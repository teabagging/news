as interpreted by Colson, Nixon's remarks constitute proof that Nixon knew no more than he has publicly stated about burglary at Dem hq or subsequent cover‐up; in Colson's view, remarks essentially show that Nixon accepted all official denials until 'new charges' came to his attention on Mar 21; Colson says that on basis of daily conversations with Nixon last yr and frequent consultations this yr, before and after returning to private law practice on Mar 1, 'I would stake my life' on Nixon's disclaimers; W Hundley, Mitchell's atty, says 'whole tenor of Mr Colson's allegations against Mr Mitchell is untrue'; Colson reacts angrily against charges that Nixon was deeply involved in scandal; dismisses McCord as 'convicted felon' using '2d‐and 3d‐hand hearsay'; says Dean had very ltd access to Pres' office and is now manufacturing sensational charges in hope of bargaining for immunity from prosecution; Colson defense charges that H R Haldeman and J D Ehrlichman diverted important information about Watergate affair from Nixon and may have been participants in cover‐up; says he remembers telling Haldeman that payments by Nixon associates to Watergate defendants could be construed as criminal 'hush money'; says Haldeman responded that he knew nothing about payments and was not concerned; Colson says that main reason he has withheld his story from reporters was fear that his former colleagues, in response, would frame case against him; says that on Jan 3 '73 he heard for 1st time, in conversation with W O Bittman, atty for E H Hunt Jr, that Dean had taken part in meetings that planned Watergate burglary; says news from Bittman 'stunned me' yet he waited 2 wks before mentioning it to Haldeman; Colson said he considered plausible Haldeman's explanation that Dean had told him about meeting but that Dean had said that when he had heard bugging discussed he turned it off; says it was only at end of Jan that he felt 'deep concern' about official involvement and spoke to Pres about it; says he told Nixon that 'if Mitchell and Magruder were involved they had to step forward and take the consequences'; says Nixon's answer was 'Get me the evidence and I'll act on it'; heart of Colson's defense is contention that, in his surprised reaction to news of Watergate break‐in, he tried to remove himself from case, even to point of refusing for 5 mos to talk with his old friend Hunt;

contends that virtually all charges of corruption that have dominated NJ gubernatorial primary races were born in 'shadowy world of campaign fund-raising' and that because new law is making it almost impossible for candidates to hide financial sources, it has already caused Gov Cahill, who is seeking re-election, and his opponent US Repr C W Sandman Jr much embarrassment; both have been forced to disclose that they had taken money from contributors who later were indicted or linked to organized crime; new law, which was approved in '73 Legis session, requires every candidate to rept any contribution and expenditure of $100 or more and establishes state comm that has power to seek prison terms for criminal violations; public pressure for disclosure reptdly is so great that all gubernatorial candidates are making disclosures now, even though new law does not require them to do so until after primary election; immediate impact of law has been to change 'dramatically' way in which candidates have been raising money in primary; R C Leone, campaign mgr for B T Byrne, leading contender for Dem gubernatorial nomination, has made so certain that Byrne is 'undisputed campaign-disclosure champion' thus far that Byrne campaign has even released list of where all money has gone, something not required by new law until after primary; analysis finds that under old vaguely-worded law, campaign financing was 'sacred cow' ultimately turned into invitation for outright fraud and that new law would have posed serious obstacle to men allegedly involved in pol scandals now facing Cahill adm; former Sec of State P J Sherwin, Cahill's closest pol adviser, was convicted by state on charges of attempting to fix state hwy contract in return for $10,000 pol campaign kickback while former State Treas J M McCrane Jr and N G Gross have recently been indicted for masterminding income-tax fraud conspiracy that enabled heavy contributors to Cahill's '69 campaign to write off money as business expenses on their income-tax returns; analysis concludes that new law's initial critics, who warned that full disclosure would attract undue publicity and dry up campaign resources, have been proven wrong; Sandman, who raised $160,000 in '69 primary campaign, has raised about $400,000 in current one New Disclosure Law"},{"year":"1972","title":"ed notes that despite refusal of Cong to grant Pres power to make whatever cuts he wanted in spending programs to hold Fed budget under a $250-billion ceiling, Nixon's aides say that he still intends to impound funds on his own to reach same objective","excerpt":"says that both need for greater econ in Govt and better fiscal planning require a greater degree of budgetary flexibility;
