The Food and Drug Administration banned ephedra, a dietary supplement promoted as a weight loss aid and energy enhancer, but linked notoriously to strokes and heart attacks. And in the wake of the nation's first case of mad cow disease, the Agriculture Department banned meat from ''downer'' cows, animals too sick or injured to walk. It also said brain and nerve tissue from older animals could no longer be sold for human consumption, and carcasses tested for mad cow disease had to be kept until the results came back instead of being sent to the market, as they had been in the past.     In both cases, the affected industries, bruised by horror stories about their products, praised rules that until now they had bitterly fought. Consumer groups, though, said that the changes were too little, too late, and that crises could have been averted if federal health officials had stood up sooner to industry pressure.When it came to ephedra, several states and major sports leagues had pre-empted the federal government, and banned ephedra on their own.

But until now, only 12 deals have been announced and only three completed. A fourth awaits shareholder approval. Utility executives, a conservative lot, have proved reluctant to join the mergers-and-acquisitions boom. Local protests have blocked some deals","excerpt":"regulators have rejected others, with fears of decreased competition uppermost. And many in the industry doubt that merged companies can realize the savings that have been predicted.  Consolidation Talk Stilled     News last week that California regulators unanimously turned down the proposed $2.9 billion combination of San Diego Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison all but stifled further talk of the industry's consolidation. Regulators concluded that the combination would not be in the public interest, since it would reduce competition but provide only limited savings.   Many utility executives, analysts and regulators now agree that widespread mergers among electric companies are unlikely. \\"There isn't going to be any wave of consolidation,\\" said Douglas Hawes, a New York lawyer who has worked on utility deals.    A few proposed mergers are still before state regulators. Dan More, director of the First Boston Corporation's mergers-and-acquisitions group, does foresee some mergers among midsized companies. \\"Some people are saying, 'That's it; no more mergers,' \\" he said. \\"But I think there will be two or three mergers a year of strategic importance.\\"    But no hostile deal has been successful. Even friendly deals, like the one in California, can take years to nudge through regulatory channels with no assurance of a favorable outcome.    Mr. Tirello, now with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, still expects more consolidation, but he has thrown out his motto. \\"It was just a battle cry, like 'Remember the Alamo,' \\" he says now. \\"It was just to get your attention.\\"    Mr. Tirello was hardly alone in foreseeing a merger boom. The industry's abundant cash flow prompted several corporate finance departments on Wall Street to bet on utility mergers. Many utility stocks carried premiums as a result. Fearing the worst, utilities began adopting \\"poison pills,\\" staggered board terms and other takeover defenses.    Failed mergers have involved both large companies -- the San Diego Gas and Electric-Southern California Edison proposal would have created the largest investor-owned electric company in the country -- and tiny community utilities. Two years ago, a seemingly defenseless Madison Gas and Electric Company of Wisconsin rallied shareholders, mostly small-town retirees, to help fend off an overture from Wisconsin Power and Light, twice its size. Would Diminish Competition     \\"If we'd have been swallowed up, there'd be no competition in our small corner of the world,\\" said Donald Helfrecht, chairman and chief executive of Madison Gas and Electric. Local opposition also arose in San Diego, where the mayor led a vocal anti-merger campaign. \\"That was one area the managements really underestimated,\\" Mr. Hawes said.    Some reasons for the rejection of the California merger are, indeed, unique to California. A 1989 state law discouraged the California Public Utilities Commission from approving the merger. The law requires that utility mergers must promise both short- and long-term benefits to rate payers, without diminishing competition. The commission has to weigh seven other criteria to determine if the deal would be in the public interest. \\"Under that statutory scheme, failure to meet any one is fatal,\\" the president of the commission, Patricia Eckert, said in a statement explaining the commission's decision.  Law Aimed at a Deal     Mr. Tirello said regulators elsewhere would be more receptive to the savings that mergers could bring. In California, he said: \\"That state law was passed to scuttle the deal. No other state has that.\\" Ms. Eckert said the commission had by no means ruled mergers out. \\"It's very important not to have this commission be perceived as anti-merger,\\" she said. She declined to elaborate pending Southern California Edison's decision on whether to appeal the commission's vote. Both the SCEcorp, Southern California Edison's parent company, and San Diego Gas and Electric declined to comment.   Some utility executives seeking to fend off acquisitions in other states have taken encouragement from the California decision. \\"It has said the effects on the surrounding marketplace must be considered,\\" said Jeffrey Sterba, senior vice president at the Public Service Company of New Mexico, which is often mentioned as a possible takeover target. \\"Bigger is not necesssarily better.\\"   Sometimes, takeovers call for novel tactics. One suitor of the Albuquerque, N.M., utility became so frustrated with repeated rejections from management that he has tried a more hostile approach, competing for the utility's franchise with the City of Albuquerque, which comes up for bid next year. The bidder, the Wheeler Peak Capital Corporation, a company formed by the former chief financial officer of Public Service of New Mexico, Albert Robison, remains interested in acquiring the utility. But Mr. Robison concedes that mergers are becoming more difficult.   Others foresee few mergers because estimates of cost savings are difficult to prove, and many companies have already cut costs. Mr. Robison says utility executives do not like to gamble, on mergers or anything else. \\"Utility executives are extremely conservative and mergers and acquisitions require risk,\\" he said.   Some possible mergers founder on the issue of who will get the top job, Mr. Hawes said. \\"If you have two C.E.O.'s both 50 years of age, you're not going to get a merger,\\" he said.    The most encouraging news for acquisitive electric companies might come from Congress. Some lawmakers are seeking to loosen the 1935 Public Uility Holding Company Act, a trust-busting law passed as part of the New Deal.   Some of the bigger, more aggressive utilities like the CMS Energy Corporation of Dearborn, Mich., say they would welcome a new law. But some consumer advocates and regulators, fear a return of the monopolistic abuses of large utility holding companies in the 1920's and 1930's. As Ronald Russell, a member of the Michigan Public Service Commission, said, \\"Human nature has not changed since the 1930's.\\" Era of Utility Deals Fails to Arrive"},{"year":"2003","title":"New York State Atty Gen Eliot L Spitzer plans to take legal action against Richard S Strong, chairman and founder of Strong mutual funds, contending Strong improperly traded in and out of shares of his company's funds","excerpt":"regulators have said such trading by fund executives violates securities law because executives have obligation to put their shareholders' interests first;

This past season we benefited from the welcome return among us of Jane Austen and Vermeer. A few decades ago we rediscovered the beautifully written \\"Narrative\\" by Frederick Douglass, which provides a searing account of slavery from the inside. We can never again ignore it. Several centuries ago, the rediscovery of Greek and Latin classics helped usher in an era of humanistic and scientific exploration. We call it the Renaissance. \\n\\n     The process of revival goes on even while we're not looking. During the 20th  century, we have been kept busy with two hot wars and one cold, and with the rise of movies and television. During that period, a few critics set out to rehabilitate a malodorous 18th-century writer who, 100 years ago, had been not forgotten but assigned appropriately to an obscure corner. The revival of the Marquis de Sade, I believe, may turn out to be the most significant and insistent revival of the 20th century -- unless some of us resolve to challenge  it.

With its atonal exclamations and craggy rhythms, it will never reach a large public, but it has a strong following and strong voice. Among the music's more committed allies have been Cheryl Seltzer and Joel Sachs, pianists and directors of Continuum, who devoted their fifth program in 25 years to the composer on Saturday night in Alice Tully Hall.   Wolpe (pronounced VOHL-peh) followed an almost archetypal path as a 20th-century cultural figure. In 1920's Berlin, he was friends with Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky (with whom he played chamber music). He joined the Communist Party in 1925 and linked his \\"advanced\\" art to \\"advanced\\" politics. He left Germany in 1933 and studied with Webern in Vienna before making his way to Palestine, where he was influenced by his Jewish heritage. In 1938, he came to the United States where his music of opposition grew more refined until he succumbed to Parkinson's disease in 1972. The range of his works and the facts of his life are just now being rediscovered.

So is the installation. The only wall panel is at its entrance. In the second half of the show, the labels are grouped together at the entrance to each gallery. There is almost nothing to detract from what William Rubin, the director emeritus of the department of painting and sculpture at the Modern, describes in the preface as the \\"austere splendor\\" of Reinhardt's work.   As surprising as it may seem, this retrospective -- opening tomorrow -- is only the second ever devoted to this highly influential, ferociously polemical and zealously independent abstract painter. Since the first one, at the Jewish Museum in the winter of 1966-67 (a few months before Reinhardt died of a heart attack in his New York studio at the age of 54) included few of the red-on-red and blue-on-blue paintings from 1950 to 1953, this is really the first full Reinhardt retrospective.
