In that belief, the Navy has felt that no naval vessel or unit should ever be placed under the control of an Army or Air Force officer.   That fundamental concept has been behind the Navy's resistance to efforts to unify the leadership of the armed forces, beginning with the Defense Department after World War II and most recently with plans to change the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   Now a vote in closed session last week by a House Armed Services subcommittee has set off a new inter-service struggle between the Navy joined by the Marine Corps on one side and the Army and Air Force on the other. As the quarrel develops, it may rival the conflicts of earlier years.

There are scenes of the dead and wounded, of the battle-grimed faces of fight-nig men and—most gruesome—of Marine flame-throwers burning Japanese snipers out of caves.The significance of this film at this moment is not in its news-wise report of a battle fought three months ago, but rather in its emphasis upon the character of the war that lies ahead.Photographed by service combat cameramen, it was assembled by the Navy Photographic Service and is released through the Office of War Information and the War Activities Committee of the Motion Picture Industry.

BIG IF, by Mark Costello. (Norton, $24.95.) A novel offers an anthropological look at the occupational rituals and argot of a group of Secret Service agents, who are in fact simply stressed-out working stiffs just like us, with the small difference that they are also charged with the continued well-being of the vice president.    A SIMPLE HABANA MELODY: (From When the World Was Good), by Oscar Hijuelos. (HarperCollins, $24.95.) The protagonist of Hijuelos's sixth novel is a Cuban composer so decorous his cross is an inability to act on, or even articulate, his deepest passions, accumulating a lifetime of repression and regret.    FRAGRANT HARBOR, by John Lanchester. (Marian Wood/Putnam, $25.95.) A novel of large scope, placed chiefly in Hong Kong in 1935 and after, undertaking big propositions: race, class, love, war and, perhaps most successfully, the transformation of a refugee community into one of the world's richest societies.    THE LAYING ON OF HANDS: Stories, by Alan Bennett. (Picador USA, $15.) Formerly known as 25 percent of the British comedy group Beyond the Fringe, Bennett serves up a volume of just three stories, all tender, caustic gems about lonely people, most in professions at once earnest and comic (podiatrists, masseurs, vicars).    NAPOLEON: A Biography, by Frank McLynn. (Arcade, $32.95.) A biography that offers the general reader a synthesis of the enormous body of specialized research about Napoleon now available and assesses current myths and controversies; its approach is occasionally psychoanalytical rather than historical.    THE RUSSIAN DEBUTANTE'S HANDBOOK, by Gary Shteyngart. (Riverhead, $24.95.) An energetic, ambitious first novel whose protagonist, a Russian-born graduate of an American college, tries to figure out what it means to be an American, a Russian, an immigrant, a Jew; a great deal of splendid comedy hangs on his inability to find out.    MORAL HAZARD, by Kate Jennings. (Fourth Estate, $21.95.) A business novel whose modest pace and poetic structure distinguish it from the traditional macho product, packed with hard fact and action; Jennings's purpose is ethical investigation and meditation on the ''perilous, jerry-built'' global financial markets.    TRAINS OF THOUGHT: Memories of a Stateless Youth, by Victor Brombert. (Norton, $25.95.) A lyrical, luminous account of the displacements of a bourgeois Jewish childhood, mostly in Europe, and of United States Army service during World War II; by a distinguished literary academic who came to America with his family in the summer of 1941.
