In the working-class black Philadelphia neighborhood that serves as the book's setting, the woeful plaint of Mahalia Jackson records mingles with the perfume of backyard honeysuckle. But the city's insidious attempts to buy out homeowners eventually spill into the domestic world of Herbie and Noon, a young couple whose lives have already been rerouted after not one but two little girls are abandoned on their doorstep. Herbie and Noon are more successful as parents than as spouses and they salve their marital wounds independently: Herbie in a nightclub singer's bed and Noon in her church and in  her fight against the city's plans. But they are true partners in the love and care of their children, especially Fannie, who came first and who charms and frightens them with her occasional clairvoyance. Though the book's end is bluntly forecast from early on and more than a few events are puzzlingly unexplained, the story moves forward on the power of Ms. McKinney-Whetstone's characters. Herbie and Noon's neighbors -- from the meanspirited petty bureaucrat across the street, desperate to protect her meager authority, to the  well-intentioned but miscalculating local pastor, who falls prey to his own pride -- are never merely props. Through these and other deftly portrayed individuals, whose wrongdoing stems more from fallibility than intent, Ms. McKinney-Whetstone captures the formidable struggle to protect both a community  and a family.
