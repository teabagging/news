The savory roasts, cumin-scented casseroles and vegetarian fritters can be had in a full-course dinner for as little as $20. Here are three good choices. Istanbul Kebap    303 East 80th Street (212) 517-6880 -- This compact family-run Turkish spot is a clean and well-organized place, with carnations adorning the paper-draped tables, Turkish rugs on the walls, copper lanterns and hanging plants.   Lamb is the foundation of Anatolian cooking: dishes include adana kebab, minced lamb seasoned with peppers and grilled on skewers","excerpt":"sis kebab, cubed marinated leg of lamb grilled on skewers; etli bamya, okra, lamb, tomato and onions, and yogurtlu kebab, a hearty casserole of pita triangles, chopped lamb, onions, yogurt, paprika and tomato.   For appetizers there are under coban, a mixed chopped salad combining tomatoes, onions and kirby (similar to cucumber); cubes of sauteed liver served with chopped onions; and stuffed grape leaves.    Appetizers range from $3.25 to $3.50; main courses $8.95 to $11.50. Sunday service is from noon to midnight. (Diner's Journal, Nov. 3, 1989). The Magic Carpet    54 Carmine Street (212) 627-9019 -- This is one of those inconspicuous Middle Eastern restaurants in Greenwich Village that rarely get attention outside their immediate neighborhood. But Magic Carpet certainly gets plenty there. And for good reason.   The food is tasty, inexpensive and copious. The staff is cheerful and accommodating. Excellent hummus, falafel or baba gannouj are a fine way to begin. Among entrees are ouzi, which is puffed phyllo nearly the size of a rugby ball holding an aromatic assembly of rice, peas, raisins, almonds, chickpeas and cashews. Of course, couscous is served, vegetable, chicken, lamb or beef.   Appetizers range from $3.95 to $4.25; main courses are $8.25 to $10.50. Sunday hours are from 2 P.M. to 11 P.M. (Diner's Journal, May 17, 1991). Sido Abu Salim    81 Lexington Avenue at 26th Street, 212-686-2031 -- Middle Eastern food has great appeal with its cooling vegetable purees, lemony salads and aromatic grilled meats. This little spot, run by a Palestinian family, has always been one of the more reliable spots in town for this kind of cooking, and a real bargain.   The setting is spare and clean, with tile floors, wood wainscoting, white walls with botanical prints, and glass-topped tables. You might start with a sampling of sprightly tabbouleh combining minced parsley, wheat germ, onions and tomato; excellent hummus, chickpea and sesame oil puree; the sesame spread tahini, and a wonderfully smoky rendition of baba gannouj, the roasted eggplant puree.   A mean-looking hot sauce set out on the table can send you screeching out the door in search of an open fire hydrant. Other dishes include cumin-scented falafel, made with chickpea flour, ground lamb-and-onion-filled croquettes called kibbee; chicken, beef or vegetable couscous; and lamb or beef kebab.   Appetizers range from $1.60 to $2.95; main courses $8 to$14. Sunday hours are 1 P.M. to 11 P.M. (Diner's Journal, May 20, 1991).

Confronted with ugliness, he became a patron of the arts. Persecuted, he responded with charity. Deeply mourned by his loving wife, Frances","excerpt":"sister-in-law, Marga; nephews, Michael and Robert, and untold colleagues and friends.

WALTER-Otto L., renowned authority on international and tax law, educator, writer, lecturer, and philanthropist. The partners, counsel, associates and staff of Alston & Bird LLP note with profound sadness the death of Dr. Otto L. Walter who passed away after a brief illness on January 12, 2003 at age 95. Our heartfelt sympathies go to his widow, Frances. In 1955, after establishing the law firm that would become Walter, Conston, Alexander & Green, P.C., the predecessor firm in New York of Alston & Bird LLP, Dr. Walter became a leading authority on German/ American law and taxation. He was a member of the New York and German bar and a Certified Public Accountant. As an advisor to the German Ministry of Finance, Dr. Walter was instrumental in the early development of the tax treaties between the United States and Germany. Moreover, he served as an expert witness on the interplay and the interpretation of German and American law in various significant lawsuits. Most prominent among the countless books and articles that Dr. Walter wrote was his work as co-author of the four volume bilingual work on the German-American Income Tax Treaty published by the International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation. Dr. Walter lectured to numerous professional audiences in the United States, Germany and Switzerland. At New York Law School, he was instrumental in developing the school's program in international law, teaching international taxation as an Adjunct Professor of Law. Following the end of the war, he worked tirelessly to promote friendship and understanding between the United States and Germany. He was a director of the German American Chamber of Commerce and the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University, an honorary director of the American Council on Germany and an honorary trustee of the Consular Law Society. For his service in the promotion of German/American relations, Dr. Walter was awarded the Cross of the Order of Merit and the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit by the Federal Republic of Germany. He was honored by the German American Committee of the USA, Inc. as its GermanAmerican of the Year in 1998. On the occasion of his 90th birthday he was saluted by Governor Pataki and Mayor Giuliani. Dr. Walter was an erudite, cultivated and gracious man with a broad knowledge of and interest in the arts, music and literature, a true Renaissance man. He promoted these interests as a philanthropist, through the Otto and Frances Walter Foundation. His crisp intellect and dry wit will be missed by all of his friends and colleagues for whom a celebration of Dr. Walter's life is being planned at a time and place to be announced.     WALTER - Otto L. The Trustees and Dean are joined by the entire New York Law School community in mourning the loss of Otto L. Walter, Class of 1954, prominent attorney in the field of international tax and estate law, founder of Walter, Conston, Alexander & Green, now Alston & Bird LLP. Proud of his distinguished contributions to the field, New York Law School bestowed on him the honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1984 and established a lecture series in his name.

Baer (Op-Ed, Feb. 23), for raising the embarrassing issue of the feminist attitude toward nursing. I too consider myself a feminist as well as a nurse, and agree that at times they seem mutually exclusive. I cringe to think of the times I've been introduced as a nurse to professional women in other fields: \\"Oh, how nice.\\" End of conversation.   Nurses are not envious of doctors. On the contrary, we believe nursing's contribution to medicine is unique -- assessing, planning, implementing and evaluating patient care. We're proud to provide our services under the stress of nursing shortages, hospital inspections and the demands of patients, families, staff, doctors.   Sometimes we are our own worst enemies. Most nurses do not join their professional organizations and are unaware of local, state and national issues that affect their scope of practice. Still, it was partly the outcry from nurses that helped get the bimbo television show \\"Nightingales\\" off the air. Here in Texas, nurses actively supported the campaign of Gov. Ann Richards.   Nursing is changing. At the hospital where I work, a referral center for seven counties, nurses are now the chief executive officer and president, vice president of patient services, director of utilization management, assistant director of patient financial services, director of surgery and quality assurance coordinator.   For a long time, nurses have been trying to achieve the goals feminists have set.

This first part, running almost, two hours, depicts the early Bolshevik rumblings, World War I and the Revolution itself, as seen by two pretty young sisters, one a married dilettante and the other an impressionable student. Obviously, the Mosfilm Studios hoped to initiate a wide, sweeping panorama of Russia and its people during the birth pangs of a new regime.This is exactly what the picture does not do, however well the novel may have succeeded. There emerges, instead, a lavish, effectively tinted and none too convincing tale of two girls, played by Nina Veselovskaya and Rufina Nifontova, and the men who love them. The picture is pretentious, loud, lumbering, static and choked with fiery utterances about the rise against injustice.Most curiously indeed, we see few signs of it, for all the howling. The camera trails the two ladies over the years, with some brief, bleak visits inside a prisoner-of-war stockade and a St. Petersburg hospital. In a film that verges on the spectacular, one scene of a Petrograd street riot barely sputters to life.The same applies to every one of the performers, who invariably smite their foreheads and grab a chair or curtain—often just in time. Under Grigory Roshal's starchy direction, the story confusingly jumps all over the Russian map. Furthermore, the two dazzlingly beautiful sisters are nearly identical. It would have helped if Miss Nifontova, who is supposedly a law student, had opened a book just once. There is even some similarity between the two handsome soldiers who love them, played by Vadim Medvedev and Nikolai Gritsenko.Outside of the comings and goings of the four principals, very little happens. Excluding the scenes of street activity and workers' meetings, the main footage goes to the two twittering ladies at home in St. Petersburg. The English titles are either flat or unintentionally funny. Asked once by Mr. Medvedev if she loves him, Miss Nifontova soulfully declares, \\"I love you all the way to the birch tree\\"—and back, presumably. Dimitri Kabalevsky's musical score is thunderous.Let us hope that Boris Chirskov, the scenarist, does better with the second serving. As for \\"Sisters\\" — oh, brother!

Choreographed by Mimi Messner for a cast of nine, the program features ballerinas, above, dressed in sunglasses, black leotards and tights and stiff tutu skirts equipped with batteries, amplifiers and speakers that respond to the sounds, surfaces, electromagnetic waves and physical topography of the space around them. The program includes ''Line,'' ''Peepers'' and ''Yamaha.'' The festival of dance, performance art and theater runs through Aug. 30, produced by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council with the River-to-River Festival. Some of the events promise to be particularly imaginative uses of the sites. New York Classical Theater will turn an old building lobby into the Tower of London in ''Mary Stuart'' (July 5 through 13). Aaron Rosenblum will convert a floor in a building on lower Avenue of the Americas into a funhouse of sorts in which vignettes exploring New York City lore will be enacted (July 6 through 15). And Ellis Wood Dance will place 20 female dancers on the balconies with fabric costuming to simulate a blaze of fire (Aug. 21 through 23 and 28 through 30).
