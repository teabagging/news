This year marks t he buildings' debut on the tax rolls as cooperatives, and the i ncreases in assessments range from $2.5 million to about $5.6 m illion.\\n\\nIn one building, the annual maintenance charges on apartments are rising by $600 to $3,000 to cover the higher taxes resulting from the higher assessments.\\n\\nThe issue of a change in assessment when a building's status changes has sparked considerable controversy. Conversions are still a relatively new phenomenon and there are no state guidelines on assessment policy. Thus, communities are free to set their own rules, and Hackensack chose to peg assessments to the total of the prices paid for the apartments in a cooperative. Before conversion, the taxes on the cooperative buildings were based on their income from rents.
