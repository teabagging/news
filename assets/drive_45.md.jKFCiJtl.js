There were more elegant speak-easies in New York than Mario's, converted East Side mansions with handsome iron gates and the imposing air of art galleries that deal only in Old Masters, but they were expensive and intimidating. Mario's occupied the two lower floors of a rundown brownstone in the West 40's; it could once have been a theatrical boardinghouse and was now a speak-easy only in the sense that it sold illegal liquor and that its owner went through the required ritual of inspecting his customers through a peephole in the locked front door. In all other respects it was a family-style trattoria, serving excellent home-cooked food at low prices. Most important, it was safe to drink its liquor. Every day during the Prohibition years the newspapers published their grim toll of people blinded or killed by wood alcohol. We were no more deterred by their warnings than a later generation would be deterred from the use of drugs by warnings in the press.    There was no problem in gaining access to a speak-easy in Prohibition; anyone could turn up a \\"friend\\" whose name would open some thickly bolted door. The innocent, as opposed to the sinister, speak-easy scene is wonderfully portrayed in that rarest of American literary achievements, a good comic novel: Elmer Davis's \\"Friends of Mr. Sweeney.\\" Not the police but death or blindness was what people like ourselves had to fear from Prohibition.

At the end of the novel the train arrives in Amsterdam where the funeral of the playwright, recently deceased, is going to be held. Within the short span of that journey, Ms. Edelman traces the somber and angry recollections of the young woman, whose encounter with the older man was not simply a love affair","excerpt":"it was a private lesson in the psychic and spiritual scars left by history.

Moholy's program for a ''New Vision'' was more than a platform for formalism","excerpt":"it was a radical instrument intended to liberate modern man from the constraints of habit and history. In his 1925 book ''Painting, Photography, Film,'' Moholy proclaimed that through the new photography ''everyone will be compelled to see that which is optically true, is explicable in its own terms, is objective, before he can arrive at any possible subjective position.'' In short, seeing was to make possible a new way of believing.   Moholy's photographic work of the time, however, can hardly be construed as ''objective.'' His investigations of the medium's formal potentials quickly led him past the ''optically true'' camera, to create abstractionist shadow pictures he named photograms and metaphorical photomontages he called photoplastics. His photograms - which are surprisingly similar to the Rayographs that Man Ray made simultaneously but independently - have become quite well known and are frequently shown. But the photomontages, except for one or two that have been repeatedly reproduced, are seldom seen, at least in this country. However, for the next two months, thanks to the Bronx Museum of the Arts and Chicago collector Arnold Crane, we have the opportunity to see a whole collection of vintage Moholy photomontages.

Islanders Set Back Canadiens"},{"year":"1992","title":"Troy Taylor participated in his first practice today, sort of, when the Jets worked out at Hofstra. He wore a green uniform and mostly watched while other quarterbacks took snaps during passing drills. Browning Nagle and Jeff Blake got more action, and so did Mike Norseth and Kerwin Bell.   It wasn't until after practice, when most of his teammates were in the showers, that Taylor got a chance to throw more than a few footballs. A handful of backup receivers stayed with him on the field so Taylor could work his arm back into shape.   And after most Jets left the training grounds, Taylor remained to catch up in the weight room. Nagle Is in the Lead    Such is the workload for a man trying to get back to where he once belonged. Last season, Taylor was the backup quarterback to Ken O'Brien, the starter. This summer, both Taylor and O'Brien missed the start of camp in contract disputes and O'Brien is still not here.   With his impressive performance in Saturday's 41-14 victory over Philadelphia at Canton, Ohio, Nagle appears to hold the lead in the fight for the first-string position. He will probably start on Saturday when the Jets play host to the Washington Redskins at the Meadowlands.   Jeff Blake, a rookie, was less impressive as Nagle's backup against the Eagles. Assuming that O'Brien will settle with the Jets and come back for a 10th season, that could leave Taylor and Blake fighting for the bronze medal in the quarterback competition.   \\"I don't make the decisions,\\" Taylor said. \\"I just want to get ready to play. I don't really worry about competition. I stick with what I do. You compete against yourself.\\"   Taylor said an absence such as his \\"is always a setback.\\"   \\"How much, we'll see,\\" he added.  Beginning His Third Season    Taylor, who earned $170,000 last season, signed a one-year deal worth up to $400,000, if he makes the team. Last season, his second with the Jets, Taylor appeared in five games and completed 5 of 10 pass attempts for 76 yards and one touchdown.   As Taylor spoke during the lunch hour, a couple of teammates drifted by, mockingly asking him for autographs. \\"Just friendly jabbing,\\" Taylor said.   He wasn't making any demands or issuing any ultimatums today.    \\"Something needs to happen here,\\" he said of his personal situation. \\"I'd like something to happen this year. I've known it's a business for a long time. You've got to separate the two. I'm done with the business part.\\"   Taylor was on the sidelines in Canton when Nagle completed completed 10 of 15 passes for 142 yards and one touchdown. Nagle also ran for one touchdown and seemed to impress teammates, fans and coaches with his poise.   \\"I thought he played well,\\" said Taylor. \\"He did a fine job.\\"   Blake completed 3 of 10 pass attempts, had one pass intercepted and lost a fumble playing with mostly a backup crew.    \\"He had a rough day","excerpt":"it was a rough first test for him,\\" said Coach Bruce Coslet. \\"He had some misreads. He made some mistakes a rookie would make. He'll fix those.\\" EXTRA POINTS    ROB MOORE, the wide receiver who sprained his left ankle on Saturday, will miss the next two games and will have the ankle in a cast for a week \\"to calm it down,\\" Coach BRUCE COSLET said. . . . DAVE CADIGAN, a left guard, joined the team after coming to contract terms, leaving only KEN O'BRIEN still out. Cadigan has a two-year deal, reportedly for $1.3 million. . . . DENNIS BYRD said he was enjoying the move from defensive tackle to defensive end, in part because of more free space. \\"There's a lot less traffic,\\" said Byrd. \\"I enjoy that. I'm an open-plains type of guy; I like the prairie,\\" said Byrd, who comes from Mustang, Okla. He returned an interception 7 yards for a touchdown against the Eagles. . . . CORWIN ANTHONY, a tight end, has been traded to Green Bay for a future draft choice. . . .

Fleshing Out Health Care    Appearing before a group of employees at Merck & Company, the big pharmaceutical manufacturer in Rahway, N.J., Gov. Bill Clinton put a little flesh and blood on his health care plan. He told the group that if elected he would require private employers with more than 50 workers to provide health- care insurance for employees and would have the Federal Government supplement health care coverage for the unemployed. Mr. Clinton also said he would call for price controls on drugs. His plan would \\"drastically simplify the administrative costs of the American health care system\\" and save about $700 billion by the end of the decade, Mr. Clinton said. The plan would also provide incentives for small companies to band together to pool coverage and reduce costs, something President Bush has also proposed. The Bush campaign criticized Mr. Clinton's proposals, saying price controls on drugs would reduce private funding for research.   Time was when most of mahogany row went Republican. But last week Governor Clinton garnered endorsements from 400 of America's corporate titans. Among the endorsers were Paul Allaire, chairman of Xerox; Robert Haas, chairman of Levi Strauss; Reuben Mark, chairman of Colgate Palmolive; Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, and the taste maker Martha Stewart. Paid to Do the Right Thing    While Mr. Clinton talked health care, President Bush was homing in on the nation's small business owners. He began by vetoing a family-leave bill that would require companies to grant at least 12 weeks of unpaid leave to any employee with a family emergency. The bill was opposed by many small-business owners who said it was too costly. \\"I have always supported employer policies to give time off for a child's birth, adoption or for family illness,\\" Mr. Bush said in his veto message. Instead of the bill, he proposed tax credits for employers who give workers time off. Later, in Greensboro N.C., Mr. Bush proposed $20 billion in tax cuts for small businesses. Durable Goods Decline    Orders for durable goods, those big-ticket items that are supposed to last three years , fell 0.1 percent in August, the third monthly decline in four months. The report was \\"Weak, weak, weak,\\" said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago. In Need of an Economic Miracle    Dogging the Presidential race is the sluggish economy. It grew by 1.5 percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said. \\"The calendar is running out for George Bush,\\"said Robert G. Dederick, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. Daring to Offend China    Time was when President Bush couldn't do enough for China. He supported its most-favored-nation trade status against and fought Congressional pressure to put sanctions on it after the crackdown in Tiananmen Square. But with the election looming, old loyalties have been called into question. Last month, Mr. Bush authorized the sale of 150 F-16's to Taiwan, China's longtime foe. Last week, he agreed to sell 12 SH-2F \\"Lamp\\" helicopters to Taiwan for $161 million. The helicopters, which can detect and attack submerged submarines, are made by the Kaman Corporation in Bloomfield, Conn. Connecticut -- whose eight electoral votes are considered up for grabs -- has been severely hurt by cutbacks in Pentagon spending. Japan's Bank Won't Budge    In Japan, they are calling it a recession even though growth has so far not turned negative. Japan's gross domestic product expanded by a meek 0.2 percent in the second quarter, the Ministry of Finance said last week. Pleading for Fewer Rubles    Russia is learning about democracy the hard way. Yegor T. Gaidar, the acting Prime Minister , is dedicated to establishing a market system, but he must contend with a Parliament still dominated by proponents of central planning. And while Mr. Gaidar has been trying to keep money growth slow, Parliament appointed Viktor Gerashenko as head of Russia's central bank. Mr. Gerashenko likes to keep those printing presses running. As a result, since last month, the value of the ruble has lost 49 percent of its value. Last week Mr. Gaidar pleaded with Parliament, saying that unless the money supply was tightened, the Russian monetary system would collapse. Agency Hopping at Olds?     Leo Burnett U.S.A., the advertising agency, has been selling Oldsmobiles since 1967. A few years ago it came up with the \\"This is not your father's Oldsmobile\\" theme. But the campaign alienated the car company's older customers without bringing in new ones. Oldsmobile's sales are sluggish, to say the least. Last week, the General Motors Corporation put the Oldsmobile account up for review. Although it did not announce which agencies would be allowed to compete for the account, which is worth $100 million to $110 million, it said Leo Burnett would be in the running. \\"We are confident we can retain the Oldsmobile business,\\" said Jim Oates, Burnett's chairman. Perhaps it will. The last time G.M. dismissed an agency was in 1958.    G.M. has been working hard to keep the labor peace. But last month, after announcing plans to close plants, lay off workers and buy parts from outside suppliers, workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, struck. And last week, 4,200 members of the United Automobile Workers union went on strike at a body stamping plant in Lansing, Mich., for the same reasons. Cracks in the Rock of Gibraltar    The Prudential Insurance Company may like to portray itself as solid as the rock of Gibraltar, but according to an independent nonprofit research agency, its losses from Hurricane Andrew so far total $1.2 billion -- four times what executives predicted. Those losses could use up 10 percent of Prudential's capital. The estimates caused alarm among analysts at Standard & Poor's, the credit-rating agency, placed it on credit watch with the possibility of downgrading Prudential from AAA, the highest rating. \\"We have always felt that Prudential was stretched on capital relative to the rating,\\" said Mark Puccia, a senior vice president at Standard & Poor's. Earlier this year, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the nation's No. 1 insurer from Aaa, for exceptional , to Aa1, for excellent. The Pseudo-Sodas    With the fizz going out of the Coca-Cola Company's sales, its third-quarter financial forecasts were, well, flat. One of Coke's answers is to go New Age. Following a host of competitors, Coca-Cola will bring out a new drink in the fast-growing \\"clear\\" category, to be called Nordic Mist. The new drink, a flavored sparkling water, will follow Pepsi Cola's H2oH! and Pepsi Crystal and the Seagrams entry, Quest. But while Nordic Mist will be clear, it won't be a health food. It will derive its sweet taste (not to mention 112 calories) from high-fructose corn syrup. \\"It's soft drinks in disguise,\\" said Jack Trout of Trout & Ries, a marketing firm in Greenwich, Conn. Shoring Up Travelers    The Primerica Corporation, the big financial services and insurance company, said last week that it would invest $722.5 million in the struggling Travelers Corporation in return for a 27 percent stake in the company. Primerica's chairman, Sanford I. Weill, said he would work with Travelers to direct its operations. More than a third of its $13 billion in outstanding mortgages are in trouble. Behind the Scenes at 'Tonight'    The way Ken Kragen tells it -- he's a Hollywood artists' manager -- Helen Kushnick plays too rough. Ms. Kushnick was Jay Leno's manager, and when he became host of the \\"The Tonight Show\\" earlier this year, became executive producer. Mr. Kragen said Ms. Kushnick kept one of his clients, the country singer Travis Tritt, off \\"The Tonight Show\\" after learning that Mr. Tritt was also appearing on the rival \\"Arsenio\\" show. What was even worse, Mr. Kragen said, was that for no reason other than vindictiveness, Ms. Kushnick canceled a scheduled appearance on \\"The Tonight Show\\" by Trisha Yearwood, another country singer whom Mr. Kragen represents. Ms. Kushnick denied Mr. Kragen's assertions about her motivations. That denial was not enough for NBC. Last week the network dismissed Ms. Kushnick.

And Mr. Anders likes his band to be opulent, with thick reed passages, and precise yet full trumpet and trombone parts. He arranges his compositions cleverly; they always maintained an unaffected naturalness. One piece had a pointillistic stop-time section, played by just a few members of the orchestra,  to support a trombone solo. Another had a melody that bounced around the sections, and during \\"Double Date,\\" a trombone played the tune, peeking out from behind the full band. It wasn't particularly challenging music, but it was well-made, fully able to perform its duties.

A HUNDRED years ago, the   French had already started referring to the epoch in which they were living as the fin de siecle. By the 1890's the term had become commonplace, and where it might originally have implied nothing more than ''up to date,'' the connotations it now carried -they were by no means without their glamour - were those of decadence and moral anarchy.

His band's sweet, melancholy songs have helped a generation of listeners rediscover the joys of heartfelt balladry. And along the way, Mr. Gibbard has gone from semi-obscure singer to unlikely heartthrob. Who could have predicted that someone like him would wind up dominating the gossip columns? And who could have foreseen the sold-out stadium concerts, the punch-up with a paparazzo, the fruitful marriage to Gwyneth Paltrow?     O.K., strike that last bit: I think I'm getting Mr. Gibbard mixed up with that guy from Coldplay. But it's a surprisingly easy mistake to make. Both of them know their way around grand, sighing love songs. And while Mr. Gibbard isn't quite a mainstream rock star yet, he's surprisingly close. The last Death Cab for Cutie album, ''Transatlanticism'' (Barsuk), has sold more than 300,000 copies since its release in 2003.

Yes, Mr. Tamiroff is an actor; give him a putty nose and he will strut like Cyrano; equip him with an expanse of brow and a drooping forelock and he will make you think of Napoleon. But through all these changes, alas, he continues to talk like Tamiroff—that is, in a formidably mongreloid accent which is neither Provençale, nor Corsican, nor Latin American (as the present situation demands), but purely and simply Akim.Moreover, with no intention of belittling, we must add that, although the fugitive actor Mr. Tamiroff plays before the cabal compels him to impersonate the deceased Presidente is known as the man of a thousand faces, it is at least a noteworthy circumstance that all of the faces bear a striking family resemblance to Mr. Tamiroff's. However, it is essentially the accent which betrays Mr. Tamiroff's little gallery of impersonations. So distinctive is it that it is no wonder if Mr. Tamiroff succeeds in imitating it perfectly when he finally comes to impersonate the Señor Presidente, since that dignitary also was being played to the hilt by Mr. Tamiroff up to the moment of his untimely liquidation by a bomb on the eve of the big American loan.In fact, considering the number of people played by Mr. Tamiroff, it is hard to justify the presence in the cast of any one else. But the price of admission also includes Lloyd Nolan, Mary Boland, Patricia Morison nd Steffi Duna, which is to say, naturally, that the price is not exorbitant.

It was once a litter-strewn, overgrown rail corridor abandoned by the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey in 1960. But five years ago the county bought it and smartened it up into a nine-mile public alley that runs from a hole in the woods in Aberdeen through the salt marshes, small downtowns and private backyards of Keyport, Union Beach, Keansburg and Middletown, stopping at Atlantic Highlands.    Thrilled are the visitors who have flocked to enjoy it on bike, on foot and in wheelchairs. Not so thrilled are some residents, who never counted on a busy park cutting under their bedroom windows. The other day, on a jaunt in a toy-sized car along the narrow trail, Lee Homyock, county parks supervisor, was saluted by a dozen giddy cyclists. He was also assailed by a furious woman who said the path had become a welcome mat for the homeless and a getaway route for thieves. He told us about the headaches and rewards of turning a dormant rail bed into a bustling playground.    Q. What did the route look like when the county took in over in 1990?   A. Not much. There was trestles, but no boards to cross the stream. The surface was poor","excerpt":"it was all overgrown. So it was pretty much impassable. And there was garbage. It was used as a dump for 20, 30 years -- for everything from your everyday litter to refrigerators, stoves, cars.   Q. Was it still intact?   A. There were approximately 73 encroachments. That could be a fence, a shed, a quarter of a condominium, a lumberyard. It took a long time to straighten out. People were saying, \\"Why are you doing this to me?\\" But we had to say we work for the public.   Q. Is there a problem with crime?    A. I would not attribute it to the trail. The area was clear for years. The whole thing now is that people have someone to complain to, whereas before they didn't. Discussions like we had back there with that woman were pretty frequent when I first took over because people needed to vent their frustrations after 20 years of people dumping and stealing things. The first year and a half was a venting process. We used to get 5 to 10 complaints every day. Now people are taking it on as if it is \\"our trail\\" in our backyard, and when is it going to be done.   Q. What needs to be done?   A. Right now we have what we call a stone screening surface over parts of it, and we put it down to make it a little harder so the bicyclists can ride on it. We're looking to have it eventually completely paved. We have an additional $90,000 left over from a Federal grant that put the bridges in that we can use. Hopefully, it will be done by next fall.    Q. Is there a big future for recycled rail trails?   A. I like to see something go from nothing, to something that is a viable means of recreation. Maybe a time will come where people's values will change back to where they are not using it to rob a house and run away, or dumping all their garbage. It would really be for the social good of all people, if you could get them away from their television or their Nintendo, and get them in physical shape. You can count me as one. I ride my bike up the trail to my parents' for dinner. I also ride at Sandy Hook. I actually started off as 200 pounds. I'm down to 180 now.

As part of a national strategy, about 9,000 Verizon customers in Keller, Tex., will be the first to subscribe to the television service, called FiOS TV. The service in Keller is part of Verizon's plan to compete head-on with cable companies that in the last 18 months have started selling digital phone lines.

The airline said it would eliminate as many as 9,000 more jobs over the next two years. [C6.]    The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the looming landfall of Rita, which threatens about one-quarter of the nation's jet fuel supply, are raising fears that the latest round of pain for airlines is just beginning. [C1.]    Soaring oil prices are giving a temporary lift to the fortunes of aircraft manufacturers because of a demand for more economical planes, the chief executive of Airbus, Gustav Humbert, said. ''The higher the oil price, the greater the demand for more fuel-efficient aircraft,'' said Mr. Humbert. Airbus and its rival, Boeing, are enjoying a bumper year for orders of aircraft, propelled in part by their competing midsize, long-distance planes, the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350.

Steaks, burgers, hot dogs or maybe chicken breasts were all that were expected, and indeed they could be sublime. Today, like many once-simple commodities such as television (three networks), sneakers (high or low) and pizzas (thick and chewy or thin and crispy), grilling has become frightfully upscale and potentially confusing.   Inspired by California-style grill restaurants that have swept across the country like a brush fire, grill cooks now consider anything that can be held down without falling through the grates suitable for charcoal cooking - tiny quails, leeks, fennel bulbs, radicchio, lobsters, clams, mussels, wild mushrooms. In Italy last year, I even tasted a dish described as grilled pasta","excerpt":"it was as delicious as it was inscrutable.   Amateur grill cooks can have a great deal of fun this summer experimenting with these new notions. Some of the most delectable results can be achieved with game birds -squabs, quails and guinea hens in particular. Once luxury foods available only in season, these succulent birds have now become available year-round in many supermarkets and butcher shops in the area. Large-scale commercial breeding farms in the United States and Canada have expanded the market from the restaurant trade to the home consumer. COOKS MOVE BEYOND HUMBLE HOT DOG"},{"year":"1995","title":"For the last several years, the drummer Joey Baron has led a small, joyously odd trio that's also made up of Steve Swell on trombone and Ellery Eskalin on tenor saxophone. The band performed at the Knitting Factory on Wednesday night, and it played elemental music, as if Mr. Baron had reduced styles to their gestures.   On \\"Boss Hog,\\" Mr. Baron had the horns harmonize in long lines, suggesting the outlines of an orchestral work","excerpt":"it was as if a big band had been there but then had been subtracted. At other times, Mr. Baron's writing articulated the sunny fervor of carnival music, a march or deep swing or even a cheesy 1950's background for strippers. He has a knack of hiding what he knows, and on some pieces hints and shadows alone made up the references.   Mr. Baron's pieces sometimes worked around a single rhythm, but more often than not they worked around a shifting set of feels. Sometimes the horns were harmonized, sometimes staggered; sometimes they played different roles. On \\"Smelts,\\" the tenor saxophone lighted up the melody while the trombone offered counter lines; then, the roles changed. And occasionally Mr. Baron shifted keys by stopping the music, then starting in a new key.   This music couldn't work without Mr. Baron's drumming. His drums sounded loose, as if the skins were soft and smooth. He used a huge arsenal of rhythms, from shuffles and rock figures to the heavy jazz swing of brushes well played or a jazz mambo. He used the metallic tapping of rim shots and the sound of fingers slapping the drums, and he ended one piece by hitting a triangle. Joey Baron Seeks an Essence"},{"year":"1994","title":"On Monday night in Avery Fisher Hall, when the Juilliard String Quartet reached the famous theme that spells out Bach's name in the last, unfinished fugue of \\"The Art of the Fugue,\\" one could almost feel the small audience that remained draw in its breath. The players, who have made this work a specialty in recent years, did not bear down on the four notes with portentous solemnity. Instead, after two hours of exploring Bach's inventiveness and spiritual grandeur, in a work in which themes were expanded, contracted, turned upside down, combined with themselves and their variants in an encyclopedia of possibilities, the quartet played the theme with quiet, eloquent simplicity.   The tension immediately increased","excerpt":"it was as if a spring were being pulled back. Two themes had already been heard in the majestic fugue. But this third, signature theme, which has long been used as a tribute to the composer (in German, B is B-flat and H is B-natural), was clearly an announcement of something more sublime than had yet been achieved. A hint of what was to come was heard as the three themes intertwined, awaiting some sort of fulfillment. Then, without warning, the first violin fell mute, the second violin followed, as did the cello, and for brief moments there were only the eighth notes of the viola, which ended in silent space. That is where Bach is said to have left the manuscript at his death.

The theaters were originally going to be built on top of the mountain, where one can walk today on paved paths offering panoramic views of farms, valleys and the church spires of the old city. Instead, the connection to nature was made even more intimate: the theaters were built into the cliff's base.

The oldest hall, called the Summer Riding School, was once an arena where bearbaiting and horse displays were presented for the local princely households. It was literally carved out of the mountain 300 years ago: arches of cool, moist stone provided a primal backdrop to the festivities. As Salzburg begins a new era under Gerard A. Mortier, directing his first festival this summer, that backdrop will provide stability amid change.   The presence of nature is one of the dominant features of the Glyndebourne Festival in England as well, though here the contrasts with the subtly crafted artifice of European opera are provided by the rolling hills of the Sussex Downs, by grazing sheep and cows, shaped hedges and formal gardens.

The Countess, who is now the publisher of the Hamburg weekly Die Zeit, was the youngest daughter of an East Prussian family whose genealogical tree branched back to the Knights of the Teutonic Order, and she had the run of a castle and grounds visitors called \\"more beautiful than Versailles.\\" Indeed, with the disappearance of East Prussia -- at the end of World War II, its castles were leveled and its land ceded to Poland -- the kind of childhood Countess Donhoff had has become something foreign to everyone. Whence the interest of \\"Before the Storm\\": it documents in knowing detail a semifeudal world most of us have glimpsed only in movies and caricatures, a world of kindly, paternalistic aristocrats and their class-conscious servants. \\"The cook would never have sat down to eat with the kitchen maids, nor the housekeeper with the housemaids,\\" she writes; \\"the cook and the housekeeper ate in a separate room at a table to which only my mother's maid . . .  [ was ]  admitted.\\" The tone of these memoirs, ably translated by Jean Steinberg, is unabashedly nostalgic, even, at times, defensive; the Countess's parents entertained lavishly, she tells us, but they lived austerely, and the children always rode third class. Countess Donhoff, however, is not sentimental. She frankly acknowledges the anti-Semitism of her parents' class, although, she explains, they also hated the Nazis. But the most powerful part of this book narrates her 1945 flight westward before the Red Army and the utter collapse of all she knew. \\"The end of East Prussia,\\" she writes, \\"had come down to this: three dying soldiers trying to drag themselves across the Nogat bridge . . . and a woman on horseback, whose ancestors had come from the west into the wilderness east of this river six hundred years ago, riding back to the west -- six hundred years of history wiped out.\\" IN SHORT: NONFICTION"},{"year":"1972","title":"BLUE POINT, L.I., Sept. 29&#8212","excerpt":"It was Ch.

The recruiting officer in charge said, \\"I'm sure we can find a spot for a semiblind soldier.\\" \\n\\nEven in the Army, Mr. Frankel avoided active combat for a year and a half by editing a newsletter at Camp Shelby in Biloxi, Miss., and then at Army headquarters at the Grand Pacific Hotel in the Fiji Islands.\\n\\nAt this point, he was philosophically atuned to the United States' entering the war. The bombing of Pearl Harbor had made him realize \\"that there was no other choice.\\" But he still did not see himself as a fighting soldier. \\n'I Felt Terror'\\n\\n \\"I was living a great life in the Army, at the hotel on Fiji,\\" he recalled. \\"Then a friend told me that I was so smart, I should go to commissioned officers school and get promoted.

At graduation, after they called my name, they called out, 'platoon leader, Company F.' \\n\\n\\"I told the officer in command: 'Sir, there has been a mistake.

For the first time as a soldier, I knew I had to go into the jungle with a gun. I felt terror. It was the lowest point of my life.\\" \\n\\nMr. Frankel spent three and a half years fighting in the South Pacific. He saw friends blown to bits no more than a few feet from him.\\n\\nHe shot at enemy soldiers at close range. And he kept a diary of all that happened -- a diary he later turned into a book.\\n\\n\\"Frankel-y Speaking About World War II in the South Pacific\\" was published in 1992 by American-Stratford Graphic Services. Mr. Frankel had to cover publishing costs but felt it was worth it because he wanted to tell his story.\\n\\nA former magazine editor, publisher and political speech writer (his clients included Adlai E.

You are always cheerful and smiling.' I say: 'My God, look what I went through. I came out alive.

He wrote: \\"Each soldier lies on his back with his jungle knife unsheathed in his clenched fist. The Yank sleeps, but his killer instinct is wide awake.\\"\\n\\nAnd: \\"They defend themselves with knives, bayonets, fists, rifle butts, teeth and religion. No one is to leave his hole. A moving object above ground is presumed to be an enemy. Knife him first and identify the corpse afterward.\\" \\n\\nMr. Frankel spared no grizzly details: \\"If you see the whites of their eyes, don't shoot; jab a bayonet into those eyes. They will scream and whistle or even call your name. They will fling firecrackers at you and chant, 'American, you die.' But make them come in after you. When they crawl around the ledge of your foxhole, they'll silhouette themselves against the sky. Then's the time to lunge upward with that jungle knife. Keep plunging and withdrawing the hilt until the flesh is death-cold. \\n\\n\\"It was kill or be killed. You had a guy and a weapon against a guy and a weapon.

One of his most treasured possessions is a photograph of himself surrounded by three lieutenants and two sergeants in his platoon, taken Feb. 1, 1945, in Manila.\\n\\nTwo days later, he recalled, he and his comrades were \\"sitting around a table in a Manila living room\\" planning an upcoming river crossing. \\n\\n\\"While we six were studying maps, barges, landing sites, etc., a Japanese shell lit on the table and exploded, driving us all back against the wall.

I'm not much of an architect or a decorator, but she did it something like Greenwich Village.\\" He saw youngsters going there, mostly newcomers.

But she vividly recalls another, sadder milestone reached one night in 1993: the final time that Ms. Holland saw Jerry Lawson, of the a cappella group the Persuasions. After eating with friends at the now-defunct Chesapeake restaurant, he stood up and sang a brooding old slave song. 'The whole place was just captivated,\\" she said. \\"After that, there weren't as many characters in the neighborhood anymore. It was like seeing the birds go. People just suddenly disappeared.\\"    Carroll Gardens  'Organic Stuff'       Frankie Rizzo mourned the closing, sometime in the late 90's, of Tony's meat market, where he bought his veal cuts and sausage for 40 years. What that closing said about changes in Carroll Gardens was made clear soon after, when a store called Park Natural Foods opened nearby. Mr. Rizzo, who is retired, eyes it with suspicion. \\"The way these people eat is different,\\" he said. \\"They all seem to go for that organic stuff. Italians would never go for that.\\"    Ditmas Park  Latte, Please       \\"Lots of people have been moaning and groaning for a decade about needing a coffee shop here, a place to go to read a book or talk to their friends,\\" said Monica MacAdams, a lawyer who has lived in Ditmas Park since she and her husband bought a seven-bedroom Queen Anne house there in 1979. Then, last year, a funky, bright cafe called Vox Pop opened on Cortelyou Road. Ms. MacAdams said her neighbors were thankful that Vox Pop was not a franchise and that it had led Ditmas Park over the socalled latte line. \\"I see people in the coffeehouse -- interesting, arty-looking young people,\\" she said. \\"I don't think it's a huge population, but it's growing.\\"    Bay Ridge  'We Speak English '       Long before the mosques and halal meat shops arrived in Bay Ridge, a few variety stores put curious signs in their windows: \\"We Speak English.\\" For Regina and Gerard Carlson, lifelong residents, speaking English was never anything worth advertising. Soon that would change. One day in 1987, Mrs. Carlson recalled, \\"we were walking with the baby on Fourth Avenue, and we noticed that we were the only ones speaking English.\\"    Sunset Park  Mexican Cornona Stick       When Bernabe Gonzales, a building superintendent, was growing up in Sunset Park, a largely Puerto Rican neighborhood. Some parts of it functioned as open-air drug markets; one block of Fifth Avenue might accommodate eight or nine sellers, each hawking a different type of heroin. Then one day in 1992 Mr. Gonzales first noticed a different kind of street activity -- Mexicans setting up little street stands to sell lotes, grilled corn on a stick served with mayonnaise and cheese. \\"I was like, what's that?\\" he said. \\"Now they got everything: mangoes, tacos, enchiladas.\\"    Canarsie  The Fire This Time       A firebombing in 1990 was the first sign that Canarsie was changing, said a slight 78-year-old man who identified himself only as Dave. \\"It was 100 percent white here -- you had Italians, you had Jewish,\\" he said. \\"They burned the house of blacks who moved in, right here in East Canarsie. People were afraid their property would depreciate. It wasn't all the people, just a couple. They caught the guys.\\" Dave has worked since 1940 at a garden shop in the Brooklyn Terminal Market, where he greets his regular customers, many of them now West Indian and African-American, with instant recollection of their preferences for hyacinths or gardenias.    Windsor Terrace  Chicken Breasts       Dan Mills remembers a stray remark by Tony Pinto, a local butcher, in the late 80's that augured a big change. \\"He said that people were starting to come in and instead of ordering a big roast beef, they'd order a couple of chicken breasts,\\" Mr. Mills recalled. \\"It used to be that Mama made a roast beef on Sunday and everybody showed up.\\" The switch meant that a group of people far different from traditional Irish Catholic families was trickling into Windsor Terrace: single people. Couples in which both partners worked. Women who didn't cook. Not long after that conversation, Tony Pinto sold his butcher shop.    Bedford-Stuyvesant  Pressure Points       In 2002, a funny thing happened to Antoniette Millsapp, a longtime resident of Bedford-Stuyvesant. \\"I was sitting on the stoop in the summer,\\" she recalled. \\"This man was walking by and he said, 'Do you own your house? Do you want to sell it?' He said he could give me cash off the bat. I said, 'Sir, then where would I live?' \\" Since then, such interactions have become commonplace. Ms. Millsapp is regularly flooded with letters, notes stuck in her gate and people ringing her doorbell, asking if she wants to sell her house. Content in her retirement from her job as a radiology supervisor at the Columbia-Presbyterian hospital , she answers them with a polite \\"No.\\"    Prospect Heights  'Mr. January'       Gus Vlahavas, the owner of Tom's Restaurant on Washington Avenue in Prospect Heights, watched the white flight from the neighborhood in the 60's, and its descent into crime and drugs in the 70's. By the late 80's, Mr. Vlahavas saw that some people -- Park Slope types, he thought -- were trickling to Prospect Heights, but he became convinced that change was afoot only in 1992, when a photographer named Randy Duchaine appeared and said he was shooting a calendar about Brooklyn icons. \\"I was in it,\\" Mr. Vlahavas said, proudly. \\"Mr. January.\\"   The Day When Back in the Day Ended"},{"year":"2002","title":"Stephens Inc denies that it sold its holdings in Huntingdon Life Sciences, biomedical testing company, because of protests from animal-rights activists (S) Private Sector","excerpt":"It Was Just Good Business"},{"year":"1974","title":"BOSTON, Nov. 17&#8212","excerpt":"It was just like old times.

In offering more than 100 works by 53 artists, the Pierpont Morgan Library's \\"Sketching at Home and Abroad: British Landscape Drawings, 1750-1850\\" goes some way toward redressing this neglect. But the show is more than just a historical corrective. Thanks to a careful selection and ordering of material, much of it from the Morgan's own holdings, it also has a quietly dramatic story to tell.   The exhibition is arranged chronologically and gets off to a somewhat prosaic start. Landscape wasn't a subject for art in England before the mid-18th century","excerpt":"it was merely filler in countless topographical drawings of rural monuments and Samuel Buck's \\"East View of Arundel Castle\\" at the Morgan is typical of the kind.

Before his death of a motor neuron disease just over four months ago, Mr. Bailey, above, was probably the most august guitarist in free-improvised music, a virtuoso whose technique was often readily apparent but also perplexingly opaque. Originally trained as a jazz and dance band professional in his native Yorkshire, England, Mr. Bailey committed himself to what he called a nonidiomatic approach to improvisation shaped by the exigencies of the moment. To keep those conditions fresh, he constantly sought out unusual collaborations. He was slated to organize a series of them next month at the Stone, the East Village space owned by the saxophonist and composer John Zorn. After Mr. Bailey's death, his widow, Karen Brookman, worked with Mr. Zorn to flesh out the details and carry on. The result is a month of programming fascinating for its scope: it begins on Tuesday with Mr. Zorn and the turntable artist Christian Marclay and ends on May 31 with a glass-instrument performance by Miguel Frasconi. Among the many highlights is a May 19 program of oral tributes and personal recollections offered by Ms. Brookman, among others. But every set will be a tribute in some way.

Q.     We plan to visit England soon. I remember reading about a disease affecting cows in Britain. Is beef consumption considered safe now? -- Irene Cooke, New York, N.Y.     A.  There have been no reports of humans being infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, a disease that causes fatal brain disorders in cows. However, judgments vary about whether it is safe to eat beef in Britain. The disease, also called mad cow disease because cows stagger, fall and sometimes behave violently when the disease affects their brains, was first diagnosed in cows in 1986. It was last year, however, after the death of a pet cat suffering symptoms of the virus, that the public began expressing a fear that humans might get the disease","excerpt":"it was never known whether the cat ate beef. There was a drop in beef purchases in Britain, and some European countries temporarily banned British beef.    It is still not known how the disease is spread among cattle. One theory is that it is passed along genetically, and another is that it is caught when cattle eat feed made from sheep infected with a similar disease. (Spongiform encephalopathy develops in older animals; as sheep are generally slaughtered when they are young, lamb is not considered as dangerous as beef.) Since 1988, authorities have been destroying all diseased cattle.   A Government investigation last year concluded that there is no risk to human health from beef. The Government said its panel of scientists found that the disease can be passed along only through the animal's nervous-system tissue and that current regulations insure that brain and other nervous tissue are removed.    Richard Lacey, a professor of medical microbiology at Leeds University, said that during slaughter, brain tissue may get onto meat. Scientists expect the virus to have an incubation period of perhaps 20 years in humans, he said, so it will be some time until it is known if the disease can be passed to people. He said he would advise people against eating beef until there is more information about the way in which the disease is transmitted and added that there is no test to determine if the virus is present in humans.   Dr. Tim Lang, spokesman for a British consumer watchdog group, Parents for Safe Food, said that \\"a huge amount of research is being done\\" and that new discoveries are constantly being reported. He said that he did not believe there was enough information yet, but that, although he preferred not to eat beef, he thought the risks were minimal.  The Orient Express    Q.     I am interested in the Orient Express, getting on in Venice and leaving the train in Istanbul. -- Singha E. Hall, New Rochelle, N.Y.     A.  You can take a conveyance called the Orient Express from Venice to Istanbul, but it is a cruise ship that connects with one of two trains that now bear the Orient Express name. (The original Orient Express train began running in 1883, traveling between Paris and what is now Istanbul, and it stopped service in 1977.)   The ship connects with one of the trains, the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express. That train has two main routes: One goes between London and Venice, a trip of 32 hours, with stops in Paris, Zurich and Innsbruck; the train started service on this route late last month and it will continue until mid-November. The other route is between London and Budapest, 34 hours, the train stopping in Paris, Zurich, Innsbruck, Salzburg and Vienna; service is from early June to early November. The cost from London to Venice or Vienna is $1,440 a person one way or $2,090 round trip, based on two in a cabin. The cost of the cruise, which also makes stops in Greece, is $1,465 to $2,315 a person, depending on accommodations, based on two in a cabin. Passengers can leave the ship at any stop and re-embark for a later sailing. Reservations: Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, 1155 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10036; (800) 524-2420.   The other train is the Nostalgic Istanbul Orient Express. One itinerary, departing Sept. 7 this year, leaves Istanbul, and stops at Edirne, Turkey; Sofia, Budapest, Vienna, Salzburg and Munich and arrives in Zurich Sept. 10. The cost is $3,960 a person with two in a cabin. There are also routes between Zurich and Nice, May 11 to 13, and Prague and Dresden, in late November and early December. Reservations: 104 South Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Ill. 60603; (800) 289-7245.  Eastern Airline Vouchers    Q.     In November, my family and I were bumped in both directions between New York and Florida. For compensation we were given coupons for travel anywhere that Eastern flies. With Eastern out of business, isn't it anyone's responsibility to pick these up? -- Jennifer Zorek, New York, N.Y.     A.  It is not the responsibility of any other airline to honor vouchers from Eastern. Continental Airlines, part of the company that owned Eastern, is among the airlines accepting Eastern tickets but it will not accept free-travel vouchers. In a survey of several other airlines, none said they would accept the vouchers. A spokesman for Continental said that Eastern ticketholders will be entitled to refunds resulting from bankruptcy proceedings, and so will airlines that accept Eastern tickets. But, he said, vouchers have no such value, and for that reason airlines will not be inclined to honor them.    Passengers who are involuntarily bumped from an overbooked flight are entitled to substitute transportation and, if they arrive at their destination more than an hour later than originally planned, $200 to $400 in addition, according to Department of Transportation rules. Airlines may offer free transportation on future flights in place of a check, the department says, but passengers have the right to insist on a check. Passengers who volunteer to stay off an overcrowded flight in return for a voucher are not entitled to anything additional. In both cases, once passengers accept the vouchers, the airline has no further legal obligation. Driving in Mexico City    Q.     I will be driving to Mexico City in May. I have heard that there are limitations on days when one can drive there. -- R. K. Leef, Mission Viejo, Calif.      A.  To cut down on pollution, Mexico City prohibits the use of cars registered in the city on one weekday, the day determined by the last number on the license plate: Monday, 5 or 6; Tuesday, 7 or 8; Wednesday, 3 or 4; Thursday, 1 or 2; Friday, 9 or 0.

I watch longingly as they are presented with the chef's special dishes, and then I turn and order from the menu just like everybody else.   One of my first interests was to review the cooking of Sylvain Portay, who became chef at Le Cirque late last year. Over the course of five months I ate five meals at the restaurant","excerpt":"it was not until the fourth that the owner, Sirio Maccioni, figured out who I was.

We had already reached dessert, but our little plate of petit fours was whisked away to be replaced by a larger, more ostentatious one. An avalanche of sweets descended upon the table, and I was fascinated to note that the raspberries on the new desserts were three times the size of those on the old ones.

Endowed with the talents of Warner Baxter, some excellent aerial photography and the exciting title, \\"Hell in the Heavens,\\" the film went on view last night at the Mayfair Theatre and seemed to please its audience. Which is to say that the spectators appeared to be no little impressed by the traditional delineation of the heroism, hysteria and humor that are common to most cinematic flying squadrons.If the reaction of this corner happened to be slightly less warm","excerpt":"it was only because the theme has been worked to death by Hollywood. After all, there are not many things a war flier can do. He can be a hero or a coward; he can bring down an enemy plane and dream at night that he is falling in flame; he can get drunk and give vent to his tortured nerves; he can fall in love; he can find himself at last and, by shooting down the German raider, discover from him that an enemy soul can be harrowed by the same feelings that burn within his own.To its credit, \\"Hell in the Heavens\\" finds a way of using almost each of these possibilities and does it in a manner that holds one's interest most of the time. There is more than a suspicion that the device employed to accomplish this laudable end is nothing more than the insertion, now and then, of a good dog-fight, or a bombing, or a glimpse of a burning plane hurtling earthward. Sneer though you may at the barroom heroics of the film fliers, you would have to be callous indeed not to shudder vicariously as the grim helmeted figure in the black plane pulls down the levers—or whatever their technical name might be—of his machine guns and death chatters its way across the sky.Mr. Baxter gives another of his sincere performances as the harrassed flight commander, and Conchita Montenegro, as the French peasant girl (and this time the French girl actually speaks French, and nicely, too) is more than merely visually attractive. Andy Devine, Herbert Mundin, Vince Barnett and Johnny Arthur contribute brief moments of comedy to prevent the film from being merely a drama of blood and fear, and Arno Frey and Rudolf Amendt are both effective and convincing as the German fliers.

We don't want these old-growth forests to go the same way.\\"    Most of the clamor about old-growth forests has come from the West, where environmentalist pressure to protect remaining large stands of ancient woods brought a halt to logging on many Federal lands and led to President Clinton's timber summit and recent compromise plan designed to protect habitats for endangered species. But biologists and conservationists in the East have recently begun to realize that there is more original forest here than was long believed to be the case, scattered remnants of the mighty forest that greeted the arriving Europeans. These woods seem to harbor no equivalent of the spotted owl, which is dependent on old growth, but scientists argue that their preservation is crucial. The first conference on the topic was convened in August at the University of North Carolina in Asheville, an event that also marked the publication of Mary Byrd Davis's landmark catalogue of the region's untouched woods. Though \\"old growth\\" is notoriously hard to define -- there are those who insist on absolute virgin forest, while others make concessions for human intrusion that hasn't altered the basic character of a grove --researchers are becoming more aware of undamaged tracts, and of what can be learned from them. \\"We have entries from every state in the East,\\" Davis says, \\"and new discoveries being made all the time. People are just beginning to realize what's out there.\\" THE WILD WILD EAST"},{"year":"2004","title":"What hath Rocco wrought?

Sean was the loving husband of Meg, the beloved brother of Una, Patrick, Teddy, Noel, Mari Byron and the late Kathleen O'Brien, and the dear uncle of many nieces and nephews. Born in Ireland, Sean has lived in NYC for the past 38 years. Sean attended a Jesuit seminary in Ireland and served as Jesuit missionary in Peru and Bolivia. Sean was the Chief Executive Officer of TML Information Services, Inc. and the Chairman of the Board for the North American Driver Safety Foundation. Sean's passion for driver safety and protecting individual's privacy rights was exemplified in his innovative and creative work using official Department of Motor Vehicle driver records of the various states of the US and several foreign jurisdictions in Mexico and Canada for promoting highway safety both in law enforcement and in the rental and insurance industries. Sean's pioneer work in this field created a large source of revenue for many jurisdictions. Sean was active as an Associate Member of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) and a member of AAMVA's Industry Advisory Board. Sean was also a leader in the Insurance Industry Committee for Motor Vehicle Affairs and a member of the Board of the Network of Employers for Traffic Safety. Sean provided his international leadership skills to the US Department of Transporation for implementing a technology transfer that developed commercial driver and motor carrier safety initiatives and a safety information system infrastructure between the US and Mexico. As part of his contributions with the US Department of Transportation on safety data exchange between the US and Mexico, Sean served in the Transportation Consultative Group of the NAFTA Land Transportation Standards Subcommittee. Sean made significant contributions to the US Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration's Team/Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's working group facilitating the opening of the USMexico borders for commercial motor vehicle operators. Sean was a leader in promoting safe driving and was coauthor of the CDL Effectiveness Study for the Department of Transportation's Federal Motor Carrier Services Administration, a Report to Congress that was instrumental in the implementation of updated federal regulations embodied in the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act. Sean will be remembered for his brilliant and creative mind, vast depth of knowledge in history, government, mathematics and the technical fields related to computers and information transfers, insatiable curiosity, inquiring mind, generous heart, love for his fellow man, and dedication to his friends, his business partners, and employees, all of whom Sean regarded as his family. Sean loved life which he faced with a sense of adventure and a zest for the joys this world brings","excerpt":"it was said of him that he lived life as a poet would like to record it, with intensity and uncompromising dedication. For Sean there was no other way. Sean's sense of humor and ''twinkle in his eyes'' will be with us always.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; Pre-Election Advance in Stocks --Call Money 6%, Sterling Little Changed."},{"year":"1994","title":"IRISH food has gotten a bad name for itself -- undeservedly. It is hard to explain how a land whose lush pastures nourish dairy and beef herds, whose kitchen gardens and orchards yield sweet strawberries and herbs, whose moors pullulate with lambs and game, and whose cold, clean waters brim with seafood gained a reputation for overboiled cabbage, overdone meat, potatoes with everything.   But a new generation of chefs is restoring the nation's culinary honor. Whereas only a few years ago the better cooks confined themselves almost exclusively to country-house hotels, today Dublin's increasing prominence as a financial center enables it to support some remarkably distinguished restaurants. If their menus have Continental embellishments, each of these three has a character as particular to Dublin as a pint of hand-drawn Guinness. The Commons Restaurant    The most conspicuous newcomer to the Dublin restaurant scene, the three-and-a-half-year-old Commons Restaurant, occupies the basement of two elegant 18th-century houses on the south side of St. Stephen's Green.   Collectively, the buildings are known as Newman House, for it was under their sumptuous plasterwork that the writer and theologian John Henry Newman gave substance to his \\"Idea of a University,\\" serving as the first rector of the Catholic University of Ireland, the institution that grew into University College Dublin. The poet Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote and taught there in the 1880's, and James Joyce, a student of philosophy and English there at the turn of the century, set part of \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" in its rooms.   No wonder Michael Fitzgerald pressed for the opportunity to open a restaurant in what until the late 1950's had served as the student canteen. He spent 15 months supervising the remodeling of the basement and the garden behind. The result is a discreet, consistent and stylish haven, more home to corporate pinstripes than student jeans.    The restaurant seats only 40 at generously spaced round tables, each covered with not one but two beige tablecloths. A spectacular flower arrangement occupies a central slate table framed by a pair of columns, but attention shifts to the collection of paintings on Joycean themes specially commissioned from local artists by Mr. Fitzgerald, who revels in pointing out Louis Le Brocquy's striking \\"Image of James Joyce.\\"    The food is as imposing as the setting, with fixed-price menus changing daily. The head chef, Michael Bolster, a native of County Cork who trained in Britain, delights in juxtaposing Irish products with French delicacies, pairing, say, lobster mousse with braised Puy lentils and black pudding with foie gras.    We opted for savory duck confit, its unctuousness cut with muscat grapes and beets, and a warm parsnip and caramel timbale, which all by itself redeems the reputation of that maligned vegetable.    Mr. Bolster's seafood, much of it purchased direct from small cooperatives on the south coast, is prepared with split-second precision, witness the firm-fleshed John Dory on which I lunched recently. Its chive-strewn white-butter sauce was at once light and sassy, providing an urbane foil to the accompanying colcannon, a classic Irish melange of cabbage and potato, here whipped to a fluff. Lamb with sun-dried tomatoes arrived pink as requested","excerpt":"it was so good that my guest yearned for a more generous helping. The side vegetables played textural counterpoint, crisp broccoli contrasting with well seasoned carrot puree, new potatoes alongside saffron-tinctured duchesse potatoes.   Desserts are modern readings of classics, artfully presented. Who can resist a sinful chocolate roulade filled with white chocolate mousse or fragrant warm apple strudel accompanied by cinnamon cream? At dinner a cheese board laden with half a dozen of Ireland's finest poses a dilemma. How does one choose between mild Cashel Blue, Camembert-like St. Killian, or washed-rind Milleens -- all in tip-top condition? Slivers of each are essential to any cheese-lover's education, or so we discovered.   Wines, too, are up to the mark, with a long, well balanced list. Having decided to drink wine in a country where the (very high) taxes on alcohol are based on volume rather than value, one might as well drink better vintages. At The Commons a pleasant 1993 Sancerre runs $32, whereas twice that buys an outstanding 1991 Condrieu.    The Commons has lived up to University College Dublin's motto, \\"ad astra,\\" \\"to the stars,\\" at least partially by winning a first Michelin star last spring. The chef who garnered that honor has moved on, but Michael Bolster and his polished team of 9 chefs and a dozen waiters seem well equipped to maintain the standard. Roly's Bistro    Nearly two years ago, at the height of the recession in Ireland, a group of catering professionals opened a 150-seat \\"bistro\\" deep in Dublin 4, the home of Ireland's chattering classes. Against all the odds, Roly's Bistro, named for the restaurant's red-bearded greeter and mastermind, has been a near sellout ever since. Its recipe: a top-flight chef using the best materials, reasonable prices based on high turnover and an attractive, buzzy ambiance.   Colin O'Daly heads a staff of 24 chefs. This most resolutely Irish of chefs, locally trained, offers modern renditions of a broad variety of native dishes, changing his menus at least twice a month. Thus his fillet of beef may be accompanied by boxty; this medley of mashed and grated potatoes enriched with melted butter, originating in County Cavan, has supplanted gratin dauphinoise in my potato pantheon. Most of us recoil from the notion of blood sausage, but Mr. O'Daly's Clonakilty black pudding, sauced with sage-infused tomatoes, converts even the most squeamish to this country staple.   Mr. O'Daly also toys with exotic accents. His Dublin Bay prawns, perhaps more familiar to us as langoustines, come with beautiful saffron tagliatelle, and snappy cucumbers and fennel, and his lamb from the Wicklow Mountains just south of Dublin has the added tang of apricots and ginger.   We admired Mr. O'Daly's approach as we settled down to delicate warm scallop mousse sharpened with lemon balm and Colin's prawn bisque, a full-flavored yet light shellfish essence. Monkfish, sauced with nettles and hazelnuts, and a scallop of wild salmon, set off by the acid of both sorrel and spinach, were firm-flaked, their tastes fresh and defined.    On advice, we opted for creme brulee. Lest regulars tire of its silken shimmer, Colin O'Daly regularly alternates its flavoring. On this evening he had added a hint of maple syrup and a dollop of crunchy walnut ice cream on the side. Desserts here tend toward schoolboy favorites such as queen of puddings -- bread pudding layered with red-fruit jam and crowned with meringue.    The relatively short wine list, revised monthly, runs mostly to European wines. The Chablis Premier Cru '90 from A. Regnard ($31.75) is an exceptional value.   Such good food naturally breeds good cheer, which is compounded by the surroundings: daffodil-colored walls, comfortable seating and eager clients. In spite of the high turnover, customers rarely feel pressured, thanks to a well-staggered reservation system and an alert young dining-room team.  Locks    For atmosphere and choice food, Locks is hard to beat. Situated along the reedy Grand Canal, which marks the southern boundary of the Georgian part of the city, Locks exudes Irish charm with a rustic inflection that has endeared the place to Dubliners for the past 14 years. Theater people, in particular, seem to congregate here.   After ringing the doorbell, diners are shown in, as often as not by the Danish-born owner, Claire Douglas, who graciously seats them beside the bar. Over drinks they can peruse a menu and take in the neighboring 50-seat dining room. An eclectic feast of 19th- and 20th-century engravings and lithographs lines the cream walls, and hoop-backed Victorian chairs face old-rose-colored banquettes across white-napped tables arrayed on worn Oriental rugs.   The menu is at one with the decor: reassuring and homey, even if few homes can boast a chef as skilled as French-trained Brian Buckley. Succulent black pudding with onion sauce enriched with duck fat and lamb kidneys with mustard are almost always listed as starters, but Mr. Buckley's inventive grace notes include monkfish and prawns sparked with Thai curry sauce and pineapple or salmon with vermouth garnished with herby marinated tomatoes. Servings arrive on handsome old china, each elaborate pattern seemingly chosen to set off the preparation.   With supreme (if fleeting) disregard for American Heart Association guidelines, I tucked into a vast portion of salmon in pastry with rich caraway hollandaise and too soon found myself mopping the plate with the house soda bread.    Game is a delight at this time of year. Venison in a titillating raspberry vinegar and Dubonnet essence is generally offered, but Locks is a fine place to try less familiar widgeon (a small wild duck) or rare roasted tender young snipe or woodcock when they are available. My husband, Arthur, chose the rich game pie, an amalgam of hare, pigeon and pheasant, and found it wonderful.    \\"Rich\\" is an adjective that recurs when describing food at Locks. No stinting on butter and cream here.  Such sophisticated comfort food suits Dublin's damp northern climate. Visitors who are less self-indulgent will find alternatives, for example, smoked salmon and grilled black sole. Don't be put off by the term \\"black sole\\"; it's known as Dover sole on the other side of the Irish Sea. At Locks it is cooked to flaky perfection.   For dessert I chose the comparative austerity of fruit salad with flavorful blackberry sorbet but couldn't resist a spoonful of my husband's gooseberry fool, a lush blend of tart fruit and sweet cream.    The relatively short wine list reveals the manager Brian Cornish's penchant for things French. The dry Jurancon Domaine Cauhape '92 ($30.30) was a happy revelation, as was the 1984 Chateau Lynch-Bages ($65.60) that incited us to linger over a superb Stilton, chatting contentedly and enjoying the lilt of our neighbors' conversations.

What is unusual is to find items of these descriptions in a single sale, many for prices that even the sharpest critics of auctions consider to be bargains.   All these conditions were in place on Nov. 15 at the Drouot Richelieu in Paris at the auction of 174 telephones transformed by artists into a robot, a baby doll, a combination shoe and pocketbook, a basket of flowers, a tabernacle, a Louise Nevelson-like sculpture. They come sealed in jars, locked in a cage and installed on the roof of a skyscraper. Organized by the Paris auctioneers Patrick Dumousset and Patrick Deburaux, the sale benefited the Association Valentin Hauy, which assists the blind.   Nearly every imaginable image of what telephones mean to people is captured in these telephones, all contributed to the cause by France Telecom, which initiated the project. The telephones and related objects brought prices from $175 to $10,000. The highest price was paid for asculpture of compressed Telecom paper by Cesar. Only 78 telephones were sold, bringing a total of $60,000.   Among the more arresting telephones were in unexpected settings. A robot of corrugated board by Roger Depresle had a telephone inset in its stomach, the push-button panel at the right, the receiver at the left and the curled wire dangling like a key chain from its waist. A blue plastic skyscraper, constructed by Igor Chelkovski, conceived of the telephone as always elusive, installed like a landing pad on the roof.   The artist Bachir, whose \\"Eve\\" is a George Segal-like sculpture of a white plaster woman reaching for a telephone instead of an apple on a tree, portrays the telephone as the root of all evil.   Artists have decorated telephones before. Salvador Dali's lobster-crowned telephone holds the auction record for such an effort","excerpt":"it was sold at Christie's in New York in 1988 for $110,000.

Several major African tribal carvings of women from the collection of the French artist Jacques Boussard, who died in 1989 at the age of 77, were sold for prices within the presale estimates or well above them.   An extraordinary figure of a kneeling woman with an outsize drum on her head, from Guinea in West Africa, was sold for $231,934 to the Museum of African Art of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Her coiffure, carved in braids like long leaves ending at the nape of the neck, appears tight with tension from the burden she bears on her head. The presale estimate was $250,000.   A helmeted Bambara figure from Mali with huge cone-shaped breasts, flattened arms carved with angles and a stomach with chevrons brought $231,964, well above the house expectations of about $100,000. A Senufo carving from the Ivory Coast depicting a woman with an elongated torso and arms and sharply pointed head, chin and breasts was estimated to sell for $100,000; it brought $378,885, the highest price in the sale. The buyers were not identified.

The realities of childhood put to shame the half-true notions in some children's books. These offer a gilded world unshadowed by the least suggestion of conflict or pain, a world manufactured by those who cannot -- or don't care to -- remember the truth of their own childhood. . . .   The popularity of such books is proof of endless pussyfooting about the grim aspects of child life. . . . Of course we must avoid frightening children, if by that we mean protecting them from experiences beyond their emotional capabilities: but I doubt this is what most people mean when they say \\"We must not frighten our children.\\" The need for evasive books is the most obvious indication of the common wish to protect children from their everyday fears and anxieties, a hopeless wish that denies the child's endless battle with disturbing emotions. Going to See the Trees      Lewis O. Saum's description of the rituals surrounding Christmas trees in the 1870's reminds us how swiftly our \\"traditional\\" holiday customs have evolved. This is from \\"The Popular Mood of America, 1860-1890\\" (University of Nebraska).     A Christmas tree was an event, something one attended, and one might attend several. Thus a milliner in Webster, Massachusetts, reported in 1876 that \\"there were lots of Christmas trees but I could not go to any of them.\\" Evidently, doing so involved financial considerations. The trees served as points of exchange for small gifts such as autograph albums. . . . Only rarely did trees appear in humble homes. The Stranger at the Dance      The Swedish Ballet, an avant-garde group active in Paris in the 1920's, aroused considerable admiration -- but nothing more remarkable than the enthusiasm of the painter Theophile Alexandre Steinlen. This is quoted from a contemporary newspaper account in \\"Ballets Suedois\\" by Bengt Hager (Abrams).     One evening, on 25 November 1920, during a performance of    Nuit de Saint-Jean,    the dancers, Jean Borlin included, were not a little surprised to see some unknown person stepping up behind them. Bizarrely dressed in eighteen-thirties garb, with a green frock coat and a tall, broad-brimmed hat, he came and took his place at the table where the peasants pretend to be eating cake and drinking. But the dancers had more surprises in store for them. For here were the huge wooden goblets, normally empty, full that evening of excellent wine, and in place of the painted cardboard cake an enormous, mouth-watering brioche. And so they ate and drank in earnest. . . . At the moment when the peasants begin a hectic farandole round the midsummer's night tree, the gentleman in the green frock coat joined hands with the others and danced to his heart's content. The ballet came to a very lively end . . . at which point, to everyone's utter amazement, the frock-coated gentleman revealed his true identity: it was the great painter Steinlen, eager to make his debut as a dancer. Useful, Addled Critics      Even bad criticism serves a purpose, as Janet Flanner demonstrates in her record of the experiences of Henri Matisse and the other painters known, in the early years of this century, as the Fauves. This is from \\"Men and Monuments\\" (Da Capo, paper).      At the debuts of all the revolutionary styles of painting that now seem merely to make up the lovely late-nineteenth-century phenomenon of modern French art, from Monet's Impressionism, in the 1870's, to Seurat's neo-Impressionism and Gauguin's and van Gogh's Expressionism, the Paris art critics performed an invaluable service. They were nearly always wrong in their judgments. Thus they sustained the conviction of each emerging contingent of artists, usually upheld by little else (being poor, visionary and worried), that their imaginations, palettes and paintings were set on one more right, immortal track. Fauvism, at its birth, was distinguished by the insults that customarily greeted the arrival of something vital and unfamiliar","excerpt":"it was termed a monster, and Paris critics called it aberrant, repellent, sensational and unnecessary. . . . Matisse, for his \\"Woman with Hat,\\" a portrait of his wife, was termed \\"robustly gifted but gone astray in eccentric color.\\" At the Salon, someone tried to stab the portrait. Creation's Flow      Jazz, Gene Lees argues, is both the most daring musical form and the perfect paradigm for the process of creativity. This is from \\"Meet Me at Jim & Andy's: Jazz Musicians and Their World\\" (Oxford University, paper).     Aldous Huxley said that art is created in a state of relaxed tension. You must be relaxed enough to let the dreams flow, alert enough to know what to do with them, grab them out of the incorporeal air as they rush by and turn them into something that others can perceive and be moved by. . . . Making jazz is a very naked thing to do.   That anyone can do anything at all but stand there in paralyzed amazement when the chord changes are going by, that musicians can function with minimal premeditation and great creativity within the materials of a song's structure, is more remarkable than even the most expert practitioners themselves seem to appreciate. It requires both tremendous knowledge, whether intuitive or acquired, and the physical reflexes of an athlete. Jazz is not only one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of music, it is one of the most striking achievements in the history of human thought.

Approval was seen as a prerequisite if Mr. Clinton hopes to have any clout on the rest of his agenda: health care, trade and so on. The plan that passed includes what is by some measures the largest tax increase ever, with the goal of accomplishing what may be the greatest Federal deficit reduction ever. The taxes come in several varieties and are likely to affect all but the very poorest people. In addition, spending on automatic benefit programs will be reduced by almost $100 billion and freezes in discretionary spending are supposed to save about $100 billion more over five years. Mr. Clinton pushed hard for this victory, giving in on some details, but retaining most of what he wanted. Still, the House vote was seen as the easy one, and a number of Senators are determined to amend the plan. The Growth Engine Sputters The United States economy, which was cruising along at a growth rate of 4.7 percent in the last quarter of 1992, misfired in the first quarter of this year even more badly than was previously thought, the Government disclosed. It now appears that the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of only nine-tenths of 1 percent in January through March. That was only half the 1.8 percent rate estimated a month ago. It was the weakest economic growth since the fourth quarter of 1991. A Tumble in Public Confidence In the Conference Board's latest survey, the public's confidence has fallen to its lowest level since before the presidential election. Only 13 percent think jobs will be more plentiful in six months than they are now, for instance","excerpt":"it was the lowest level in a year. But if people are losing hope for the future, they are not so gloomy about current economic conditions. The current-conditions index remained a good deal higher than it was in October. As Norma Pace, president of WEFA's Economic Consulting and Planning in New York, put it, \\"The index is an accurate reflection of how consumers feel, but it's not a good reflection of how they spend.\\" The Fed Can't Stop The Drop The Federal Reserve intervened to try to stop the decline of the dollar against the yen on Thursday and Friday, but it was not enough to keep the United States currency from establishing record lows. That is because many traders believed Washington is not all that uneasy with the idea of a stronger yen, which could lead to a decrease in the American trade deficit with Japan. By late in the week, however, the Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, Lawrence H. Summers, said, \\"The market has moved too far, too fast.\\" How far and how fast? It took 125 yen to buy a dollar in January; for a while on Friday, it took fewer than 107. Layoff Notices Not Required A Federal judge has ruled that the General Dynamics Corporation did not have to follow the law requiring that workers be given 60 days' notice before being laid off. The case involved a mass layoff in 1991 after the Navy canceled a warplane program. Other companies must deal with the competitive marketplace, natural disasters and economic cycles and still must warn their workers of possible layoffs. But military contractors have a bigger burden. They do business with the Federal Government. A Short HDTV Honeymoon As it became clear that the three research teams competing to develop high definition television, known as HDTV, in the United States all had worthy technologies, the focus shifted to nontechnological matters, including jobs. So, there was a sense of relief when the rivals agreed last week to join forces, presumably heading off lawsuits by those not chosen. But the euphoria was shortlived. Experts quickly suggested that it might be impossible to reconcile crucial technical issues without alienating television equipment companies or computer companies. INTERNATIONAL Renault, After the Socialists When the Socialists held the reins in France, they stopped the privatization of Government-owned companies.

Among the world's rich and famous, there are few people as rich and as famous as the Aga Khan. But this counts for little these days in Italy.

Another Chance for China As a candidate, Bill Clinton lacerated George Bush for not using trade as a lever to improve human rights in China. But as President, Mr. Clinton has not deployed his main weapon: China's \\"most favored nation\\" trade status. He will give Beijing another year to make progress on rights. COMPANIES Time on Their Side Since Time took Warner as a partner, there have been periodic reports that the company was looking for well-heeled investors. Now they are starting to appear. Earlier this month, U S West said it would take a 25.5 percent stake in Time Warner Entertainment. Then Seagram unexpectedly disclosed that it had acquired 5.7 percent of Time Warner's stock and wanted to accumulate 15 percent. Time Warner professed to be delighted, although it was not immediately clear what it might gain from a closer relationship with a Canadian liquor and fruit juice company. Crossing Paths Again Before Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts took RJR Nabisco private for $25 billion, one of its biggest deals was a $6 billion buyout of Beatrice.

But Kohlberg, Kravis must have been impressed by Mr. Harper's performance because it has now turned to him to become chief executive of RJR Nabisco. Looking Under The Rock At Prudential Securities, insiders say, some high-commission brokers in the booming Dallas branch ran amok from the mid-80's until last summer.

In the folklore of the computer industry, the story of the rise of Dell Computer is one of the standards. Hatched in a University of Texas dormitory room by 19-year-old Michael Dell, the company has grown in less than a decade to be the fourth-largest personal computer maker. But now Dell has had its wings clipped. The company reported first-quarter profits that were half of the previous year's even though revenues were sharply higher. The big problem was that the company had failed to keep up in the fast-growing notebook-computer market. For the week Dell's stock plunged $9 a share, or more than 27 percent.  ...And an AST Acquisition Dell may soon be unseated as No. 4 in the PC business by AST Research, based in Irvine, Calif. AST has agreed to buy the money-losing TE Electronics, the computer-manufacturing subsidiary of the Tandy Corporation. Tandy had previously announced that it would spin off TE at the beginning of July as a separately traded company. For AST, the purchase is a chance to acquire manufacturing capacity. Tandy wants to concentrate on its Radio Shack stores and other retail operations. But the sale also removes a pioneer of the PC industry. There was a time a decade or more ago when Tandy -- along with Commodore and Atari -- was one of the leaders in the industry.

Ms. Demaray had the idea during a residency at the Headlands Center for the Arts in Sausalito, Calif., a former launching site for nuclear and conventional missiles. The artists' colony sits alongside an educational center where decommissioned missiles are restored and maintained by volunteers, mostly Army veterans once stationed there. Ms. Demaray took a walk down the hill to introduce herself, and the veterans warmed up to her quickly. ''These ex-Army fellows invited me to do a piece at the missile base, and I said, 'Funny you should invite me, because I've been thinking about it and I'd like to upholster one of your warheads,''' Ms. Demaray recalled.

When she convinced them she would do no harm, they made her an official volunteer, issued her a uniform and pointed her toward a silo.

I heard in that class that many in Europe had believed that Jews had been taught by the Talmud to poison the wells and that the Black Death had been brought by \\"Talmud Jews.\\" I learned that in the Middle Ages, it was firmly believed that the Talmud instructed Jews to use the blood of Christians in the ritual of making matzoh, the unleavened Passover bread, and so the manuscripts of the Talmud were often burned by princes on advice of the church. In the required course in literature, we were studying \\"The Merchant of Venice.\\" The \\"enlightened\\" teacher made a point of telling us that Shylock's crassness and anger were not an innate characteristic of Jews","excerpt":"it was the unfortunate cast that centuries of obedience to the Talmud had given their character. \\n\\nEarly in the morning before going to school I studied the Talmud with my father; he was waiting for me when I came home so that we could return to the text. I had no doubt that what I was hearing at school was wrong and hurtful. My problem was: Why had \\"they\\" been saying such things for so long? The easiest answer was theological bias, deeply ingrained in Western culture. The metaphor the first Talmudists used to explain themselves to themselves -- that the Talmud, the authoritative library of Jewish law, ethics, mysticism and folklore, is an ocean and that those who study it are swimmers who fight great waves to find truth -- has persisted among the students of rabbinic texts for more than 20 centuries. But for the early Christians, the chronicles of the discussions and debates of the rabbis in the great academies of Jewish learning for the seven centuries ending with A.D. 500, which constitute the Talmud, were a Dead Sea, and the Pharisees, who founded those great academies, a sect that preferred the letter of the law to its spirit. Western Christian culture had been embroidering this charge for centuries. In the 1700's and 1800's, many of those willing and even eager to give Jews equal rights made it clear that emancipation would come only if the Jews would free themselves from the separatist rituals and nonsensical tales and doctrines that were recorded in the Talmud. (This enlightened idea even appeared among Jews.

This tale of the French Revolution with its death-crossed lovers, its purloined necklace, its musical invocations of Mozart, Rossini and the operatic tradition itself, was also a stunning success for James Levine, who commissioned the opera 12 years ago for the 1983 centennial of the Met. He gave it an immaculately polished performance. The company spared no expense in its (dare one say?) haunting and fantastical production by Colin Graham and its first-rate cast, including Teresa Stratas and Haken Hagegard.

An official said PETN was commonly found in bombs and surface-to-air missiles, making it impossible, for now, to know for sure which type of device destroyed the jet, killing 230 people.

It is wasteful, inefficient and bad public policy for one individual criminal-justice agency to push its own legislative agenda in an attempt to obtain more resources than another without considering the entire picture. For it is compellingly clear that the problems of the criminal-justice system are interrelated.   Whether there should be more resources in one area - more police, for example - cannot be rationally decided without considering the effect that more police will have on prosecutors, courts and prisons, or jails; nor is there any purpose in providing additional resources if each component of the system is following different priorities.

One of its most exquisite products was the elaborately dyed and embroidered    kosode,    or short-sleeved robe, similar to the modern-day kimono. WHEN ART BECAME FASHION: Kosode in Edo-Period Japan (Weatherhill, 421 Madison Ave., New York, N.Y. 10017, $60), with pages of color photos of    kosode,    is a companion book to an exhibit of some 150 of these garments at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art","excerpt":"it was written by two of the museum's curators, Dale Carolyn Gluckman and Sharon Sadako Takeda, with additional contributions by seven scholars. The Edo Japanese expressed their individual style not in the cut of their clothing, as in the West, but through their choice of surface decoration. Sumptuary laws, meant to regulate extravagant dress, in fact encouraged alternative design and dyeing techniques for    kosode,    making it the designer clothing of the age. Because the Japanese made no distinction between fine art and decorative art, the great artists of the day used    kosode    as their painting surfaces, creating robes that became supreme status symbols. Wordplay, Chinese pictograph characters and even poetry were incorporated into    kosode    design as well, creating what Ms. Takeda calls \\"a cloak of language that announced the sensibilities, desires and values of the owner.\\" Perhaps this is the precedent for the often inscrutable English one sees on T-shirts, jackets and shopping bags in today's Japan.

Mr. Dupont is noted for his unusual touches, and he has not spared them in this production. Even the opening, which ordinarily is but a staid, prosaic list of characters, has become almost a part of the picture. The director has managed to get the most from his situations without overdoing them.Mr. Bennett is not a screen writer and thus has retained in his story the verisimilitude which would be necessary in a novel. The actions are all motivated and swing freely forward without dismal hurdles or detours. And, like the director, who throws in a bit of modernistic camera work, the author has put in something which might be described as a climax. In other words, the suspected woman did not commit the murder.Miss Gray seems to have been rediscovered as an actress. For a long time she has been docketed as an exponent of \\"shimmy,\\" but in \\"Piccadilly\\" she appears to show that acting is not above her. A prophet apparently is without honor; Miss Gray found it necessary to flee to English studios to have a chance.The story is about the Piccadilly restaurant and its leading dancer. The latter is slipping from public attention, and when her partner is discharged for annoying her she alone is unable to hold the patrons' attention. Her last performance is ruined by an obstreperous guest who makes a disturbance about a dirty plate, and when the owner of the restaurant goes to the kitchen to investigate the plate he sees a Chinese scullery maid dancing for her friends.The maid (who is played by Anna May Wong) is given a trial and she is hired as a dancer by the owner, who presently falls in love with her. He visits her one night, leaves just before the other dancer arrives and knows no more about it until the coroner's jury is called to investigate the girl's murder. But instead of the dancer being the guilty party, a Chinese friend of the victim ultimately confesses the crime.Of the players besides Miss Gray and Miss Wong, King Ho-Chang gives a good performance as the friend of the Chinese dancer. He is said to be a restaurant owner who went into the picture just for amusement, but he appears to be a finished actor.The picture in its original form was silent, but in the course of its voyage to the American screen it has found itself encumbered with sound and sound effects.

The occasion wasn't a particularly propitious one","excerpt":"it wasn't Brando at his noble-savage best, dressed in a trendsetting bad-boy outfit of T-shirt and skintight jeans, as in ''Streetcar,'' or Brando at his most primally Brandoesque, as in ''Last Tango in Paris,'' still gorgeous but already edging toward fleshy ruin, getting more naked than any actor had ever allowed himself to be despite remaining dressed. No, I caught him on a late-night television viewing of the overripe Tennessee Williams vehicle ''The Fugitive Kind,'' in which he is called upon, somewhat implausibly, to make goo-goo eyes at an aging and desperate Anna Magnani rather than at a very young if crazy Joanne Woodward, and yet manages to cradle Magnani's ravaged face in his hands as if it were the only one that spoke to him. (Nevermind the disheartening truth of the matter, as revealed in Peter Manso's biography, which is that Brando went out of his way to reject Magnani's advances at every opportunity.) Years later, I would try to capture the combustible effect Brando had on me by composing a poem in a college writing class that transformed him into a verb. It was addressed to some love object of the moment, to whom I paid the highest compliment I could think of. ''You Marlon Brando me,'' I wrote, meaning that the subject of the poem had bypassed all the subtle indexes of wit and sophistication by which I usually measured men and gone straight to the heart of my amorous craving.    It has always been floated that the erotic imagination of women -- in contrast to that of men -- is relatively immune to direct visual stimulus. Much to the chagrin of marketing mavens and the pornography industry, the gentler sex are supposed to require the lambent atmospherics of intimacy -- murmured endearments, gestures of affection, everything sweetly veiled -- to bring out their lusty side. Brando, it seems to me, put the lie to this cultural truism. He suggested that it was possible for an image of male beauty to arouse the female gaze solely on the basis of the aesthetics of desire. Brando was more than a male pinup, of course, but in some ways his complex emotional articulation -- his eloquently tongue-tied mixture of truculence and sensitivity -- was icing on the beefcake. To look the way he looked, with all the smoldering drama implied in just the contrast between his chiseled, poetic features (before he broke his nose during the run of ''Streetcar,'' he was considered too pretty to play Stanley Kowalski) and his brawny, thick-necked body, was appetite-whetting enough, even before you got to the fascination of the inner Brando, with his sad childhood, his cruel streak and his magnetic bisexual allure. Brando, it should be said, was more at ease with the girlish, psychologically cross-dressing aspect of himself than any American actor before him. For evidence of this, you have only to look at the iconic scene in ''On the Waterfront'' when he picks up the white glove Eva Marie Saint has dropped and then, in an unscripted move, tries it on, wiggling his large paw into its delicate contours; or at the way he inhabited the role of the closeted gay major in ''Reflections in a Golden Eye'' not through a surface mincing around but by hinting at the foiled machismo of the man (although the provenance of the major's strangled, half Southern drawl and half plummy British lisp as Brando devised it correlates with no known geographical locale on this earth).

The Vice President answered the door himself, and standing on the front stoop, the three men settled into a polite routine of questions and answers. Suddenly, Pat Nixon appeared. She was angry and, it was clear, not in control of her emotions. She damned the reporters and their colleagues for favoritism toward Kennedy that she said cost her husband the election. Nixon calmed her and led her away. When he returned, he said nothing about his wife's outburst, and the reporters resumed their inquiry as if nothing unusual had occurred.

The reporters, hoping to shake things off-script, and aware of their own video presence, would have shouted self-consciously aggressive questions.

TOP STORIES    KOMMERSANT  GAZPROM SHUNS FOREIGN PARTNERSHIP: A ''sensational'' statement on Monday by Aleksei Miller, head of the Russian state gas company, Gazprom, that his company will develop the Shtokman gas fields without the aid of Western partners, was completely unexpected, the newspaper wrote. Mr. Miller also said that Gazprom will no longer send Shtokman gas to the United States as originally intended, but to Europe -- primarily Germany. Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, the newspaper said, may propose making Germany Russia's main energy partner in Europe when he meets with Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, today.    VEDOMOSTI  MERGER CREATES ALUMINUM GIANT: The heads of Rusal, Sual and Glencore signed an agreement in Moscow on Monday merging their aluminum companies into the unified corporation, Russian Aluminum. The new company will become the world leader in aluminum manufacturing when it begins operations around April 1 next year. Though stock options for the company will open to investors in about a year and a half, Oleg Deripaska, Rusal's head, will retain a controlling share.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  ELECTIONS YIELD NO SURPRISES: As expected, United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, swept municipal elections held on Sunday, though with a less successful showing than in the last round of voting in the same region. In total, the party of power gained between 35 and 55 percent of the votes in the 9 regions where elections were held. The newly united Party of Life, Pensioners' Party and Motherland party, each exceeded the 7 percent minimum threshold required to remain active. The Party of Life faired relatively well, gaining 34 percent of the votes in Tuva and 16 percent in Karelia.    GAZETA  KOZLOV MURDER SUSPECTS DETAINED: According to information from an unnamed source, two Ukrainian citizens have been detained in connection with the murder of Andrei Kozlov, the former deputy head of the Russian Central Bank. Investigators apprehended the two suspects after a check of mobile phone communications around the time and location of the murder, the newspaper wrote. The two said they have no information on who ordered the murder and admitted that they had not yet been paid for their services, the newspaper reported.    GEORGIA RESPONDS TO ''DISCRIMINATION'': The Georgian government is considering an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in connection with what it said was discrimination against Georgians by the Russian government. Georgia also called the deportation of Georgians from Russia on cargo planes ''intolerable'' and refused on Sunday to allow such aircraft to land in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital. Meanwhile, Russian military units in the region, which had been put on a heightened state of alert following the arrest on Sept. 27 of Russian officers in Georgia, returned to normal operations.    ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA  GEORGIAN ISSUE AFFECTS MIGRATION DEBATES: The latest conflict between Georgia and Russia has prompted Russian legislators to quicken the adoption of a comprehensive migration law, and has also added several important nuances to Russia's migration question, the newspaper wrote. The Russian government may decide to shorten the period for which it issues visas. The president also demanded that the new legislation protect the interests of Russian citizens in the labor market. Nevertheless, the new law is expected to be more liberal than previous legislation","excerpt":"it will be easier for foreigners to register and receive work permits, the newspaper wrote.    VREMYA NOVOSTEI  FIRST STATEMENT BY PUTIN ON JOURNALIST'S MURDER: In a telephone conversation on Monday with the American president, George W. Bush, Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's president, said that Russian law-enforcement agencies would ''take all necessary efforts to objectively investigate the tragic death of the journalist, Anna Politkovskaya.'' The Russian interior ministry also said it was doing everything possible to solve the murder, but admitted that contradictory statements by witnesses and uncertainty about how to prioritize different theories about the murder could slow the investigation. Officials said, however, that they had not hit a dead end.    NOVYE IZVESTIA  WAR ON GAMBLING BEGINS: The State Duma began hearings on Monday on a federal law that would eliminate all casinos and gambling establishments outside four designated gaming territories. Regional authorities, however, have preempted the law, declaring war on local casinos and gaming halls, the newspaper said. In Moscow, officials announced on Monday plans to close 317 businesses in the gambling industry by the end of the year. Authorities in St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novogorod have voiced similar plans.

The photoplay gives the impression of some fabulous old tale of strange people in a strange world, fascinating, exciting to the imagination, and yet so unfamiliar in all of its aspects that it always seems remote, elusive even, when one would like to get closer to its meaning.Paul Wegener, who directed the production, has shown his greatest artistry, perhaps, in maintaining the consistency of his production. Even his method of telling the story without the usual directness and coherence of modern narration seems a part of the age and subject with which he deals. It will doubtless be disconcerting to some","excerpt":"it will be said that the photoplay does not develop climactically, and in places its lack of direction does leave the mind somewhat at sea, but this is not to say that it is ever dull, for one cannot lose interest in a work so strangely engrossing and with such power as \\"The Golem\\" has in many of its scenes.This power is derived mainly from a combination of exceptional acting and the most expressive settings yet seen in this country. Resembling somewhat the curious constructions of \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\\" the settings may be called expressionistic, but to the common man they are best described as expressive, for it is their eloquence that characterizes them. They give impressions of distance, of compactness, of massiveness, of old-world unearthliness that could not be conveyed in any other way. They are as active a part of the story as any of its characters, and afford another striking illustration of how much constructed scenery, furniture, buildings and the like may mean in a photodramatic composition. It is not because they are weird, but because they vivify the action of the story, that they are cinematographic works of art.The acting of the players, too, is of that pantomimic quality essential to the motion picture if it is to be a living thing. None of the players is named, except Mr. Wegener, so individual credit cannot be distributed, but the old Rabbi Loew, his daughter, her betrothed, Rudolph Habsburg, and the others in the cast, including many who are only vital figures of the crowds, all define their characters clearly. None of them is simply a silenced chatter-box, as are so many supposed screen actors in this country.The most impressive performance is that of Mr. Wegener as the Golem. This is the name for a huge figure of clay fashioned by Rabbi Loew and brought to life by the insertion of a magic word in a receptacle in his chest. The rabbi employs the monster to propitiate Rudolph, who has ordered the banishment of the Jews from Prague, but, like the creature of Frankenstein's creation, the Golem does not remain obedient and seeks its own dumb satisfaction to the threatened havoc of the Ghetto. He is reduced to the impotence of inanimate clay only when a Christian child whom he picks up playfully unscrews the bright star in his chest which holds the magic word.The story is said to be based on an old Jewish legend, but it is no part of orthodox Jewish tradition surely. It is, however, an absorbing Old World story, most effectively told.Its effect is heightened by Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld's presentation of it with appropriate accompanying music, an inspiring musical prologue and motion picture views of the still ancient-seeming City of Prague.By way of light relief the picture is followed by a dance by May Kitchen Cory in Benda masks, another of Tony Sarg's delightful chapters on the merry men of prehistoric times, and a mirthful Keaton comedy called \\"Hard Luck.\\"Rudyard Kipling's \\"Without Benefit of Clergy,\\" increased in quantity, if not in quality, by many things that might be, but are not likely to be, inferred by one reading the story, and only slightly modified to suit the squeamish, is at the Capitol this week. On the whole, it is a worth while production, more faithful to its original than one dared hope in advance, exceptionally well photographed, staged with a fine regard for details, and as well acted as the method of its filming permitted.It is with this method that one is most inclined to quarrel. It is that of the stage and the written word, not that of cinematography. In scene after scene the characters do nothing but talk, speak words that cannot be heard and must later be inserted as sub-titles. There are many striking scenes in the picture and some that reveal their own meaning, but there are also many others meaningless in themselves and consequently flat. James Toung, who directed the production, has accomplished the arrangement and photographing of his scenes admirably, but he has not revealed fluency in the language of moving pictures.Perhaps the chief trouble is with the story. It is not suited to the screen. Its very essence is of words, and although—or because—Mr. Kipling himself selected it, and collaborated in its adaptation with Randolph C. Lewis, it remains a splendidly illustrated edition of his story. It has not become a moving picture play.Virginia Brown Faire, as Ameera, the little Indian girl whom Holden, the British engineer, marries \\"without benefit of clergy,\\" gives, perhaps, the most appealing performance, although she does not surpass in effectiveness Evelyn Selbie, as her mother. Thomas Holding, as Holden, is adequate, and Nigel de Brulier, as Pir Khan, is a piece out of the original.The screen version remains \\"faithful to the poignant and only appropriate ending of the original, for which it should be heartily congratulated. Its only important concession, in fact, is in the introduction of a native marriage between Holden and Ameera.Also at the Capitol is an interesting Kineto review on \\"India\\" and a Mack Sennett comedy, \\"Astray from the Steerage.\\" Sascha Jacobsen, the violinist, plays Wieniawski's \\"Souvenir de Moscow\\" and Erik Bye sings Korsakoff's \\"Eastern Romance\\" and \\"Song of India\\" as a prologue to the photoplay.\\"Appearances,\\" the first production of the Famous Players-Lasky British Producers, Ltd., to reach this country is at the Rialto this week; \\"Sowing the Wind,\\" with Anita Stewart, is at the Strand, and \\"Life,\\" from the melodrama by Thompson Buchanan and William A.

The speeches by Mr. Martin and Ms. Rohrbacher were recorded by The New York Times. Mr. Appleby's comments were taken from the Web site of the bishop's conference. The full texts of the statements are online at nytimes.com/national.    Mr. Martin     I find it's easier to tell my story using the name John Doe. I can revisit my pain and not hurt myself again. I found different stories that have helped me to understand my suffering. I'd like to share some of those today so that others may be helped.     In John's late 20's he meets his wife, Julie. This is a start to his recovery, yet John has no idea. John's wife brings him back to religion and also introduces him to a priest that helps in John's recovery. I wish I could say recovery started here. But John wasn't quite ready. John had to read an article out of Sports Illustrated dated Sept. 13, 1999, entitled ''Every Parents Nightmare.'' This describes to John why he was in a position to be hurt. It goes like this:    ''While society has no trouble envisioning the violent molester and the child who is forced to submit to a sexual predator, many people are baffled by how adult seducers are able to get kids to go along with them voluntarily. These men seduce children, in this case boys in exactly the same way men and women have been seducing each other since the dawn of mankind. In other words they flirt with them, laugh at their jokes, shower them with attention, with gifts, with affection. They size up their weaknesses, their vulnerability, their needs. They will target the kids who are more vulnerable.''    The amazing part of when I allowed John to talk about his abuser was how this man also offered kindness and love. How this man became John's best friend. John has showed very little anger toward his abuser. I was amazed at who John directed his sorrow to. He directed his sorrow not at his abuser but at his parents.     John tells a story of how his abuser wants to take John fishing. The abuser asks John's parents if it's O.K. John's parents thought it was a great idea for John to go on a fishing trip with a Catholic priest.     John talks of how his relationship with his parents changed. How he no longer trusted them. How alone he feels.    Mom and Dad, I'm terribly sorry for how I treated you. Please accept my apology. I know that only thing I have in my heart for you is love. I love you both dearly.    You see a child who is abused is put in a frightening and confusing situation. They may have never heard of anything like this happening. Nobody has told them it's right. Nobody has told them it's wrong. Everybody may like and respect the person who is doing these things.     John remembers this motel that night with the priest. But hardly anything else. John has no idea how he got home. It is only 35 years later that John is starting to remember what happened that horrible night.     Abused children often hide their anger and distress from others so that no one will suspect that they're being abused. They may also keep their feelings under control while they're being abused to protect themselves from feelings of distress and pain, or because they don't want the abuser to see how much he is hurting them. Many adult survivors continue to cope by blocking feelings and trying to forget about the past.     Survivors often have a low opinion of themselves and lack self-confidence and self-esteem. They may feel worthless, useless and unloved. Many survivors put on a front and present themselves as capable, cheerful, confident, while feeling wretched inside. Survivors may be so overwhelmed by their low opinion of themselves and lack of confidence that they may suffer bouts of depression making them unable to act positively or find pleasure in things.    I say these words because they describe John's feelings exactly. John became sexually active shortly after his abuse. John describes some very unhealthy attitudes toward women, admits to seeking out women in a predatory way. Alcohol also started to control John's life. It was many years before he finally sought help for alcoholism.     Although sexual compulsivity and alcoholism had major effects on John, it was his need for self-esteem that's kept him alive. John still admits today to having low self-esteem. John has shown symptoms of low self-esteem, depression, anger and the need to control. John has been able to survive only because of his family, his friends, his children and the therapy he continues to go through.     Ms. Rohrbacher     When I was a little girl, my family, at the request of Mount Angel Seminary in Oregon, befriended several Mexican seminarians who were students there. The seminary placed one of these young men with my family, who was also Hispanic, no doubt to ease his transition to life in the United States.    My mother, who regarded him as a son and encouraged my siblings and me to treat him as a brother, generously welcomed him into our family. We housed him over school holidays and summer vacations. The young seminarian that my family sponsored was named Jose. Our family situation was difficult when I was a child. My father died in 1960, leaving my mother a widow with 14- and 8-year-old sons and myself, age 5. During summer vacations she had no choice but to leave us at home while she worked.    The summer of 1967 Jose lived with us during his break from the seminary. He took advantage of my mother's trust in him and sexually molested me.    As difficult as it is for me to reveal these deeply personal aspects of my life to you, and probably uncomfortable for you to hear, I feel it is important for you to understand the harm he did to me. Jose molested me by digital penetration of my vagina and fondling. I was terrified to do anything but keep quiet and not move while he violated me. He told me, ''Don't tell Mom.''    Because I was afraid of Jose and the effect that I believed disclosing the abuse would have had on my family, I did not reveal his actions to anyone and hid my horror and shame for many years.    Because of his status as an adult, a man and as a future priest, I believed at the time and continued to believe for many years that the abuse was somehow my fault. Jose continued to be treated as a member of my family. My mother was a special guest at his ordination to the priesthood and was as proud of him as if he were her own son.    In 1984, when I was 29 years old and pregnant with my first child, Father Jose came to visit my husband and me in Juno, along with my mother. This visit precipitated a nervous breakdown. I disclosed the abuse to my husband after the visit and sought counseling at his urging.    Dr. Appleby      The root of the problem is the lack of accountability on the part of the bishops, which allowed a severe moral failure on the part of some priests and bishops to put the legacy, reputation and good work of the church in peril. The lack of accountability, in turn, was fostered by a closed clerical culture that infects the priesthood, isolating some priests and bishops from the faithful and from one another.    No one can safely generalize about a group as huge, complex and amorphous as the laity. It is also wrong to generalize about you, the bishops. Indeed, many of you are not only blameless in the current scandal -- you have acted honorably in the incredibly difficult balancing act you are called upon to perform. You did not protect abusive priests, nor have you attempted to circle the wagons or clamp down on lay dissent when outraged parishioners and priests in recent months demanded accountability for episcopal misdeeds. Other bishops, however, have behaved atrociously, angering fellow bishops and priests, whose reputations have been tarnished by those whose actions have been marked by arrogance, lack of repentance, and repeated failure to be collegial and consultative, except in an upward direction. . . .    Rome has been very cautious, to say the least, in granting authority to the national episcopal conferences, and I believe that the laity have or will have difficulty understanding what appears to be a counterproductive level of oversight. Please pardon the question, but it is a natural one: are you not trusted by the Vatican? It seems incredible to the interested outsider that on matters of faith and morals you would veer one millimeter from orthodoxy.     Those of you who are canon lawyers know the challenge of applying canon law within a specific local and national environment. The state and civil society in, say, Honduras, or Poland, present different challenges to the church than does the U.S. government and legal system.    To the extent possible, then, I urge you to formulate the policies that make the most sense for this environment, without anticipating how the Vatican might respond.

British Air started the contest in 2000 when it introduced full lie-flat beds in its refurbished business-class cabins.

FLIGHTS FOR FASHIONISTAS -- Getting to Milan from New York will soon become a lot easier for fashion-industry travelers and other premium-cabin business fliers. Starting in February, a new travel club, Milano Manhattan, will offer bookings on all-business-class nonstop flights, daily except Saturdays, between Kennedy International Airport and Linate Airport, which is 15 minutes from the Milan city center. The flights, operated by Eurofly, are in an Airbus Corporate Jet configured with 48 business-class seats, with round-trip fares of $3,500 to $4,300. To participate, you need to be accepted for (free) membership in the club, which calls itself MiMa, either through recommendation from a member or by applying at www.mimaclub.com, starting Nov. 30. Airbus Corporate Jets, developed from the 124-seat A319 family of commercial airliners, usually fly with about 18 seats when configured as private business jets. With 48 business-class seats, they still offer lots of room.    TRAVEL SPENDING -- This will be a record year for travel spending in the United States, according to the Travel Industry Association. Total spending in the United States by domestic and international travelers will total about $646 billion this year, a 7.8 percent increase over 2004, the group says.    SONG FARE SALE -- Although it will be merged into its parent, Delta Air Lines, next year, Song, the spiffy little low-cost carrier, is still plugging away. Some examples from its current fare sale, all round trip: $118 between New York and Orlando; $218 New York to Las Vegas; $238 Los Angeles to Orlando; $238 New York to Los Angeles.

The makeup maestro Dick Page, who worked on both shows, tends to blend a soft rose lipstick on the apple of the cheek, but believes that women used to working with a powder blush should stick to powder. Whatever your medium, start with naked skin (a total maquillage can make a blushed cheek look too doll-like), and smile before applying to make the application appear as natural as possible. Buy something pinker than you think you will ever need","excerpt":"it will look right once it's on. Page likes cream blush for a healthy flush; the makeup artist Fulvia Farolfi uses Estée Lauder's Minute Blush for a very creamy look. Either way, you don't have to go to the gym.    EITHER-OR LIPS  There's no middle ground for pouts this season: it's either nude or burgundy. Page warns that truly nude lips like those at Marc Jacobs and Missoni can make the best-intentioned woman look ''dead and buried.'' So opt for something with warmth. Begin with a concealer (Shiseido's concealer pencil or Yves Saint Laurent's light beige lip pencil) and top with gloss (Lancôme's or Clinique's). For dressier occasions, emulate the deep berry mouths at Louis Vuitton, Donna Karan and Carolina Herrera. Page says women who don't wear dark shades should use a stain, like Vincent Longo's. But for a full-strength smacker, begin with a lip pencil and use a brush to spread lipstick (real reds from Yves Saint Laurent or Revlon) all over the surface. Then blot and powder (with Laura Mercier's translucent loose) and repeat the lip brushing. Phew.    MOD IS IN THE DETAILS  Exaggerated Twiggy eyes, rimmed in black and white, popped up at the Chanel, Dior and Ungaro collections. Page thinks that women who lead their lives off the runway should opt for a pared-down rendition, preferably without the white. ''It's too costume to try at home,'' he says. The look of the 1960's requires liquid liner, which -- unless you have the hands of a surgeon -- usually results in an ugly space between lines and lashes. (For that exigency, Farolfi suggests the help of Revlon's user-friendly rubber-tipped liquid.) Page skips the liquid liner altogether, using instead an inexpensive eye shadow (like Wet 'n' Wild) on a small damp brush to work darkness into the lashes. ''It's more attractive than a razor-sharp line,'' he says. Amateurs, keep a pile of damp Q-tips handy.    EYE DO  Eyes are the center of attention this season, especially when they shimmer like the silver and gold painted lids at Gucci, Zac Posen and Narciso Rodriguez. Metallics can be worn wet or dry. Page wets shadow by mixing it with grease (like Elizabeth Arden's Eight Hour Cream) and rubbing it on the lids with a soft brush. (Cargo has a ready-moist version.) Farolfi likes powders from Shu Uemura or Nars. A tip: don't use anything darker than your skin tone. And don't overdo it; otherwise, it will show in the creases of your lids and highlight imperfections and wrinkles. The models batted extra-thick eyelashes at Dolce & Gabbana and Proenza Schouler. For similar spiderlike fringe, Page layers on Maybelline Great Lash; not letting it dry between coats makes for great buildup. To avoid looking like a drag queen, keep most of the face fairly bare.

They have spent more than $40 million buying and restoring 16 buildings and soon will start on a $6.3 million hotel, restaurant and retail development overlooking the harbor a block away.   The project, scheduled to start in January, will be the first phase of a $26 million waterfront festival marketplace planned jointly by the Mitchells and the Woodlands Corporation, the real estate arm of Mitchell Energy and Development Corporation, of which Mr. Mitchell is chairman and president. It is part of his overall aim to bolster the port's economy by increasing tourism to 8 million visitors a year from 5 million, making the city of 58,000 residents the state's No. 2 tourist attraction (San Antonio, with 13 million visitors a year, is No. 1).   The city, a 32-mile-long barrier island 50 miles south of Houston, was called the \\"Queen City of the Gulf\\" in the last half of the 19th century, when 60 percent of all goods shipped to the Southwest came through its port. During the island's golden era in the 1870's, the Strand, its commercial area, was known as the \\"Wall Street of the Southwest.\\" In 1900 a hurricane killed 6,000 residents, and the dredging of the Houston ship channel, in 1911, drew business away from Galveston.   By the time the Mitchells bought their first Strand building in 1976, the area had become a skid row. They paid $50,000 for the dilapidated three-story brick League Building, with its a cast-iron front, and spent more than $1 million restoring it for shops and a restaurant. In 1985 they converted a former merchandise mart into the 120-room Tremont House Hotel. Then they revived Galveston's Mardi Gras celebration, which now draws more than 350,000 people each February.   Their latest project, on a 10-acre former banana terminal site leased from the Port of Galveston, will include a 40-room bed-and-breakfast-style hotel called Harbor House","excerpt":"it will occupy the second and third floors of a three-story building with 24,000 square feet of retail space at ground level. A 10,000-square-foot building for shops and a restaurant will be built next door, overlooking a small marina.   The project, whose architects are Ford Powell & Carson of San Antonio, will be financed in part by a $900,000 Urban Development Action Grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and $2.4 million generated by city tax reinvestment zone bonds.

''THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO'' is a thought-provoking documentary that reflects the complicated situation we are in. Directed by MICHAEL WINTERBOTTOM and MAT WHITECROSS, it details the incarceration of three British Muslims captured during combat in Afghanistan after 9/11 and sent to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, where they claim to have been tortured. The prisoners, known as the Tipton Three, are portrayed as naïve or nefarious young men (you decide) who chose to place themselves in a war zone at an extremely inopportune moment in East-West history. As depicted in the film their treatment since being arrested is shocking, and edifying. If not fundamentalists before, the three men, who have since been released, certainly appear to have become fundamentalists during their incarceration.  In New York at the Angelika Film Center, Mercer and Houston Streets, Greenwich Village, (212) 995-2000, and the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, Broadway at 63rd Street, (212) 757-2280, as well as at theaters in Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington","excerpt":"it will open in two weeks in more cities.

Her prognosis was poor, but her doctors told her she was a suitable candidate for a dangerous, unproved and costly therapy under study, a bone-marrow transplant that would allow them to bombard her body with huge, otherwise lethal doses of anticancer drugs.   She grasped the slender reed. \\"I feel it has given me an opportunity at a possible cure,\\" Mrs. McCook, 35 years old, said of the $100,000 procedure. It was performed this spring at the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center, and while her cancer has melted away, she will not know if she is cured for years. The bills were paid by her health insurance company, which is supporting the study. Denial and Near Death    Evelyn Harper, 47, with two children, learned last fall that her breast cancer had invaded her eyes and liver. A resident of the Virgin Islands, she sought treatment in Los Angeles, where doctors said she too should consider a marrow transplant.    But her insurer, like many around the country, said it would not cover an experimental therapy. In February she appealed, sending reams of data provided by her doctors arguing that the procedure might give her a 20 percent chance of surviving cancer-free for years. At the end of May the appeal was denied. By then the cancer had spread too widely to consider a transplant and now, with no hope of effective treatment, she is near death.   \\"That might not have sounded like a big chance of success, but it's a lot better than nothing,\\" said her husband, Dennis Harper. \\"It seems like the insurance company holds you off as long as possible, waiting until it's too late for a transplant. That's not right.\\"   Whether insurers should pay for marrow transplants has already become tinder for bitter lawsuits, poignant talk shows and an emerging political movement of breast cancer patients. The debate exemplifies the wrenching issues that may increasingly bedevil American medicine in an era of fast-changing, enormously expensive treatments and rising concern about costs. Benefits vs. Costs    Health experts and government leaders, as well as insurers, hope to tame runaway medical expenses through more stringent assessment of new treatments and by weighing their benefits and costs.   The concepts sound sensible and uncontroversial -- until they are applied to real people, especially with life-threatening diseases like breast cancer, and to promising treatments being urgently refined, like marrow transplants.   Grueling ordeals that put patients through at least three harrowing weeks of hospitalization, transplants have already proved useful against certain cancers of the blood, and insurers generally pay in those cases. Doctors are now trying the therapy in patients with several other kinds of cancer, including ovarian, testicular and especially breast cancer.    Some patients have shown encouraging responses, but many have not. The mortality rate from the procedure itself, while improving, is still 5 percent or more. All the researchers agree on the need for more research, but they put different shades on the same skimpy facts.    \\"For the right patient, I think it should be considered a therapeutic option,\\" said Dr. William P. Peters, director of the Duke University Medical Center's marrow transplant program, a leader in research on transplants for breast cancer and a critic of insurance companies that refuse to pay when the procedures are performed at experienced centers.   Other experts are skeptical. \\"We have raised the public's expectations far beyond what is supported by the published data,\\" Dr. I. Craig Henderson, director of the breast evaluation center of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, wrote in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute this summer. \\"We have no evidence as of yet that any patient will be cured by this therapy who would not have been cured by more conventional treatment.\\"   Hundreds of women with breast cancer this year will endure the transplants and accompanying blasts of drugs. Researchers believe at least 10,000 women a year, of the more than 40,000 who die from breast cancer annually, may be good candidates if the procedure is shown to help more than it hurts. Clinical Trials Under Way    Most women whose cancer is caught in early stages are cured with conventional treatments, including removal of the cancerous lump or the entire breast, along with drug therapy and radiation. For them, there is no reason to take on the risk and travails of a marrow transplant. Many more women are ruled out as transplant candidates by age and condition. Because it is so demanding on the body, the procedure is seldom tried on women older than about 55, or on those with other medical problems.    Firm answers about effectiveness are several years away: controlled clinical trials, comparing patients receiving transplants with similar women receiving conventional chemotherapy, have just begun.   The procedure is becoming safer and less expensive, but even at best, research suggests, it will never offer a miraculous cure for patients with advanced breast cancer","excerpt":"it will, however, raise their odds of survival.   For advanced breast cancer, it appears that transplants will, at best, keep 10 to 20 percent of the women cancer-free, said Dr. Edward A. Stadtmauer of the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center, who is treating Mrs. McCook in a study comparing transplants with traditional drug therapy. And that success rate may fall, he said, as more patients are followed for more years.    \\"That still would be wonderful,\\" he said. \\"But we also have to look at quality of life, toxicity and costs. I have to say I still don't know which group in the study is going to do better. There is truly no right answer in 1991.\\"    With known therapies offering little, some patients see the unknown in a different light.   \\"There's a whole list of things that could go wrong, and yes, it scared me,\\" Mrs. McCook said. \\"But I also have two small children, and the chance of not being here in 10 years also scares me.\\" The Controversy State of the Art Or Experimental?     Insurance companies have long said they do not cover unproved therapies, but they have often paid for innovative, unapproved uses of cancer drugs. In decades past, too, they started paying with little question for costly new procedures, like coronary bypass operations, that were widely adopted with little evaluation. But today, expensive new procedures receive much closer scrutiny.   The official position of the insurance industry on transplants is clear enough. \\"We are not saying this is too expensive and it shouldn't be covered,\\" said Naomi Aronson, director of technology assessment with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association in Chicago.   \\"We are saying that procedures need to be evaluated so that precious health care resources can be used for things that are effective.\\" If studies provethat transplants improve survival, Dr.  Aronson said, the companies will pay.  Many Insurers Are Paying    To speed the search for answers and perhaps fend off lawsuits, many Blue Cross affiliates and, in the Philadelphia area, U.S. Healthcare, a large health maintenance organization, have agreed to contribute to the costs of patients' receiving transplants in certain clinical trials.    In practice, after hearing pleas or threats from doctors or lawyers, many insurers are paying transplant bills for some breast cancer patients, but many, too, are denying coverage. Recently, some insurers have begun writing policies that specifically exclude coverage of marrow transplants for breast cancer.    Cancer researchers, as well as desperate patients, are angry.    \\"It's unfortunate, because basically they are holding transplants for breast cancer up to a different standard than other costly procedures,\\" said Dr. Karen H. Antman, director of the transplant program at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Insurance officials deny they have a double standard.    \\"It will be impossible to do studies unless patients have coverage,\\" Dr. Antman added.    Ellen Hobbs, a 36-year-old breast cancer patient in Sacramento, Calif., said: \\"What's the difference between experimental and state of the art? The doctors told me that traditional chemotherapy would be ineffective.\\"    \\"This country spends a lot of money fixing up people with no hope,\\" said Mrs. Hobbs, who had a transplant in June and became politically active after fighting for months, with the help of a lawyer, before persuading her insurer to pay.    Now receiving radiation therapy in followup treatment, she is doing well so far, but, like Mrs. McCook, cannot know her long-term prospects since cancer cells can lurk in the body for years before resurging. The Transplant Bombarding Body With Cancer Killers     For such a trying ordeal, the transplants involve a series of undramatic steps. Doctors have long suspected that in some patients they could kill cancer in the body by dousing it with enough toxic drugs. The problem was that this would kill the patient, too, by destroying the marrow cells that generate vital red and white cells and platelets in the blood.    In autologous marrow transplants, as these are called, some of the patient's own marrow cells are extracted from bone or blood and frozen; outside donors are not needed. The patient is then subjected to several days of intensive chemotherapy, 10 times the normal dose. Her marrow cells are reinjected, and the real drama begins.    For weeks, until the reinjected marrow begins producing new blood cells, assuming it does, the patient lives without much of an immune system, susceptible to vicious fungal, bacterial and viral infections.    \\"It is horrible,\\" Mrs. McCook said.  \\"Everything just hits rock bottom. I had temperatures of 105, vomiting, bowel problems and I needed morphine. You lose your hair and your appetite, you lose your taste buds. You get depressed.\\"  Vulnerable Period Shortened    Until recently all patients spent more than a month in the hospital and transplant-related mortality at some leading centers was over 20 percent, most often from infections. But the recent availability of growth factors, manufactured versions of natural body chemicals that stimulate the marrow cells, has shortened the period of critical vulnerability, reduced hospital stays to as little as three weeks and pulled down death rates to 5 percent to 15 percent at various centers.    The growth factors have also pulled down the cost, which is attributable more than anything else to the length of the hospital stay. Dr. Antman said cost for some patients at some centers was down to $70,000 or less. Dr. Peters believes that over the next several years the price could fall to $25,000 or less. The Results Encouraging Signs But Doubts Persist     Right now, transplants are considered worth risking for the several thousand women each year whose cancer has spread to 10 or more lymph nodes, meaning that they a high chance of relapse after normal therapy. It is also considered worth the risk for the smaller number of women with large tumors that cannot be surgically removed or with inflammatory tumors and for the tens of thousands of women whose cancer has already spread to other parts of the body, who are rarely cured.   Among those groups, only some can even potentially benefit. Before a transplant is considered, a woman is given a course of conventional chemotherapy. Only those whose tumors shrink in response to lower doses, studies have found, may potentially be helped with the all-out attack of high doses and a marrow transplant.  Will Remissions Last?    In a positive sign, studies indicate that women receiving transplants are far more likely than others to show a good short-term response -- disappearance of detectable cancer.    The open question is whether these remissions will last.   Dr. Peters and other researchers point to encouraging recent results from studies involving limited numbers of patients. In one recent study at Duke, among 59 women whose cancer had spread to 10 or more lymnph nodes but not more widely, three-fourths were cancer-free after four years, he said. With conventional therapy, he said, he would only expect about one-fifth of such patients to be cancer-free.   Among a group of 45 transplant patients whose cancer had already spread to distant sites beyond the lymph nodes, he said, 20 percent are cancer-free after an average of four years. With conventional therapy, almost none with such advanced disease would be cancer-free at that point, he said. Of another group of 22 women with advanced cancer who were early pioneers with the therapy, three remain cancer free after five to eight years.    But others say figures like these, while intriguing, may easily mislead.   \\"The question is, what would have happened to those same patients if they had gotten conventional chemotherapy,\\" said Dr. David M. Eddy, a health economist at Duke University who is a consultant to insurance companies. \\"I can show you individual patients who received conventional therapy who also survived 5 or 10 years.\\"   Among other problems with existing comparisons, the patient groups may have differed in important ways. \\"The transplant patients are very healthy, good candidates for treatment,\\" noted Dr. Bruce D. Cheson of the National Cancer Institute.   Dr. John H. Glick, director of the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center, says four or five years is not long enough to say a patient is cured of breast cancer. \\"Some of the advocates are speaking too soon,\\" he said.  The Outlook Weighing Lives Against Costs     Within three or four years the clinical trials should yield convincing evidence about the comparative effectiveness of transplants, although it will take longer to know whether cures are achieved. If a statistically significant survival benefit is shown, even for a few years, then the insurance dispute may fade away.    But, depending on how dramatic the trial results are, divisive questions of cost versus benefit may persist.    \\"If there is a big difference in survival, then it will be persuasive,\\" said Dr. Cheson of the National Cancer Institute. \\"But if there is only a small advantage for transplants, it's still going to be an individual decision the physician will have to make with the patient.\\"    Even the insurance industry has shied away from the more explosive, but ultimately unavoidable issue for American medicine: How good does a treatment have to be to make it worth the price?  Benefits to Bring Pay    In the case of marrow transplants, insurance companies have said that if studies yield proof of benefit, they will cover the procedure whatever it costs.  But some experts wonder whether this approach will remain feasible, or even wise.    \\"I think they should take the cost into account, and weigh it against the benefits,\\" said Dr. Eddy, the health economist. \\"I think in five years they will do that, but they don't now.\\"   \\"Somewhere, some time, someone will have to judge what additional benefit is worth what additional cost,\\" Dr. Eddy said. He acknowledged that this would be treacherous new terrain for government, insurers, doctors and patients who, like Mrs. McCook, put a value on hope itself.   \\"Society has had very little experience doing this,\\" Dr. Eddy said.

Holden, on the street, shouts up that he always wanted to be a catcher in the rye, saving children from falling off a cliff, but he knows that's impossible now, because if the kid lands on him from this height, they'll both be paste. Mickey Rourke yells back that all people make him sick, but it's hypocritical to kill them, which prompts Holden to ponder his own troubled youth, and through simultaneous flashbacks, they have this incredible, insightful exchange of love, wisdom, etc. (This scene is ALL YOURS! Go to it; 600 words, max.)\\n\\nSuddenly, Christopher Walken, wearing a red hunting cap, leaps out of the elevator shaft, holding a nail-gun to Julia Roberts's head. He confesses that he started killing people shortly after the end of the first book, when Holden rejected him. (Remember?) Ever since, he's considered the world to be full of phony, hypocritical, impolite morons. Holden shouts, \\"Why kill the girl, Antolini, when it's ME you're after!\\" As Christopher Walken mumbles a response, Holden knocks the nail-gun out of his hand. They wrestle, and Holden throws Christopher Walken into the path of an oncoming school bus. He's dead -- or SO THEY THINK!\\n\\nIn fact, Christopher Walken clings to the bumper, smashes through the windshield, savagely kills the driver and takes control of the bus. Holden chases him on a motorcycle through the streets of New York, overturning cop cars and fruit carts. The bus crashes into a fast-food restaurant. (Endorsements?) They wrestle, and just as he's about to be strangled, Holden thrusts Christopher Walken's head into a bubbling french fryer. The red hunting cap floats to the surface.\\n\\nAs for that concluding scene where Holden returns to torch his old sanitarium, we keep it -- BUT, IT'S A DREAM!\\n\\nOr is it?\\n\\nOne last thought: What if we were to say Macaulay Caulkin would absolutely KILL THE POPE to play Holden Caulfield in a flashback sequence? Not that we care. But think about it. Caulkin? Caulfield? Is this fate or what?\\n\\nWe KNOW this can't miss! Then again, we're not married to it. If you've got a better idea, PITCH US! We can't wait to hear from you. But this time, could you try and get back to us sooner?

''One is the artful charmer, prone to the gossamer and the exquisite. . . . The other, darker and stronger, is the discoverer of death. . . . He now broods with the austerity of a Greek or an Elizabethan.'' Almost 40 years later, Capote's book is once again a best seller -- it's at No. 7 on the nonfiction paperback list, in a crisp edition tied into the new movie. (In 1966, the book was a hardcover best seller for more than eight months","excerpt":"it would later spend eight months on the paperback list.) Knickerbocker's review was accompanied by a rambling interview with the author, conducted by George Plimpton. Capote defended the ''nonfiction novel,'' telling Plimpton, ''It seems to me that most contemporary novelists, especially the Americans and the French, are too subjective, mesmerized by private demons; they're enraptured by their navels, and confined by a view that ends with their own toes.'' That sounds like the complaint Tom Wolfe would make two decades later about American fiction, writing in Harper's Magazine. But, interestingly, Capote was no fan of Wolfe's writing, at least not back in 1966. When Plimpton asked him what he thought of the New Journalism, which was then only nascent, Capote defended his turf: ''If you mean James Breslin and Tom Wolfe, and that crowd, they have nothing to do with creative journalism -- in the sense that I use the term -- because neither of them, nor any of that school of reporting, have the proper fictional technical equipment.''

When the Jesus Lizard, a quartet based in Chicago, performed on Saturday night at Irving Plaza, its singer, David Yow, dived into the audience repeatedly and sang entire songs while propped up on the arms and heads of his fans. Remarkably, Mr. Yow rarely missed more than a line or two of each song, even when he was accidentally dropped on the floor.   Mr. Yow didn't care much about sound quality when onstage either. He often cupped his hands around the microphone to muffle his voice and dropped the microphone on the ground with a thud. The music was much less freewheeling than Mr. Yow's antics. The Jesus Lizard plays hard, heavy rock in which the guitar, bass and drums are strictly syncopated, providing structure behind Mr. Yow's distorted lyrics about death and mayhem. The bassist, David Wm. Sims, is the lead instrumentalist, plucking his bass incessantly and melodically over the loud, precise drumming of Mac McNeilly and the low-pitched chiming of Duane Denison's guitar. The result is the muddy mixture of industrial music, Southern rock and heavy metal that the Jesus Lizard has been performing almost peerlessly for more than five years.

It also would provide millions in New York to com bat beach erosion on Coney Island and in Connecticut for flood control in the Mamaroneck and Sheldrake River Basins and the Byram River.

The tunnel vas under construction from 1970 until 1975, when the city s fiscal crisis forced a halt in work on it. A total of $350 million has been spent on the tunnel, which is to stretch someday for 12.7 miles from the Hillview Reservoir in Yonkers and supply all five boroughs. It has been dogged by delays and litigation, with six contractors suing the city last year for work that they said they had not been paid for. They sued for $100 million and settled for $18 million. The House of Representatives is to vote this week on the Rivers and Harbors Act, which also contains provision for a $25 million loan for the water tunnel.

It is concerned with a District Attorney who is placed in the position of having to prosecute his son as a reckless automobile driver. Mrs. Mannering, the young man's mother, is so eager to save her son from a long prison sentence (a young woman was killed in the car) that she willingly consents to compromise herself, so as to blast her husband's hopes of reelection. Mannering's rival, Jerome Wallace, promises that he will see that Bob Mannering goes free if he is elected District Attorney.This might be plausible if the compromising situation were not so utterly absurd, and from then on the picture goes from bad to worse. Mannering even suspects that his wife is infatuated with Wallace, when it is obvious that the poor woman is almost on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Furthermore it ceases to be entertainment at all when the director brings on a familiar forest fire, in which during certain scenes two women are depicted groping their way through the flames.\\"If the fire touches the power house the dam will go,\\" is a title which has an old-fashioned ring.

Byrd Democrat of West Virginia    Now Mr. President, a superpower has claws and it has teeth. The superpower, as against this third world power, doesn't have to be impatient or impetuous. A superpower doesn't have to feel rushed. We can afford to be patient and let sanctions work. They say the morale of our soldiers will suffer. Mr. President, we should have thought about this before we proceeded to double our forces and terminate the rotation policy in the Middle East. Nothing damages morale more than early large losses of life. . . .   Mr. President, the two economic giants of Germany and Japan have hardly spoken eloquently with their pocketbooks. They have only opted to hold our coats while we take on Hussein. Mr. President, I think this is a shame and a disgrace that Germany and Japan, two countries which will benefit far more than will the United States, two countries whose need for the oil of the Middle East far exceeds our need, will stand by and cynically watch American men and women shed their blood in the sands of the Arabian desert and refuse to help to finance in their treasury the costs of this effort.    I think, Mr. President, I have difficulty finding the words to express my feelings that other nations would stand by. It's a monstrous disgrace and the American people will remember it.  Representative Ted Weiss   Democrat of Manhattan     Speaker, when we take those 30 seconds to take the oath of office and we raise our right hands and we puff out our chests, that's not just a formula that we're going through. We swear to preserve and protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.    When we do that, we do it in the particular. And for the last 10 years at least, there has been such a tremendous erosion of our commitment to protecting and defending and preserving the Constitution.    And this institution has played a role in that. We've abdicated. When we think that it's O.K. to wage small wars ourselves, whether it's Grenada or Panama, without the prior approval of the Congress, it seems to me that we're eroding the Constitution.    And when we try to depend on international law, having set that kind of example, we erode the Constitution and our leadership role.    The Bennett-Durbin Resolution should be adopted, because it reasserts that which the founders of this nation intended -- that the people make that fateful decision. And it should be done at this time. It is being done","excerpt":"it wouldn't have been done if the Secretary of State or the President had been left to their own. This body made that happen. Let's adopt this resolution to make it absolutely clear.  Senator Bob Graham  Democrat of Florida       We make a basic mistake, I suggest, if we think that what we are dealing with is one man -- Saddam Hussein. I see Saddam Hussein not as the cause of those fundamental events, but rather as the guileful person who has taken advantage of those and other fundamental factors occurring in this region.   We also, drastically, have contributed to the past. We have accommodated Iraq over a period of more than a decade, accommodated in terms of covertly assisting them in the war with Iran, within the shadow of the invasion of Kuwait, continuing to extend substantial economic assistance to Iraq.   We also have contributed to the past by our failure to have a sustained commitment to a rational national energy policy, failure which has made us increasingly hostage to the circumstances in the Middle East and the personalities of today's and tomorrow's Saddam Husseins.   Looking to the future, I would suggest that as we attempt to assess how we should respond to the current crisis today, we should ask ourselves what do we want to have as some of the consequences not just of the next 10 or 60 days but over the next decade in this region and what do they say about U.S. policy around the world in this new post-cold-war era.   I am going to support the resolution which will give the President of the United States the authority to use force. I am going to do so because I believe that the President of the United States deserves to have a presumption of correctness of his actions, and that he especially deserves to have a presumption of correctness as it relates to matters of our national security and relations with other nations.   I am reluctant to draw universal conclusions from a short visit to the Middle East, but that reluctance will be overcome to this extent: that I came away with the sense that this was an an extremely complex fabric of interrelated and divergent issues, factors, personalities, history and culture that we were dealing with in this crisis. It is not just the simple issue of a large and powerful state invading, pillaging and occupying a weak neighbor. And that the institution of the Presidency was in the best position to integrate, evaluate, assess options and implications of those options, and reach a judgment which was in the national interest.   Representative Thomas S. Foley Democrat of Washington     I would not feel it right as a Speaker to stand behind the usual custom not to vote and not to speak on the question of this importance. I do not ask anyone to follow me but I do as you feel so often I think, the need to explain to my constituents, to those who have sent me here why I will cast a vote for Hamilton-Gephardt and against the Michel-Solarz amendment.   Those who believe that the President must now be armed with what is unquestionably . . . a virtual declaration of war, those who believe that that must be done, should not hesitate to vote that way, should not hesitate to give him that power.    But let me suggest to you one thing. Do not do it under the notion that you merely hand him another diplomatic tool, another quiver of economic leverage or international leverage.    The President has had no doubt about this. He has said again and again that if given that power he may well use it and perhaps sooner than we realize. If that is your judgment vote honorably and calmly and securely.    But if you feel that more can be done, if you feel that the sanctions have not yet wasted their opportunity, if you believe that Saddam Hussein is growing weaker everyday under their impression, if you believe the international coalition will hold, if you believe that this nation's leadership is best expressed in this body and in the other body and in the coalition of constitutional consent, then vote for Hamilton-Gephardt.    But however you vote, as the majority leader has said, let us come together after the vote with the notion that we are Americans here, not Democrats and not Republicans, all anxious to do the best for your country without recrimination as to motive, without anything but the solemn cry that on this great decision day we voted as our conscience and judgment told us we should. And then though our opinion may change over the years, we will not bear the burden of a harsh judgment on our honor and our actions at this moment.  Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato   Republican of New York -    Mr. President, Saddam Hussein is like a glutton, a geopolitical glutton. He's sitting down at the banquet table overflowing with goodies. And let me tell you, like every glutton, he's going to have them all. Kuwait is just the appetizer. He's gobbling it up. But it's not going to satisfy him. After a noisy belch or two, he's going to reach across the table for the next morsel. Now what's it going to be -- Saudi Arabia? Could be. The U.A.E? Who knows? I don't.    But I do know two things with absolute certainty: he's going to keep grabbing and gobbling, and the main course somewhere on that menu is the State of Israel. The Israelis know that and that's one big reason that Prime Minister Shamir within the past 48 hours has again stated his unequivocal support for President Bush's policy.    What's a little hard for me to understand is how some of Israel's strongest supporters in this body have joined into this chorus of \\"Let's give Saddam more time.\\" Saddam has already had too much time. And I'm not talking about just these past five months, Mr. President. I'm talking about the years and years in which we, the United States, ignored his brutality, condoned his repeated aggressions against both his neighbors and many of his own people, and actually subsidized him with American taxpayers' money. It's time, Mr. President, to blow the whistle on Saddam Hussein. It is time to let him know, this grisly glutton, that the free lunch is over. It's time for him to pay the bill.  Senator Charles S. Robb  Democrat of Virginia     We can and should take the President to task if we disagree with him on a whole variety of matters here at home -- from the budget to the rest of the domestic agenda.    But in the great issues of war and peace, I believe we ought to make every effort possible to speak with one voice, or at least with the strongest majority voice possible.    On balance, the majority of us would give the President very high marks for the way he has handled the gulf challenge to date. Yet now that we have reached the truly critical stage, I believe it would be a fundamental mistake to give even the appearance of withdrawing our trust and support.    There is no question that the risks are great. I don't want to minimize the potential consequences if we're wrong. We can't escape responsibility for the actions we are about to authorize, and we shouldn't. We are risking thousands of American lives, and that fact weighs on the conscience of every member here -- particularly on those who have known the unhumane brutality of combat firsthand. And maybe future Saddam Husseins will act rationally when they look back on how the free world responded to the first real challege to the concept of collective security in the post-cold-war era.   Let's give peace a chance by giving the President the authority he believes he needs to achieve it.    And if Saddam Hussein understands that we have not only the capability but the will to carry out such an attack if necessary, maybe he'll act rationally in the first instance and we'll be able to bring the troops home soon.   Representative Charles E. Bennett  Democrat of Florida     When I first came to Congress, I wore a ribbon, the Silver Star. I did it partly for apology for being crippled. I haven't been wearing it recently. I'm not quite sure why I'm not wearing it. But I do know this, that when I was given that, I was given that with a citation that said, \\"Gallantry in Action.\\" Friends, there's no such thing as gallantry in action.    I don't want to run down anybody else's award. But action -- military action -- is a horrible experience. There's no gallantry in it. There's no beauty in it. It's a horrible experience. It's up to us in Congress to bite the bullet ourselves and to do something about seeing to it that peace is secured, if it can be secured, for the benefit of everybody, and it can be done.    There are things that are unmentionable, things that can't be linked, for instance, that antagonizes a lot of people. But the world knows if this war ends the way it's now going, we're going to have a worse war in the future, a much worse war which may last for thousands of years.    So this question of settling the Palestine problem, protecting Israel in its boundary and things like that are things that can be met. That takes courage because it can defeat us to do anything about it. But that's why we were elected. We were elected to make this kind of decision. We weren't elected to stay here forever. We were not elected for our salaries. We were elected to take a responsible position of government when the opportunity came -- comes to take it, and that's what we're not doing it unless we pass some way to see to it this process of trying to find a solution to this, other than combat, takes place. That's our responsibility. That's the courage that we must show today, and this is the place it has to be. It's not in Saudi Arabia. It's here in Washington, D.C., in this chamber today.    I'm 80 years of age. I've been in this chamber for 43 years. Out of the 17,000 votes I've cast, the only one I really regret was the one which I cast for the Bay of Tonkin resolution. I particularly regret it because I knew that it was a declaration of war, and just as is the Solarz measure before us today, it's a declaration of war. And if you pass it, you make a compliance with the thing that I'm now asking you to vote for, which is to say you ought to decide ----    . . . it means that a vote ought to be cast on the basis of what you think is best for our country, not best for the Democratic or Republican Party, not best for the President, not best for you, but what's best for our country and what's best for the world.    So take that in your heart. Hold it close to you and realize this is a tremendously important opportunity you have here today, and cast your vote on that basis.   Representative Nancy Pelosi  Democrat of California     The King of Jordan last night on \\"Nightline\\" said that if we go to war, we could have an ecological disaster of the first order. Some of the consequences could be -- and this is according to the United Nations Environment Program -- oil spills equal to a dozen Exxon Valdez spills coursing through gulf waters; oil fires raging for weeks and perhaps months; smoke and debris blocking sunlight, causing temperatures to drop and altering crop seasons which could result in widespread famine; toxic plumes ascending to the upper atmosphere and falling as acid rain; millions of fish, dolphins, sea birds and other marine life wash onto Gulf shores; chemical contamination of air, water and vegetation; the Persian Gulf as a dead sea.    The point has already been made how important it is for us to have an energy policy to avoid such conflicts in the future. The point is already made how we have to have a better policy toward nuclear disarmament. I hope the point will be made that we take very seriously the environmental consequences of our actions.   Senator Robert J. Dole  Republican of Kansas     I think everyone would agree that sanctions without a credible military threat would never have any severe impact on Iraq or Saddam Hussein.   Now I've said to the President of the United States in a meeting with Republicans and Democrats that we need to pursue every avenue for a peaceful solution. I've said to the President of the United States, when I look into the eyes of a young man in the desert in Saudi Arabia I see his parents, maybe his children, his spouse. And if we talk about burden-sharing as we have in the dollar terms, wait until we start counting the deaths, how many Egypitans, how many Americans, how many Saudis, how many British. This is the real burden-sharing.    And I've implored the President, who also has been there in World War II, that what we are attempting to do in the Congress of the United States is to strengthen his hand for peace, not to give him the license to see how fast we can become engaged in armed conflict.    As far as this Senator knows, nothing in the United Nations resolution says that on the 15th you have to do something. But I think on the 15th, Saddam Hussein will understand that if he wants peace he can have it.    So Mr. President, I know that everyone in this chamber wants Saddam Hussein to get out of Kuwait, and some have additional demands they would make on Saddam Hussein. I believe that the resolution we're about to vote on does exactly the wrong thing. As I've indicated, it actually gives Saddam Hussein a holiday from the threat that we might use force. . . .    It would seem to me that the pending resolution wipes out this credible threat unless we're going to maintain 400,000 men there and all the military threat we have up until some day in the future, maybe this year or next year or the next year. And I've always thought that if he had sort of a holiday, as Saddam Hussein would have, that he probably wouldn't just take the holiday, he'd probably dig in deeper and make preparations so he can inflict even more casualties on the United States and on our young men and our young women and other forces from other allied nations in this period. So it's a two-edged sword.   So it seems to me we have to think about the ultimate result. Do we save lives by waiting six months or waiting a year? Or do we by our votes today indicate to Saddam Hussein that now it's up to you? . . .    So I would hope, Mr. President, that we're going to demonstrate today that the President of the United States is the Commander in Chief. The Congress of the United States certainly has a role to play. I said last November and December we ought to have been here debating then, when the policy was being formulated instead of coming in at the 11th hour after having been AWOL for three or four months and trying to change the direction of the policy President Bush has so patiently and successfully put together. This is not the United States versus Iraq. It's the entire international community with just a few exceptions versus Saddam Hussein and Iraq.  Representative Thomas M. Foglietta  Democrat of Pennsylvania     I sit on the Armed Services Committee and we have heard experts come in and talk to us about the number of casualties, the number of young American men and women who will come back to us in body bags. Those estimates have ranged from as low as a thousand on up to 40 or 50 thousand. I say to you that we should do all we can to seek peace, to prevent those body bags from coming back to this country. So far, we have negotiated. We had one meeting -- one meeting, which lasted for six hours, during which time our representatives, our Secretary of State, issued an ultimatum: either you do what we say or else.   Don't you believe that those 10 to 40 or 50 thousand young men and women deserve more? Deserve more time, more consideration and more negotiation? I do.   Senator Al Gore  Democrat of Tennessee     My decision today is the product of an intense, may I say excruciating, effort to find my way to a place as close to a sense of the ultimate truth in this matter as I am capable of getting.    I've struggled to confront this issue in its bare essence -- to separate what I think is fact, or at least highly probable, from what I think is false, or at least highly improbable -- to strike a balance and to take my stand.    We've all made that journey, regardless of where it has lead us. Each of us has stood here to describe it. And now it is my turn. I stood in a different place halfway through last year, when men and women from my home town in Carthage, Tenn., joined the units of many other towns across this country, leaving their loved ones, saying goodbye to husbands and wives and children and parents and preparing to become part of this army now massed in the desert of Saudi Arabia.    I felt, up until recently, especially after the hearings in which I played an active role, questioning, probing, searching for the truth, I felt that I would support a move to continue the sanctions and hold open the option of force at a later time. As I searched my heart on this issue over the last few days with special intensity after we all heard the Secretary of State enunciate the word regrettably in Geneva, I found myself feeling that if I voted for the Mitchell nonresolution I would do so hoping that it did not prevail. I found myself feeling even late last night that since it now appears that there is a majority in favor of the other point of view that it would pass and will pass regardless of how I vote.    I found myself pulled once again to support the Mitchell nonresolution, speaking only of the process I've gone through.    And, Mr. President, I feel that I owe it to those who are there prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice, to give the best judgment of my head and my heart on what this nation should now do. I cannot reconcile myself to a point of view and a vote that says in effect, we will let this deadline come and go and try the sanctions perhaps until the next window, next August when military operations would again become feasible.  Representative Bud Shuster  Republican of Pennsylvania     Mr. Speaker, we're asked, what's the hurry? Well, after five months of rebuffed diplomacy, every day that this Congress procrastinates Saddam's factories are producing more chemical and biological weapons; more anthrax, more botulism, more sarin, which is a lethal nerve gas, and yes, more progress on nuclear weapons.    And make no mistake about it, my colleagues, if we must resort to military force, those factories of death and destruction and terrorism will surely be targets.    So today, not next week, not next month, but today, we must give the President the authority to remove this scourge or the face of history will pass judgment upon us as the Congress that failed to do its duty.

Garden and Home"},{"year":"1928","title":"This picture makes no pretentions of doing anything save tell a pretty little story, consequently it succeeds quite admirably. There are holes every here and now, and there are occasional canyons—yet the entity is rather on the side of entertaining.Mr. Walker is a black-face comedian, the idol of thousands, the toast of the town, the pet, the matinee idol. He goes one day to the country and while his automobile is being repaired seeks a job as extra man with the Bolivar Players. There he meets the girl, and there the audience is treated to a show in its unintentional sublimity not unlike the brief play of \\"Priamus and Thisbe\\" with Bottom and his friends.But things change, for the matinee idol's own producer is in the audience and he invites the players to enter the coming idyllic review. They accept and on opening night we see Mr. Walker both as the revue's star and as the comic extra man of the trupers. But, of course, what old Colonel Jasper Bolivar thinks is high tragedy is to hardened Broadway the funniest thing on earth. There are tears and recriminations and Cinderella goes away. It all turns out all right, however, with the matinee idol once more becoming the extra man.It is a gleeful little story, parts of it very well done, parts not quite so high. The original performance of the trouper's play, near the beginning of the picture, could almost be classed as excellent","excerpt":"it, however, takes a drop when Broadway is reached.Bessie Love as Ginger Bolivar, the star of the players, is quite good, giving a natural performance at all times. Her extra man—and matinee idol—Mr. Walker, backs her up without seeming to care whether he is in the center of the stage or not.

It it still there. Yesterday afternoon the most recent effort on the part of those who were responsible for it came into the Little Carnegie Playhouse. Like the other, \\"Die Lustigen Weiber von Wien\\" is an operetta","excerpt":"it, too, is extremely well done.Comparisons are unfortunate things, but sometimes they are relevant. \\"The Merry Wives of Vienna\\"—which is its English title—seems to be equal or superior to \\"Two Hearts\\" not only in the buoyancy of the act-ting, and the comedy, but in the music. In the first picture there was the excellent song taken from the title; in the second there is one which forms a theme throughout its length. Photographically, \\"The Merry Wives\\" seems clearer and more realistic.The story is of Vienna in 1875 and concerns more or less directly Commissioner Leitner and his ten daughters and their dancing teacher. The father announces that he plans to marry an old music hall star, so the girls leave home. The fact that they appear at the teacher's hotel and announce that they will take up residence with him spoils a romance elsewhere but adds to the comedy. The daughters then form a ballet and appear in a variety hall.The Commissioner, meanwhile, feeling himself disgraced, tries to resign, but the Minister thinks he is just inviting him to a party at the music hall. They go to the performance and later the dancing master conceives the idea of palming off the Commissioner's fiancée on the Minister. And presently the ten girls return home, and the master is able to return to his interrupted personal affairs.The cast is suitable to the spirit and aims of the picture, with Willy Forst taking the part of the dancing master and Lee Parry that of his coffee shop sweetheart. Geza von Bolvary, the director, has spared no pains in bringing out minor characters so that each takes its place in the whole. The scenes have been arranged just as deftly, and they are in keeping with the characters and the idea.As in \\"Two Hearts,\\" Robert Stolz composed the music and Walter Reich wrote the scenario.

Yet, while Hungary has more than enough to eat, near-catastrophic food shortages in Poland helped bring on last week's military takeover. The difference can be traced to Government policies. Polish agriculture collapsed because of official mismanagement and ideological suspicion of three million Polish private farmers. Reacting to official discrimination, shortages of fertilizer and machinery, and unrealistic prices, farmers have reduced production and withheld food.   If Poland, which once produced food surpluses, is to feed itself again, it should look closely at Hungary, whose farmers manage to satisfy professed Communist principles while allowing for the profit motive.

Its five movements, each inspired by a character or situation in the Superman comics, have more the character of a suite of scherzos or lively overtures, or what are now called concert openers. Yet an American composer trying to make his living at orchestral music is hard pressed to write anything but concert openers, so the symphony's somewhat ad hoc character might be overlooked.   The more pressing issue is whether Mr. Daugherty has come up with a style befitting the sexiness of his subject. Although he produces a distinctive texture -- thudding ostinatos, quick-cut jumps and shifts, swirling glissandos, sirens and rimshots and the like -- his harmonies are curiously static, his rhythms more often insistent than incisive.

Sound Directions       Four years ago, the hip-hop producer Madlib built his own jazz sandbox: a half-instrumental, half-sampled project he called Yesterday's New Quintet that played an exaggeratedly spaced-out version of early 70's jazz funk. He played all the parts himself, laying down organ, bass and drum tracks, and the results were merely O.K. But now that he has hired actual studio musicians on horns and guitar -- and, occasionally, a much better drummer than himself, Malcolm Catto -- and renamed the band Sound Directions, things are looking up. The new album ''Funky Side of Life'' (Stones Throw) has dense, delirious grooves, perhaps despite the fact that it's also serious record-junkie stuff: the song credits include the great bebop trombonist J. J. Johnson (though ''Harlem Clavinet'' was written for the 1972 film ''Across 110th Street,'' in his later, soundtrack-composer phase) and the arranger-producer David Axelrod, one of the suede-covered geniuses of the Los Angeles studio scene in the early 70's.

Nação Zumbi       This great Brazilian rock band has never yielded particularly good songwriting, and it doesn't have a first-class singer, but that's beside the point: it's more interested in conjuring a heavy, satisfying sound. The recipe is very special: trap drums, shakers and interlocking rhythms from the big bass drums of maracatu, one of the old traditional rhythms of northeastern Brazil -- paired with ironclad guitar riffs. With the singer Jorge du Peixe intoning his chants on top, the band plugs into the atmosphere of a song and lets it rip. On ''Futura,'' Nação Zumbi's fourth album, the band has realized its sound with the help of the American producer Scotty Hard, who makes the drums big and crisp and central. And they hit a few new sweet spots, branching out into jams that could be described as electronic surf-metal, dub reggae for capoeira and psychedelic Bo Diddley samba.    Gianmaria Testa       A wheezy-voiced Italian folk-pop singer, Mr. Testa put out the album ''Extra-Muros'' in Europe in 1996; it is just now having its first American release (Le Chant du Monde).

Mr. Testa's songs don't have the burned-out piquancy of Mr. Conte's, but the music is sturdier and more earthbound, including the thick tone of the bassist François Moutain -- more suited to the jazz club of today, versus Mr. Conte's evocation of the vague past.

The unseen component is an elastic chest belt containing two electrodes and a transmitter, which detects the heart's electrical signals and relays the data to a receiver housed within the watch. A digital readout of beats per minute is displayed instantaneously. This high-tech toy will be the status symbol for runners at today's New York Marathon.\\nWHY DO I NEED A $400 SWATCH? So you can have the most efficient workout in the shortest amount of time. The prevailing wisdom has been that the ideal workout is a 20-minute regimen of aerobic exercise at 70 percent of your maximum heart rate (the maximum is determined by subtracting your age from 220). This regimen has since been debunked by the sports science community. Research now indicates that to achieve optimum fitness an individual should exercise in short, intense intervals (followed by a recovery period), maintaining a heart rate of 85 percent. Only a heart-rate monitor can give an accurate reading (to within one beat per minute).\\nB.P. (BEFORE POLAR): In the mid-1970's, East Germany outfitted its cycling team with the first wireless heart-rate monitors. Transmitter belts were sewn into the athletes' jerseys. The belt used a radio antenna to transmit a signal to a receiver in a van following the cyclists. Coaches would listen to the heart rate through earphones, count the beats and plot the data on graph paper. By 1982, Dr. Seppo Saynajakangas, a professor of electronics at Oulu University in Finland, revolutionized sports training when he introduced the first generation of Polar heart-rate monitors. The monitors, manufactured by Polar CIC Inc. of Port Washington, L.I., are now available through most serious sports stores, including Paragon's, which sells the Polar Vantage XL for $389.\\nWHAT, NO MOON PHASE? The Polar XL is more than a heart-rate monitor","excerpt":"it's a computer. In addition to providing heart-rate figures, it performs all chronograph functions and sounds alarms to let the wearer know when the heart rate creeps below or above a target zone. The XL also stores up to eight separate workouts. With the appropriate software, these data can be downloaded to a computer, where performance can be graphically displayed and evaluated.\\nPOLAROBICS: Anyone attending Heart Attack, a class at Crunch Fitness (54 East 13th Street, at Broadway), not only straps on a Polar heart-rate monitor, but also gets to sweat with Jim Wharton, one of the country's premiere exercise physiologists. Mr. Wharton has personally trained 33 Olympic athletes, 11 of whom went on to win medals. \\"What people have to understand is that a heart-rate monitor is not just another exercise gimmick,\\" Mr. Wharton said. \\"This is the way world-class athletes have been training for the past decade.\\"\\nHEART THROBS: High-profile celebrities and athletes who train with Polar monitors include Tom Hanks, Joe Montana, Sylvester Stallone, Pete Sampras, Cher, Dan Jansen and John Travolta. Polar heart-rate monitors are also used by the Pritikin Center in Santa Monica, Calif.; Duke University; Stanford University; the United States Army and Air Force; NASA, and health spas around the world.\\nBETTER THAN A ROLEX: Mentally Tough, a training program that is designed to teach corporate competitors how to cope with stress, encourages executives to check their pulse frequently and recommends lowering heart rates through relaxation exercises. This crude form of biofeedback could be greatly enhanced by wearing a heart-rate monitor Example: When news of a hostile takeover breaks and your Polar reads 250 beats a minute, take several deep breaths and recite some W.

When the star, who opened a six-performance engagement at Madison Square Garden on Thursday, shakes his fist at the sky, the earth rumbles and laser beams split the heavens. As he strode around a revolving stage at the center of the Garden on opening night, the scowling, gray-haired star suggested a pop music Zeus, a middle-aged gladiator and a tent evangelist rolled into one.    The singer's craggy bass-baritone has always been one of pop's more rugged voices and, now that he is 51 years old, that voice has deepened into a growl that shades into a thundering roar. Not a word issues from Mr. Diamond's mouth onstage that isn't weighted with an oratorical self-importance. That bombast is thumpingly underscored by his longtime band, whose thickly textured guitar and synthesizer arrangements propel a \\"Star Wars\\" grandiosity with a driving pulse that inflates clumping folk-dance rhythms with arena-rock pretensions.
