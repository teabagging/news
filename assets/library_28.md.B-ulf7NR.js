By intervening in the Northwest dispute, which he pledged to do last month, Mr. Bush becomes only the second president to order workers at a major airline to stay on the job since 1966. [Page A1.]    A federal bankruptcy judge criticized a bid by Carl C. Icahn for the assets of Trans World Airlines, and suggested a proposal by American Airlines was the only valid offer. [C3.]    Utility Merger Talks End Abruptly  Merger talks broke down between the Public Service Enterprise Group, which operates New Jersey's largest energy concern, and Cinergy, a Midwest energy utility, executives close to the negotiations said. While the talks could still be revived, they said it was unlikely. Shares of PSEG fell 84 cents, to $41.61, while Cinergy dropped 67 cents, to $34.48. [C14.]    Copyrighted Song List to Napster  In compliance with a court order intended to curb the exchange of copyrighted music on Napster, the major record labels said they planned to deliver a list of 135,000 songs -- music that Napster will have three business days to prevent users from trading. The delivery starts the clock ticking on a process that could gut the amount and types of music Napster users have been able to exchange online. [C14.]    Possible Changes to Tax-Cut Plan  As the tax fight shifts to the Senate, Republicans who have consulted with the White House said the administration had identified two areas of possible compromise in the overall $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan: reducing the amount by which the top income tax rate would drop, and scaling back rather than repealing the estate tax. Those changes could whittle down the dollar figure by several hundred billion dollars. The savings could be used to make the plan smaller, or to add provisions that might attract support from moderates. [A1.]    Ernst & Young Loses Court Ruling  Ernst & Young, the accounting firm whose auditors the government contends failed to uncover a fraud at Cendant, lost an early court battle. A federal judge granted a motion filed by prosecutors to bar depositions by more than 40 potential witnesses in the trial of Walter A. Forbes, above, and E. Kirk Shelton, formerly the chairman and vice chairman of Cendant, who are charged with financial fraud. Ernst & Young asked the judge to either allow depositions by those witnesses or to delay all depositions. The judge refused. [C3.]    The Africa Problem for Drug Makers  This week, the unthinkable happened in Africa: the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies were forced into a painful negotiation over patent rights and the price of AIDS medicines. Suddenly, the question is no longer whether Africans will get life-saving drug cocktails, but how. That question lacks a simple answer","excerpt":"merely cutting prices will not automatically get drugs to patients.

They are likely to run into resistance.

If those banks had been part of a larger company, the losses from a local economic downturn could have been absorbed by other parts of the company, and the damage to the banking system would have been much less.

Among the presentations on the varied program were two French films, one a curious, fanciful affair, known in the land of its origin as \\"Paris Endormis,\\" and the other was a magnificent study in child psychology called \\"Faces of Children.\\" Besides these pictures there was exhibited also a film without pictures, a bright idea perpetrated by Thomas J. Geraghty, a scenario writer","excerpt":"Merle Johnson's production. \\"Knee-Deep in Love,\\" a film in which the faces of the protagonists do not appear, and an old D. W. Griffith photodrama entitled \\"A Feud in Kentucky Hills,\\" wherein Mary Pickford figured as the heroine.The principal offering was Jacques Feyder's \\"Faces of Children,\\" a pathetic story woven around the marriage of a widower, who has two children—a boy of 9 and a girl of 4—and a widow, who has a little girl, 8 years old. Jean, the boy, worships the memory of his dead mother, and he can't reconcile himself to the new scheme of things. He resents his step-mother's daughter using his playthings and as time goes on, the bickering between the two older children soon causes Jean to become so bitter that he hates his step-mother's daughter. His belligerent little soul fights against the intruders into his father's household, and he persists in calling his step-mother, \\"Madame.\\" The girl finds herself tormented by Jean, and although she naturally resents his treatment of her, she appears to forgive and forget.During the winter while they are in a sled, Jean, ever on the alert to hurt the girl's feelings, tosses her doll out of the vehicle. He goes even further, for that evening when the child is weeping because of the loss of her doll, Jean tells her that it dropped out not so far away. The girl thereupon creeps out of the house and while trudging over the snow-covered mountain paths she is forced, utterly exhausted, to take refuge from an avalanche in a shrine chapel. She is rescued eventually after her mother has suffered hours of anguish.Even this terrifying experience fails to wring any affection out of the boy, and it is only after his step-mother has exhibited marvelous courage that little Jean is finally impelled to call her \\"Mama.\\"The acting of the three children is nothing short of Marvelous, for, when one anticipates a conventional expression, one beholds something different and thoroughly suited to the situation. The boy narrows his eyes in a childish way. He lies in deep thought over his cruel plot, and after a while he betrays nervousness. He is a good-looking boy with fine, clear eyes, and his face lights up when he gazes upon the picture of his own mother. The girl is wistful and sweet. She shows temper, but it soon fades away. She is a little Trojan, despite the fact that she does not curry favor with Jean. She is willing to enjoy the new domestic arrangement and also the companionship of her stepfather's little son and young daughter.In the cutting of this production for exhibition there are some jerky places, and in one chapter one is suddenly taken from Winter to a full-blown Summer, while a caption describes merely the passing of a night. These shortcomings can easily be remedied, and the screen will be richer by having this remarkable picture. Incidentally the exterior scenes for this film were made in the Vosges Mountains.\\"Paris Endormis\\" or \\"Paris Asleep,\\" is concerned with a scientist's invention of rays that not only inflict slumber on the whole population but leave its victims in the posture they held when attacked. Eight persons, including the scientist and his niece, escape the rays. One of them is a night watchman on a high platform of the Eiffel Tower; another is a crook, and then there are a detective, an aviator, a financier and a wealthy travelling woman. The idea is very original. There are touches of genuine humor throughout this eccentric piece of work, especially when the old scientist fathoms the formula for waking up the city.

Whatever may be the final opinion of this mile or so of merry tomfoolery, it should be set forth that not a few of its hectic adventures were greeted with shrieks of laughter from an audience yesterday afternoon. Hence, whether it strikes one as an exciting dream bordering on a nightmare, or whether it seems more or less polished slapstick, it is an offering with a certain entertainment value.The joking is often silly, but at times it is quite funny. George Marion Jr., the punning subtitle writer, and Percy Heath are responsible for the story, or what might be referred to as one. It is a production with occasional songs, which cause the affair as a whole to remind one of a musical comedy with some real land and water, a real sky, a real ship or two and a studio island that in the end is supposed to be submerged during an earthquake.One of the laughable incidents is where the boomeranging of one hat ends in the hats of most of a steamship's passengers and also that of the Captain being tossed overboard. Mr. Oakie as Voltaire McGinnis, an inexpert chauffeur who has been promoted from the stoke-hold to deck steward, realizes the grave error of throwing the Captain's cap overboard. He therefore looks up in the crow's nest, or where it might be, and shouts:\\"Say driver, you had better put on the brakes. The Captain has lost his cap.\\"There is a shipwreck, with a giddy time aboard two rafts that eventually find the shores of an island in the South Seas, a place ruled by Jerry, a Brooklyn-born individual, who wears a crown of native pearls. His subjects are all girls who astonish the survivors of the rafts by answering in fluent English, with a suggestion of the Kings County dialect, presumed to have been acquired through conversing with King Jerry.In the early stages of this utterly irrational work, the furniture movers succeed in smashing several vases, other objects of art, tables and chairs. Eugene Pallette, the slow-witted sleuth of the Van Dine murder films, does most of the damage and one can't say that there is much in the way of suspense, for Mr. Pallette invariably lets the audience know what is going to happen. This same criticism applies to other parts of the picture, but breaking chinaware and furniture is something spectators cannot witness without roaring with laughter, so long as it does not happen in their own homes.Several of the players, including Miss MacDonald and Mr. Oakie, have an opportunity to ease their feelings in song. Miss MacDonald gives as pleasing a performance as is possible in such a mélange. Mr. Oakie, William Austin, James Hall, Kay Francis and others add to the wild gayety.

Cline, Egbert is hired as a movie director and as a bank detective and taken hostage; he also encourages his future son-in-law (''Og Oggilby.

And the 1986 season there, opening today, offers two basic themes - both, let it be said at the outset, subject to wide interpretation. There is the Orient, notably in the form of clean kimono shapes by Gianfranco Ferre and translations of handmade Japanese papers into exquisite silks and linens by Gianni Versace. Then there is something that might be loosely gathered under the heading ''safari cum military'' - jackets that includes a subtle cut by Giorgio Armani, a skirted look by Laura Biagiotti and the complicated patterning of a Complice outfit by Claude Montana that manages a camouflaged look via a photojournalistic collage. Throughout, there is also a renewed emphasis on legs through above-the-knee skirts, Bermuda shorts and pants that fit second-skin tight. Shoulders, though still emphasized, are evoluting. Designers have been walking about with clouds of shoulder pads - sticking them into jackets, pulling them out, snipping at them with scissors or, even, tossing them away. ''Shoulders still have to be important,'' as Armani put it, ''but somehow smaller.'' For sheer luxury, there are light, beaded jumpsuits by Versace, adorned with variations on the Japanese symbol for happiness. Ferre drops his restructured kimonos over what he calls his ''energy dress'' - a tank-topped slink of black leather pulled even tighter with a suede obi. At Krizia, Mariuccia Mandelli has paired down her signature big-shoulder shapes and shortened her skirts. ''The mood perhaps is military - but by that I mean the rigorousness and cleanness of uniforms emphasized with touches of white,'' she says.

Commissioned by the orchestra to celebrate its 150th anniversary, and completed just a few months before Messiaen's death last spring, the work, \\"Illuminations of the Beyond,\\" seems meant as a sort of summation of the composer's career. It marks the end of a lifetime of composition in which the artifice of human music was used to point to something beyond artifice, to evoke something beyond earthly experience.
