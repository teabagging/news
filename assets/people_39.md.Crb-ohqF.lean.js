There is more science than mystery in this cops-versus-killer number, but it is an adventure which, despite a low budget, is not low in taste or its attention to technical detail, backgrounds and plausibility.Speed and melodramatic pyrotechnics are not its attributes. As has been noted, its \\"hero\\" is as much the Department of Legal Medicine of Harvard's Medical School as the Branstable, Mass., detective who tracks down the slayer. That dastard is known almost from the start. He is a Cape Cod blue blood who has eliminated a blonde lady of the night who threatened to expose his indiscretion. But the police only have her skeleton to work with. And, with the aid of Harvard's medicos, this flimsy evidence is built up to a case against the unknown, philandering murderer and acquittal of an innocent Bostonian held for the crime.Ricardo Montalban is natural and unassuming as the plodding sleuth who proves that the policeman's lot is not an easy one. And his observation that \\"professors work with their heads and cops with their feet\\" is amply portrayed by Bruce Bennett as the chief medical researcher. Marshall Thompson, as the wrongly accused suspect","excerpt":"Sally Forrest, as the wife; Edmon Ryan, as the murderer; Jan Sterling as the brassy charmer who is the cause of all the investigation, and, especially, Elsa Lanchester, who is top notch as a gin-bibbing, blackmailing landlady, give the principals solid support. \\"Mystery Street\\" may be short on suspense, but it is strong on authenticity.

A Duke University surgeon and urologist who combined a career as a leading medical scientist and physician with a passion for the arts and charitable causes, died at his Durham, NC home on April 21, 2005. He was 94. Semans was a pioneer in rehabilitative and urinary surgery who during World War II developed an operation to relieve retained urine due to spinal cord injury. At that time, renal failure was the primary cause of an early death in paralyzed veterans. In addition to his leadership as a medical scholar, Semans, along with his wife of 52 years, Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans, was involved in numerous arts and charitable causes. Semans helped lead the establishment of the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem in the 1960s and served as chairman of the school's board of trustees for the first 17 years. He also served for 48 years on The Mary Duke Biddle Foundation and was chair until his retirement in 2004. The Mary Duke Biddle Foundation funds charitable activities at Duke and other institutions in North Carolina and New York. As leader of the Biddle Foundation, he was asked to assist with the development of arts education and performing components at Duke, and was instrumental in the establishment of the Ciompi Quartet and the Institute of the Arts. Semans served on dozens of nonprofit boards of directors. He was president of the North Carolina Society for Crippled Children and Adults and vice president of the National Paraplegia Foundation and served on the Governor's Committee for Employment of the Handicapped. He was also an active leader in many arts, educational and cultural institutions and organizations. As a member of the North Carolina State Arts Council, Semans suggested establishing an emerging artists program that today provides programs in communities across North Carolina. For years he served on the Advisory Board of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, and on the Advisory Council of the School of American Ballet. Born in 1910 in Uniontown, PA --the youngest of seven boys and one girl --Semans received his bachelor's degree in 1932 from Princeton University. He earned his medical degree in 1936 from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and where he remained on staff as a urologist. During World War II, he served for two-and-a-half years as a major in the Army's medical corps and cared for hundreds of injured soldiers. It was during this time that he developed a deep interest in people with disabilities, a population for whom he was an advocate all of his life. After the war, he entered private practice for six years in Atlanta before joining the Duke medical staff as a surgeon and associate professor of urology. He was promoted to professor of urology in 1961. In 1953, Semans married Mary Duke Biddle Trent, the great-granddaughter of Washington Duke, in whose honor Duke University was named. Together they focused their energies on charitable work, especially involving the arts. At Duke the Semanses and the late Dr. Wayne Rundles established a premiere hospital arts program --now known as The Health Arts Network --at Duke Medical Center. Semans was an advocate for Duke establishing a world - class university museum and was instrumental in the development of the new $23 million Nasher Museum of Art, which is scheduled to open at Duke in the fall. In 1997, the Semanses were awarded the North Carolina Philanthropy Award. In recognition of their leadership in human relations, the Semanses received the first Humanitarian Freedom Award given by the Durham chapter of Hadassah in 1960. Nine years later, they received the National Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews for distinguished service in human relations. Semans also was honored by the North Carolina School of the Arts, Duke University, Duke University Hospital and the North Carolina Association of Arts Councils, among others. In addition to his wife, Semans is survived by seven children: Mary Trent Jones of Abingdon, VA","excerpt":"Sally Trent Harris of Charlotte, NC; Dr. Rebecca Trent Kirkland of Houston; Barbara Trent Kimbrell of Sullivan's Island, SC; Jenny Semans Koortbojian of Durham; James Duke Biddle Trent Semans of Chapel Hill and Beth Semans Hubbard of Los Angeles; 16 grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren.

The investors won an important victory in September when the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled the deal would have to be approved by 80 percent of Zapata's shareholders, rather than a standard majority. Mr. Glazer owns a 73 percent stake in Houlihan's and would have received $29 million in cash from the purchase.   (AP)    KMART TO MERGE MANY CANADIAN BUSINESS FUNCTIONS  The Kmart Corporation said yesterday that it would merge many of its Kmart Canada business functions into its United States operations. The move, which the giant retailer said was intended to maximize efficiencies, will result in 150 job cuts at the unit's head office in Brampton, Ontario, by the end of the year. Approximately 200 positions will remain in Canada and a number of new positions will be created in Troy, Mich., where Kmart is based, the company said. It was not specific about the number of new United States jobs.   (Reuters)    SBS TECHNOLOGIES TO ACQUIRE BIT 3 COMPUTER  SBS Technologies Inc. agreed yesterday to buy the Bit 3 Computer Corporation, a privately held maker of computer networking products, for $24 million. SBS Technologies, a maker of electronic and computer products based in Albuquerque, N.M., said the purchase was contingent on an offering of its common stock, set to close Dec. 20. Bit 3 Computer had 1995 income of about $4.7 million before taxes on sales of about $12.5 million. SBS Technologies said costs associated with the purchase will reduce earnings in its second quarter ending Dec. 31 by $11 million, resulting in a loss for the quarter. In last year's second quarter, the company earned $776,000.   (Dow Jones)    POLISH AIRLINE BUYS TWO NEW BOEING AIRCRAFT  Poland's national airline LOT signed an agreement yesterday to acquire two new-generation planes from the Boeing Company in 1998 in a deal worth $90 million. LOT and Boeing also hope to complete negotiations later this year on the purchase and delivery of eight more Boeing 737-800's until the year 2002, under a long-term contract worth $360 million, officials said. The 737-800 model is Boeing's new jetliner with 162 to 189 seats, which will become available in 1998.

Some of the sounds were mighty sweet, some a trifle puzzled, even a bit alarmed. The kids had come to see \\"Perri.\\"Felix Salten's magical children's tale of the bouncy, wistful lady squirrel who learned the meaning of life, love and death among the creatures of Wildwood Heart is a natural, of course, for Walt Disney. With the enchanting animation of the same author's \\"Bambi\\" already a classic, in recent years the expansive film master has been producing animal-life documentaries, called True-Life Adventures, with results ranging from pretty good to superlative.The new picture, most aptly labeled Disney's \\"first True-Life Fantasy,\\" shapes documentary footage to reprise the original story. As the bushy-tailed little heroine herself might acknowledge, this is a tough nut to crack.Technically, in the stunning color photography and in the extremely adroit easing of actual incidents into the story flow, the result is admirable. The alert camera men, who must have toiled like feather-footed Trojans, have captured some beautifully-foliaged close-ups and suitable vignettes of forest creatures in repose, on the prowl and, most forcibly, in intramural warfare.It could well be that today's tykes are a good deal sturdier-minded than one aging Salten fan, who holds out, in this case, for the imaginative nuances of Disney's animators instead. Especially with a rather superfluous narrator familiarly explaining that the \\"winds of late autumn, as though jealous of the lovely leaves, rip through Wildwood Heart and tear them in a golden fury from the trees.\\"Finally, much of the footage simply rambles. One dream sequence, played against a snowy backdrop, is pure synthetic bunk. And the obvious man-made, studio aspects of the climactic forest fire, with the little animals scrambling in terror, made at least one petite balcony blonde (a neighbor) scowl like a Fury. Mr. Disney has spunkily assembled an educational film, to say the least. But it remains a far cry from a lovely and loving little sermon, set in a stern but unforgettable Never-Never Land.

Yet the celebrities don’t make the perfumes; professional perfumers do. Celebrity inexorably lends an aura of artificiality, and not just to the celebrity scent; it extends to us as well. We are, at best, torn.The fact of the matter is that some celebrity perfumes are just as good as those from fashion designers. Others are better. We often forget that a designer’s name on a scent is no more logical than that of a 20-year-old singer/actress. Before Gabrielle Chanel claimed perfume for fashion designers in 1921, it had been the exclusive territory of perfumers (see: Guerlain, Daltroff, Coty). If fragrance is now to be given to Hilary Duff — whose Wikipedia entry includes the music genre “bubblegum pop” — and her colleagues, so be it.

In creating ''Saturday Night Live'' for NBC, Mr. Michaels was primarily interested in writers - veterans such as Herb Sargent, brash new arrivals such as the National Lampoon's Michael O'Donoghue, and all sorts of aspiring youngsters. He wanted to give them as long a creative leash as possible and, with the nervous but steady support of NBC executives, he quickly began to succeed.   The comedy series was uneven, as it would continue to be to greater or lesser degrees, but the offbeat and frequently outrageous sketches began clicking with an influential audience, precisely the kind the network was eager to court: young, relatively affluent individuals who rarely watch television. Gradually, the talented cast began establishing distinct and marketable personalities: Chevy Chase, Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd and Bill Murray.

Made between 1960 and 1964, these often dazzling canvases release huge transparent spheres or embryo-like clusters of blue on stark white grounds. They show a young artist at the height of his powers, mark a turning point in American painting with unusual complexity, and in both ways may unsettle prevailing opinion about their creator's achievement.    Mr. Francis, who is 68 years old and lives in California, has a career that spans 40 years and several continents and is shaky in reputation. Ever since the 50's, when he lived and worked primarily in Paris, his art has been held in higher regard in Japan and Europe than in the United States. In New York especially, Mr. Francis's meteoric ascent -- which began in Paris in the early 50's -- is widely thought to have been followed by a steady decline. His reputation rests primarily on his shimmering crepuscular monochromes from the mid 50's, in which rounded repeating brushstrokes create a multi-celled or honeycombed surface while also resembling a Mark Rothko color cloud in the process of disintegration.

In a fairly consistent light comedy manner, with a satiric inclination, the story proceeds with the rivalry of two women seeking one man, and the deliberately womanly woman—that is, she of the emphasized feminine charms—wins, leaving the girl who can snoot and fish and ride to bear her defeat as best she can in her woolen stockings and flannel shirt.To the extent that this photoplay is lightly satiric it is highly enjoyable. Whenever it skates dexterously between gay comedy and foolish farce it is unusually diverting. And it is pleasant to report that for a good deal of its length it is thus entertaining. Occasionally it verges on taking itself seriously—every now and then it sags beneath the weight of too much film, and at such times it grows tiresome, but it soon picks up again after each slump and goes on as merrily as ever.As a matter of fact, the picture's chief trouble seems to be due almost entirely to excess footage. Lorna Moon, the scenarist, provided a good idea for the story","excerpt":"Sam Wood, the director, had the wit to see the point of it and the skill to give it sympathetic cinematographic treatment, and the players in the cast were able to suit themselves to the mood and manner of the story—all for a limited period. But the limit was too far from the starting mark. The photoplay had to go five or six reels to meet stupid trade requirements, and neither the idea nor the people working with it could keep going that long; hence padding and ??? stretches, but not enough to bury the bright scenes, so there's much to be enjoyed in the production as it stands.It is especially good to see Wallace Reid get back to farcing. He always seems self-conscious and soon grows monotonous as a romantic or melodramatic hero, but as a farceur he is delightful. And he is agreeably aided and abetted by Gloria Swanson and Elliott Dexter in \\"Don't Tell Everything.\\"But, why that title? They work it into a caption, it is true, but it really has nothing to do with the story and gives a decidedly wrong impression about it. It may have a certain box-office value, but won't the people who buy tickets expecting that kind of a photoplay he disappointed, or disturbed, when they find something entirely different?The second of the Triart productions based on famous paintings is also at the Rivoli this week, Josef Israels's \\"The Bashful Suitor\\" being the subject this time. There has been some disagreement about these pictures, arising, it seems, from differences of opinion about the point of view from which they should be considered. It has been complained, for instance, that \\"The Reggar Maid,\\" the first of the series, does not give an accurate idea of Burne-Jones or his work, and the same charge may be brought against \\"The Bashful Suitor.\\" And it must be confessed that in claiming relationship with paintings, the series exposes itself to this criticism. On the other hand, any one is free to take these motion picture productions as motion picture productions, regardless of their origin or the motives of their producers, and it is only as such, surely, that they have, or lack, significance for the screen.What, then, is the screen value of \\"The Bashful Suitor\\"? What place does it hold as a motion picture, and nothing else?Well, first of all, it is a finished piece of photography. The pictures by Herbert Blache and Lejaren a Hiller make the eyes feel good, and this is something that every screen production should do Photography, which includes composition, lighting, toning and everything that goes into the creation of a visually pleasing picture, is an essential of cinematography, so, by its photographic excellence, \\"The Bashful Suitor\\" achieves high rank as a motion picture. But there should also be a dramatic, or a lyric, quality to any screen production that professes to tell a story, and this quality is derived not only from the story told, but from its treatment. In other words, the story must be essentially dramatic, or lyric, and the pictures in which it is told must be cinematographic as well as photographic; that is, expressive as well as beautiful. And the fault with \\"The Bashful Suitor,\\" as with \\"The Beggar Maid,\\" is that its story is too self-consciously sentimental, which is to say, undramatic, and its pictures are often just pictures, without any particular meaning, without the cinematographic vitality they should have as works in narrative, kinetic photography.But \\"The Bashful Suitor\\" is not entirely devoid of dramatic quality, only less positively dramatic than it should be; so, with its photographic distinction, it remains an interesting and, more importantly, a significant screen production. It is only to be hoped that to the sincerity and special proficiency with which it has been produced some one will add the dramatic faculty necessary for the true completion of the series, of which, after all, it is only the second.

In folkloric concerts, the arrival of roots-conscious children is precisely the moment when sentimentality drives a stake through the heart of a show: one is expected to bemoan the loss of tradition and applaud the youths' valiant attempts to fight off encroaching international pop culture. But Ms. Mercury had other ideas. The three, beating out a complicated and ferocious samba pattern, were supported by a stadium rock production, including flashing lights, fog banks and a booming sound system. It was a pop spectacle, and it was authentic, and the crowd went haywire.   Ms. Mercury, a young singer from Bahia, packed the Ritz, and it was hard to imagine a better party anywhere. Men were holding women on their shoulders, and the entire audience was swaying to the music, singing along with the songs, or dancing. Ms. Mercury sings with a voice that can move easily from pure pop tones to a hoarse, African style. She and her two dancers worked tightly choreographed routines, and Ms. Mercury pretty much proclaimed herself to be sex on two feet, all in a nicely civilized, consensual adult way. She's a star: but in a domestic touch, her publicity biography mentions that she has two children.
