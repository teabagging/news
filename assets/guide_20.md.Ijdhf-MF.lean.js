The Mark's     25 East 77th Street (212) 879-1864 -- This sumptuous restaurant in the two-year-old Mark Hotel offers not only tranquillity and comfort but also some sophisticated contemporary cooking on a par with the better independent restaurants in town.

The irrepressibly cheerful owner, Annick Le Douaron, always has a kind word, and the gentle waitresses do not seem inconvenienced by your presence. The setting is charming in a low-key manner. The entrance, with its frosted glass walls, icicle chandeliers, lace curtains and Florida pink walls, still looks like a small-town beauty parlor.

The strong margin should help give Mr. Abbas a mandate for change and to try to put an end to terrorism.   A1    President Bush welcomed the victory of Mr. Abbas as administration officials prepared to increase the tempo of involvement in the Middle East and cautioned that Israel and the Palestinians needed to take concrete steps to capitalize on the election.   A7    The voting was largely trouble-free in the Gaza Strip. In the West Bank, too, voting took place without major difficulties, as the people chose a new leader, a rare event in the Arab world.   A7    When Will the U.S. Leave Iraq?  Conversation has started on Capitol Hill, in the Pentagon, and some days even in the White House about when and how American forces might begin to disengage in Iraq.   A1    Two Iraqi policemen and three Iraqi civilians were killed south of Baghdad during a gunfight for which an Iraqi spokesman initially blamed American troops. Seven Ukrainian soldiers and one Kazakh soldier were killed when a bomb accidentally detonated near Suwayra, 50 miles southeast of Baghdad. Eleven other soldiers were also wounded.   A6    Expanding Tsunami Relief  Mercy Corps, an aid group based in Portland, Ore., is expanding its relief work. The group is recruiting local laborers who will help clear the disaster zones. Despite the grueling and gruesome labor, the recruited men seemed to be relieved to have something constructive to do, and to have a way to earn money.   A1    Tarnished by its handling of the oil-for-food program in Iraq as it begins another multibillion-dollar program of tsunami relief, the United Nations is taking measures to ensure public accountability of how the money is spent.   A8    Members of Lasker Mujahedeen, a paramilitary group that has fought Christians in Indonesia and has had links to Al Qaeda, are among hundreds of Indonesian Islamic extremists who have come to Aceh in the name of helping their fellow Muslims.   A9    Peace Treaty in Area of Sudan  The Islamic government of Sudan signed a peace agreement with a Christian rebel group in the south. The agreement is fraught with potential complications but it could help bring development to one of the world's most destitute regions. The celebration was tempered by the fact that the war continues in other areas of Sudan.   A3    Gale-Force Winds in Europe  Eleven people were killed and at least four were missing after gale-force winds battered northern Europe, causing flooding and transport chaos and leaving hundreds of thousands without electricity.   A4    NATIONAL   A12-17    DNA Donations Requested To Solve a Grisly Murder  Police officers in Truro, Mass., are trying to get DNA from all 790 or so men in town -- or as many as will agree -- in an unusual last-ditch move for clues to the three-year-old unsolved murder of Christa Worthington, who was stabbed to death in the town's most grisly mystery.   A1    Differences on Social Security  White House officials plan to describe Social Security as a system in ''crisis'' whose promises to younger workers are a ''fiction,'' in the first phase of a strategy to build support for overhauling the program. Opponents say Mr. Bush is exaggerating the problems.   A14    Weather-Related Deaths in U.S.  Relentless, pounding rain produced landslides, flooding and chaos on California highways. Wicked weather was blamed for several deaths during the weekend, from Southern California to Pennsylvania.   A12    Railroad Crew Questioned  Investigators seeking the cause of a train crash that released clouds of chlorine gas and killed nine people said they were looking into whether a train crew was distracted or fatigued when it was time to reset a railroad switch. Investigators said the crew had called their dispatcher seven hours earlier to report that they had completed their work. That call meant that the switch should have been re-positioned. The switch showed no sign of tampering.   A13    Sheriff Firings Upstage Victory  Clayton County, Ga., opened the year with its first black-majority government, including the county commission and sheriff. But the celebratory moment has been all but eclipsed by the uproar over the new sheriff's firing of 27 employees. The county commission's chief of staff, Clark Talmage Stevens, a former adviser to presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, called it ''a blatant mass political firing.''   A12    Democrats Pick Midterm Chief  Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois was named as the new chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The appointment means Mr. Emanuel will direct the Democrats' effort to recapture the House in the 2006 midterm elections.   A14    SPORTSMONDAY   D1-8    Mets to Sign Carlos Beltran  Carlos Beltran and the Mets agreed in principle to a seven-year, $119 million contract. The deal is contingent on Beltran's passing a physical and on the two sides completing the financial structure of the contract, a major league official who was briefed on the negotiations said.   A1    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-5    'Wicked' Witch, Injured, Still Takes Her Final Bow  Idina Menzel, the Tony Award-winning actress and departing star of ''Wicked,'' the Broadway blockbuster based on ''The Wizard of Oz,'' took the stage for a five-minute final standing ovation just 24 hours after she fractured a rib in an onstage accident.   B1    Investigation of Arts Center  The Saratoga Performing Arts Center said it had received a subpoena from the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, relating to questions about its spending practices.   B5    Vaccine Shortage Tests City  New York City, which dealt with a shortage of flu vaccine last fall by scrounging for doses, now faces a flu season that is just beginning. How it handled the crisis offers lessons in how it might respond to a larger health emergency.   B1    Ex-Con Arrested Again  Jesse Nettles, a homeless man who served more than a decade in prison after two violent attacks in 1974, was arrested in connection with another string of violence: the stabbing of a man in Times Square and two employees at a restaurant in Pennsylvania Station, the police said.   B1    Behind Rowland's Plea  Lawyers involved in the case of John G. Rowland, the former Connecticut governor, say that last month's plea agreement shrewdly positioned him to appeal for leniency at his sentencing on March 11 and halted a criminal investigation.   B5    Neediest Cases   B4    ARTS   E1-12    Paris Museums Branching Out  The Louvre and the Georges Pomidou Center are both preparing to open branches outside of Paris, following a growing trend.

Formal groundbreaking for the building, Tweemill House, at the corner of 126th Street and Lexington Avenue, took place Monday.   The housing group, the Community Association of East Harlem, said the six-story, 39-unit building will have two elevators with control panels in braille, a round-the-clock security guard and a social worker assigned to the tenants. The tenants -- handicapped individuals or heads of families who qualify as low-income under Federal guidelines -- will pay 30 percent of their income in rent.    Tweemill House was first planned in 1983. The site was provided by New York City for $12,000 and the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal lent the group $98,000 in seed money. The turning point came in September, when, five years after its first application for Federal assistance, the Department of Housing and Urban Renewal approved a loan of $4.9 million, the building's projected cost.   Architects for the project, which is to be completed by the end of May, are Marlo & De Chiara of New York City. The building's name is a play on the name Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, a New York law firm that has advised the East Harlem housing group on a pro-bono basis.

Abandoned buildings lower the property values of neighboring homes, he explained, and often create a psychological barrier to neighborhood improvement efforts. \\"If you go after the vacant two-flat on the corner you are really going to revitalize the entire block,\\" Mr. Shubert said. \\n\\nInitiated by Tom Lenz, executive director of the Local Initiative Support Corporation of Chicago, (LISC) and Bruce Gottschall, executive director of Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, the new program is similar to others in Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Seattle. Both groups are branches of national, nonprofit community development organizations. \\n\\nSix community groups will each receive $25,000 from LISC to acquire and rehabilitate abandoned dwellings in some of the city's most impoverished neighborhoods. During the program's first year more than 100 buildings are expected to be renovated and offered for sale. \\n\\nDepending on the price of the home, buyers with annual incomes as low as $15,000, or less than 60 percent of the Chicago area's median income, will be able to purchase houses. \\n\\nLISC will also administer $1.2 million in city community development float funds as purchase and construction financing. Those loans will be repaid upon the sale of the buildings. \\n\\nPrices for the buildings will range from $35,000 to $55,000. Mortgage packages with rates running as low as 3 percent are available through Neighborhood Housing Services, which is directing state housing money into the program. The city is putting up $4.5 million for 5 percent, 15-year second mortgages that can reduce the down payments to as little as $3,000. \\n\\nThe first rehabs are under way in the Englewood neighborhood on the city's south side.

But they specialized in winning low-scoring games, beating teams with their legs and with power. The White Sox hit into the fewest double plays in the league and had eight players with at least 13 homers, led by 40 from Paul Konerko, the most valuable player of the A.L.C.S. Scott Podsednik hit his only homer of the season in the playoffs against Boston, but he is a threat to run at all times. Joe Crede had several big hits in the A.L.C.S. and finished the season strong.    PITCHING    The White Sox finished the A.L.C.S. with four complete games in a row, a feat unseen in the postseason since the 1956 World Series. Clearly, this was the team to do it: Mark Buerhle, Freddy Garcia and Jon Garland all finished in the top 10 in the American League in pitches thrown. Game 1 starter José Contreras is the toughest of all of them to hit, with his fastballs and forkballs. The savvy Buehrle works quickly and has an excellent cutter that neutralizes right-handers. Garcia has always been best in tough spots, holding opponents to a .197 average with runners in scoring position. There is depth in the little-used bullpen, as playoff-tested Orlando Hernandez showed in the division series. No Houston hitter has ever faced closer Bobby Jenks, one of the hardest throwers in baseball.    DEFENSE    Two or three years ago, opposing teams could count on the White Sox to beat themselves with shoddy defense. That changed this year, and the White Sox now have outstanding defense up the middle. Shortstop Juan Uribe has excellent hands and a strong throwing arm, forming a slick double-play duo with second baseman Tadahito Iguchi. Aaron Rowand, a Gold Glove candidate, runs down everything in center field, and A.J. Pierzynski solidifies the catching spot. Pierzynski has an average arm, but most White Sox pitchers besides José Contreras hold runners well.    X-FACTOR  Ozzie Guillen, the plucky White Sox manager, was a coach in the National League but managed in a decidedly American League style in the championship series, making just one pitching change and using only one position player off his bench, the pinch-runner Pablo Ozuna. With the middle three World Series games played under National League rules, Guillen will probably have to get his bench and bullpen involved, and those players have basically been resting all month. Guillen must hope that the relievers and reserves (yes, Mets fans, Timo Perez is among them) are ready to go.    POSTSEASON STATISTICS    BATTING AVERAGE: .263  ON-BASE PERCENTAGE: .337  HOME RUNS: 12  STARTERS' E.R.A.: 2.81  RELIEVERS' E.R.A.: 0.00  BAT. AVG. AGAINST: .202    Astros    HITTING    Like the White Sox, the Astros are one of the more daring teams on the bases but also have decent power. Morgan Ensberg opened his stance this season and improved his home run total to 36 from 10. Lance Berkman is better lefthanded than right, but he is a sophisticated hitter who adjusts to pitchers' patterns quickly. Craig Biggio, at 39, still sparks the offense and is the career leader in times hit by a pitch, getting plunked 17 more times this season. Jason Lane came into his own this season, with 26 homers, and Jeff Bagwell looms as a threat off the bench or at designated hitter.    PITCHING    In the playoffs, the White Sox beat the Red Sox without facing Curt Schilling and then the Angels without facing Bartolo Colón. There will be no avoiding the Astros' threesome of aces: Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and the most valuable player of the N.L.C.S., Roy Oswalt. The good news for the White Sox is that Paul Konerko, their best hitter, has a .444 career average off Clemens and a .391 mark against Pettitte. In the Houston bullpen, Chad Qualls has a power sinker and Dan Wheeler (.204 opponents' average) has become a polished setup man for Brad Lidge, who has the best slider in the National League. Lefty hitters struggle to keep that pitch fair, if they can touch it at all. Of course, Lidge must avoid hanging the pitch to a righthander, because Albert Pujols crushed one in the N.L.C.S.    DEFENSE    Only one National League team, the Braves, had fewer errors than the Astros. Willy Taveras replaced Carlos Beltran in center field and quickly showed that he might be the N.L.'s fastest player. Eric Bruntlett replaces Craig Biggio for late-inning defense at second base. Brad Ausmus has always been an excellent defensive catcher","excerpt":"Houston committed just six passed balls this season. Chicago's Scott Podsednik can steal on Andy Pettitte if he breaks on the first move, because Pettitte is slow to the plate. But that first move may well be a pickoff try, and it will be interesting to see if Podsednik risks it.    X-FACTOR    The Astros play in Minute Maid Park, where they keep the roof closed and the fans spend all game trying to blow it off with noise. The Astros' familiarity with the crowd and the funky playing field could give them an edge. The outfield walls are a maze, zigging and zagging from foul pole to foul pole. The left field wall juts in, standing just 315 feet from home at the corner to offer an inviting target for hitters and a potential problem for visiting outfielders. The 10-degree slope in straightaway center field, complete with a flag pole in play, is an intentional oddity that could confound the White Sox.

The CBS program was conceived in 1967 and born, a lusty, contentious and entertaining baby, a year later, and Mr. Hewitt, its executive producer, has written such a chatty book about its life and times that one is reluctant to appear pompous by calling it a memoir. Instead, ''Minute by Minute'' is the literary equivalent of spending the night in a bar listening to the yarns of an old-time newsman.   About half the pages are filled with pictures accompanied by excerpts from ''60 Minutes'' interviews with the highly diverse cross-section of Americans that have gone before the program's cameras. Mr. Hewitt's insights and recollections fill the rest of this large-page volume. It puts the program in the best of lights and the people who run it in the highest category of journalists. After all, what else would someone who is speaking of his life's work write? There were mistakes, but they weren't fatal. The family feeling on network and program seem to have been idyllic, unless you get on the subject of Fred W.

Most of the actors graduated from the Juilliard School, where they presumably studied with Mr. Langham, until recently the head of its drama division. The result is a closer responsiveness between the performers and the director than is often found at Theater for a New Audience. The cast evokes memories of that earlier group of Juilliard graduates who became the charter members of the Acting Company.   In his distinguished career, Mr. Langham has staged a number of productions of \\"Love's Labour's Lost,\\" in England, at the Stratford Festival in Canada and at Juilliard. He is a master of the play's gently satiric humors. This time, he views the comedy as more autumnal than vernal. Russet colors dominate the palette in Douglas Stein's attractive set. One might suggest that the feeling in the air is that of homecoming or post-graduation, as the King of Navarre gathers his three closest friends for three years of celibacy and learned discourse.

Mr. Keene has only occasionally had the resources, concrete and human, to do these operas well. He also knows they are bad for business.   So in one way or another, the failure of \\"The Midsummer Marriage\\" was built in from the start: either failure in terms of operatic quality or failure in terms of audience response, and in this case both.

Yet even though stock prices are generally down and most of the major companies in the industry reported sharply lower earnings or losses for the first quarter of 1984, many analysts say the costly rate war in business lines, which has been largely responsible for the insurance woes of the last five years, may be coming to an end.   And there is a growing belief on Wall Street that if there is no more of the price-cutting that has been responsible for substantial underwriting losses - such pretax losses amounted to a record $5.08 billion in the first quarter and were barely surpassed by the pretax investment gain - the industry's profits will eventually show a pattern of increases.

One of my colleagues has enthusiastically described it as ''a big step toward liberating the screen'' and, to the extent that it's the first nonpornographic film to include sequences that in other circumstances would be judged pornographic, he is right.   Yet the freedom to make and show publicly such a film has been available to most Western filmmakers for over a decade. It's just that Mr. Ripploh is the first director with enough talent, substance and courage to utilize that freedom in such a way that we come away from his film feeling more provoked, enlightened and amused than shocked, titillated or disgusted, which can be the effect of secondrate movies whether they're pornographic or not.   Yet one of the principal reasons for the success of ''Taxi zum Klo,'' in which Mr. Ripploh looks at his own life with the sort of merciless candor that is not without its self-congratulatory aspects, is that the filmmaker is reacting with articulate fury and humor against what he sees to be an inhibiting, hypocritical society, one that frowns on his running sexually amok.

Nabi - discussed these changes and their appraisal of various portfolio holdings.   ''Our major change, which took place in April, was to move 20 percent of an account's assets into 20-year Treasury bonds,'' said Mr. Nabi, who joined Bessemer Trust early this year as research director and executive vice president for investments. ''This reflects our conviction that the United States is in the midst of a secular disinflation that probably will last through most of the 1980's.

Indeed, there was no such word as Hindu in those days, so there could be no war against non-Hindus. Nowhere does Hindu mythology raise the question of religion. These are just plain stories of great people.   The letter writer states that Hindus plan and carry out attacks on Muslim homes and businesses in India. The facts point in other directions. Most of the trouble normally erupts in Muslim-dominated areas of the country, such as Aligarh and Kashmir.    If Hindus wanted to attack Muslim homes, they would do so in areas where they are in the majority. But that is not the case. It is Muslims who attack Hindu homes and businesses in the areas where it is the Muslims who have the majority.   Historically, the Hindu religion was practiced long before Islam came into existence. It was Muslims who forced people from other religions to convert to theirs. Hindus have never ever gone around converting people to Hinduism. Indeed, Hindus have been pretty strict about admitting anybody else to their religion; hence, the statement that Hindus are forcing others into Hinduism is nothing else but a mindless fiction.   If we look around the world, most of the trouble and war takes place in or is due to a Muslim country. The interesting point is that many wars are promoted by heads of religion, as in Iran. But Hinduism has never promoted or been a cause of war.   In the last paragraph, the letter writer states that aid to India should be cut off because of the human rights issue.    Since independence in 1947, India has always followed a democratic political system, which is a fair democracy. Indeed, it has been fairer to Muslims than any other democracy in the world. Only in Indian democracy, are Muslims permitted to have several wives legally and need not pay alimony to divorced wives as they must under Islamic law. At the same time, Muslims have the benefits of Hinduism's views on the punishment of crime. They don't get their hands cut off for theft as Islamic law decrees and don't get stoned to death for adultery.   Democracy in India is not a mockery of democracy as democracy is in most Muslim countries. India has appointed a Muslim to the highest position in the country, the president.    On the other hand, Pakistan has seen democracy only in glimpses between changing dictatorships. If you analyze the pattern of migration between India and Pakistan, the net flow of Muslims is from Pakistan to India. More Muslims in Pakistan have chosen to come and stay in India than Muslims in India have chosen to move to Pakistan. This confirms that there is more of a human rights problem for Muslims in Pakistan than in India. U. D.

Students of hospital history know that the first hospitals primarily were places for poor people to die.

The charitable origins of hospitals reflected the concern, especially of religious groups, to provide shelter for the disadvantaged of our society.\\n\\n As hospitals changed over the years from social agencies to technical institutes to complex corporations, most maintained the obligations inherited from their charitable origins. Nonprofit hospitals, in particular, have continued throughout this evolution to provide their services to people with little or no resources.

On the outskirts of metropolitan London you might also want to see Kew Gardens and Windsor Castle.
