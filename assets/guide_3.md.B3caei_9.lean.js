He set up a folding card table on a sidewalk on Main Street here. He displayed a handful of used books on the table. And then he put up two signs: one said, \\"Free Books,\\" and the other read, \\"Donation.\\" So many people took books and left cash that in one day he made $138, which he gave to Grace Church Community Center for projects that help the homeless.\\n\\nThat was in 1986. Free Books, as the project came to be known, moved into a storefront in 1987 at 213 Main Street, a few doors down from the church. It was staffed entirely by Mr. Weiner and a cadre of regular volunteers. There was no fax machine, no telephone -- not even a cash register. Mr. Weiner, a retired high school English and social studies teacher, didn't want to become enmeshed in anything too much like a conventional business. He did keep the donation jar prominently displayed, and over the past seven years, he collected $125,000 for the cause.\\nIntense Political Discussions\\n\\n Despite the project's success, however, Mr. Weiner now finds himself with 40,000 books and nowhere to go with them. The storefront had been donated by Halpern Enterprises, a real estate and development company based in Tarrytown. Free Books paid only a nominal fee to help cover utilities. Last month, though, Jon L. Halpern, the company's president, told Mr. Weiner that he was sorry, but the company could no longer afford the arrangement and was planning to renovate the storefront and rent it out. On June 30, Mr. Weiner held a farewell party for the people who had volunteered at the shop and those who had come in regularly.

This time, the locale is Shaker Heights, Ohio, a Cleveland enclave that's the home of Kelly Ernswiler (Shia LaBeouf). Kelly is a bright teenager obsessed with historical American battles and a participant in war re-creations. He meets Bart (Elden Henson) after saving his life in a mock World War I battle and the two teenagers become fast pals. Kelly develops a relationship with Bart's parents and, more important, a crush on Bart's engaged older sister, Tabby (Amy Smart). Things are complicated at Kelly's house, too.  His mother (Kathleen Quinlan) employs a group of immigrants to make paintings that support the household. And his recovering addict father (William Sadler) treats their place as crash pad for the homeless and other less fortunates. Yes, Kelly's sitting on a pile of rage. It's why he spouts the kind of precocious drivel that, in real life, would get him beaten up by even the victims of bullies.

theories explaining how such water could have been released include 1 contending that shifting position of planet's axis causes melting of polar regions when they are exposed to high doses of sunlight every 50,000 yrs; another holds volcanic heat could have melted permafrost stored beneath Martian surface and caused deep faults and sinuous riverbeds in crust; H Masursky of US Geological Survey says that determination of water presence is central to answering question of whether Mars has been suitable for life development; predicts that future Mars‐landing missions may find fossils or signs of life; Mariner 9's 428 revolutions of Mars have produced 7,000 TV pictures, which have been perfected by computer; photos identify 4 major geological provinces; volcanic province's most prominent peak is larger than that in Hawaii; equatorial plateau province, marked by cracks which indicate tectonic (earthquake‐like) activity, has canyon 10 times length and 3 times depth of US Grand Canyon; crater terrains of 3d province cover 1/2 of planet and seem to be its most ancient feature; 4th province is expanse of stair‐step terraces and deep grooves which radiate from south polar area and are believed to have been gouged by moving ice cap; north polar region, though not yet completely photographed, is expected to be similar, indicating that Mars, like Earth, has had ice age and is now in warmer period; other Mariner 9 findings are that temperature ranges from 200 degrees below zero at North Pole to 80 degrees above zero in equatorial zone, that atmospheric winds reach 115 mph normally and 300 mph during dust storms, that amt of ozone, which is necessary to life because it screens out lethal ultraviolet sun rays, is less than 1/100 of amount in earth atmosphere, that Mars is somewhat circular but suffers from variations in gravitational pull, and that south polar cap recedes about 1,800‐mi in diameter between winter and spring;

Sunday afternoon at Avery Fisher Hall, with his National Symphony Orchestra, his cello, an assistant conductor, the Choral Arts Society of Washington and a Soviet mezzo-soprano in tow, he reaffirmed those credentials with a thrilling concert in honor of the 100th anniversary of Sergei Prokofiev's birth.   As the pre-eminent cellist of our time, Mr. Rostropovich might have been expected to make his strongest impression in the opening piece, the Sinfonia Concertante in E minor for cello and orchestra (Op. 125). But it was his work as a conductor, sometimes questioned on technical grounds, that justifiably earned the most fervent ovation. It came after a performance of the \\"Alexander Nevsky\\" cantata that for sweeping conviction and unashamed patriotic fervor is unlikely to be bettered. Review/Music","excerpt":"Prokofiev Honored On His Centenary By Rostropovich"},{"year":"1991","title":"The Seattle Opera's 1990 production of Prokofiev's opera \\"War and Peace\\" was widely acclaimed, and it was a seemingly nice idea to show the independently produced high-definition television taping of the Aug. 2 performance for a commercial New York run. As it happened, Tuesday's opening night at the Ed Sullivan Theater was an amateurish near-fiasco, though things may improve for the rest of the run through Saturday evening.   High-definition television offers a far higher resolution than conventional television, American or European, so that its images can plausibly be expanded for a theatrical screening. But the result is like a slightly grainy film, which hardly makes the best case for the new medium. While the images offer a decent opportunity for opera lovers to see this production, they would be more brilliant on a television set. Unfortunately, no high-definition television sets are yet available for home use outside Japan. Sony Classical is negotiating the rights to the material, but would only issue it here in conventional video form for the time being.

Is it because mere stars of whatever magnitude are inevitably eclipsed by the Mozart sun? No doubt. But the causes may go deeper. For reasons not confined to musical quality as such, Prokofiev's standing, and his future in the repertory, could be in doubt.\\n\\nSome of those reasons were driven home vividly a year ago in San Francisco. Kurt Masur, who has since been appointed music director of the New York Philharmonic, conducted the local symphony orchestra in Prokofiev's familiar cantata based on his music to Sergei Eisenstein's 1938 film \\"Alexander Nevsky.\\" The program, as always, had been set long in advance.

The first time was in 1947 and that, too, was at the Atheneum.     It is news that so far as art goes, is of national, possibly even international importance. Not only is the art a first-rate sampling of American and European modernism, much of it acquired within a year or two of its creation, but it is also a clear reflection of unaided taste. Not for these collectors the dutiful picking of one from Column A and two from Column B on the 20th-century menu: There is no Photo-Realism, no Neo-Expressionism, very little Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism is downplayed. What there is of the latter is choice, especially two large works by Mark Rothko and Franz Kline, dated 1952 and 1956, respectively.    This may explain why the names Burton and Emily Tremaine, seldom seen on the society pages, command such respect among curators and why dealers, it is said, are not above dropping them to encourage other, less confident collectors. Incidentally, it was their Jasper Johns painting, ''Three Flags,'' of 1958, that made headlines just over three years ago when the Whitney Museum of American Art bought it for $1 million. Believed to be the most ever paid for a work by a living artist, the price represents a profit of $999,085 for its previous owners.
