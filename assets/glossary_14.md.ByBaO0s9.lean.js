Why Mr. O'Hanlon wanted to penetrate the Tiban mountains of Borneo, a primary jungle unexplored by anyone since 1926, he never quite satisfactorily explains.  To the relief of one reader he does not say, ''Because it was there.'' He seems to have been initaially inspired by the example of ''a mild mannered uncle'' who had visited Borneo with the Oxford expedition of 1932 and later as a Special Oberations comando during the war against Japan.

It is a combination of satire and burlesque, in which that master of fun, Chester Conklin, revels in situations that call for his inimitable style, something between farce and comedy.In this cheerful piece of work Mr. Conklin, still possessing his imposing mustache and eyeglasses and his pate still denuded of most of its hair, steps into the rôle of a subway guard, known at first to a few and subsequently to the nation as John Sloval. Mr. Sloval in the first few scenes shows that after all a uniform is not to be despised, especially during the rush hour in the subway.Mr. Sloval slips down to his work in civilian attire and therefore he finds the matter of approach through the throng to the employes' room sometimes an ordeal needing patience and energy. But once he emerges from the locker-room of the subway station, with his brass buttons and his cap, a crown of authority, his demeanor is not exactly tactful, being rather that of an autocrat dealing with hoi-polloi. These scenes are cleverly designed and adroitly pictured, with an excellent reproduction of a Gotham crowd ready for business and eager for a seat.There are a few mildly humorous glimpses of Coney Island, where Mr. Sloval has a friend named Philip Hard, who owns concessions for furnishing amusement to tired business flappers and their escorts.The conspicuously attractive girl in this film is Mr. Sloval's daughter, Sophie. This young lady is one of the reasons Mr. Sloval can't sleep on the night after his Coney Island adventures. The other reasons are that he indulged too much in some of the diversions and then imbibed freely of Mr. Hard's apology for Scotchwhisky. It may mean nothing to you, but Mr. Sloval is listless and sleepy when he reports for his attack on the masses. The consequence is that after a slight push he makes a literal faux pas and discovers himself in a recumbent pose across the tracks, just as a down-town express is approaching. He is rescued from under the train with nothing more than a slight scratch on his head.This accident leads to the main event, for the eye of the news-hungry city editor of a tabloid, The Daily Mail, sees possibilities in the accident. The consequence is that Mr. Sloval is snatched from a humble hospital and taken to a luxurious nursing home, and according to the sensational articles in The Mail, he becomes The Subway Hero, the man who was willing to sacrifice himself so that others would not fall. He is adjured not to talk when his wife comes to visit him, and whether he will or no his head is extravagantly bandaged and likewise an uninjured foot. The Mail's candidate for Mayor visits The Subway Hero and is photographed sympathizingwith Mr. Sloval. Our Hero is attended by half a dozen nurses who have not neglected their personal appearance, and one of the young internes is kept busy entertaining Mr. Sloval by turning the patient's bed up and down.The diligent Daily Mail sends a photographer to see Mrs. Sloval and is undaunted by the fact that she has only one daughter. This camera expert sends for all the children of the tenement. They are grouped around Mrs. Sloval and at the psychological instant are instructed to lift their hands and shout:\\"We want our daddy!\\"Mr. Sloval, according to the caption writer, is the whisper who becomes a big noise and then fades into comparative obscurity. Mrs. Sloval's ambition is to own a cow and live in the country, and this hope is satisfied by giving the Sloval family a meadow with several cows, while Miss Sloval embraces her heart's desire, William Hedges.Mr. Conklin is ably supported by Sam Hardy, a talented actor, who makes the most of every incident in which he appears. Ned Sparks affords some laughter by his serious attitude as the candidate for Mayor.And Alice White contributes the beauty.This highly humorous pictorial effort was produced by Robert T. Kane and directed by Allan Dwan.

A1    A.C.L.U. Is Pressed for Files  Federal prosecutors are trying to force the American Civil Liberties Union to turn over copies of a classified document it received from a source, using what legal experts called a new extension of the Bush administration's efforts to protect national security secrets.

Service, always polished, seems even more attentive to diners' needs, without hovering or being obtrusive -- a fine line.         The decor is much the same, with lace cafe curtains at the front windows and  mirrored walls, though the posters in the nonsmoking section have been replaced  by floral prints.

Unfortunately, Mr. Roach succeeds chiefly in establishing the possibilities","excerpt":"rarely gets around to realizing them.

Same butterfly-brained matroof same blustering husband, same problem children, same impression able kitchen-help, same debonan tramp who only needed a shave to bring out his manly beauty and reduce the elder daughter of the house to reading novels upside down. There is even, thanks for the memory, the same financial crisis in father's affairs and the same opportunity for the tramp to make himself invaluable. But it doesn't add to the same dizzying comedy.For Mr. Roach has never traveled far from the Keystone days and his fingers are always itching to reach for a nice fat custard pie. Of course he doesn't actually pick it up. But he enjoys watching Alan Mowbray get his hand caught in a vase while the young mistress is asking for a match and a pair of great danes are frisking all over him. And he has some capital fun letting father do a drunk scene on the stairway. And, in one bang-up episode, he has all the women fainting simultaneously and people with pitchers of water colliding in swinging doors. But, somehow, we can't remember a clever line or a bit of business that doesn't owe its comic effect entirely to the bright comic styles of such players as Billie Burke, Alan Mowbray and Patsy Kelly.Still, there are those bright comic styles and the ingratiating artfulness of Mr. Aherne (who should be told, though, not to simper so) and the presence of Bonita Granville, who continues to be the perfect imp of a younger sister. Possibly \\"My Man Godfrey\\" spoiled us, or possibly it left too clear an impression. \\"Merrily We Live\\" is too close for comfort and altogether too loose to be anything but average light entertainment.

(Washington Square/Pocket Books, $15.) The author, who spent part of her childhood in Iran, returned in 1998, traveling alone in local dress everywhere from Tehran to the holy city of Qom and encountering a blizzard of contradictions along the way. Her account ''splendidly conveys 'the suspicion, the kindness, the absurdity, the generosity, the repression, the tolerance, the occasional danger and the constant wonder of life in the Islamic Republic,' '' Michael Upchurch said here last year.    ASSORTED FIRE EVENTS: Stories, by David Means. (Harvest/Harcourt, $12.) Set in faded industrial towns in the Northeast and Midwest, these tales feature battles between haves and have-nots, and small-scale moments of loss and redemption. ''There's not a cheap emotion or a predictable conclusion to be found,'' Maria Russo wrote here in 2000. Means ''has an uncompromising, humane vision'' that makes his stories ''almost unaccountably lovely.''    IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS: Everyday Interactions That Anger, Annoy, and Divide the Races, by Lena Williams. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) Drawing on focus groups and her own experiences, a reporter for The Times examines the seemingly minor but telling breaches of etiquette that generate racial mistrust. ''Nobody could disagree with her conclusion that 'what the races need more than anything else is to lighten up' . . . and memorize a few hitherto unsuspected offenses to be avoided,'' Judith Martin said here in 2000.    THE GLASS PALACE, by Amitav Ghosh. (Random House, $13.95.) This panoramic novel, which begins during the British invasion of Burma (now Myanmar) in the 19th century but expands to India, Malaya and New York as the years sweep by, explores the deceptions and self-deceptions of the colonial mind, particularly among India's Anglicized elite. Last year in the Book Review, Pankaj Mishra found much of the book ''grippingly subtle'' and said that ''among other things, Ghosh dramatizes . . . how the English language in India has retarded self-awareness and imprisoned even many educated Indians in a kind of permanent childhood.''    FAST FOOD NATION: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, by Eric Schlosser. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) Analyzing the fast-food business in depth from meat to marketing, the author doesn't find much that's appetizing on either a culinary or a societal level. The result is ''a fine piece of muckraking, alarming without being alarmist,'' Rob Walker wrote in these pages in 2001.    A DESERT IN BOHEMIA, by Jill Paton Walsh. (Plume, $13.) This novel traces the lives -- by turns brutal and joyful -- of the inhabitants of a small town in a fictional central European country between the end of World War II and the fall of Communism. Paton ''writes with grace and cunning, trapping her characters, chapter by chapter, in a web of intrigue,'' Lynn Karpen said here last year.    THE DIAGNOSIS, by Alan Lightman. (Vintage Contemporaries, $14.) Bill Chalmers, this novel's frantically multitasking hero, is totally reliant on cellphones, pagers and computers. He short-circuits one day on the Boston subway, losing his memory temporarily, and his search for a cure for his mysterious illness unfolds against a parallel narrative involving the execution of Socrates in ancient Greece. Lightman, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is ''a highly original and imaginative thinker,'' Abraham Verghese wrote here in 2000, and he ''forcefully captures the great confluence of our times: information overload, unimaginable prosperity and spiritual bankruptcy.''    RESCUING JEFFREY, by Richard Galli. (St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95.) The author tells of the freak accident that paralyzed his 17-year-old son from the neck down, and of the wrenching decision facing him and his wife: as parents of a legal minor, should they choose to let him die? ''Through a voice as plain as that of a single-reed instrument, he achieves an emotional resonance that swells with symphonic intensity,'' Noelle Oxenhandler said here in 2000.    LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD: How the Law Can Make Sports Better for Fans, by Paul C. Weiler. (Harvard University, $17.95.) A Harvard law professor sets out to solve the daunting problems of big-league sports, arguing, among other things, for flexible caps on gambling and players' salaries.

Unlike a lot of visitors, his is a size 18 neck. \\"Those buildings seem to go into the sky,\\" he said. Another unusual circumstance was that while he looked at the city with wide eyes, some of the city looked back at him in quite the same way.   He was one of a group of husky fellows that, as part of a tour of the city, took the Staten Island ferry on a gray morning yesterday. Other passengers noted them because they were being followed by another group of television and still photographers, and reporters.   \\"Who are you?\\" asked a young man with a baseball cap, with typical New Yorker diffidence.   \\"Steve McNair,\\" he replied, softly and, perhaps, warily.   \\"You the quarterback from that small school in the South?\\"   \\"Alcorn State,\\" said McNair.   \\"Hey, you had some year, guy!\\" He turned to his friend. \\"This guy was outrageous. He's got unbelievable stats!\\"   McNair, who has set several Division I and Division I-AA records in passing and total yardage, was in town along with five other college football players who were considered the top candidates for the Heisman Trophy, emblematic of the best college football player in the land.   Each of the other candidates were from Division I-A schools: Ki-Jana Carter, the running back, and Kerry Collins, the quarterback, both from Penn State","excerpt":"Rashaan Salaam, running back, Colorado; Jay Barker, quarterback, Alabama, and Warren Sapp, defensive lineman, Miami.   The winner was Salaam, who had rushed for 2,055 yards this past season. McNair was third, with 111 first-place votes, tying him for the highest finish for a Division I-AA player in Heisman history. Gordie Lockbaum, the two-way player from Holy Cross, finished third in 1987, and Neil Lomax, a Portland State quarterback, finished seventh in 1980.   \\"I think that with the numbers I put up, that should erase questions about the level of competition,\\" said the 6-foot-2-inch, 220-pound McNair. \\"While the other players had butted heads against some of the best teams in the country on a week-to-week basis, McNair's Southwestern Athletic Conference -- the Gramblings, Southerns and Mississippi Valley States -- while competitive, could hardly be classed with the Michigans and Notre Dames.   The other players on the trip to visit young patients at St. Vincent's Medical Center on Staten Island -- were generous, if not in fact diplomatic, in their comments about McNair.   \\"I don't think that his level of competition should take anything away from how he should be considered as a football player,\\" said Collins. \\"I saw film clips of him. He's a great talent.\\"   Said Salaam: \\"He's got a nice size and a nice shape, and what he did he did on a college level -- it wasn't like junior college. And I've talked to coaches about him. They tell me he's legit.\\"   McNair had opted for Alcorn State because when he was a star high school quarterback out of Mount Olive, Miss., the Division I schools interested him -- Miami, Mississippi State, Notre Dame and Florida, among others -- wanted him to play defensive back. \\"Alcorn State was the only one that wanted me as a quarterback,\\" he said.   Before learning he had lost, he said, he was happy to be in the running for the Heisman.   \\"After this,\\" he said, \\"I'm going back to school and get my degree in May.\\" He will earn a bachelor's in recreation. \\"And then I'll see what I can do in the next level.\\" Which means the National Football League.   Pro scouts have talked with him and, he says, they have informed him that he has \\"the total package\\" to be an N.F.L. quarterback. \\"They said they like my size, my arm strength, my stamina, my ability to elude the rush.\\"   Was he concerned that as a black quarterback he had special hurdles in the N.F.L.? \\"Twenty years ago I might have said yes, but not today,\\" he said. \\"The N.F.L. wants great players. They don't care if they're black or white.\\"   As for Charlie Ward, last year's Heisman winner who was not drafted by a single N.F.L. team but wound up as a basketball player with the Knicks, McNair said, \\"The way I understand it, the N.F.L. wanted a firm commitment that he would play football and not basketball, and he didn't give it to them.\\"   On Friday night in New York, McNair and the other Heisman candidates saw the skating rink at Rockefeller Center, the Empire State Building and stopped off at the Hard Rock Cafe.   \\"It's amazing,\\" McNair said. \\"There are more people out in the nighttime than in the daytime.\\" He admitted it was nothing like his hometown or Lorman, Miss., where Alcorn State is located.   And while he has enjoyed much of what he saw, he still misses certain elements of home, like Mary's, a hangout in Lorman, where they serve his favorite dish, the pork chop platter.   When he entered Alcorn State, he only had a size 17 neck. What was more responsible for his adding an inch to his neck, a weight program or the pork chop platter?   \\"Both,\\" he said, with a convincing smile.
