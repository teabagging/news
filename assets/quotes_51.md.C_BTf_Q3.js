The president of the Air Line Pilots Association, Capt. Henry Duffy, and Lane Kirkland, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., have agreed that Mr. Kirkland and airline union officials should meet with Congressional leaders soon to see if new laws are needed to remedy the industry's problems.

In the first half of this year, the major carriers collectively lost half a billion dollars on operations.

W Ger labor exchanges have been instructed by Govt to favor foreigners who have their families with them over Ger applicants with fewer dependents; Ernst gives reasons why Govt wants to avoid mass departures of foreign workers; W Ger Govt has decided to apply unemployment compensation regulations beyond present rules in order to allow jobless foreigners to remain in W Germany for 1 yr and be eligible for unemployment benefits; rules had stated that foreigners in country for less than 5 yrs lose work permits when they lose jobs and are thus ineligible for another job; Ernst estimates that jobless benefits will cost Govt $234‐million to support 50,000 foreigners for 1 yr (M) FOREIGN WORKERS FACEBONN CURBS"},{"year":"1976","title":"15 unemployed Lebanese workers with experience in tobacco growing are driven from border checkpoint to Israeli town of Safad for jobs in cigarette factory, opening latest phase of what Israelis call their 'good fence' policy","excerpt":"Labor Min officials say 100 to 150 Lebanese will be engaged by Jewish Natl Fund for work in forests near border;

The company canceled rehearsals on Tuesday and yesterday, but refused to sign an interim agreement proposed by the union. The company said that it had not suspended any performances and would try to resolve differences to avoid a strike. Without at least an interim agreement, Ms. Kallas said, the dancers plan to perform this morning for a group of students, but not during the evening as scheduled. Dancers are seeking a new contract with the company in an effort, they say, to protect their jobs, safety and health. Among other issues, dancers want more control over rehearsals and how management handles dismissals. The company canceled a tour of Italy this year in a dispute related to per-diem allowances for the dancers to pay for meals. The company's production of ''The Nutcracker'' is scheduled to run through Dec. 24 at the Warner Theater.
