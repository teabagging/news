Mr. Silverman is a full-time lawyer for the Environmental Protection Agency, but nonetheless proved a pianistic natural in the Ives. His interpretation responded admirably to the work's flow of ideas, and his playing had dimension, atmosphere, energy and discipline - wedded to a sense of rhythm that would not quit.

If you're the sort of fan who likes to buy compact discs or high-quality Japanese pressings and enjoy yourself in a soundproof room, you may never find a club environment as ideal for listening to the nuances in the music. But if you stay in that soundproof room, you're going to miss something.   The music isn't just on records; jazz is much more than a few frozen moments of an improviser's art. Jazz is the music that's happening every night, in every club and loft and concert hall and corner bar. And jazz pianists are rarely dummies when it comes to the acoustics of a room. They play for the particular bar or club, for each night's audience and ambiance. This interaction is the heart of jazz, and for jazz fans in particular, this concluding weekend of the Village Jazz Festival offers some of the art's most gifted, and often most attuned, improvisers.

Portraitupe, it turns out, is a new way to shuffle the Picasso deck, and room after room has unfamiliar pictures that are ferociously, shockingly inventive and often stirring.

Long on idealism but short on military know-how, the Republican cause was doomed, even as it drew such champions as Andre Malraux, Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Tina Modotti, Hans Namuth, David Seymour and Robert Capa.

If it wastes its fuel-energy and fails to do its allotted work. It is inefficient. Likewise, if a photoplay converts constructive thought, time and labor spent upon its production into proportionate dramatic power on the screen, it is efficient. If it uses up thought, time and labor without achieving consequent and corresponding dramatic effectiveness, it is inefficient.Now, the efficiency or inefficiency of a photoplay may usually be ascribed to several, or many, different factors, but if you look for an explanation of any particular failure in efficiency, you will find in many cases that it is due to the effort of a director to accomplish an effect through the medium of words. Say the director has selected a potentially dramatic scenario for his photoplay, grant that he has worked hard and long on its production, admit that he has exercised some imagination and skill in handling his continuity, concede even that, where he has used pictures, their photography is excellent, and you may still have to rate the photoplay as inefficient because its chief dramatic effects are sought in subtitles, which, no matter how much they may aid the exposition of a filmed story, can never make the potential dramatic force of its crises fully effective. Only expressive, which is to say cinematographic, moving pictures can do that.The screen offers abundant evidence of verbal inefficiency and pictorial efficiency in photoplays. A present example, in which both are illustrated, is the latest importation from Germany, \\"All For a Woman,\\" which was at the Manhattan Strand last week and goes to the Brooklyn Strand today. In this production the dominating figure is Danton, the courageous, convivial, popular leader, and there are many scenes in which he is brilliantly portrayed, in which Emil Jannings makes him one of the most commanding figures ever seen on the screen. Surely every one who sees \\"All For a Woman\\" will carry these scenes away with him in his mind and retain a vivid impression of them for a long time. They are as nearly 100 per cent, efficient as motion pictures have ever been.But Danton is an orator. His strength lies in his influence over the people, and this influence is exerted largely through spoken words. So, in \\"All For a Woman \\"he makes speeches, and the things he says are told in subtitles. Then he becomes far less effective as a dramatic figure than he is in the scenes which are purely pictorial. The subtitles are not more than 25 or 50 per cent, efficient.You may not have been struck with this as you watched the photoplay, because the influence of the pictures was so strong that the weakness of the words was not appreciated, but in what form did the photoplay impress itself upon your memory? Think of it now, and what springs up in your mind? Isn't it the scene in which Danton shakes off the arms of the woman clinging to him and strides to the open window to face the howling mob outside? Isn't it especially the moment in which the indignant and defiant Danton faces the mob, just before he begins to speak? But do you recall what he says when he speaks? His words are supposed to bring the people to their senses, but isn't it Danton as you saw him, rather that his words as you read them, that fills your imagination now? So, wouldn't you say that the moving pictures of Danton were efficient, that they had their designed effect upon you, while the subtitles were inefficient in that they failed to make the planned impression on you—although, as subtitles, they were well written?The real impression made by motion picture scenes and subtitles can often be tested in this way. You remember what impresses you most, and what do you remember of the photoplays you have seen? Their subtitles and the meaningless pictures accompanying them, or their pictorially expressive scenes? Think of \\"All For a Woman\\" again. What else do you recall vividly? Danton's laughter before the revolutionary tribunal? That was a picture. The way in which he sent the timid Desmoulins bravely to the guillotine? That was a picture. His own bearing at the moment of his execution? That was a picture, too.PICTORIAL effectiveness is strikingly illustrated in another German production entitled \\"Shattered,\\" which was shown privately not long ago, and, as this is written, is scheduled to be exhibited, with \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\\" under the auspices of the National Board of Review, at Town Hall, on what will be last night by the time this is published.This picture suffers from as poor photography as has been seen on the screen in recent years. Furthermore, in the form in which it was first shown, its story often dragged because of the unnecessary prolongation of relatively unimportant scenes, and at various points its action was obscure. But the chances are that those who see it will remember it longer and more definitely than nine out of ten photoplays that come from the most modern studios, because of the eloquence of its moving pictures. You simply can't forget some of them.The fact that the picture is practically without subtitles, having only some five or six to indicate passages of time, is important only because in many places where most directors would have put words, Lepo Pick, the director of \\"Shattered,\\" has put expressive moving pictures. It may be admitted that the photoplay would be helped if a few subtitles were inserted here and there to clarify doubtful incidents, but it should also be noted that, as in the case of the few other photoplays which have been made without subtitles, the ability of motion pictures to convey ideas and information undreamed of by those who use words freely on the screen is stirringly demonstrated in \\"Shattered.\\"The story is a sombre tragedy. Into the drab home of a plodding railroad track-walker, his methodically hardworking wife, and his daughter, whose life is being smothered in a dull environment, there comes a man from the outside world, an aggressive, well-tailored, metropolitanly toned railway inspector. He easily seduces the girl, fanning to flame the dying spark of life in her, and when the mother discovers them she runs out of the house to find the father, but stops at a wayside shrine to pray and freezes to death in the snow there. The father is crushed by his wife's death and when he learns the real cause of it he proceeds, without any evidence of violent emotion, but with dogged determination, to choke the railway inspector to death. Then he flags the next train and surrenders himself as a murderer, leaving his utterly benumbed daughter in the shattered home.Can you imagine the verbal embellishments many directors would have given this story? And how futile and how soon forgotten they would be? But who will forget Werner Krauss's impersonation of the old track-walker? He does nothing spectacular, nothing excitedly or to excite the spectator. He just plods along through the routine of his dull life, and when the routine is disturbed he reacts to the disturbance like a dumb beast. But in his slow, uneven walk, in his spiritless attention to the details of his work, in his pitiful agony before his wife's empty bed, he makes the character of the track-walker one of the most vital the screen has had. And the two women, as well as Paul Otto, who plays the rôle of the inspector, make their characters significantly realistic. Also many scenes are vivified by expressive little touches for which, presumably, the director is responsible, such, for instance, as when the track-walker is called away from his dinner to attend the telegraph instrument in his house, and his wife, after looking at him solicitously a moment, obviously wondering how long he will be, covers up his soup to keep it hot.If you see \\"Shattered\\" you will probably think it a very poor picture in some respects. Its photography and some of its direction are primitive. But you are not likely to forget it. Even with its handicaps, it is efficient to a remarkable degree, because it is substantially pictorial. And if it had the benefit of good photography you would not be able to get away from it for years, the influence of its pictures would be so powerful. As it stands, it's much more worth seeing than all the illustrated novels and plays turned out in a year.

And it does at least prove conclusively that the Empress—we refer to that eternal cinemempress, Catherine the Great of Russia—was a devil who, luckily for some of her political prisoners, was sometimes swayed by a very specific kind of sentiment.\\"The Devil Is an Empress\\" is commanded by an excellent cast","excerpt":"pictorially and histrionically, the Catherine of Françoise Rosay is magnificently gratifying; the mechanical-minded Baron Kempelen, with his hordes of automatons—a company of whom execute his worst enemy in a delightfully long-drawn-out sequence—could hardly be in better or more experienced hands than those of Conrad Veidt. Micheline Francey, the heart interest, resembles Irene Dunne, which must be an asset, and the others are equally plausible. The smuggling of the romantic hero inside a mechanical chess player is the melodramatic twist in the plot, and the story is that it proves to be the last twist for Conrad when the calculating Catherine has the \\"dummy\\" executed for lése majesté. The lovers, of course, escape across the border into Poland.At the Modern PlayhouseIf the shade of Maurus Jokai, the great Hungarian author and patriot who crossed the divide thirty-five years ago at the age of 79, could visit the Modern Playhouse these days it no doubt would be pleased with the screen version of \\"Szegeny Gazdagok\\" (\\"Poor Plutocrats\\") on view there. Furthermore, it would never need to waste its unlimited time on Hollywood's \\"Westerns.\\"This well-made Mesterfilm production, directed by Jenö Csepreghy, has practically everything in the way of romance, gold, jewels, hold-ups, masked bandits and desperate battles between the outlaws and the forces of law and order, all done in an ideal century-old setting. Even persons unfamiliar with Hungarian will enjoy the gorgeous ball scenes, the lovely music and the swift action.Theodore Uray is fine as the rich baron doubling as the mysterious chief of the bandit gang. He is ably supported by pretty Zita Szeleczky (to whom hoop skirts are particularly becoming), Laszlo Szilassy, Gerö Maly, Sandor Pethes, Piri Vaszary and Margaret Lukacs, a welcome newcomer.At 86th St. Garden TheatrePatrons of German-language movies blessed with long memories will recall the name \\"Das Ekel\\" (\\"The Grouch\\"), of the new Tobis comedy at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre, but they should not think it is the same film shown here almost eight years ago with the late Max Adalbert in the title role.For the story, while similar in some basic parts, differs considerably from that of the first \\"Ekel\\" and the locale has been shifted from Germany to Austria. Hans Moser, the popular Vienna funny man, is the petty tyrant at home and in his immediate circle who has to be brought to his senses by a brief stay in jail. He sets the pace with his super-dialect and the others in the cast try hard to keep up with him. Fritz Kampers and Hans Junkermann are among the old reliables, while pretty Herma Relin, as the grouch's daughter, is a new shadow here. Hans Holt, Kurt Meisel and Else Moellendorf are the other young folk involved in the double love affair.There are lots of laughs and a little sound philosophy in this amusing effort, which was directed by Hans Deppe.

In fact a stylist would be hard put to it finding anything in the language adequate to describe just what category it does belong in. Mongrel is as near as you can come hurriedly.The hero is a patrolman and the heroine a private secretary to a silk mill owner on whose properties there have recently been many robberies. The sub-hero is a newspaper humorist who is entrusted \\"(just like life) by his city editor with the task of solving the crimes. The patrolman also has a brother who has fallen into evil ways and is, if you can believe it, running around with the thieves.For saving his brother—he was \\"framed,\\" of course—the hero is unfrocked and becomes a truck driver. But he never rests. Like the Northwest Mounted, he will get his man. He does so, we are grateful to learn, but only after much fighting and the expenditure of every one's patience.Maybe somewhere in the Far West the residents will think that \\"Crooks Can't Win\\" shows a cross-section of life as lived in New York, and thus they will like this film.

To be sure, it would have been much better if a number of the situations had been left out, but then, you can't have everything as you want it.The plot is banal, being about a wealthy young man who is \\"rescued\\" by a wealthy young woman after he has been arrested for inciting a riot. The riot, by the way, takes place at a prize-fight in Chicago, \\"where you may be down but never out.\\" Things happen to the young pair, the heroine meanwhile being unaware of who the hero really is, but everything turns out in proper shape.The picture starts out excellently, retaining its quality for the first third. Then Mr. Denny is caught in the shower room of the Mission with only a towel for protection. After that scene, the show goes up again, only to drop a few minutes later into absurdities. It ends with a large free-for-all fight in which the hero captures three crooks who have been robbing his friends of their jewels.The most consistent performance is that given by Otis Harlan, who takes the part of an elderly crook who is almost—but not quite—on the verge of reform. The actor throws into the character the expressions, manners and walk of a Falstaff and is never misled by circumstances into overacting. Mr. Denny in the leading rôle is quite often catapulted into disasters in his efforts to keep up to what may happen next. Miss Nolan, as Julia Harrington, is all right.

It is a tale of intended seduction which at the last moment—through pity and fear, perhaps—turns into intellectual love. Its name is legion and its plot, Cinderella.Mr. Brook is an Archduke without much sense of humor and with a liking for the ladies. At a carnival in this city not far from Budapest he meets a sweet young thing, innocent and vivacious, the sister of the locality's only physician. Things go along the usual rut until the last night of the Archduke's visit when he enters the home of the esteemed lady.The physician, of course, is absent—having been led away by the myrmidons of evil—but he gets back in what is known as the nick of time. There is then a fight in which the girl shoots the Archduke, only to discover what the audience knew all along, that she loved him.The girl and her brother are sent to jail, for it is apparently a grave offense to shoot an Archduke. They did not make a good job of it, however, for he recovers and finds that he, also, is in love. The last we see is the pair going through the gates of the prison, to freedom and the new life.The plot is so utterly threadbare and ragged about the elbows that none of the cast can possibly do more than stagger through the vale of unreality.

The architecture enclosed the picture, so frames were not necessary. In the 14th century, as artists started to paint on panels and canvas, they recognized the need to frame their works. Framing became an art in itself, and framers often created pieces so ornate that they overpowered the picture. With the rise of modernism, artists demanded simpler, less distracting frames. Even so, framing is still an art that requires craftsmanship and good taste.\\n\\nPicture frames have two functions. One is esthetic. A good frame directs the viewer's eye to the art work, and it creates a boundary that separates the picture from the visual distractions of the surrounding environment. The second function is more prosaic but no less important. The frame protects the art work from dust and humidity and guards it from damage when the piece is handled.

Against this arid, desolate, seething background the director unfurls the love story of the \\"boy\\" and the \\"girl,\\" the young man's efforts in search of gold, the attempt to steal it from him and finally the happy reconciliation.It is not much to work upon, but the director has made the story so integral a part of the locale that it would be entirely out of place in any other setting. One feels, as the picture progresses, that here are men and women who are entirely credible, struggling against a ruthless, relentless nature and not merely puppets in a picture doing the director's bidding. The picture moves along at precisely the lethargic pace that its atmosphere demands. You feel the utter hopelessness of the existence of these people, of the heat and the squalor that are slowly but inevitably grinding out their last powers of resistance.Not all of the scenes have been handled in an original manner, but there are a number that are powerfully gripping. In particular those sequences where Rex, a dog, tries to make his master understand that the \\"man\\" has stolen his gold, and the one where the \\"boy,\\" fearing that the dog is crazed from the heat, draws his rifle from his sadle and turning his head fires at his companion, who, with a mute look of appeal and bewilderment, lifts one paw as if to ward off the discharge.The cast is uniformly excellent.

Entitled \\"The Battle of Midway,\\" the picture is two reels in length and for eighteen tingling and harshly realistic minutes the spectator is plunged into the front-line amid the thunder of exploding bombs, the angry whine of fighter planes locked in combat and the relentless bark of anti-aircraft guns aboard surface vessels.The picture does not hide the fact that American warriors died at Midway, that others fell wounded, some to be scooped out of the sea. But there are no signs of fear on the determined faces of the young pilots or the machine gun crew in a sandy foxhole coolly repelling intermittent strafing attacks by swooping Jap planes. Their courage and marksmanship were eloquently attested to, as the film clearly shows, by the downing of 300 Japanese planes of all types, the sinking of four carriers and the destruction or damaging of twenty-eight other enemy warships, including battleships, cruisers and destroyers.Photographed in ColorCurrently on view at most of the big first-run Broadway theatres and also at the newsreel houses, \\"The Battle of Midway\\" was photographed in color by a crew of Navy camera men under the supervision of Commander John Ford, U. S. N. R., the former Hollywood film director. Five hundred prints of the subject will soon be available without cost to theatres throughout the country. The Navy Department is supplying all of the prints, at an estimated cost of $59,000, to the motion picture industry's War Activities Committee, which has designated Twentieth Century-Fox as the distributing agent.Opening on the eve of the battle, with the commentator sardonically noting Premier Tojo's promise \\"to liberate\\" the island's gony birds, the film turns quickly to the excitement of the dawn alarm. A Flying Fortress lumbers down the runway, finally racing into the sky. At sea fighter and torpedo planes roar aloft to seek out enemy warships and fighter craft. The Japanese planes come in over Midway, blast an oil barge, pulverize the hospital, clearly marked by the Red Cross painted on the roof, strafe ground gunners and turn a large hangar into a mass of twisted wreckage. Several striking hits are scored on Jap planes, which plummet earthward like fiery meteors. When the smoke of battle clears there is a poignant moment as enlisted men and officers, among them Major James Roosevelt, stand grimly at attention during burial services for the heroic dead.Fighter Pilots IntroducedSeveral of the fighter pilots are introduced as they step from their planes, weary and victorious, while others are shown being rushed off to medical stations. Only one false note is struck in this otherwise remarkably frank and inspiring film and that is the anxious voice of a woman urging that the wounded be hurried to \\"clean hospital cots.\\" It is intended as a pointed comment on the ruthless bombing of the hospital base, but the strident female voice just doesn't suit the pictorial action. The voices of the narrators, Donald Crisp, Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell, were recorded in Hollywood like the film's other sound effects.Commander Ford and his camera reporters did not get these startling pictures from behind safe vantage points. They were out in the thick of the battle and in a few instances the concussion of exploding Japanese bombs was so great that the film leaped from the camera's sprockets. It is evident that the unsung camera men and Commander Ford, who was wounded while operating a 16mm. hand camera, risked their lives in making this astounding factual film record. Every one on the home front has a definite obligation to see \\"The Battle of Midway.\\" FILM OF 'MIDWAY' RELEASED BY NAVY","excerpt":"Picture on View in Theatres Here Shows Savage Battle of Land, Air and Sea Forces TAKEN IN HEAT OF COMBAT American Reverses as Well as Final Victory Over the Japs on Island Are Shown"},{"year":"2006","title":"Chief Raul Garza of Kickapoo Tribe provides New York Times with photograph of himself shaking hands with Pres Bush at May 2001 White House meeting, with lobbyist Jack Abramoff in background","excerpt":"picture opens window on Abramoff's efforts to sell himself to Indian tribes as man of influence and raises questions about how Abramoff and Garza, whom he was trying to sign as client, gained access to Bush's meeting with state legislators; photo (M) Photograph Shows Lobbyist at Bush Meeting With Legislators"},{"year":"1928","title":"Increase in European output EUROPE PUSHES WAR ON AMERICAN FILMS","excerpt":"Picture Output for Current Year Shows an Increase of Nearly $10,000,000."},{"year":"1964","title":"Michel Legendre, French Consul General here, and Mrs. Legendre will hold a reception on Monday at the French Consulate, 934 Fifth Avenue, before a motion&#8208","excerpt":"picture party at &#8220;That Man From Rio&#8221; at the Paris Theater.

But then, he is in love with Patsy. Dad can't see it, however, so he forbids his hopeful the use of the family automobile.Being a member of the younger generation. Smoke, instead of getting Patsy to borrow her car, steals the prohibited machine and proceeds to wreck it against the car of Mr. Beaut Thibaut. A repair man says the rehabilitating of the car will cost a large sum of money, so Smoke hires out as the driver of three men to earn it, unaware of their methods. The three rob a bank, shoot Smoke Sr. and then are driven to a police station by the youthful paragon, to whom all is forgiven.The picture is no worse than the general average of those dealing with wine, automobiles and the biological gropings of persons under the age of 24.

The picture was produced under the direction of Ivan Mosjukine from a scenario in the making of which Mosjukine had the collaboration of Norbert Falk and Alexander Volkoff. Noe Bloch was responsible for the artistic direction.\\"Casanova\\" comes as the climax to a series of sensational pictures, such as \\"Les Misérables\\" and \\"Michael Strogoff,\\" produced by the same society under Mosjukine's direction, and surpasses his previous achievements in those qualities of vivid action and movement for which his work is noted.In presenting the episodes of Casanova's adventurous career, Mosjukine brought to the screen probably for the first time a gripping picturization of Venice in the eighteenth century, with its canals, masquerades and atmosphere of luxurious indolence which marked the closing years of the Venetian republic.Scenes equally exciting are those which present the Russian court before Catherine's accession to the throne, and the succession of dramatic episodes such as the revolt of the guard, the burial of the extravagant Peter III and the coronation of the Empress.The picture is a triumph of artistic photography and the interpretation of the leading rôles is competent throughout. Mosjukine himself plays Casanova, Suzanne Bianchetti is Catherine the Great and other artists who contribute to the success of the film are Diana Karenne, Olga Day and Jenny Jugo.Into the life of Casanova, Mosjukine and his assistants have introduced situations, which make for dramatic cohesion and unity. The story as picturized concerns itself with Casanova's amorous intrigues in Venice, his flight to Austria, his arrival at St. Petersburg, his return to his own country, his imprisonment and his escape.

She runs away with a man who has come out of the wilderness, and settles with him on a secluded island. She is kidnapped by enraged natives and delivered to head hunters. The hero and Shane rescue her and Shane proves a good fellow by sacrificing himself so that the other two may escape.The atmosphere of the film is what every school child dreams a South Sea place is, except that here it is doubly exaggerated with choruses of hula girls and elaborate ceremonial rites.Other Photoplays.\\"The Case of Sergeant Grischa\\" is the Cameo for a second week.The German dialogue film, \\"Because I Loved You,\\" is continuing at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse.The Film Guild Cinema is exhibiting \\"White Cargo,\\" a British talking","excerpt":"picture.\\"Seven Days Leave\\" is at the Little Picture House.\\"Cameo Kirby\\" is at the Little Carnegie Playhouse until tomorrow; \\"New York Nights\\" will be shown until Friday.At the Hippodrome the feature is \\"The Cohens and Kellys in Scotland.\\"\\"General Crack\\" is at the Plaza until tomorrow; \\"Condemned\\" will be shown until Friday.The Fifth Avenue Playhouse is exhibiting \\"No So Dumb\\" until Tuesday; \\"Show of Shows\\" will be at that theatre from Wednesday until Saturday.\\"Anna Christie\\" is at the Capitol; \\"Honey.\\" at the Paramount; \\"Captain of the Guard,\\" at the Roxy; \\"Hell Harbor,\\" at the Rialto; \\"Lummox,\\" at the Rivoli; \\"Dames Ahoy,\\" at the Colony; \\"Framed,\\" at the Globe; \\"The Rogue Song,\\" at the Astor; \\"The Man From Blankley's,\\" at the Central; \\"The Vagabond King,\\" at the Criterion; \\"Mamba,\\" at the Gaiety; \\"Song o' My Heart,\\" at the Forty-fourth Street, and \\"Mammy,\\" at the Winter Garden.

A self-taught black painter working in Norwich, Conn., Ruley died violently in 1959, at the age of 77, under suspicious circumstances. Or, as Glenn Robert Smith argues (with the help of Robert Kenner), convincingly if luridly, he was murdered in a racially motivated attack. Married to a white woman and the imperious patriarch of a racially mixed extended family, Ruley took up painting in his later years. His surviving production, presented here in rich color illustrations, comprises small, highly simplified works on board, including pastoral and hunting scenes, landscapes and motifs reworked from photographs in popular magazines. An essay by Stacy Hollander, a curator, and Lee Kogan, a senior research fellow, at the Museum of American Folk Art, traces Ruley's likely sources, primarily stock images of popular heroes and bathing beauties that the artist appropriated to construct a kind of private idyll, a fantasy imagery of male desire with some affinity, as the authors note, to the work of Rousseau. The monographic approach by Mr. Smith, a California collector of folk art, and Mr. Kenner, the former editor of Art & Antiques -- a melodramatic account of Ruley's life and a search for sources and influences -- seems intended primarily to establish a market for Ruley's paintings. The book does not address a range of issues currently being raised in relation to the work of self-taught artists, like the ways race, class and difference shape their work. The book does, however, present interesting new material to be explored in those discussions.\\nMIGNON NIXON IN SHORT: NONFICTION","excerpt":"Pictures of a Gone World"},{"year":"1934","title":"Mrs Akeley shows films of last African expedition !MRS.

Most of the photographs in this exhibition are ''abstract,'' but they are abstract in a way that is different from American photographic abstraction. It is seldom possible to recognize in them any little bit of the visible world - a rock, a root, a human face or figure or an architectural detail - that an American photographer would isolate from its surroundings to produce an abstract effect. Instead, there are mysterious shapes that have no obvious counterpart in the visible world. Some are geometrical, some have a liquid, flowing biomorphic form, and many seem to shine with their own inner light.

In one instance, after bragging that he is an old friend of June Allen, he finds it somewhat difficult to make her acquaintance. However, he contrives successfully to meet her and tells her that he is employed in a bank. Later she discovers who he is when she returns the wallet he has dropped in her car. She doesn't seem to mind the least bit that he has lied to her or that he is a shoe clerk.Andy is discharged because he refuses to clean up an ash tray that the shop owner's son has upset. From then on with his go-getting tactics he succeeds in outwitting his rival and selling the rights to his arch preserver just as his creditors are about to close him out.Mr. Lewis is agreeable as the young upstart and Miss Nixon as June, who never for a moment doubts Andy's ability, makes a pleasant heroine.

Number after number, Mr. Bernstein's 1950's ''Romeo and Juliet'' answers the standards of variety, melodic richness, seriousness of intent and musical sweep that the major operatic composers have taught us to set.   This idea is hotly resisted, but the best argument for it is here on the records in the music itself. I can see no reason why the ''Tonight'' ensemble should not be compared to the quartet from ''Rigoletto.''

Rebecca Bryant, apparently a child of nature, was set upon by Muki Kayam, a man wearing identical spotted tights, and two women in red, Sheridan Roberts and Jenna Smith. The formlessness of the movement, not evident in Miss Osberg's dancing, added to the confusion.
