Even Fortune 500 companies are signing deals that have a frontier quality. In fact, the upheaval seems to be stimulating imaginative deal-making, not inhibiting it. The greater the turmoil and risk, the greater the concessions the authorities in the newly independent lands seem willing to grant, although concern is surfacing that deals born today may be canceled tomorrow by some future government that views them as one-sided and exploitative. Promise of Big Profits    The guiding principle appears to be this: Gamble as little as possible in a risky investment that might very well return a jackpot profit, if the money is not lost altogether in the chaos. Robert S. Strauss, a millionaire Texas lawyer and the United States Ambassador to Moscow, describes the potential and the risk by advising business people that if he were younger -- he is 73 -- he would invest $100,000 in the old Soviet Union and run it up into $10 million, but that if he had $10 million, he would gamble only $100,000 of it.

I found the selections weaker than they were last year but the variety no less fascinating. The concerts included, for example, a remarkable Chinese shadow play by the Yueh Lung Shadow Theater in which a mythic tale of a prince battling dragons was told with delicate miniature images projected on a screen.

Joseph, the husband of Mary and the patron saint of the family, is revered as the protector of the needy, the homeless, orphans and unwed mothers. These days he's a saint worth encouraging.   And that's not all. He is also the patron saint of pastry makers, so typical dishes for his day are often fried and sweet. Sugar-dusted zeppole fritters are perhaps the best known.    Many Italian food shops and bakeries are preparing zeppole and other special foods. Large, puffy zeppole and sfinci (pronounced SPHIN-gee), puffs filled with cream, are $2.50 each at Grace's marketplace, 1237 Third Avenue (73d Street). Grace Doria, the co-owner, is also making St. Joseph's bread filled with onions, raisins, anchovies and olives, at $8 a pound.   Zeppole and sfinci are $1.25 each at Veniero Pasticceria, 342 East 11th Street, at De Robertis Pasticceria, 176 First Avenue (10th Street) and at Alba's, a paradigm of gaudy, gooey excess at 7001 18th Avenue, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. At La Guli, 29-15 Ditmars Boulevard, Astoria, Queens, they are $1.50 each.   Another typical Sicilian dish for the holiday is the savory pasta con le sarde, made with long tubes of thick pasta dressed with sardines, raisins, capers, pine nuts, fennel and olive oil. Ideally, the sardines should be fresh, not canned, and the fennel wild.   Fresh sardines, $5.99 a pound and available Thursdays and Fridays, and wild fennel from California, $4.98 a big bunch are at Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas (Ninth street). Prepared pasta con le sarde is $9.50 a pound. Balducci's also has zeppole and sfinci, $2.25 each. Tasting Kosher Wines    On Tuesday from 6 to 8 P.M., the International Wine Center, 231 West 29th Street, is holding an informal tasting of more than 30 kosher wines from France, Italy, Israel, California and New York. The cost is $20. For reservations: (212) 268-7517. Open House at Adriana's    Adriana's Bazaar, 2152 Broadway (75th Street), will hold an open house with food and jazz tomorrow from 7 to 11 P.M. Rochelle Zabarkis, the owner of this unusual shop, which sells herbs, spices and condiments from around the world, said she was having trouble meeting expenses. So she is giving a party, modeled on Depression rent parties, to drum up support from neighbors and the cooks who depend on what she sells.    The party is free and there is no obligation to contribute. Free Tips and Recipes    This month the Williams-Sonoma stores are offering a free 20-page booklet, \\"Fresh, Light and Fast,\\" filled with cooking tips and a dozen recipes for reducing the use of fats in cooking. The booklet is available at Williams-Sonoma stores or by writing to the company at Post Office Box 7456, San Francisco, Calif. 94120. Helping to Relieve Hunger    The annual Taste of the Nation events organized by Share Our Strength to raise money for hunger-relief programs will be held March 29 to April 5.

American Express is underwriting all expenses.   In New York on March 30, there will be a party on the World Yacht vessel New Yorker at Pier 62, 23d Street and the Hudson River. The party begins at 7 P.M., and the yacht will take a one-hour sail at 10 P.M.   Tickets are $125 each, with sponsorship categories from $250 to $5,000. For information: (212) 382-5766.

Touches of Tuscany    Likitsakos Market, 1174 Lexington Avenue (80th Street), has introduced some spectacular new homemade ravioli that suggest the striped marble of Renaissance churches in Tuscany. Brown and white striped triangular ravioli are filled with a mushroom puree, gold and black triangles are filled with smoked salmon, and ovals banded in pink, black and white contain a lobster and crab combination. The ravioli are $7.99 a pound. PASTA IS GOING TO COLLEGE   ABOUT a dozen Italian restaurants will dish up their specialities at a buffet dinner Monday night in the kitchens of the hotel and restaurant school at New York City Technical College, 300 Jay Street (at Tillary Street), Brooklyn.   The benefit event, from 6:30 to 9 P.M. is to raise money for refurbishing the school's dining room.    Among the restaurants whose chefs will be on hand at the buffet are Felidia, Remi, Vivolo and Caffe Bondi in Manhattan, Galileo in Washington and Bacco's in Waterbury, Conn. Chefs from Italy are also participating.   Tickets are $75 and can be reserved by calling (718) 260-5630.

He appears to have no idea where  he is or what he's about to do. His anxiety quickly passes, but it's an indelible moment. It's also enough time for Frank Langella to suggest what soon  turns out to be stunningly true: his complete command over one of the most difficult and complex assignments in the modern theater. That is, the role of the obsessed husband and father in August Strindberg's mesmerizing and ferocious marriage play, \\"The Father.\\"         Though the Roundabout Theater Company production, which opened last night at  the Criterion Center, has its perfunctory elements, \\"The Father\\" still has the power to astonish. Richard Nelson's new adaptation of the Swedish text speaks in clean, spare English prose, the kind that remains discreetly outside time without betraying the conventions of the period when the play was written (1887). Equally important, Mr. Langella's performance is a career triumph of the sort Broadway has seen only once before this season in something other than a megabuck musical.
