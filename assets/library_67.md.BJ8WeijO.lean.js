Aid to the Soviet Union is something we must consider in the event that the Soviet distribution system breaks down this winter and that hunger or even famine grips certain areas of the country. This contingency planning is needed even if most reports from observers indicate that the trouble rests with a breakdown in distribution, rather than with basic food shortages.   A deep and dangerous crisis looms just over the horizon in the largest country on earth, and the cause of it cannot delay our humanitarian, as well as our self-interested response. We Americans have a stake in preventing extreme suffering and the resulting social chaos in the Soviet Union.   But, in the long run, providing emergency assistance will not help rectify the deficiencies of the Soviet system -- deficiencies that are also problems in Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. The solution lies in establishing effective distribution systems in these countries, introducing modern techniques of marketing and, most important, helping them structure a legal framework that encourages development of a free market and a regulatory framework to prevent hoarding, gouging and black market activities -- the rule of law.   I am proud to be devoting a good deal of effort to the work of the Institute of East-West Business Dynamics at New York University. The institute represents a coordinated attempt by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the American private and public sectors to develop a crash program to train experts in marketing and distribution, as well as to provide training for newly elected parliamentarians.   Ours is a United Nations-generated approach to stabilize the economic and legal systems of formerly centrally planned economies. It is nonideological and has strong bipartisan American support.   In addition to planning for emergencies, we must also help the new democracies in Europe to develop the wherewithal themselves to make a successful transition to market economies.

And in Houston, Bill Agee, director of the museum there for the last eight years, has resigned ''to return to research and writing.'' But thereby hang two tales.   Miss Boggs, a Degas scholar who headed the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa from 1966 to 1976, then served as a professor of art history at Harvard, had a less-than-easy time of it in Philadelphia, where she presided over a deficit-ridden museum, whose trustees were not always the most diligent of fund raisers. Miss Boggs herself was accused of more interest in scholarship than administration. Still, while at Philadelphia, she was responsible for several major acquisitions - the Degas painting ''Red Nude,'' for example - and during her tenure Philadelphia organized such important shows as ''Manifestations of Shiva,'' ''Futurism and the International Avant-Garde'' and the big Thomas Eakins exhibition that will open May 28.

The second purports to be a manifesto for a new, inclusive brand of feminism eschewing extremism and rigid ideology.   As Ms. Wolf, the author of \\"The Beauty Myth\\" (1991), sees it, the backlash against feminism culminated during the years of the Ronald Reagan Administration and ended with the Anita F. Hill-Clarence A. Thomas hearings of October 1991.

These apparent drawbacks only enhance the charm of a city that is almost surrounded by the Baltic. Its pastel neoclassical buildings and cobblestone streets are interspersed with flashes of bold architecture by internationally known Finns like Eliel Saarinen and Alvar Aalto. It is Scandinavian&#8208;tidy, but the leisurely pace is more akin to Oslo than to bustling Copenhagen or Stockholm. Helsinki endures discouraging spells of cold and dampness, but this is more than compensated for by its residents, who have not yet become sated with American tourists. Officially, the weather is rated as mild, ranging from an average midday temperature of 25 degrees Fahrenheit in February to 72 degrees in July. The average midday temperature this month is 59 degrees, and the September water temperature in nearby lakes and the Baltic usually ranges between 55 and 60.

But while there's plenty of nostalgia attached to disco, the music doesn't seem distant. In all but name, the disco era never ended. Only the haircuts are obsolete.     Dance music, disco's current alias, still fills clubs from here to Tokyo, and the disco beat, that steady thump that disk jockeys call four-on-the-floor, is still the music's common denominator, unsubtle but supremely effective. Disco songs from the late 1970's are all over movie soundtracks, period or not. And beyond its persistence as dance music, disco has stayed current in more stealthy ways. Nearly everything that was initially reviled in disco -- its monotonous rhythm, its gimmicky sounds, its disposability, its superficiality, its emphasis on physical function over literary meaning, its notion of music as pure dumb fun, not to mention its gay undercurrents -- has become entrenched in the pop mainstream, from the Backstreet Boys to Mary J. Blige to Ricky Martin to Beck. Disco, once mocked for being shallow and synthetic, has turned into roots.   Disco Lives!

First, the corn that they are made of is not the Indian maize Americans call corn.

Corn dollies are made today in a great variety of shapes that have evolved from long local usages - horseshoes in Suffolk, bells in Cambridgeshire, lanterns in Norfolk, bowknots in Staffordshire, fans in Wales.

It seems as if fashions may change and people may age and pass on, but that Joe Weber and Lew Fields are still holding their own, as their names in electric light signs are this week once again adding to the brightness of the Great White Way.Mr. Fields as the old native German, Carl Pfeiffer, delivers a memorable performance in this picture. The manner in which he handles the rôle creates a good deal of sympathy for the dilemma in which old Pfeiffer finds himself as the story is unfurled. You see him with tears of rage, tears of anxiety and sorrow dimming his eyes. Mr. Fields is careful in every change of mood and ably portrays the gradual surprise of the old man, who so detests being called \\"Charlie\\" by his friendly enemy, Henry Block.One of the excellent scenes in this production is where Pfeiffer catches his first glimpse of his son, William, in the uniform of a United States Army officer. There is wonder in his eyes and in his resilient face one reads the thoughts of a German father who knows that his son is going to war. In another sequence Pfeiffer is in his office with his stenographer. There is the sound of military bands and the old man goes to the window and instinctively takes off his hat, which act is at once noticed by the frivolous girl. Her grin prompts Pfeiffer to put his hat back on his head. Mr. Weber portrays the shock at hearing that two young relatives have met their death in fighting and one realizes that he is torn between loyalty to his adopted country and love of his native heath.George Melford, the director, depicts Pfeiffer and Block using the plates and dishes to show their ideas of the warfront, which discussion usually ends in something being broken. Mr. Melford rather overdoes this idea as he gives it a second time in Pfeiffer's home. Block is a banker and Pfeiffer is a successful shoe manufacturer, and young Pfeiffer is in love with June Block. Block is a quiescent type, delighting in enraging Pfeiffer by calling him \\"Charlie\\" instead of Carl.The interest in the story is well-sustained, and while there are certain scenes in which Pfeiffer upholds the actions of the Germans, his ultimate glory in his adopted country atones for his previous actions.There is Hilda Schwartz, the cashier of the German restaurant to which Pfeiffer and Block go for lunch, who cleverly outwits the Teuton spy, Miller. Pfeiffer wants to end the war and he gives Miller $10,000 with this idea in mind, little thinking that the money is going to be used to blow up a transport aboard which his son, William, is bound for France.Down in the engine room one sees the emissary of the German spy, which of course strikes one as being at least a little far-fetched. He is followed by Miss Schwartz, who points him out to the Captain. But before he is shot he manages to explode his bomb. Through some extraordinary good fortune Miss Schwartz is saved, and so is William Pfeiffer","excerpt":"hence the plausibility of this story is vulnerable and would not stand a vigorous attack.Eugenic Besserer is capable as Mrs. Pfeiffer. She is always thoroughly natural when arguing with her fiery husband. Stuart Holmes makes the German spy a little careless, and Pfeiffer appears to be extremely gullible when he believes that Miller can do anything to end the war. It is barely possible that a man like Miller would not have found many persons from whom he could have collected $10,000 with a promise of another check.One of the finishing touches in this picture is where the parrot shrieks \\"Hello, Carl,\\" and the former German sympathizer, believing it to have been prompted by old Block, shouts out that he wants to be called \\"Charlie.\\"Mr. Weber gives a good performance. He does not have the opportunity Mr. Fields has, as he feeds the latter with action and lines in the subtitles.

Both the film and the theatre are off the beaten path and it seems appropriate, too, to preface these remarks with the observation that \\"Farrebique\\" and its simple, compassionate presentation of farm life will impress its audience in one of two ways. Either you will take this picture into your heart and cherish it, or you will brusquely dismiss it after the first fifteen minutes, for there is no story in the customary sense to generate a subordinate interest in the proceedings.From the evidence on the screen one has no reason to doubt that Georges Rouquier, who made this hauntingly beautiful picture, spent a year on a farm in the Province of Rouergue. His camera wanders lovingly around the vast acreage of the fruitful farm called Farrebique and provides intimate glimpses of the life that thrives there, animal, plant and human, and how all is affected by the changing seasons. The people of Farrebique are real honest farmers and they are identified in the film only as Grandfather, Grandmother, Roch, the eldest son, and his wife, Berthe, and their four children","excerpt":"Henri, the youngest son, and Rosette, daughter of a neighboring farmer.One of the truly remarkable things about \\"Farrebique\\" is the complete naturalness these people display, even when the camera is sitting down to dinner with them, or spying when Grandfather calls the whole family together for the important business of distributing his material resources. Life is rich with tradition and hard labor produces material benefits at Farrebique, and no incident of daily routine from the mixing of dough for the huge round loaves of bread to the bedding down of animals at night is overlooked. And almost timidly the camera brings out the growing romance between Henri and Rosette.Though Farrebique has grown in more than a hundred years from a few acres into a sprawling farm and the simple barnlike structure expanded room by room as the children kept coming until the house rose two stories, life continued along primitive lines. Grandfather's decision to bring electric current to Farrebique calls for deep thought and a stubborn campaign to convince Rosette's father that he also should thus brighten his world and share the expense of the improvement. The only other slight element of dramatic conflict, and indeed that is too strong a word, stems from Grandfather's worry over Roch's indifference to his suggestion that the house, cracked and cramped with the passing of time, be rebuilt.The whole pattern of life, from birth to death, unfolds in terms of poetic imagery in \\"Farrebique.\\" Stop motion photography enhances the pictorial beauty of plant life bursting into full bloom and the growling majesty of a sudden summer storm, from the distant gathering of heavy black clouds. There is a repetitiveness of incident in \\"Farrebique\\" that might have been lessened by further editing, but otherwise here is a picture that will live long in the memory of those fortunate enough to come under its spell.

For \\"David and Bathsheba,\\" which was unveiled to the public last night at the newly-reopened Rivoli, is a reverential and sometimes majestic treatment of chronicles that have lived three millenia.That it avoids to a great extent the pagentry and overwhelmingly concocted spectacles of some Biblical productions which have emanated from Hollywood is apparent from the start. But that is a matter of taste. In concerning itself with an ageless romance, \\"David and Bathsheba\\" admirably achieves its goal.Scholars may find interpolations not in keeping with the simple and beautiful words set down in the Second Book of Samuel. But \\"David and Bathsheba,\\" which often is prolix and measured in its movement, does reveal one great trial in the life of its soldier-poet-king hero. And in this fusion of Old Testament and Technicolor that test of the man is given forceful characterization.Philip Dunne, who wrote the script","excerpt":"Henry King, the director, and Darryl F. Zanuck, Fox's production chief who personally handled the reins on this drama, have not completely ignored the fullness of David's career. Faced with a record that included a forty-year reign, they have—occasionally only by inference—illustrated the arrival of the Ark of the Covenant at the gates of Jerusalem, the battle against the Ammorites outside of Rabbah, Saul's bloody defeat at the Mount of Gilboa (by inference) and the storied slaying of Goliath by the youthful David.But these are footnotes to the basic business at hand. David, as pictured here, is the mature king sure of his domain and people and outspokenly aloof from his wives, especially Michal, Saul's daughter. And he is portrayed without whitewash as an obvious adulterer coveting Uriah the Hittite's wife, Bathsheba. He also is a brooding monarch beset by his awe of the Mosaic law but one who is ready to shoulder the guilt and direst of fates for his love.There is no attempt made—to the credit of all concerned—to make David a titan without faults. He is human enough to want to run away with Bathsheba when the populace led by the Prophet Nathan accuses him of adultery and its resulting disastrous effect on Israel's economy. And his mate is depicted as being aware of her guilt in the matter too. She confesses—and this, among other things, may cause debate from learned sources—that she had, in her wily woman's way, a great role in enticing her lover.In endowing David with the graces and shortcomings of a mortal, Mr. Dunne and company have made him an angry ruler but one who has never lost his zeal for his God or the Law of Moses. Ready to send Uriah the Hittite into \\"the hottest forefront of battle\\" in the knowledge that his loved one's husband thus will be killed, he is man enough to admit the horrible thought and deed. In his recital of the Twenty-third Psalm he is a lonely but truly pious man speaking his heart. And since God is his \\"Shepherd,\\" he is also ready to test His wrath and save his people from privation by sacrificing himself to the divine power of the Ark.Without a convincing David, as has been noted, this combination of romance and religion would have been merely a two-hour dissertation no more exciting than a lantern-slide lecture. However, in Gregory Peck's delineation the producers have an authoritative performance. He is a man filled with anguish at the death of Jonathan and of Saul. He is a King willing to forego his regal rights for his love and he is the frail vessel who movingly confesses his sins but one who also is strong enough to exclaim, \\"lift Thine hand from Thy people who suffer for my crimes.\\"Unfortunately, however, the rest of the cast is entirely overshadowed by this role. Bathsheba, as portrayed by Susan Hayward, is a Titian-tressed charmer who seems closer to Hollywood than to the arid Jerusalem of the Bible. Raymond Massey, as the bearded Prophet Nathan, is little more than a voice of doom in the wilderness. Kieron Moore, as Uriah; Jayne Meadows, as the vengeful Michal, and James Robertson Justice, as David's aide, Abishai, merely make casual, brief appearances.Having been mounted artistically, an age-old tale now takes on colorful dimensions. For all of its verbosity and occasional slickness and sensuality, \\"David and Bathsheba\\" makes its point with feeling and respect.

It is the thesis of Garry Wills's new book that \\"nothing has been more stable\\" in American history \\"than religious belief and practice,\\" that \\"religion has been at the center of our major political crises,\\" and that \\"the willed ignorance about religion\\" on the part of political reporters and historians reflects \\"a refusal to see the connection between Christian doctrine and politics.\\"   In the course of setting up this argument, Mr. Wills writes at length about the tendency of intellectuals to discount the importance of religion in this country. He notes that the same commentators who reported on the \\"death of God\\" fad that swept certain divinity schools in the 1960's have ignored or played down the potency of the evangelical movement. He points out that reporters focused on President Ronald Reagan's skills as a communicator, rather than on the fact that he was communicating religious attitudes. And he argues that \\"the 'educated' part of America\\" mistakenly assumed that the Scopes trial in 1925 was a victory for the evolutionary point of view -- when, in fact, Darwinism did not make a strong showing in textbooks until the 60's, when the Sputnik-generated rivalry with the Soviet Union focused new attention on the teaching of science in American schools.   Among the writers Mr. Wills singles out for their historical myopia are Henry Steele Commager and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., both of whom have written about the essential secularity of the American mind. \\"Commager and Schlesinger are to American history what Michael Dukakis was, in 1988, to American politics,\\" Mr. Wills writes. \\"Much of American (indeed, of human) experience is off their mental maps. They have a serene provincialism, dismissive of the ordinary torments of people less optimistic, irreverent, and pragmatic than they.\\"     But while Mr. Wills presents many of his arguments in this book as a kind of intellectual heresy, those views often represent a synthesis of other scholars' work in this same area. The historian Sydney Ahlstrom has made a strong case for Americans' sense of themselves as a \\"religious people\\"","excerpt":"Henry May has suggested that the vigor of American culture stems from the country's dialectic between secular and religious thought; and Richard Hofstadter has illuminated the links among fundamentalism, anti-intellectualism and right-wing politics in American life.   More recently -- last year, in fact -- two books appeared that underscored the hold that religion continues to exert on Americans' lives: Andrew Greeley's \\"Religious Change in America\\" (Harvard University Press) and \\"The People's Religion: American Faith in the 90's\\" by George Gallup Jr. and Jim Castelli (Macmillan). Indeed, Mr. Wills draws heavily upon the Gallup-Castelli study for statistics demonstrating the extent and nature of American piety:   Nine out of 10 American say they have never doubted the existence of God.   Eight out of 10 Americans say they believe in a Judgment Day.   Seven out of 10 Americans say they believe in life after death.   Thirty-seven percent of Americans say they believe in the Devil.   Forty percent of the American population attend church in a typical week.  Instead of trying to explain the social and historical reasons that make the United States the most religious nation in the developed world, Mr. Wills launches into a discursive -- and highly arbitrary -- discussion of the interplay between politics and religion in American life.     Considerable space is devoted to James Madison's and Thomas Jefferson's efforts to protect religion by separating church and state (a subject with which Mr. Wills seems fully at ease, having already set forth detailed examinations of both men's works in two earlier books, \\"Inventing America\\" and \\"Explaining America\\"), but such pivotal events as the Great Awakening are completely ignored. The Scopes trial and the current debates over abortion and pornography are held up to the light, but the issue of school prayer is mentioned only in passing. The bulk of this book consists of somewhat dated profiles of candidates in the 1988 Presidential race -- profiles that apparently represent amplified versions of stories Mr. Wills wrote for various periodicals during the campaign.   In these profiles, Mr. Wills tries to look at the candidates' own attitudes toward religion and the role that public attitudes toward religion played in shaping their campaigns. In the case of Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson, this sort of examination yields fairly obvious insights: the very fact that these two men, representing the extremes of Left and the Right, were ordained ministers forces the reader to acknowledge \\"the broad stratum of religion underlying American culture.\\"    With the other candidates, this approach devolves into more generalized assessments of character. Mr. Wills ends up reciting what are now familiar arguments about Gary Hart's lack of roots and a moral vocabulary, Michael Dukakis's lack of passion, and George Bush's successful exploitation of the themes of patriotism, religion, and law and order. When he tries to come up with a more original take on these men's personalities, the results tend to feel strained and pretentious.   He compares Mr. Hart to Don Giovanni, as someone who lives insistently in the present, unable to connect the future and the past. (\\"Donna Rice is the Zerlina of our story,\\" he writes.) In another chapter, he even more incongruously compares Mr. Dukakis to Hippolytus, Racine's ascetic hero who runs afoul of the gods. (Of the Dukakis aide John Sasso's fall from grace over campaign improprieties, Mr. Wills writes, \\"Dukakis's need for a Sasso, for some escape hatch from his own self-containment, is like Hippolytus' involvement, against his nature, with Phaedra, the stepmother who falls in love with him.\\")     Fortunately, these sorts of passages do not occur frequently in \\"Under God.\\" For the most part, the writing in this volume is intelligent and fiercely logical. Mr. Wills gives a surgical, if highly debatable, analysis of Mario M. Cuomo's stand on abortion (privately against it, publicly pro-choice), and he reveals the ironies contained in the religious Right's opposition to the strict separation of church and state.   Such controversial insights, however, do not add up to a cohesive book. In the end, \\"Under God\\" is a hodgepodge of thoughtful historical analysis and dated journalism, strongly articulated opinions and popularized recyclings of other people's research.

Thus the prizefight story has its own cast-iron mold, and when the information gets out that a new film is a slugging drama of the ring you can be pretty sure that it deals with a good-natured leather-pusher who, coincident with his rise in the sporting world, abandons his faithful wife or sweetheart for a society girl, hits the skids and finally returns penitently to the little woman. The rather pleasant prizefight film which was offered at the Rialto last night follows the formula in these matters. Acted with some proficiency and humor by Pat O'Brien and Glenda Farrell, it succeeds in working up a fair sum of interest, without ever threatening to become one of the distinguished films of the year.Working once again from the general to the specific, a visitor to the Rialto cannot help noting the rarity with which anything resembling reality crops up in the prizefights arranged for the motion-picture cameras. The opponents selected for the leading man usually pull their punches with such an earnest regard for the star's high-priced face that, if the same fight were staged before a real boxing audience, the house would be wrecked, the fighters lynched and the manager run out of town before you could shout \\"Fake!\\" In connection with \\"The Personality Kid,\\" they do say that Mr. O'Brien used to be the champion of Marquette University, that he was trained for the picture by Jackie Fields, and that two former champions, Mushy Callahan and Marvin Shechter, provided the opposition in the ring. All this impressive statistical work adds up to zero. Mr. O'Brien and his various opponents in the film paw each other like long-lost brothers and some of the theoretically sleep-producing blows would hardly jar the script girl.Anyhow, \\"The Personality Kid\\" tells how Mr. O'Brien goes after the middleweight title, with his wife, Miss Farrell, as the shrewd business manager. Although he lacks a punch, he is supposed to be such a dancing master that his helpless opponents cannot put a glove on him. Falling a victim to inflation of the ego, he becomes the lion of the swanky set, and spends too much of his time with the cool and superior Claire Dodd, a commercial artist. Then he discovers that his opponents have been performing a Georgia Coleman for him, so that his managers could build him up as a popular contender. When he learns that his wife was a party to the fraud, he quits her, becomes a failure, and then fights his way back when he finds that his wife is about to produce an heir.Thomas Jackson, one of the cinema's leading detectives, has dropped his badge for the moment and assumed the duties of a cynical sports writer. Then there are Clarence Muse, the always reliable Negro comedian, as the superstitious camp follower of the fighter","excerpt":"Henry O'Neill as an honest fight promoter, and Robert Gleckler as the promoter who arranges the set-ups.

Did they change, or was someone simply just eager to take an old vehicle out for a new spin? The answers can be found in the next 10 weeks at the Biograph Cinema, 225 West 57th Street, Manhattan, where a series called Sequels, Prequels and Close Relations centers on some familiar movie figures, showing us where they were going and where they had been.    No series on this subject would be complete without the trio of \\"Godfather\\" films (Aug. 25 to 31), or without the expertly paired Robin Hood duo that began its six-day run this week (the 1938 Errol Flynn swashbuckler, \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood,\\" and Richard Lester's 1976 \\"Robin and Marian,\\" with Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn).

Henrys have come in all sizes, from fat (Charles Laughton) to lean (Nicol Williamson in Broadway's \\"Rex\\"). But until now, he has never resembled Sir Launcelot. This is the case with the new musical \\"Six Wives,\\" in which Steve Barton, last seen in the romantic lead in \\"Phantom of the Opera,\\" plays Henry -- at least the young Henry -- as a handsome hero. By the time he gets to Queen No. 6, he has been slightly padded, but at no point does he simulate the Rabelaisian robustness of life and cinema.   The Edward Thomas-Joe Masteroff chamber musical (at the York Theater Company) begins with Henry addressing the audience confidentially. He mentions the familiarity of the king's life and wonders why there is need for still another version of his story. Good question, Henry. Then he says what will occur onstage is \\"all truthful, all historical, all chronological.\\" I would have preferred all singing. The book is ploddingly predictable, except for one out-of-sequence appearance by a later wife who is impatient for her turn. While Mr. Barton holds himself to the role of Henry, Tovah Feldshuh and Kim Crosby play all the queens (three Kates, two Annes, one Jane).
