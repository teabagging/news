Mr. Kim, who will play a recital at the 92d Street Y on Saturday night, now owns the 1716 ''Cessole'' Stradivarius. The instrument is named for Count Eugene de Cessole, of Nice, who owned the violin from 1845 to 1870 when he traded it for a Guarneri and a sum of money in cash.\\n\\nThere is a special mystique about the instruments that were made in Cremona, Italy, during the 17th and 18th centuries by Niccolo Amati, and especially Antonio Stradivari and Giuseppe B. Guarneri (also called del Gesu). No one knows what combination of wood, shape and varnish accounts for such supremacy, but most great string players play one or the other, and are often associated with the instrument's particular characteristics.
