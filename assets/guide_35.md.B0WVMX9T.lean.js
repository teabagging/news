It's about a mother whose strong Christian faith helps her to rehabilitate her drunken husband and her teen-age son, a car thief, and to encourage her pregnant teen-age daughter to finish her education in order to open a day-care center.

policy was signaled on Nov 6 in lr from Sec Kissinger--conspicuously addressed to Karami, not to Franjieh, and made public by embassy--that said US 'fully supports your Govt' in effort to ending fighting; Kissinger also wished Karami success in his effort to change Lebanon's pol system, which has effect of giving predominant role to Christian community though it is now a minority; US officials do not hide their belief that it is partly intransigence of some Christian leaders, including Franjieh, that is blocking reform; lr reptdly outraged Franjieh, who meets infrequently with US Amb G McMurtrie Godley; Godley is on good terms with Karami and is friend of Raymond Edde, Christian centralist who would like to succeed Franjieh in '76; US officials insist they are not involved in supplying arms to Christians, say US interest in Lebanon is that it should remain stable since instability endangers Kissinger's painstaking Middle East diplomacy; this assessment is widely accepted by Eur diplomats and others sympathetic to US policy in Middle East; some 3d world diplomats believe US needs Phalangists to keep Palestinian guerrilla movement preoccupied and on defensive, so as not to upset Kissinger's diplomacy; recall Repr Les Aspin's charge in July that Sarkis G Soghanalian, repr of Colt Industries, received embassy and Stale Dept approval for sale of $250,000 worth of handguns and ammunition to unspecified clients in Lebanon; Soghanalian, who is known to have contacts on Lebanese right, denies he intended to sell weapons to Phalangists, Palestinians or any of growing private armies; State Dept official reptdly stated that 2,000 Colt pistols were destined for Christian elements;

But there are hints that 1992 may have been the year when a trend toward ever-more-powerful patent claims began to reverse itself.   Such a reversal is hardly in full swing, as evidenced by some of the multimillion-dollar patent settlements that were reached last year. But after a decade in which the balance of power shifted decisively toward patent holders, there are signs of a change in sentiment both in the courts and at the Patent and Trademark Office.

Yanukovich had won, but international observers said there were systemic voting abuses and the opposition candidate refused to accept defeat.   A1    Iraqi Cleric and Soldiers Killed  A leading Sunni cleric was killed in a drive-by shooting in the northern city of Mosul, and American military officials in the city discovered the bodies of at least four more Iraqi Army soldiers killed by gunshots to the head. Insurgents are kidnapping and killing Iraqi soldiers and national guardsmen with shocking regularity, in part because insurgents have infiltrated the Iraqi security forces.   A14    Iraqi officials and American commanders plan to rely on Iraqi security forces to protect 9,000 polling places during the forthcoming elections, but there are far fewer trained security officers than Iraqi officials estimate are needed, and many have performed poorly.   A1    The first international conference aimed at easing the tensions created by the United States enterprise in Iraq will open today.   A14    Bush Promises Aid to Colombia  President Bush promised President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia that he would push Congress to add to the more than $3.3 billion Washington has spent since 2000 to destroy coca crops and support Colombia's battle against Marxist rebels.   A3    Iran's Nuclear Activity  Iran appears to have frozen major nuclear activities in an effort to persuade the world that it does not intend to build nuclear bombs, the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency said.   A6    Working Toward Mideast Vote  Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said that he had won a commitment from Israel to let Palestinians living in Jerusalem take part in elections in January and to ease conditions in the West Bank and Gaza so that Palestinians can more easily vote there as well. He also conferred with Palestinian leaders, praising them for their efforts.   A8    Yasir Arafat's nephew, Nasser al-Kidwa, said that according to medical records released to him by the French Ministry of Defense there were no traces of known poisons found in the Palestinian leader before he died, but that his cause of death remained a mystery.   A8    Violence Erupts in Sudan  Two clashes in the western Sudan region of Darfur left at least 25 people dead and forced the evacuation of aid workers less than two weeks after the Sudanese government and rebels reached a partial agreement aimed at ending the conflict there.   A11    Bhutto's Husband Out of Jail  Asif Ali Zardari, the husband of Paksitan's former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was released on $16,900 bail on the last of numerous corruption charges that have kept him in prison since 1996.   A3    NATIONAL   A16-22    Americans Show Concerns On Bush Agenda  Americans are optimistic about the next four years under President Bush, but have reservations about central elements of the second-term agenda he presented in defeating Senator John Kerry, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.   A1    Bush Pushes Spy Plan  President Bush has ordered an inter-agency group to come up with a plan that could expand the Defense Department's role into covert operations that have been a specialty of the Central Intelligence Agency, administration officials said.   A20    A number of Congressional Republicans and members of the Sept. 11 commission called on President Bush to force Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his military commanders to offer public support for a bill, blocked by House Republicans, that would overhaul the way government spy agencies gather and share intelligence.   A20    Charter Schools Underperform  A new study commissioned by the Department of Education, which compares the achievement of students in charter schools with those attending traditional public schools in five states, concluded that the charter schools were less likely to meet state performance standards, the authors said.   A21    Sixth Hunting Victim Dies  A sixth hunter died after a shooting incident in Wisconson that injured two others. Police arrested Chai Soua Vang in connection with the killings, but lack of a motive has left area residents baffled.   A16    Harvard Pays Managers Less  Harvard paid its top money managers a total of $78.4 million last year, a 27 percent decrease from the previous year, when their compensation provoked alumni criticism.   A19    New Drug Benefit Helps Most  A new study confirms that the drug benefit being added to Medicare will provide significant help to elderly people with low incomes or very high drug costs. But, it says, one in four people who sign up for the benefit will have to spend more of their own money for prescription drugs.   A16    Democrats Battle for Post  Early skirmishing has broken out in a race to lead the Democratic National Committee, with Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, among the Democrats said to be interested in replacing Terry McAuliffe at the party helm.   A21    Drug Testing Debated  America needs a better system to detect harmful effects of drugs that are already on the market, and it should be independent of the Food and Drug Administration and the drug industry, medical researchers and journal editors said.

A1    Velella Granted Reprieve  Just hours before he was to return to prison, former State Senator Guy J. Velella was given another week of freedom when a judge said she would need a week to consider whether a mayoral panel acted legally in ordering him back to jail.

''Born to Run,'' the first volume of Dave Marsh's quasi-authorized biography, appeared in 1979, and is now available along with its sequel, ''Glory Days,'' in a single volume called ''Bruce Springsteen: Two Hearts.'' Springsteen's lyrics, which frequently, if modestly, display their own literary pedigree, resonate in the prose of writers like Bobbie Ann Mason, Richard Ford, Stephen King (who prefaced his epic novel ''The Stand'' with a quotation from Springsteen's song ''Jungleland'') and T. C. Boyle, who took the title for his story collection ''Greasy Lake'' from imagery in a cut from Springsteen's first album.

In 1999, when he reunited the E Street Band for a long, triumphal tour, it seemed Springsteen's main enterprise would be the consolidation of his reputation as the greatest -- and perhaps also the last -- rocker to emerge from the ferment of the baby boom. His recent releases, apart from ''The Ghost of Tom Joad,'' had been mainly archival, and the reunion shows were devoted largely to breathing new life into old favorites and to a joyful, generous rock 'n' roll revivalism. But then came Sept.11, which called forth ''The Rising,'' his (and maybe anyone's) most convincing rock record since the Reagan era, and the 2004 election campaign, which occasioned Springsteen's first public endorsement (on the Op-Ed page of this newspaper) of a presidential candidate. Those events, and the release this spring of ''Devils & Dust,'' have sent the Bruceologists back to their desks, and the result is a spate of revisitings, reinterpretations, reissues and recyclings, from rock critics, psychiatrists, historians and fiction writers.

Although the picture only runs an hour and thirty minutes—this is a decided improvement over the usual two-hours-plus length of Mexican productions—it has been directed at such a slow pace that it fails to hold interest. If the producers had sharpened the action by deleting another fifteen minutes, many of the scenes could have been shortened to advantage and \\"Flor Sylvestre\\" would have been a much more effective entertainment for American audiences.The story of the revolution against the land owners is told in flashback by the beauteous peasant girl Esperanza (Dolores Del Rio) who many years previously had been married to the son of a haciendado and had suffered the full consequences of social injustice. The trouble is that the picture makes the audience suffer her every hardship, which struck us as carrying things too far, especially since the revolution is depicted in more or less comic-opera fashion.

But family-friendly is one thing","excerpt":"romance is quite another concept. The gorgeous oceanfront room with its king-sized bed whispered, ''Ravish me!'' while our daughter pushed past us, shouting, ''Cookies!''    THE LOCATION: Situated on the sunny Kona coast of the Big Island, this resort may be the most stunning of the company's three (soon to be four) Hawaiian destinations. Low-key two-story accommodations unwind along tiki-torch-lighted pathways, evoking a Polynesian-themed camp for rich people. But don't come for the beaches. Lava rock, shallow reefs and prickly sea urchins persuade most guests to confine their swimming to a small protected lagoon and to King's Pond, carved from lava rock and stocked with 3,500 fish, as well as the hotel's five pools.    THE KID SCENE: For parents of children aged 5 to 12, the resort's seven-day-a-week Kids for All Seasons program is like mainlining freedom, at least during the camp's regular hours of 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (We took pity on the exhausted-looking counselor pulling a double shift, who pointed out that our daughter was the only child staying after 3:30, and we dutifully retrieved her.) Your child's day is broken into a half-dozen or so activities, including several hours at the family-oriented Sea Shell Pool (which, when top-heavy with children, bears little resemblance to the serene infinity-edged pool fronting the resort's Web site). Electives like rock climbing or canoe lessons cost extra, as does room-service-priced lunch ($17.50, including choice of milkshake). Private time for parents of the under-5 set is pricier but attainable: with 24 hours' notice, the resort will arrange a nanny for $16 an hour (three-hour minimum), and kids under 5 may attend camp with a sitter in tow.    THE ROOMS: Our romantic, expansive, ocean-view prime room, with its huge walk-in closet ($825 plus taxes) easily accommodated our family of three (no extra charge for kids). Only our daughter's name spelled out in multicolored sponges in the lavish bathroom and a slight thickening around our midsections served as reminders that we were not on our original honeymoon.    THE BATHROOMS: These oversize slate-tiled, earth-toned chambers can fit a family of six, plus two in the soaking tub, and three in the cavernous shower lined with L'Occitane bath products. Lower-level rooms feature outdoor showers with lava-rock walls and bamboo roofs.    AMENITIES: The decade-old 32-acre resort features golf, tennis, a spa and a gym. Free poolside fruit kabobs, Evian spritzers and sunglass cleaning are nice touches.    ROOM SERVICE: Our daughter's regular doses of cheese pizza ($8) arrived without mishap, but red Thai curry chicken ($33) came sans chicken. There's a $4 service charge plus an 18 percent tip tacked onto the already buoyant prices.    THE BOTTOM LINE: Despite rumblings from other guests about service having dropped a notch (we did encounter some lackluster pool attendants who didn't seem $825-a-night joyful about taking care of our every poolside need), the supervised kids' programs exceeded our expectations and freed plenty of (day)time for canoodling in paradise. Rooms start at $625 for golf-ocean view; suites start at $1,050 a night.     The Four Seasons Resort Hualalai, 100 Kaupulehu Drive, www.fourseasons.com/hualalai; 808-325-8000.

This is the facetious beginning of a tale which includes in its telling some passing mention of a strike, a hurricane and the pianist's deranged wife. It is the kind of tale made possible, but not excused, by the willingness of Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne to attempt to repeat, for the matinee trade, the type of star-crossed romance more happily expressed a few months back in \\"Love Affair.\\"Hollywood, like any mental laggard, seems unable to understand that spontaneity is almost the first requirement of a picture, that almost nothing operates more deadeningly than the opportunist system of recalling the starring team of one of these spontaneous hits, hiring a writer to turn out a script along the lines of such-and-such and inviting a director to produce a second so-and-so. Mr. Boyer, with the charm that has made him one of our few authentic matinee idols, and Miss Dunne, always a pleasant and sincere performer, are unequal to the task of bringing life and conviction to James Cain's made-to-order script. Director John Stahl, a notorious softy, is no match for it himself. With due deference to the ardent ladies who come to warm themselves before the glowing Mr. Boyer yesterday, the drama they saw was tosh.It is a story of transparent fortuitousness. To free the waitress from her tray-carting duties, there is a strike. To provide the last touch of intimacy to her Long Island rendezvous with the pianist, there is a hurricane which isolates them in a church's organ loft. To present the one, unlooked-for barrier to their love, there is not merely the wife (for that is no real obstacle at all), but a wife who had become crazed when her child was still-born. To complete his cycle, Mr. Cain need only have killed off the wife either in the strike or in the hurricane. That he did not is a small point to his credit and one, we do not doubt, which will be held against him by 90 per cent of the film's feminine patrons. After all, if it must be tosh, why not a complete job of it?

As a young, widowed Parisienne recruit who unluckily falls in love with an enemy, the sinuous, shapely Françoise Arnoul perfectly epitomizes the title (her Gestapo nickname).Indeed, the first and best half of this Ellis Films import tiptoed across the World Theatre screen Saturday with the quiet stealth of a cat. If the footing eventually seems less sure and a bit self-conscious, blame it on two beset sweethearts, Mlle. Arnoul and Bernard Wicki, whose plight familiarly over-shadows the war.That the picture generally sustains credibility and suspense is due primarily to Henri Decoin, the director and co-scenarist. With a good cast and an eagle-eyed photographer (Pierre Montazel), M. Decoin has nimbly paced a rather economical production and pulled it taut with a minimum of dialogue. The opening scene, a Gestapo raid with the quarry clawing at a high window ledge, should settle any audience speculation about Resistance movies being a little dated now after so many.Likewise the tingling sequence that follows, as Mlle. Arnoul and a handful of confederates filch some German rocket blueprints from a nest of Nazis in the provinces. M. Decoin has staged some fine clinical pantomime in the saboteurs secret laboratory. This tensely atmospheric quality, along with the good English titles, also applies to several scenes in a Paris bar, where the lonely heroine meets an attractive stranger.On its own terms, the ensuing romance that dominates the rest of the picture makes certainly an engaging one, tenderly played by Mlle. Arnoul and M. Wicki. Although the ending is logically grim (if drawn out), it hinges on a familiar question: Should an enemy soldier sacrifice the woman he loves?What puzzles us is the affair's comparative isolation under some extremely shrewd Nazi and Resistance noses. There should have been a crossfire of intrigue. For that matter, why should an entire band of saboteurs expose themselves in enemy territory only to watch four colleagues load a plane? Also, a saboteur spy is unmasked after a fatal delay by a simple check with a business office. The phone would have sufficed.The performances are uniformly sound, in addition to those of Mlle. Arnoul and M. Wicki. Roger Hanin, André Versini and Louise Roblin are grimly believable as the Resistance crew, and Bernard Blier, as their leader, is excellent. As a lecherous Nazi captain, Kurt Meisel seems slightly overdrawn.M. Decoin has fashioned a trim and interesting \\"Cat\\" that should have been stronger.

It delivers on-the-go freedom at an affordable price, around $1 less per three-minute phone call, than a conventional cellular phone call, which is about $1.70.

She has appeared in several British dialogue films and was seen here last September in the short-lived dramatization of Ernest Hemingway's book, \\"Farewell to Arms.\\"In this current screen production Miss Landi displays consummate ease in her work. Her performance is apparently effortless, yet always impressive. She speaks English fluently, in this instance like an English girl who has associated with Americans for a year or so. She may not be beautiful, although at certain angles she is very attractive. She has, however, a fascinating personality and lends considerable distinction to all her scenes. Her lines are uttered with feeling and her facial expressions give a sensitive conception of the mental reactions of the character.Charles Farrell, who plays opposite Miss Landi, reveals still further improvement in his acting, but Alfred Santell, the director, has not always succeeded in eliciting the true mood expected from the individual Mr. Farrell impersonates.The title, \\"Body and Soul,\\" might suit many other films far better than it does this one. It is a title calculated to draw in passers-by. Actually the story here deals with flyers and a dash of spying. And in spite of a climactic incident, one cannot say that there is much in the way of drama in this venture. It is, as a matter of fact, rather confused in some sequences and in the closing stretches matters are decidedly forced.Several American flyers are attached to a Royal Air Force Squadron, among them being Mal Andrews (Mr. Farrell), Jim Watson and Tap Johnson. A British general lectures the squadron on not getting results, his harangue being anything but tactful. He wants an enemy balloon brought down and Jim Watson is killed in attempting the feat, which is eventually accomplished by Andrews, who has his own way of seeing that Watson receives posthumous credit for the success of attack.Then there is a girl referred to as Pom-Pom (Miss Landi), who is supposed to be an inamorata of Jim's. Andrews finds her and tells her of Watson's death. Soon Andrews and he supposed Pom-Pom become interested in each other. Andrews is ???lad who is pictured for the greater part of the picture as being as innocent of wrongdoing as a babe in arms. He sprays perfume on himself and gargles brandy to make his comrades think that he has spent a riotous evening. In a restaurant in London he pours out wine and slyly losses it away, and, to his surprise, he learns that Pom-Pom has been doing likewise.Subsequently, Pom-Pom, or Carla, as is her real name, is suspected of being a spy, nobody being surer of it than one Alice Lester. It is thought that Carla is responsible for giving information through which Tap Johnson loses his life, but things turn out as one anticipates immediately this espionage interlude is rung in.There are several effective flying episodes, but after all the whole production hinges on the excellent portrayal of Elissa Landi.Myrna Loy does well with the minor role of Alice Lester. Humphrey Bogart is earnest as Jim Watson, and Donald Dillaway acquits himself favorably as the valorous Tap Johnson. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Romantic War Fliers. A Flash in Tin Pan Alley.

He was a leading proponent of the system of Special Drawing Rights set up by international monetary agencies to increase monetary liquidity by getting around the somewhat restrictive gold-standard system.   Born in Lecco, Italy, and educated at the Bocconi University in Milan and at the London School of Economics, Mr. Ossola was the former director of the central bank of Italy.    He was with the bank for almost 40 years, first in the research department and later as its foreign representative in London, Lisbon and Paris. He served as deputy director from 1965 to 1975, and as director from 1975 to 1976, when he left to become Italy's Minister of Foreign Trade. He held this position until 1979 and helped reform Italy's foreign trade regulations and encouraged exports.    He also served for many years as chairman of the committee of deputies of the \\"Group of Ten,\\" the key international monitary organization made up of finance ministers of the 10 most industrialized nations.

It also has an easy path to 9-1. The Cowboys, who lead the National Conference East, play the 3-6 Rams, who trail the N.F.C. West.    With four interconference games and five interdivision contests on tap, the weekend's major interest will be on two of the five intradivision games, involving four of the league's five 7-2 teams. On Sunday, New Orleans and San Franciso fight it out for the undisputed leadin the N.F.C. West, and Buffalo and Miami do the same thing in the A.F.C. East on Monday night. In a possible, if unlikely, Super Bowl preview, the other 7-2 team, Minnesota, which is far ahead in the N.F.C. Central, crosses conference lines to play the 5-4 Oilers, who are on a possible wild-card pace in the A.F.C. Central. New England Patriots    Take a team that has gone 0 for 9 and has allowed a league-leading 42 sacks and you have a team with a quarterback problem. With original starter Hugh Millen resuming practice yesterday for the first time since suffering a shoulder separation three games ago and first backup Tommy Hodson out with a broken thumb, second backup Scott Zolak, who took over for Hodson in the fourth quarter of last Sunday's loss to the Saints, will be making his first National Football League start on Sunday, against the Colts. Waiting nervously on the sideline will be new fodder, Jeff Carlson, a one-time Buccaneer who spent the summer in the Giants training camp. Tampa Bay Buccaneers    An accomplished 12-year veteran who kicks a 52-yard field goal in his only attempt as a one-game substitute for an injured regular shouldn't have to wait long to find more work. Sure enough, two weeks after he was waived by the Chiefs, Eddie Murray was being measured for a new uniform, this time in Tampa Bay. Until he was waived by the Lions during training camp, Murray had spent 12 stellar seasons in Detroit. To date he has connected on 245 of 382 field-goal attempts and is 14th on the career scoring list, with 1,116 points.   Murray, who had been hired by the Chiefs as a temporary fill-in for the injured Nick Lowery, hopes to make a season of it this time. His Tampa Bay predecessor, Ken Willis, won't be back. He was waived after missing four of his last five field-goal attempts, including both chances in the loss to the Vikings. Los Angeles Raiders    You've tried two starting quarterbacks this season. One is 0-2. The other is 3-4. Which one do you start against the Seahawks this weekend? The one who is 5-0 against the Seahawks, of course. That helps explain why Jay Schroeder, benched after the second game of the season, will be starting on Sunday while Todd Marinovich returns to the sideline after two dismal outings. Green Bay Packers  Alfred (Snatch) Oglesby, the kidnapping prone former Miami nose tackle, has been signed as a backup to starter John Jurkovic. He replaces Danny Noonan, who was waived after failing to live up to his early season promise. Oglesby, a three-year veteran who started 12 games last year, was relegated to backup duties this season and released by Miami on Oct. 20, not, the Dolphins insisted, because of his bizarre preseason ploy in which he concocted a kidnapping story as a coverup for missing practice. Minnesota Vikings    He may be too nice a guy to complain, but come on guys, couldn't somebody give Mike Merriweather a little help on defense? Does the linebacker have to do it all? O.K., so he didn't do it    all   . In fact, Merriweather made only 19 tackles in the victory over the Buccaneers, and he actually did have some help on four of them. Still by the time they got through counting tackles over the weekend, Merriweather was so far ahead he was named N.F.C. defensive player of the week. uffalo Bills     When you lead the league in total yards from scrimmage (1,151) so much is expected of you it's hard to turn heads in any one game. It took some doing, but Thurman Thomas managed to do just that in the victory over the Steelers on Sunday. Rushing for 155 yards and a touchdown on a career-high 37 carries made Thomas the A.F.C. offensive player of the week, the fourth time he has earned that honor in his career. Kansas City Chiefs    What's in a name? Call it coincidence, but what the Buffalo Thomas was doing on offense on Sunday, the Kansas City Thomas was doing on defense. After making nine tackles, including four sacks, forcing two fumbles that led to scores and recovering one of them in the victory over the Chargers, linebacker Derrick Thomas was named the A.F.C. defensive player of the week, his fifth such honor since joining the Chiefs in 1989. Chicago Bears    Saying that \\"when you're scratching and crawling, you have to find something,\\" Coach Mike Ditka shook up the team for Sunday's game at Tampa Bay in an effort to break a two-game losing streak.

While most consider the veto a negative power, the Founders conceived of it as a revisionary tool, which afforded President and Congress a final chance to revise and improve legislative proposals. That the veto is viewed primarily as negative reflects history, not the Founders' vision.    President Bush is not, as Professor Teitel asserts, blithely defying the original intent of the framers by vetoing 20 bills in two years. Impressions to the contrary notwithstanding, the Constitution sets no limits on the frequency or circumstances of veto. Mr. Bush is not violating original intent, but rather the practices of early Presidents, who used the veto rarely because of the lack of necessity and of guiding precedent.    President Bush's veto per-year average of 10 hardly upsets the Constitution's balance of powers, any more than John F. Kennedy's yearly average of 10.5, Dwight D. Eisenhower's 22.6 or Harry S. Truman's 31.2. And Jimmy Carter vetoed 31 bills (29 public, 2 private), not 26","excerpt":"Ronald Reagan vetoed 78 bills, not 65.   The \\"odious royal veto\\" to which Mr. Teitel refers was an absolute veto, not subject to override -- a circumstance applicable only to the President's pocket veto, a power that the Constitution does circumscribe.    Finally, I share Professor Teitel's outrage at Mr. Bush's veto of the Civil Rights Act, the Family Leave Act and other bills. But that outrage is unrelated to the constitutional basis of the veto power. ROBERT J.

Later, warned that they are out to kill him, he refuses to run away. The story's outstanding merit is that the whys and wherefores are never explained, leaving the reader to imagine what he will.With Burt Lancaster as the Swede and Ava Gardner in a freshly invented femme fatale role, the 1946 film opened with an exact rendition of the terse original, then embroidered an \\"explanation\\" of its ambiguities into a taut and clever gangster melodrama. It was probably the screen's most successful attempt to capture the Hemingway mood.Now, Universal has updated the tale for an inexpensive remake, in color, with a reasonable cast, a visual-minded director and plenty of excessively modern violence. The result arrived yesterday at the Embassy and 16 other theaters around town, cofeatured at many with a cheap sex farce called \\"The Private Lives of Adam and Eve.\\"What the studio neglected to supply was a script. The cliché-ridden rewrite substitutes racing cars for the protagonist's boxing metier, and has him working at an institute for the blind instead of the old-fashioned hash house. There the inspiration ends.The rest resembles one of those remakes of old Hollywood movies that television used to serve up in its early days — usually with Anita Ekberg in the old Ingrid Bergman roles, and the plots compressed into 60 minutes minus commercials. It is all close-ups and broad cutting effects, with the subtle character development and the more cinematic sequences neatly omitted.Donald Siegel, a talented director, is too handicapped by his limited means to do much with the fragments of plot about a fall guy involved with a mail robbery, a devious redhead and double-crosses following in predictable sequence. His actors seem dispirited by the script, although Angie Dickinson is all woman as the femme fatale and Lee Marvin plays one of the killers with laconic authority. John Cassavetes is merely dull as the fall guy","excerpt":"Ronald Regan ill at ease as the criminal mastermind, and a newcomer, Clu Gulager, overdoes the companion killer role.Hemingway is the victim in all of this.

McCarrick, head of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, and Bishop John S. Spong, head of Newark's Episcopal Diocese.   The episode that brought the criticism began last month, when Bishop Spong defended a document, drafted by a committee of his diocese, that said the Catholic \\"position on women\\" was \\"so insulting, so retrograde,\\" that women should abandon the church \\"for their own humanity.\\"   Bishop Spong said the language in the document \\"may not be the language I would have used.\\" But, he said, he welcomed the document because the airing of opinions was important, and he sent it on for further study within the diocese.    In response, Archbishop McCarrick wrote in his diocesean newspaper that the comments constituted \\"open hostility\\" and \\"Catholic bashing.\\" The Archbishop also suggested that Bishop Spong was creating \\"a church without morals.\\"   The interdenominational group's criticism of both prelates came earlier this month in a statement that was signed by the organization's co-chairmen, Bishop A. Theodore Eastman of the Epsicopal Diocese of Maryland and Archbishop John F. Whealon of the Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford.   \\"We call on members of both our churches to put the best interpretations, rather than the worst, on the the actions and positions of others,\\" the statement said.    The statement did not deal with another controversy involving Bishop Spong, who on Feb. 1 published a book suggesting that St. Paul was a \\"self-loathing and repressed gay male.\\"  4 Languages Added     For those who keep track of such things, the number of languages in which the Bible has been rendered around the world grew by four in 1990. The United Bible Societies announced last week that complete Bibles, with Old and New Testaments, were now available in 318 languages and dialects.   And the number of languages in which parts of the Bible, including one or more books, has been translated grew to 1,946, an increase of 18 over 1989.   The four new complete Bibles are in Ranau Dusun and Kayan, languages of Malaysia","excerpt":"Rongmei Naga, a language of India, and Chimborazo Quichua, a language of Ecuador.   In releasing the data, Dr. John D. Erickson, the general secretary-elect of the United Bible Societies and a vice president of the American Bible Society, said, \\"Every year at this time everyone looks forward to the release of these figures because they represent the millions of people who now have, for the first time, the Christian Scriptures in their own 'heart' language.\\"  Gas Mask Rights     An American Reform rabbi who often criticizes Israel's Orthodox Jews for what he has called their tyranny over religious life in Israel is now defending their right to get special gas masks.    \\"It is neither necessary nor fair to require any Orthodox Jew to shave his beard so he can wear a gas mask that may save his life,\\" said the rabbi, Alexander M. Schindler, president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.    Many Orthodox men who wear beards have insisted that they be given protective hoods that fit over the beards rather than the standard-issue gas masks given to most Israelis as protection against any Iraqi chemical attack. But many secular Jews in Israel have contended that the Orthodox should not be given preferential treatment and that the hoods, which are less constricting and also more expensive, should go only to those who need them most: children and people with medical conditions that make it difficult for them to breathe.    \\"Obviously,\\" Rabbi Schindler said, \\"those with physical handicaps who must have such masks should receive first priority.\\" But he added, \\"The authorities in Israel should take whatever steps are necessary to accommodate themselves to this important principle of civil rights.\\"  For the Flock That Rocks     Ever since Jesus was baptized in the Jordan River, Christians have been initiated into the faith in lakes, streams, oceans, swimming pools and the baptismal fonts of churches. Now comes word from California of a new baptismal frontier: the hot tub.   Earlier this month the New Song Church held a baptism ceremony for 30 new Christians, who splashed about the outdoor spas of the Puddingstone Hot Tubs Resort in San Dimas, a suburb of Los Angeles.    The New Song Church, whose Baptist congregation describes itself as \\"the flock that likes to rock,\\" draws up to 1,000 people each Sunday to services in a rented junior high school gymnasium. The average age of members is 27, and most are single.   The Rev. Sandy Herbold, the associate pastor, acknowledged that hot tubs were usually associated with \\"sybaritic pursuits,\\" but added: \\"The holiness is in the act of the baptism. It isn't in the place. It isn't in the water. It is in the heart of the person.\\" Religion Notes"},{"year":"1964","title":"ADLER&#8212","excerpt":"Roni Beth, cherished daughter of Joyce and Fabian, loving sister of Eric and Amy, beloved granddaughter of Samuel and Sophie Adler and Samuel and Yetta Rothman.
