The members of Congress and commentators who argue otherwise ignore international law, specifically United States obligations under the United Nations Charter.   Article 6 of the Constitution makes international treaties, including the United Nations Charter, part of the \\"supreme law of the land.\\" The Charter is part of United States law, signed by the President and ratified by two-thirds vote of the Senate.   Article 42 of the Charter provides authority for the Security Council to take military action and to authorize \\"operations by air, sea or land forces of members of the United Nations.\\" Regarding Iraq, the Security Council has now done that. Articles 48 and 49 of the Charter require member nations to carry out decisions of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security.   The only other case when the Security Council authorized military action by United Nations members was in Korea in 1950. In Korea, as with Kuwait, Security Council resolutions recommended and authorized, but did not order, United Nations members to take military action to assist the Republic of Korea against armed attack. In Korea, Congress did not declare war. Yet hundreds of thousands of United States troops fought there as the United States carried out its United Nations obligations.   Security Council Resolution 678 authorizes members of the United Nations to \\"use all necessary means,\\" including armed force, to assist Kuwait in its defense against Iraq's invasion. If Iraq does not withdraw from Kuwait, as it has been ordered to do by the Security Council, the United States will have legal authority to take military action.    As in the Korean \\"police action,\\" the United States will be acting under the United Nations Charter. To execute such United Nations-authorized police action, the President need not obtain the legal authority of a Congressional declaration of war. He already has such legal authority under the United Nations Charter, constitutionally part of the supreme law of the land. GREGORY STANTON  Prof. of Law, Washington & Lee U.

They are hard working funsters who will do anything to get a laugh in, and, in \\"Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man,\\" they do just about everything. It would be a pleasure to report that we had been rolling in the aisle yesterday at the Capitol, but that would be an exaggeration. The boys try hard and, on the whole, they appear to have recaptured a good deal of their old spunk, but their efforts are not always rewarding over the picture's eighty-two minutes running time.Not that a story line means anything to A & C—but this time they are a pair of private detectives working for an invisible client—a middleweight title contender—who must prove that he did not murder his manager. Some modestly amusing situations help pass the time until the plot thickens to the point where roly-poly Lou finds himself in a bout with Rocky Hanlon. Lou's invisible client, Tommy Nelson, will actually throw the haymakers, of course, but things reach a high degree of helter-skelter fun when Nelson suddenly deserts the ring. For sheer slapstick tomfoolery this fight is one of the funniest things Abbott and Costello have had to offer in a long, long while.Arthur Franz is as good as Claude Rains ever was as the invisible man (no comment, please, on that critical observation) and Nancy Guild and Adele Jergens lend a nice decorative touch to the proceedings.
