Since the Museum of Modern Art owns the Mies van der Rohe archive, and thus has under its own roof the lion's share of important drawings, models and photographs of Mies's work, there seemed all the more reason to assume that this exhibition, organized by Arthur Drexler, would leave no room for other statements about Mies.

In France, we might have a pot-au-feu after the New Year's celebration -- which is essentially boiled lean cuts of meat, carrots, turnips, onions, leeks, celery, potatoes and parsnips. The broth yielded by this combination of ingredients is sublime.   The American equivalent of pot-au-feu is the traditional New England boiled dinner. Eighteenth-century American cooks boiled many foods, believing that this was the most salubrious method of cooking. In the first cookbook written by an American -- \\"1796 American Cookery,\\" by Amelia Simmons -- boiled meat dishes are common. Little is known about Amelia Simmons, except that she lived near Hartford, and described herself in the book as \\"an American orphan.\\"   One of the most popular recipes was for Alamode Beef, in which less tender cuts of beef were larded, seasoned and boiled with lots of herbs. The New England boiled dinner is a logical evolution of that.   In my recipe, smoked shoulder or butt of pork is combined with winter vegetables and chicken quarters. The smoked pork is already cooked, which greatly reduces boiling time. The chicken legs and thighs go in last because they cook quickly. Serve guests a little of each ingredient along with Dijon-style mustard, grated horseradish and cornichons.   A mixed green salad is all you need on the side.

''Lolita'' is unlike most controversial books in that its edge has not dulled over time. Where ''Ulysses'' and ''Lady Chatterley's Lover,'' say, now seem familiar and inoffensive, almost quaint, Nabokov's masterpiece is, if anything, more disturbing than it used to be.      Scrupulousness might have argued for waiting a few years to memorialize it, since the book did not come out in this country until 1958. Nabokov finished it in December 1953, and according to his biography by Brian Boyd, sent it to five American publishers: Viking","excerpt":"Simon & Schuster; New Directions; Farrar, Straus; and Doubleday.

For the gist of this dizzy demonstration of a quarrelsome theatrical husband and wife who are cast as a cozy Mr. and Mrs. on a B. B. C. serial TV show is that the broadcasting business is frenzied, fantastic and inchoate—which, of course, is precisely what ours is, according to American films.If you don't believe it, observe this thespian couple. They are about to separate when they are picked to play Simon and Laura, the ideal lovey doves. So what happens? They are turned topsy-turvy by the mad demands made upon them in the gadget-filled crazy-house caverns of the B. B. C. studio.They are made to be saccharine sweethearts when they would like to cut each other's throats. The suggestion is even made to them that their rating might rise if they would have a child. In lieu of that desperate consummation, they are saddled with an adopted son on their show. This leads to further mad confusion. Oh, they have quite a time at the B. B. C.But we sadly suspect that Peter Blackmore, who wrote the script for this affair, found the prospect more hilarious than it is made to appear on the screen. Somehow the farcical confusion around the studio is pretty forced and flat. And the fact that the climactic action is a drunken brawl on the supposedly happy Christmas show gives a pretty good idea of the extremity to which he is forced to go.Performing the histrionic couple are Peter Finch and Kay Kendall, the girl who distinguished herself as the virtuoso on the trumpet in \\"Genevieve.\\" Mr. Finch is in dire circumstances. Miss Kendall, at least, has her looks to compel undivided admiration in the embarrassing straits through which they have to go. In color and VistaVision, not to mention an assortment of low-cut gowns, Miss Kendall is something to sit and look at, hilarious comedy or no.Ian Carmichael cuts a funny figure as a producer for the B. B. C. and Thora Hird is most amusing in a brief role as a suddenly televised maid. Maurice Denham as a hammy butler and Clive Parritt as the \\"adopted\\" brat add bits of brightness under the busy direction of Muriel Box.\\"Simon and Laura\\" takes an idea that is pretty pat at the start and makes it even patter—or just patter — as it goes along.

Mr. Viola, who was born in Flushing, Queens, in 1951, began working with video in the early 1970's, when the medium was in its infancy. He came to it not from painting or sculpture, as most video artists of the period did, but from electronic music, which he studied at Syracuse University. Since then, he has moved from making elaborately edited videotapes to an almost exclusive concentration on video installations in which his tapes, often of himself and his family, are projected into the viewer's space with increasingly complex results.

The Chicago carriage trade, long indignant at shoddy road versions of New York hits, blistered their palms, and Chicago critics dusted off their flaming adjectives, made stunned comparisons to Jeanne Eagels and Bernhardt.Without warning a new star had sprung full-blown onto, of all places, a Midwest stage, and in a single night Uta Hagen had leaped from comparative anonymity to a stellar place in the neon-lighted night sky.New York critics, visibly shaken but still dubious, bided their time while Miss Hagen took to the road in a tour that observers of such phenomena agreed was unparalleled since the days when Hayes and Cornell aroused the hinterlands.Her grateful producers promoted her to the New York company, and Miss Hagen returned to Broadway on the tail of a Midwest comet Moving with equal ease from the fantasy-ridden Blanche to Clifford Odets' phlegmatic \\"Country Girl,\\" she spent the next two years collecting such critical kudos as few actresses acquire in a lifetime.The final verdict may be brought in next Thursday night when the Theatre Guild raises the curtain on the tall girl from Wisconsin as the fiery Maid of Orleans in Shaw's \\"Saint Joan,\\" the first Joan to appear on Broadway since Cornell played her ten years ago.SHE lives with her daughter, Letty Ferrer, product of her dissolved marriage to José Ferrer, in a high-ceilinged old apartment overlooking Washington Square. There is no maid, no chaise longue, no temperament, no hostess gown","excerpt":"simply a big-boned, ash-blond girl with short-cropped hair, wearing a washdress and sandals, who, in rare moments of repose, is reminiscent of Bergman. Driving, candid, engagingly casual, she doesn't faintly resemble the faded flower of Southern womanhood that brought her fame.Bookcases range the quiet room—Kafka, Chekov, Freud, Willa Cather, Eliot—a Bach quartet rests in the piano rack, two excellent Paul Klees, gifts from Ferrer, hang alongside a unique diploma with which her friend Saul Steinberg commemorated her graduation from \\"Streetcar.\\" An intense, intellectual girl furiously determined not to get trapped in the small, incestuous life of the theatre, she is constantly involved in a welter of non-theatrical activities, foremost among which is Letty.LETTY is 8-going-on-9 and in the fifth grade of the Grace Church school on East Tenth Street. At the moment she thinks she'll be a veterinarian, but she loves the theatre, always accompanies her mother to matinees. She particularly liked \\"The Lady's Not for Burning,\\" once she had damnation explained to her, and she thought the last scene of \\"Streetcar\\" was fine, when the men carted her mother off in a truck. But she would only watch \\"Country Girl\\" from the wings, within trotting distance of the dressing room in case she got upset, since Mr. Odets' version of backstage life was closer to her own experience than the carnal heat of Mr. Williams' New Orleans tenement.On a rare occasion a few years back, when her mother appeared in a comedy, \\"The \\"Whole World Over,\\" Lefty's sniffling was audible throughout the theatre. Swollen with tears, she sought out her mother during intermission, demanded to know when she was going to die.\\"But darling,\\" Miss Hagen said, mopping up the small face, \\"I told you this was a comedy. I don't die at all.\\"Letty stopped crying and looked at her indignantly. \\"That's mean, mother!\\" she said furiously. \\"You have to. You always do.\\"It is only since her divorce that Uta Hagen has considered acting a serious career. She credits the transition to Blanche DuBois, but old friends maintain that before her divorce she had subordinated her career to her husband's.\\"It's funny,\\" she said recently in her oddly husky voice, \\"but the times I've been really happy I've had no desire to act. An actress gets rid of all her emotional steam on the stage, just as a painter with a hatred of the machine age vents his rage on canvas. An analyst once told me that a serious artist should never be analyzed, since if it were successful his powers of communication would be dissipated.\\" She grinned. \\"That's me. When I'm truly content—look, ma, no message.\\"A DOMESTIC animal by her own admission—\\"although press agents have made it a suspect statement\\"—she loves to cook, bakes her own bread—\\"occupational therapy, and anyway it tastes fabulous.\\" A fellow \\"Streetcar\\" traveler reports that five drawers of her wardrobe trunk held hot plates, pots and pans, the sixth contained her wardrobe.They entertain at home twice a week, with Letty in charge of the hors d'oeuvres (specialties: devilled eggs, stuffed celery), Uta at the stove: \\"frogs legs, anything in aspic, sensational souffles.\\" Sundays they stay home and putter, bar all visitors. Between they have a formidable weekly schedule. Letty takes singing, dancing and swimming lessons; her mother's off-stage activities currently include Spanish, Russian (she reads Chekov in the original), double-crostics (she only uses reference books when working) and going off on tangents.One of these is teaching a class of professional actors in scene study at the Herbert Berghoff School \\"to really see, hear, listen, exist. Not to pretend to exist,\\" she says fiercely, \\"as they learn in bad dramatic schools. You can't act love by panting and melting your eyes center stage. Love is the net result of something. I love Letty and to show it I might beat the stuffing out of her when she crosses the street without me; an action of love. In Joan I don't act holiness by raising my eyes and lowering my voice. I believe in my voices and to prove it I beat on the table and say, \\"God-dam it, I hear voices.\\" The Steinberg diploma shuddered against the wall.WHEN she discusses acting she projects the same emotional intensity she does on stage. \\"There's a schism in today's theatre. The good rising actors—Brando, Steve Hill, Eli Wallach, Maureen Stapleton, Mildred Dunnock—under directors like Clurman, Strasberg and Kazan have learned that the theatre is a craft, in which you must constantly study, dig, explore yourself, to create a role. The old days of relying on a bag of tricks and a big personality are gone. Today some established actors are surprised when their old tricks don't work any more. Why? Because they've become their own clichés. Because the audience has caught up to them, and they know just when hand will rise to the forehead, the laugh will crack—\\"The phone rang. \\"Hi, sweetheart. Having fun? . . . You did? . . . Oh, you didn't. Well, I still love you.\\" Exchange of telephonic kisses. \\"Letty,\\" she reported. \\"Away for week-end, Made me fabulous cupcakes, then ate them. Where were we?\\"She ran a furious hand through her cropped hair. \\"You don't have to be a murderer to play one. You simply have to remember back to the night you took a bath towel and pursued a mosquito for an hour and then the bloody mess and the sense of triumph when you finally got him. Murder is simply an extension of the violence and intent of that pursuit\\"UTA HAGEN grew up listening to family discussions of art on a high level. Her mother was a German opera star, her father a composer, conductor and Handel authority, who named her Uta (pronounced oo'ta) after a thirteenth century statue he saw in a Nuremburg cathedral the day she was born. When she was 6 she was taken to see Shaw's \\"Saint Joan\\" in a Berlin theatre, a production which made Elisabeth Bergner famous and may do the same for her hypnotized fan of twenty-five years ago. When she was 7 the family left Germany for Madison, Wis., where her father has been head of the University of Wisconsin's Art History Department ever since.His daughter remembers that early Madison childhood with some reluctance. \\"I never stopped being strange to my schoolmates\\"—the husky voice recalls a sober-eyed youngster with a foreign accent standing on the edge of the recess crowd—\\"I played the piano, my father played the violin and my mother didn't play bridge. It was an insuperable chasm.\\"SHE quit the university after her freshman year to attend the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.Upon her return she met Tallulah Bankhead at a party and promptly confided her burning ambition to tour with Eva Le Gallienne. \\"Well, dahling,\\" Miss Bankhead replied characteristically, \\"tell her about it, not me.\\"Miss Hagen took her advice. The fervency of her letter to Miss Le Gallienne won her an audition and that summer, her seventeenth, audiences saw her as Ophelia towering fragilely over the tiny Le Gallienne's Hamlet.Proceeding inexorably to Broadway she wangled an audition with the Lunts and landed a leading role in their production of \\"Seagulls.\\" Next came \\"Key Largo,\\" during which she met and married José Ferrer, a fellow member of the cast, and from there she played Desdemona under the long shadows of Robeson's Othello and Ferrer's lago.After \\"Othello\\" she went into a two-year eclipse during which she produced Letty, taught Shakespeare, and directed an off-Broadway production of Tolstoy—\\"the closest brush I ever had with ulcers\\"—until she returned to play the affrighted Mrs. Manning in Ferrer's revival of \\"Angel Street.\\" It was there that Elia Kazan spotted her for the Chicago company of \\"Streetcar.\\" Her first reaction to the news was characteristic: \\"Thank God I haven't seen it yet.\\"SHE played Blanche for a solid year through all the way stations west of the Hudson to mounting encomiums. It was a rewarding tour but it wasn't unalloyed. She says: \\"There was always some subhuman Stanley Kowalski type button-holing me and saying, 'Jeez, lady, you must be like that, lonely and a lush and all, or you couldn't have played her that good.'\\"Her last stop was her home town of Madison, which draped itself in bunting and superlatives for their local daughter. Professor Hagen shared her bows at the end of the performance and the cast gave her a silver box inscribed, \\"We all love you,\\" and plastered her dressing room mirror with lipstick kisses.\\"That did it,\\" she recalls. \\"I cried for three days straight.\\"She recovered in time to wow the New York critics. When she moved on to play the long-suffering wife in \\"Country Girl\\" they acclaimed her versatility, voted her the best actress of 1951. An omniscient picture magazine explained it all to its fathomless circulation: \\"Barely 30, she supplies what the U. S. stage sorely needs, a serious and electrifying young actress who plays in the grand manner.\\"The electrifying young actress swung her legs over the edge of the chair and giggled.\\"What they mean, I guess, is that I'm not afraid to cut loose, that I don't think flicking a cigarette in a substitute for acting. I'll take Duse any time. There was a real actress for you—simple, quiet, economical. I saw an old movie of hers at the Modern Museum with a corny old plot about a mother whose son left her and she just kept walking and walking around this damn room\\"—she started to pace—\\"in this terrible stillness and then all of a sudden she goes up to a wall and pounds on it.\\" Miss Hagen pounded so hard a copy of Gorki's short stories fell off the coffee table. She grinned. \\"I let out such a shriek they'll probably bar me for life.\\"SHE is that almost obsolete combination of a modern young woman and an old-fashioned actress. She demands to be seen and heard, and she sweeps through a play like a tornado. She has never had to simper her way through ingenue parts. \\"She can only play leads,\\" a prominent director said of her recently, \\"simply because she burns everybody else right off the stage.\\" An actor's actress, fellow-players say they learn from being on stage with her.She considers herself fabulously lucky. \\"I always said the only part that could beat Blanche was a female Hamlet and now I'm doing that.\\" She feels that the play's theme—\\"man's reaffirmation and search for God, the fighting off of oppression\\"—is particularly applicable today. \\"That trial scene is so modern it should be inserted in The Congressional Record. I only hope it makes a lot of people sit up and take notice.\\"A lot of people will be taking careful notice when the curtain goes up next Thursday night. One of the most interested observers will be Letty Ferrer, filled with pride and happy anticipation. This time she is going to get to see her mother burn, and she can hardly wait. \\"It's going to be wonderful,\\" she confided the other day over a chocolate soda. \\"When my mother burns, she'll burn good.\\"Her fellow aisle-sitters will be watching the curtain rise with the same suspicion.HELEN MARKEL HERMANN is a freelance, who often writes about theatrical people.

As an active member of several Jewish organizations, Judge Friedman was a pillar in the American Jewish community and his devotion, warmth, sense of humor and vision will be sorely missed.

What is escape velocity? Is it different for different planets?   A. Escape velocity is the speed required to get away from a planet or other celestial body and never come back. Strictly speaking, it is the minimum velocity needed to put an object from earth, or Planet X, in a parabolic trajectory","excerpt":"since a parabola is an open curve, an object on such a course will never return. Lower velocities result in elliptical orbits that do not escape. Escape velocity depends on the mass of the planet and the distance of the escaping object from the planet's center of mass, so it is harder to get away from the larger planets, but easier to get away if you don't have to start from the surface. Ignoring atmospheric friction, escape velocity at the surface of the earth is about 36,700 feet per second. From the moon it would be 7,800 feet per second; from Mars, 16,700 feet per second; from Jupiter, 197,000 feet per second.

Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, began punching back on Monday with a new television ad that directly attacks the challenger, Leslie Crocker Snyder, a former judge. The ad, ''Clear Choice,'' focuses on the candidates' differing views on the death penalty. A spokesman for the campaign declined to say how much the commercial cost","excerpt":"since January, the campaign has paid about $472,000 to the producer and its parent, Squier Knapp Dunn Communications, according to filings with the city's Board of Elections.    PRODUCER -- KnickerbockerSKD.    ON THE SCREEN -- At first, the new ad repeats images from Mr. Morgenthau's first television commercial of this campaign, including a glowing quote from Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general, and shots of the candidate standing on the courthouse steps, chatting with police officers and talking on the telephone at a large desk while a newspaper headline highlights his opposition to the death penalty. Then a shot of Ms. Snyder, taken from her first television ad, appears, along with the words ''Leslie Crocker Snyder Supports Death Penalty,'' in yellow lettering. The cover of her autobiography, ''25 to Life,'' is shown; the book opens and a sentence is highlighted: ''I would have been willing to give him the lethal injection myself.'' As Ms. Snyder reappears, a gavel comes down on the words ''Leslie Crocker Snyder, Wrong on the Death Penalty, Wrong for Manhattan.''    THE SCRIPT -- A narrator says: ''For district attorney, a clear choice. Eliot Spitzer calls Bob Morgenthau the best prosecutor in the nation. Morgenthau's innovative policies have brought crime in Manhattan down to record lows. And Morgenthau is leading the fight against the death penalty. Leslie Crocker Snyder supports the death penalty. She even told one defendant that she would have been willing to give him the lethal injection herself. Leslie Crocker Snyder. Wrong on the death penalty. Wrong for Manhattan.''    ACCURACY -- New York State's highest court struck down the death penalty last year. Ms. Snyder has said that she would request the death penalty if it were available for particularly heinous crimes and given corroborating evidence like DNA. The ad accurately quotes Ms. Snyder's book, although it showed the wrong page (the Morgenthau campaign says it has corrected that). But the case she was describing did not involve a death-penalty sentence; rather, she made the remark ''in a moment of anger,'' the book says, to a defendant had who pleaded guilty to a particularly brutal murder and rape that left the surviving victim's life in ruins. Ms. Snyder, who sentenced the defendant to 40 years in prison, yesterday called him ''the sickest criminal I have ever seen.'' Mr. Morgenthau has, indeed, been a longtime opponent of the death penalty.    SCORECARD -- Though Ms. Snyder has denounced the ad as misleading, it is likely to be very effective with liberal Manhattan voters, those most likely to turn out for the primary next month.
