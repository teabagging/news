Here are three restaurants that serve tasty and fresh crab cakes, each slightly different in character and each with its own partisans. Docks Oyster Bar and Seafood Grill    633 Third Avenue, at 40th Street in Manhattan, (212) 986-8080 -- This stylish and comfortable two-level expanse has a big arching wood-and-brass bar in the center, on which are displayed all manner of iced shellfish. In the evening, Art Deco sconces, candles and strategically placed overhead lights create a cool urbane mood.   For such a big crowded place, Docks rarely gets too loud. As for the food, it is reliably fresh and deftly prepared. Appetizers run from assorted oysters of the day, which are usually freshly shucked and in peak condition, to excellent rings of lightly breaded fried calamari with a cumin-laced hot sauce, and excellent clam chowder.   Other starters include generous Maryland crab cakes with tartar sauce and marinated seafood salad. Among entrees are lobster fra diavolo with linguine, red snapper wrapped in thin potato slices, grilled Norwegian salmon and blackened medallions of swordfish. A New England clambake is served with salad, dessert and coffee.   On the dessert menu are key lime pie and Docks' mud fudge pie. Appetizers range from $4 to $9","excerpt":"main courses $10 to $19.50; desserts $4 to $6.50. The clambake is $23 for two one-pound lobsters and $27 for one two-pounder.    Sunday dinner is from 5 to 11 P.M. (Review, Sept. 30, 1988; Article Oct. 19, 1990.) Gage & Tollner    372 Fulton Street, at Jay Street in Brooklyn, (718) 875-5181 -- The 110-year-old Gage & Tollner stands with defiance and dignity in the dispiritingly tacky Fulton Mall in Brooklyn. The long dark mahogany dining room is delightfully democratic: no good tables, no bad tables, just long rows of symmetrically arranged white linen, like a college dining hall.   Arched mirrors along the felt-covered walls make the space seem even larger than it is. From the 15-foot-high ceiling hang gas-fueled brass chandeliers. The food is orchestrated by Edna Lewis, the renowned Southern chef and author.   Among the appetizers are Charleston she-crab, creamy and peppery with a good base of crab stock and sherry; broiled or fried soft clam bellies; lightly breaded and sauteed white eggplant and peppers in olive oil; lobster bisque, and meaty golden crab cakes.   Main-course selections include tender braised brisket of beef; the mildly spicy shrimp and crab gumbo, rich with crab meat, okra and green peppers and served over rice; sauteed jumbo sea scallops served on a bed of spinach, and Southern-fried chicken.    Appetizers range from $4 to $8; entrees $10 to $17; desserts $4 to $8. Sunday dinner hours are 4 P.M. to 9 P.M. (Review, July 7, 1989; Article, Oct. 19, 1990.) John Clancy's Restaurant    181 West 10th Street, at Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, (212) 242-7350 -- Fresh skillfully grilled seafood is the specialty at this comfortable Greenwich Village institution.   The step-down main dining room and bar are done in whitewashed brick walls and pearl gray, with pastel garden prints on the walls; the upstairs, done in similar colors, is more intimate.    You might start with Tunisian crab cakes, seasoned with harissa and served with a tomato-garlic sauce; lemon red pepper linguine with lobster, crab meat and shiitake mushrooms; lobster tartlet with a peppercorn vinaigrette; lobster bisque, or ceviche of smoked shrimp and sea scallops with a grilled vegetable relish. Entrees include barbecued jumbo shrimp; grilled swordfish steak with basil pesto, ginger red onion marmalade and shellfish bordelaise; sauteed sea scallops accompanied with scallop ravioli, star anise and a red wine butter sauce, and an herb-crusted red snapper with ginger-dill sauce.   John Clancy's is one of the few restaurants in town that serves English trifle -- layers of sherry-soaked genoise, raspberry puree, creme anglaise and whipped cream in a wide-mouth goblet. Deadly, but good.    Appetizers range from $4.50 to $10; main courses $16.50 to $26.50; desserts are $6 each. Sunday dinner service is from 5 P.M. to 10 P.M.

The state produces 75 per cent of the nation's lobsters, a bumper crop that totaled 17 million pounds last year, and the haul this year is expected to be even greater.

A friend says the geographic center of the United States is somewhere in western South Dakota. Is this true? How is this determined? A. While it is relatively easy to calculate the center point of a plane area, the boundaries of United States are drawn on a portion of the surface of an oblate spheroid in revolution. Any attempt to convert this irregular spheroid surface to a plane map distorts it","excerpt":"maintaining a constant area ratio will lead to a distorted shape, while preserving the shape will distort the area. Thus there is no satisfactory or accurate method of determining the center point. Defining the point as the center of gravity of the surface is complicated by the irregularity of the surface, islands and large bodies of water on the borders, the curvature of the earth and other factors. Nevertheless, that is the method used by geologists at the Interior Department's Geologic Survey, who years ago tackled the problem by pasting a map of the United States on cardboard and spin-balancing the map on a pin. The point where the map balances is, with an accuracy within 10 miles or so, the geographic center. The balance point for the 50 states is 17 miles west of Castle Rock in Butte County, S.D. (latitude 44 degrees58N, longitude 103 degrees46W). Excluding Alaska and Hawaii, the point is near Lebanon in Smith County, Kan. (39 degrees50N, 98 degrees35W). The center of the North American continent is 6 miles west of Balta, in Pierce County, N.D. (48 degrees10N, 100 degrees10W).

Much of this appeal is because of the attractive, luxurious appearance, but another reason is that many people mistakenly expect such floors to be virtually maintenance-free.   It is true that slate and quarry tile are extremely durable and should last a lifetime if properly installed, but these materials are also very porous and stain very easily when food is dropped or liquids are spilled, making them difficult to clean. In addition, individual pieces of slate or tile sometimes work loose and wobble annoyingly when stepped on, and the mortar joints between the pieces may eventually crack or crumble - especially around the outside of the house.

At first, these cracks are only minor imperfections, but left unattended, they can develop into major headaches. Weeds usually force their way through the crevices widening them. In winter, water entering into the cracks will freeze and expand them even more. The water can also penetrate to the subbase and undermine it.

Indeed, the number of heroin addicts is far smaller than the number of smokers and alcoholics. There are 44.5 million adult smokers in the country, nine million alcoholics and&#8212;depending on whom you believe&#8212;between 300,000 and 560,000 addicts. &#8220;If Gil Hodges dropped dead on the golf course from a heroin overdose, it would be a national scandal; from cigarette&#8208;smoking it makes no impact,&#8221; says Glasser. &#8220;The whole thing strikes me as com pletely irrational.&#8221; Society's attempt to treat heroin differently from ciga rettes or alcohol has been a disaster&#8212;creating a spiraling crime rate &#8220;that is fueling a very repressive kind of politics in this country.&#8221; Glasser would decriminalize heroin and make it available in pharmacies for addicts.
