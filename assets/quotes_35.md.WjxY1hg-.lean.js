The occasion was one of the more glamorous events in the hall's Centennial Festival, certifying the graduation of James Levine's prized operatic ensemble into a full-fledged symphony orchestra, on display in the country's most famous concert hall.   If that was the intention, however, the concert was not conclusive. Indeed, it was oddly bifurcated, with really glorious playing in the two numbers, one of them comfortably operatic, in which the musicians accompanied the soprano Jessye Norman, and not so overwhelming otherwise. In any case, Mr. Levine shunned direct comparisons with established orchestras by avoiding mainstream orchestral repertory.

Not only has it been led by such conductors as Toscanini, Walter, Szell, Bohm, Karajan and Reiner, but over the last decade James Levine has devoted to it almost as much time and attention as the old-fashioned music directors gave to symphony orchestras. Mr. Levine has made the ensemble a powerful instrument that can healthily exist away from the house.   In recent years, for example, the orchestra has made its first recordings in a generation -- a new version of Wagner's \\"Ring\\" along with other recordings under way for Deutsche Grammophon, Sony Classical and Philips. The orchestra went on its first concert tour last spring. And there have been times in the house itself (as in last September's \\"Idomeneo\\") when the playing has had a grace and subtlety that both supported the drama and created autonomous musical worlds.

Indeed, the argument that greatness can exist without universal themes and moral weight -- that, for example, three minutes from Mendelssohn's \\"Songs Without Words\\" may be worth two hours of Mahlerian agonizing -- receives powerful support in Donizetti's closing of Act I, a sequence of small miracles that transform addled infatuation into music of breathtaking and heartbreaking beauty.

They require singers of the very first rank, masters of rhetoric and phrasing who can also negotiate intricate passages. They require a conductor who pays as much attention to articulation of detail as to long dramatic lines. They require a production that is subtly attuned to the work's manners and implications. Finally, more than any other operas in the repertory, they require a finely wrought sense of ensemble.   Such exemplars may be hard to come by, but as this season's first performance of \\"Idomeneo\\" at the Metropolitan Opera showed on Saturday afternoon, they do exist. This was one of those occasions when the pleasures were not primarily in the voices (although such pleasures were extravagantly at hand), but in what the singers and players made of the work as a whole. The tale of the Greek king condemned by his hasty vow to sacrifice his own son to the god Neptune is not one of Mozart's best-loved works, but such performances cannot fail to raise it in public esteem.

Indeed, despite some flaws in the production and in some characterizations, there did seem to be magic in the web of this \\"Otello.\\" In a new production by Elijah Moshinsky, mounted in honor of Placido Domingo's 25th-anniversary season at the Met, supported by an interpretation that brought Valery Gergiyev's conducting talents to the pit in his much anticipated Met debut, and with a cast that included the Russian baritone Sergei Leiferkus as Iago and Carol Vaness as Desdemona, a haunting nexus of character and motif unfolded with urgency and fury.

Perhaps years of familiarity can blunt an operagoer's objections to the busy and often distracting detail of Mr. Zeffirelli's extravaganzas. Or perhaps, to put it differently, one is simply bludgeoned by their sheer weight into a resigned acceptance. It may even be that Leslie Koenig's stage direction has muted some of the excesses, although it would be tough to point to examples.

That proved to be one of its few distinctions. This was another of those substandard, barely routine performances that always seem to turn up in the drear midseason weeks.   The reasons for disappointment go deeper than the unfathomable casting, but that will do for a start. Beethoven's only opera requires above all a dramatic or robust spinto soprano in the title role who both sounds and acts like a Romantic hero. Elizabeth Connell did not qualify on either count. The voice, thin on top and unevenly produced elsewhere, might be more suited by size and timbre to the lyric soprano repertory. It surely lacked the thrusting power to convey Leonore's rage in the \\"Abscheulicher\\" and, more surprisingly, was hard pressed to sustain the prayerful mood of \\"Komm, Hoffnung.\\" Review/Music","excerpt":"Met's First 'Fidelio' Of Season"},{"year":"1954","title":"R Bing decries effect of new mass media BING DECRIES MASS MEDIA","excerpt":"Met's Manager, at Lafayette, Bemoans Effect on Opera"},{"year":"1967","title":"Marriage of Figaro, The, by Mozart: (Met Natl Co) Opera: Miracle of 'Figaro'","excerpt":"Met's National Troupe Makes Convoluted Plot Understandable Even to a Novice"},{"year":"1954","title":"OPERA TO AID MILK FUND","excerpt":"Met's Performance of 'Tosca' March 8 Will Be Benefit"},{"year":"1962","title":"Casey Stengel will celebrate tomorrow the golden anniversary of his first major league baseball game.

It was the great W.E.B. Du Bois, in ''The Souls of Black Folk'' in 1903, who drew upon the figure of doubleness as a metaphor for the psychological, social and political status of the Afro-American. Unlike many of his less poetic heirs to employ the figure, Du Bois never forgot that ''twoness'' was just that -a figure. than merely the metaphorical. The dark (or should I say airy) and foreboding presence of Mr. Walcott's English grandfather Mr. Donoghue cites as an analogue for the poet's ''standard English style, dangerously high for nearly every purpose except that of Jacobean tragedy.'' While I would disagree strongly with Mr. Donoghue that Mr. Walcott's intent or effect is ''to give his people heroes, if not saints'' (when Lord knows West Indians have an ample crop of heroes, home-grown), I worry especially about the racialist theory of poetics implied by the invocation of that pale shade, Mr. Walcott's grandfather. Not since Hippolyte Taine have we had a ''serious'' theory of ''race'' and poetics, and thank goodness for it. We would do well to leave Taine's spurious category, and Mr. Walcott's grandfather, to rest silently among the dead.

Krzysztof Kieslowski's \\"Double Life of Veronique\\" exemplifies a very distinctive kind of contemporary European film. Intellectually well bred, it bewitches the eye. It introduces a lovely new actress named Irene Jacob and, in a series of alternately haunting and opaque sequences, examines a metaphysical equation whose symbolism and practical application would seem to be of no urgency whatsoever.   The screenplay, written by Mr. Kieslowski with Krzysztof Piesiewicz, considers the mystical bond between two identical young women (Miss Jacob), one Polish, one French, neither of whom is aware of the other, though each has intimations of the other's existence.

From the time of his earliest plays in the late 1960's, he has stocked his work with enough visual and verbal conundrums to keep disciples of abstraction babbling through years of exegesis, but the fact is that there is simply no satisfactory way to invoke what the experience of sitting through his plays is like. They exist fully only in the moment of their performance. And to try to boil them down to synopsis or allegory is to make them sound both pretentious and slightly bogus.   Accordingly, to watch \\"My Head Was a Sledgehammer,\\" the most recent offering of Mr. Foreman's Ontological-Hysteric Theater, is to be swept into a dazzlingly self-contained, thoroughly exhilarating universe that seems in the viewing -- as does the best of Mr. Foreman's work -- logical, rational and disturbing in the way that individual dreams can be.

Their monologues merge into a dialogue that compares the flow of blood to the human heart to the traffic routes in and out of East Berlin.

Over the next 90 minutes, the criminologist, the actress and the waiter are revealed to be enmeshed in a triangle. The actress has been chosen to play the lead role in a movie depicting the unsolved murder of a woman in Montreal several years earlier. It emerges that the waiter, who lives in an apartment on the other side of a wall from the actress, was originally suspected of the crime. It also emerges that the polygraph test that helped clear him of suspicion was administered by the criminologist, who in an attempt to trick him had lied to him about the results.
