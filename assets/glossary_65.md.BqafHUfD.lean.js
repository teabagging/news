She runs several classes of 11 children, 5 to 15 years old, and will soon add one for adults. Her name is Cory Bragar, and she is 14 years old.   Cory, who has already acceded to the second-degree black belt category, is probably the only high-school student in New York to have her own school. \\"A few months ago I decided that I really liked teaching and wanted to do more of it,\\" said Cory, who recently hired two assistants -- her classmates Jason Davis and Justin Goldfinger, who are both also 14.    Taekwondo (pronounced tie-kwan-DOH) is a discipline in which students master self-defense techniques using the hand and foot.   \\"Cory provides an atmosphere where a child can learn to defend himself in the crime-filled world we live in,\\" Justin said. Cory is the highest- ranked person under 17 years of age in the Unites States Taekwondo Alliance in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania regions. She presents her classes in a relaxed way, so that even very young children can learn.   \\"Cory realizes that it's hard to teach children at the same rate of discipline that is taught to adults,\\" Justin added. \\"That's why she intertwines fun games in the routines.\\"    Her passion for the martial arts began when, at the age of 7, she attended a birthday party with a karate theme. \\"I really loved it, so I started taking lessons,\\" said Cory, who got her black belt when she was 12. When she found other karate organizations too militaristic, she joined the United States Taekwondo Alliance three years ago.   At a class last week, the students ended the session by trying to break pieces of wood with chops of the hand, a classic taekwondo maneuver. It was an off day, as two of the boys were not successful. \\"Show them how you do it with your head,\\" said Sandy Bragar, Cory's mother. \\"That's what she used to do when she ran birthday parties,\\" Mrs. Bragar added. \\"Now she sometimes gets a headache.\\"   After setting up her business a few months ago, Cory found that one of her biggest problems was getting her own bank account. Her parents are co-signers.   Cory will hold winter classes from Jan. 7 to March 14 at the Jan Hus Presbyterian Church, at 351 East 74th Street in Manhattan.

Like his first two books, \\"Our House in the Last World\\" (1983) and \\"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love\\" (1989), Oscar Hijuelos's latest novel, \\"The 14 Sisters of Emilio Montez O'Brien,\\" is a family saga, one of those commodious, emotionally generous books that immerse us in a well-upholstered fictional world. Once again, we are given a richly colored portrait of immigrant life in the United States","excerpt":"once again we are shown how familial hopes, dreams, yearnings and sadnesses are handed down generation to generation.   Whereas \\"Mambo Kings,\\" which won the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, was an insistently male book, focusing on the sexual and romantic adventures of two Cuban immigrant brothers, \\"The 14 Sisters\\" is a novel about women, a novel examining the lives and loves of the Montez and O'Brien women.   Though many of its central characters suffer from a lingering melancholy reminiscent of that possessed by Nestor, one of the two brothers in \\"The Mambo Kings,\\" the book is less concerned with loss and missed opportunities than its predecessor. Death, divorce and illness all take their toll here, but \\"The 14 Sisters\\" takes a longer view of family life than \\"The Mambo Kings,\\" and its vision is ultimately more redemptive, concerned in the end, like Gabriel Garcia Marquez's \\"Love in the Time of Cholera,\\" with the cyclical nature of time, and the enduring possibilities of love.   Moving back and forth in time, \\"The 14 Sisters\\" begins, more or less, with the story of Nelson O'Brien, a young Irish boy, whose dreams of America are based on the penny novels he has read about Wild Bill Hickok and Jesse James. In time, Nelson emigrates to the United States, settles in a small Pennsylvania town and, in 1898 after the death of his beloved sister Kate, goes to Cuba to take photographs of the Spanish-American War.   There, Nelson meets the beautiful, dreamy 16-year-old Mariela Montez, and for 27 Sundays in a row he pays her court. He tells her about his house in Pennsylvania \\"deep in the heart of America, where people could do as they pleased and there was no war,\\" and she dreams of a good life with this earnest, sad-eyed man. For their wedding, Nelson gives her a telescope so that she might gaze upon the stars, and he introduces the shy young woman to the unexpected pleasures of his bed.   Their passion is enthusiastic, and almost mythically fecund. In the ensuing years in America, Mariela will have 14 daughters, and finally, after all these girls, a son.   Though we wonder how Mr. Hijuelos will ever be able to keep so many siblings clearly sorted out in his mind, he's able to implant a firm sense of each and every one of them in our imaginations. There's Margarita, the oldest and in many ways the novel's presiding spirit, who makes an early, unfortunate marriage, and spends years regretting her mistake, only to discover, late in life, the joys of love and independence. It is Margarita who will keep the members of this huge, sprawling family in touch with one another, and Margarita who will imagine her parents' lives together, and preserve them, along with the lives of her siblings, through the willful exercise of memory.   After Margarita, there's Isabel, the blond, Irish-looking sister, plump and enamored of food, who will find a husband and a home in Cuba. Maria, the third sister, and the twins, Olga and Jacqueline, are the musically gifted ones -- the family's \\"Three Nightingales\\" -- who will find fulfilling careers in show business. Then there's the beauteous Helen, appropriately named after a bottle of Helen of Troy Beauty Pomade; plump little Irene; the angry, pensive Sarah, and Patricia, the sister born with a gift for second sight.   Veronica, named after the saint, will live up to her name and marry a homeless man she has helped find shelter. Marta and Carmen will remain homebodies for many years, before finding happiness in California. The promiscuous Violeta will eventually abandon her hectic social life to become a minister's wife. And Gloria will struggle for years with her incestuous love for her brother, Emilio, a handsome, introspective boy who will grow up to become a small-time movie star.   In relating the tangled history of the O'Brien-Montez clan, Mr. Hijuelos moves confidently from one character's story to the next, leaping ahead in time to foreshadow the future, then jumping backward in time to show us the seeds of hope and despair. He subtly reveals the ways in which the sisters' choices echo -- or counterpoint -- the choices of their siblings, and he demonstrates, as well, the ways in which their lives both embody and contradict the dreams of their parents.   Toward the end of the book, Mr. Hijuelos's narrative becomes a little rushed, and his quickening litany of developments in the sisters' lives -- alcoholism, addiction to Valium, subscriptions to spiritist newsletters, affairs with younger men -- can sound suspiciously like an inventory of topics on a talk show. The reader, however, never really minds, so persuasive and generous is his delineation of the family's life. Indeed, one finishes \\"The 14 Sisters\\" reluctantly, the way one finishes a long letter from a beloved family member, eager for all the news not to end.

G. Wodehouse. As Mr. Cooke notes in his capsule introductory biography, Wodehouse, who died in 1975, was not only one of the most popular writers of all time, but was also highly regarded by such worthies as Hilaire Belloc, Rudyard Kipling, Evelyn Waugh and George Orwell. Whether this new television series centered on his most famous creations, the unfailingly feckless Bertie Wooster and his valet, the formidably feckful Jeeves, will enhance that reputation is uncertain.   Sunday's opener, at 9 P.M. on Channel 13, begins at the beginning, with the arrival of Jeeves at Bertie's bachelor digs in response to an advertisement: \\"I was given to understand that you required a valet.\\" As Jeeves, Stephen Fry, much more the gent than his employer, gets his humorous effects with the tilt of an eyebrow. The face of his master, Hugh Laurie, is all over the place (the place is London's Mayfair), along with what passes as his mind. The two actors, a popular pair on British television, play comfortably off each other.

Still, they're an important part of the process by which he creates the character of Michal: a man in his late 30's who, for seven years as a child, was physically and emotionally tortured by his parents. For Mr. Stuhlbarg, the ''shock scars'' are physical reminders of the electrodes once attached there -- and an indication of the subtlety of his approach to playing a mentally handicapped person.    Michal's condition, and its implications, are doled out in tantalizing portions over the course of ''The Pillowman.'' But for Mr. Stuhlbarg -- and for the actors playing two other developmentally disabled characters in major Broadway shows this season -- the incapacity must be created whole. That's notoriously difficult to do, especially when the meaning of the drama hinges on the expressiveness of limitations, as it does in ''The Pillowman,'' ''The Light in the Piazza'' and ''The Glass Menagerie.''

However, when asked if he would dramatize that pledge as President by moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Israel's capital, candidate Reagan replied that he did not want to ''get into trouble the way Joe Clark did.''

''Flashpoint'' was made up of two half-hour films that favored Israel, a one-hour film that did not, and some 30 minutes of chitchat and discussion. The main point of contention was the one-hour film, ''Occupied Palestine,'' an examination of the lives of Palestinians under Israeli rule. Some stations, WNET/Channel 13 among them, rejected it as biased. PBS said that bias was besides the point.

The tragic clash of Western and Japanese cultures was examined in \\"Madama Butterfly\\" on Saturday afternoon, and the legend of the vengeful ice princess \\"Turandot\\" was offered that evening. And perhaps to sweep away the tense emotionalism of those works, on Sunday afternoon the company revived its 1984 production of \\"The Mikado,\\" Gilbert and Sullivan's deliciously silly fantasy about the Japanese town of Titipu, and its odd web of bureaucratic and romantic entanglements.   Lightweight though \\"The Mikado\\" is, this production is one of the most delightful in the company's repertory, and it has retained its freshness. Originally staged by Lotfi Mansouri, and now directed by Christian Smith, it plays on subtle contrasts. Thierry Bosquet's sets, for example, are delicate Oriental hangings and screens, painted in pastel shades. But his costumes use bright reds and greens. There is a spareness that makes the stage seem roomy, yet the bustling crowds are on hand when Gilbert calls for them.

Every spring the official press warns Soviet citizens against the horrors of ideological contamination from Western bourgeois tourists; the incentive is in the dollars and other hard currency that visitors spend. Moscow still cannot compete with the comforts that Western capitals offer, but a genuine effort has been made to ease the tourist's lot. The state travel monopoly, Intourist, has tried to reduce the bureaucratic hassle to modest Soviet proportions.

But it is also instructive to note that the actual moment of unity, Oct. 3, was selected not for any historic or symbolic significance, but as a result of the most rollicking variety of political maneuvering.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl came to realize that unity was likely to create considerable dislocation and sacrifice on both sides, so he began pressing for reunification and elections as quickly as possible, before the full cost of the process began to undermine his aura as the Unity Chancellor. The opposition Social Democrats, for similar reasons, began demanding an even earlier date for unity - so that Mr. Kohl could be held directly responsible for any nastiness - and a later date for elections.   The struggle went through much of the summer, with both sides drawing heavily on military imagery to describe their successes and losses. When the Social Democrats succeeded in keeping the election in December, they spoke of \\"occupying an important strategic height\\" and of demonstrating \\"that we can stop the elephant Kohl.\\" The Christian Democrats fought back with speeches accusing the Social Democratic front-runner of \\"hoping that the people in East Germany will be worse off so that his election chances would rise.\\"   The maneuvering lasted through most of July and August, until finally the politicians agreed to merge the Germanys on Oct. 3, the earliest date possible for external reasons, and to hold state elections in East Germany on Oct. 14, followed by the first all-German balloting on Dec. 2.   What this means is that Oct. 3 will effectively mark the start of the final round in what must rank as one of the most hectic years in modern German politics.   Posters have already appeared around Bonn showing Mr. Kohl with the slogan, \\"Chancellor for Unity.\\" At the same time, carpetbagging West German politicians have fanned through East Germany to run for the new vacancies there.   In the most celebrated such race, Kurt Biedenkopf, a former secretary general of the West German Christian Democrats who fell afoul of Mr. Kohl, is running for governor of Saxony against Anke Fuchs, the party manager of the West German Social Democrats.   It will be for history to judge whether the handling of unity has been wise or foolish. Ultimately, there may have been no real alternative to the headlong rush of the the last year","excerpt":"once the Berlin Wall was breached on Nov. 9 - and no German politician can claim credit for that - it became largely a question of managing what was effectively an accomplished fact.   Still, the cracking of the wall also sounded the starting gong for a political free-for-all in which nothing - not the date of unity, not economic union - has been left \\"above politics.\\" Mr. Kohl, the consummate clubhouse pol, has so far proved himself the more adept player, pushing unity through a maze of political, economic and social obstacles with extraordinary energy and resourcefulness. By all current barometers, he appears certain to win the balloting in December to become the first elected chancellor of the reunited Germany.   Many have criticized the politicking as unseemly. Commentators in West Germany and abroad have lamented what one termed the hijacking of a solemn historic moment by a rowdy election campaign.   Yet there are those who argue that the politicians have not done so badly. Despite the extraordinary pace of unification and the disintegration of the East German economy, politicians and officials in both West and East have managed the administrative takeover so far without serious glitches.   \\"For anyone who has witnessed over the past 15 years the months of struggles over minor problems, this has been proof of a totally unexpected soundness,\\" wrote Hans-Peter Schwarz, director of the political science department at the University of Bonn. \\"One of the many surprising discoveries of the past nine months is that West Germany, in the federal government and the states, has very competent politicians and officials.\\"   One charge, heard most often from the rump of the East German Communist party, restyled the Party of Democratic Socialism, and from the popular movements that led the mass demonstrations in East Germany last fall, is that the West German politicians have essentially run over East Germany, shoving aside everything indigenous, including fledgling popular movements like New Forum.   Nobody denies the degree to which the West German parties have taken over in East Germany. But that is hardly surprising, according to Josef Joffe, foreign editor of the Suddeutsche Zeitung, who is now a visiting professor at Harvard University.   \\"The West is essentially taking over a moribund company, and insists on running it,\\" he said. \\"So it's natural that some East Germans feel they escaped from an indigenous totalitarian regime only to slip into the clutches of an imported regime that's running them 'for their own good'.\\"   The Western dominance, however, cannot last for long, and the East German electorate is certain to eventually define its own interests. The question then will be what shape it gives to the politics of a unified Germany.   One line of speculation is that the addition of 16 million Protestants and a region with strong socialist traditions could shift the balance away from the Christian Democrats and their conservative Bavarian allies the Christian Socialists, and give new strength to the Social Democrats.   But initial voting patterns in East Germany have suggested that 40 years of Communism have fostered an allergy to socialism in any form and that religious differences are no longer as strong as they once were. So far, in any case, the Christian Democrats have shown the greater strength in the East.   A stronger possibility is that Germany will become divided along rich-poor lines, with a struggling East pitted against a protective West. One initial indication of this was the decision by West Germany to give its large states greater weight in the upper house of Parliament, enough to deny the five new East German states a collective veto.   Even longer-term prognoses divide Germany into a rich south - with a revived industrial belt in Saxony in East Germany shaping a \\"green belt\\" with the rich West German southern states of Badem-Wurttemberg and Bavaria - and a poor north. Agriculture and industry are suffering in both East and West Germany.  One effect that is already apparent has been the battering of fringe parties on both right and left. In West Germany, the right-wing Republican Party has disintegrated in internal squabbling and the far right has found no new cause around which to rally.   On the left, the Party of Democratic Socialism - the restyled East German Communists - have rallied under their chairman, Gregor Gysi, to form a nationwide alliance of the left. Current opinion polls, however, do not give them the five percent needed to enter Parliament, and their net effect may be to siphon critical votes from the Greens.   If these trends persist, the first Parliament elected by a unified Germany is likely to consist largely of major parties with Mr. Kohl's coalition again in the saddle. Current polls show Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats with 45 percent, followed by the Social Democrats, with 36 percent. That would leave Mr. Kohl once again dependent on Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher's Free Democrats, with about 10 percent of the vote, to form a coalition government.   That Mr. Kohl will become the first all-German chancellor is not in question, since on Oct. 3, East Germany will technically accede to the existing Federal Republic.   At the same time, the East German Parliament and Government will simply cease to exist. Mr. Kohl has let it be known that four East German ministers will join the all-German cabinet after Oct. 3 as ministers without portfolio, and 144 of the 400 members of the East German parliament will take seats alongside 530 West German deputies in the Bundestag in Bonn.

By all governmental-film tradition, they should be dry as dust, jam-packed with statistics and graphs, as stirring as a Department of Agriculture bulletin on the boll weevil. Once the Resettlement Administration had him do a picture about soil erosion","excerpt":"once the Farm Security Administration had him make one about floods; the United States Film Service, his current boss, has just released his latest—a picture urging the need for trained men in the field of obstetrics. Something must be wrong with Mr. Lorentz. His film about soil erosion was a splendid documentary called \\"The Plough That Broke the Plains.\\" His film about floods emerged as the poetic and magnificent epic, \\"The River.\\" His film about maternity arrived at the Belmont yesterday as \\"The Fight for Life\\" and it's as dramatic as life itself.Something, obviously, must be wrong with Mr. Lorentz, for he seems to feel that the screen can be employed as a window through which the world about us can be seen, not merely as a prettily colored mirror to reflect, all gaily distorted, a world that does not exist. He seems to feel that living is an exciting adventure, that information is not dull because it is information, that simple things—things like birth and death and hunger and ignorance and hope and dedication to service—actually can be engrossing and dramatic as, say, the problem of the beautiful shop girl who must decide between champagne at the Ritz and a cuppacawfee at the automat. Odd, the notions some folk get!\\"The Fight for Life\\" is on the borderline betwen documentary, as we know the word, and fiction film. For the first time in his government-picture-making career, Mr. Lorentz has employed actors, has—in some cases—used sets, and has shaped a plot of sorts to bring his film into a semblance of dramatic unity. At the same time his material is factual, many of his scenes were made on the spot, with real people in them; we have government mortality tables, reports of Boards of Health and medical societies to support his word that 90 per cent of the nation's babies are brought by men with 5 per cent training, that maternity causes more deaths than cancer and half of these preventable, that puerperal fever (which generally is avoidable) is the chief assassin.In reciting statistics that way we do Lorentz's film an injustice; for he has not been that bald. He has brought them in unobtrusively, slipping them into lines and scenes pulsating with the beat of his drama. He has told it as a personal history—the history of a sensitive young doctor who has watched a mother die on a delivery table in a great urban maternity hospital and has asked himself whether there was one balanced second when they could have held the life flowing from her. \\"Maybe there's a design,\\" he wonders. \\"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life.\\"\\"Perhaps there is a design,\\" later replies an older doctor, \\"but we don't know it. . . . Floods and erosion are normal in nature. Perhaps human erosion is normal. Too many still think so.\\"So the young man goes to a maternity clinic in Chicago's slums, and there he works and learns; and there, at last, he faces another case where there is the \\"one balanced second\\" when life may be saved or lost. And this time the process of human erosion is stayed.A slight story framework? Perhaps. But the drama has been solidly built on human experience, on the tissue of life, on the beat of the human heart itself. Louis Gruenberg's score, dramatic as the film's imagery, has exploited that heartbeat magnificently, has used its rhythm with drums and strings to create a haunting symphony of birth and death and the long, suspenseful, muted passage between. Lorentz always has been fortunate in finding his composers, but never has he been more beautifully served than here. He has been happy, too, in his drama's performance. Had we not seen them on Broadway and in occasional pictures, he might have pretended successfully that Myron McCormick, Will Geer, Storrs Haynes and Dudley Digges really were men of medicine, that Effie Anderson was a professional receptionist at a clinic, that Dorothy Urban (that magnificent study of a slums grandmother) really had been found in some ramshackle tenement near the yards.We don't know what it is that's wrong with Mr. Lorentz for thinking there is drama in the greatest adventure of life, for thinking nice people want to be told that hundreds of thousands of mothers and infants die needlessly each year through an almost criminal lack of proper care and attention, for thinking any of us may be interested—no less fascinated—by the workaday routine of visiting nurses and physicians on maternity duty in the slums. But whatever it is that's wrong, we wish more film makers had it, and we wish there were some form of Pulitzer award for the kind of cinema journalism Mr. Lorentz has been doing.At Loew's CriterionAs it turns out, the personage who arrives on the screen at Loew's Criterion this week under the sinister pseudonym \\"Wolf of New York\\" is none other than Edmund Lowe. It must also be noted for the record that Mr. Lowe's lupine activities hardly cover as much territory as the title, ambitiously, would seem to indicate, but are confined to the metropolitan law courts, where he moves, apparently, with the combined assurance and legal background of Samuel Leibowitz, Thomas Dewey and Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.The story, a really healthy enjoyment of which will depend on a philosophical acceptance of the above major premise concerning Mr. Lowe, is the one about the irresistibly brilliant criminal \\"mouthpiece\\" in whom a pretty girl, detecting rudiments of a conscience, finally places her entire trust. Mr. Lowe's regeneration takes place after he has failed to save the life of the only innocent man he ever defended. And when the Governor (persuaded by the pretty girl) makes him District Attorney, Mr. Lowe accepts the appointment and cleans up the town, including his best-paying former client. \\"Wolf of New York,\\" in other words, is merely a sheep in wolf's clothing.MUSIC NOTESToday's events: \\"Pelleas et Melisande,\\" Metropolitan Opera, evening; Philharmonic-Symphony, Carnegie Hall, 8:45; Chamber Choir, Carnegie Chamber Hall, 8:30; Piano Teachers Congress, Steinway Hall, 10 A.

(St. Martin's, $22.95), an absorbing, panoramic novel set in the waning Wild West days of British Columbia. It's that  good: intricately plotted, meticulously researched and shaded with nuance. In \\"Shoot!\\" the Canadian poet and novelist George Bowering tells the story of four  young men whose Indian mothers and white fathers earn them the dismissive status of half-breeds. Caught between two cultures that neither understand nor accept them, the boys tumble self-destructively from petty thievery to murder. With page after page of thundering hoofbeats, shoot-outs and blood-red sunsets, Shoot! does the western genre proud. But what truly distinguishes this novel is  Mr. Bowering's unflinching examination of bigotry and intolerance, which seems as relevant to today's world as to that of the 1870's. Steady doses of wit and adventure help his brusque prose recover from occasional didactic detours, and a spiraling narrative structure gives the old-fashioned setting some post-modern flair. If nothing else, discovering the source of its deceptively hee-haw title  is reason enough to tempt plenty of curious readers.

''I'm used to working with students who are seriously preparing for a dance career,'' she said, ''who take class six times a week and have enormous talent. In Westchester, most of the kids come to the school for fun, because they like to dance, so their whole approach is different, and we have to make a lot of compromises.

Weber, who was born in Russia in 1881 and emigrated to New York City with his family at the age of 10, was fleetingly considered one of the leading modern artists in America. He was, for example, among the first Americans to exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art, in 1930.   The Brooklyn show, which consists of 62 paintings and drawings and one small, graceful sculpture, covers the decade from 1910 to 1920, when the artist, fresh from three years in Paris, grappled with the heady influences of European modernism: Futurism and Expressionism as well as Cubism. (It wisely ignores the remainder of his career: from the late 1920's until his death in 1961, Weber pursued an increasingly conservative and sentimental brand of figuration, often mired in religious piety.)

''You still attend to the kid and you love the kid, but you also begin to learn how to let the kid teach you stuff.'' Mr. Gutierrez's mesmerizing solo was a handful as a newborn","excerpt":"one can only imagine what has transpired since then. The work, above, which probes the performer's relationship to the audience, contains nudity, but far more revealing is Mr. Gutierrez's baring of his mental and emotional landscape; a shifting, fragile terrain that seems to consist equally of bravado and vulnerability. That mix is part of what makes him such an irresistible performer, whether he's mimicking a tape of himself mouthing off at a panel discussion or following a set of unspoken rules in a section of improvisational movement. ''I won't tell you what I'm thinking because then it's no fun for me,'' his e-mail teased. Also returning to the Workshop is Mr. Gutierrez's ''Difficult Bodies,'' a dance for three women that, with ''Retrospective Exhibitionist,'' creates a performance diptych. As with his solo, Mr. Gutierrez would only hint at subtle but important changes that ''invigorate and underline the 'power' of the women in the piece.''

Alfred A. Knopf. $24.95.   At a reception for the Goncourt prize a few years back, one could have seen a tallish man, over-elegant for the occasion, a note pad conspicuously in hand, moving among the guests to question them about this curious Parisian rite: a prestigious award no one believes in, since it's an open secret that the author jurors vote for their own publishers' candidates. The man, who, with his starched collar and unadorned spectacles, resembled a young Leon Blum (in his pre-political years as a literary critic), was in fact Richard Bernstein, then the Paris bureau chief of The New York Times, digging deeper than a Times correspondent need do for his daily news file.    We have the product of that deeper probing in the book before us. Mr. Bernstein was obviously moonlighting on The Times. During his three-year Paris stint, as in his student days and on frequent return visits, he threw himself into what may appear a hopeless endeavor: trying to make sense of the French, and not only of Parisians. For he knew something a less vigilant observer might not: that every Frenchman cultivates his down-home origins. And to understand the French, who tend to cluster in Paris and to do most of their business and politicking there, one necessarily travels to the hinterlands, to La France Profonde. Mr. Bernstein did that, again and again, and put it all down in the most penetrating account of contemporary France we're ever likely to own.    In looking for clues to French character, the author explores everything from wine culture to cultural politics, movies, food and the higher eroticism, with the same punctiliousness. One can imagine a harassed tourist picking up this book and letting it drop out of his hands. Too big to carry on a visit to France, \\"Fragile Glory\\" is to be read before and especially afterward. One hopes (vain hope?) that people in the State Department responsible for our European policy will read it, and you can bet that business executives bracing for an approach to the Common Market will consult this primer early on.      Is it giving away the plot to reveal Mr. Bernstein's conclusion that French civilization is a success? The nation is up front not only in life's treats like foie gras but also in the development of such contemporary artifacts as the world's first supersonic passenger plane, the fastest regularly operating railway train and a nuclear-energy network in working order. No longer a first-class power, France makes up for that with a superiority complex","excerpt":"one can travel far on myth, and Mr. Bernstein has penetrated this \\"France of the mind.\\" Mr. Bernstein's Paris \\"has more of everything -- more museums and movies, more book stores and restaurants, more intellectuals per square inch, more distinguished men and beautiful women, more shops selling designer clothing, more grand monuments and historic places than just about any other urban conglomeration in the world.\\"   And Mr. Bernstein shows us how Paris achieved that position. He borrows from the historian Fernand Braudel the notion that Paris owed its military advantage, which soon enough became political and spiritual superiority, to the raising of oats, allowing the Carolingians to feed horses, which, when used with newly invented stirrups, guaranteed victory in battle. Despite Paris, France remains a nation of peoples, and could easily have become a federation, like Yugoslavia, rather than the centralized nation we know. Mr. Bernstein takes us on a rapid tour of what the French proudly call their hexagon, with snapshots of landscapes, and insights on regional particularities. He also lets us visit Paris with him, quarter by quarter, the way a Michelin Guide cannot (Michelin eschews the dark side).    \\"Fragile Glory\\" addresses itself without flinching to the matter of French decline, Paris no longer being the place where things happen first. Mr. Bernstein finds redeeming qualities all the same, as in the passionate way Parisians defend their cultural heritage both monumental and literary. If Parisians are no longer at the top of the heap, they'll continue to act as if they were. The author deals evenly with French-American relations, which are never as good as one expects them to be (considering how the United States helped to save France in two World Wars and one cold war). Americans, Mr. Bernstein shows, are often lumped together with the British, the neighbor the French seem to detest more than they do the Germans. He offers a tongue-in-cheek description of the belligerent French campaign -- laws and all -- against use of the English language (obviously a sign of a culture unsure of itself). \\"Lurking behind\\" the language crusade, Mr. Bernstein writes, is \\"the longing for national glory,\\" and an underlying anti-Americanism.     The author characterizes President Francois Mitterrand as \\"an opportunist, in the great French tradition of political opportunism,\\" which is almost too kind, for of course Charles de Gaulle twice removed himself from power because he refused to be an opportunist, and Mr. Mitterrand's chief rival, Jacques Chirac, enmeshed in principles slightly out of step with his times, is losing his last crack at the throne because of them. Perceiving his countrymen's essential suspicion of things foreign, even of allies, Mr. Mitterrand has adopted some of the characteristics of Gaullist aloofness. Significantly, in the prudent manner of this author, Mr. Bernstein never comes out flatly against Mr. Mitterrand's \\"royalist habits,\\" preferring to sum up the arguments of others.    Perhaps it is just as well; it makes \\"Fragile Glory\\" a compendium of the best and most useful    French    thinking about France. Mr. Bernstein is almost too conscientious in trying to explain everything while covering all exceptions and variants. But it is nice to have so scrupulous a reporter around when the subject is as complicated as this one: a people not quite ready to sit still for a portrait.

And I said that in the absence of its truth claims – claims like salvation is through belief in Jesus Christ who rose from the dead and redeemed us by taking upon himself all our sins – a religion was nothing more than a set of stories and ritual practices bereft of any transcendent meaning of which they would be the expression. You can teach those stories and practices – just as you might teach the stories and practices of baseball (which is, I know, the religion of some people) – but you wouldn’t, I insisted, be teaching religion, only its empty shell.Of the hundred or so comments I received, only a few indicated agreement with my point. The others raised a number of objections, and among those objections three were prominent: 1) I fail to understand that one can teach the truth claims of religion as historical and cultural facts without either believing or disbelieving in them: “To understand the works of Christians such as Chaucer, Dante, Milton or Shakespeare, one must understand something of Christianity. One must not, however, become a Christian.” 2) Teaching the exclusive truth claims of a religion as matters of fact goes against the principles of liberal democracy and liberal education: “Teaching religious thought as dogma is not education, but theocracy.” 3) What I said in this column is contradicted by what I said in earlier columns: “The argument you present seems to run counter to your prior claim that any potentially controversial topic can and should be studied within ‘academicized’ grounds.”First of all, I stipulate to the usefulness of teaching the bible as an aid to the study of literature and history. I’m just saying that when you do that you are teaching religion as a pedagogical resource, not as a distinctive discourse the truth or falsehood of which is a matter of salvation for its adherents. One can of course teach that too","excerpt":"one can, that is, get students to understand that at least some believers hold to their faith in a way that is absolute and exclusionary; in their view nonbelievers have not merely made a mistake – as one might be mistaken about the causes of global warming – they have condemned themselves to eternal perdition. (“I am the way.”) What one cannot do – at least under the liberal democratic dispensation – is teach that assertion of an exclusive and absolute truth as anything but someone’s opinion; and in many classes that opinion will be rehearsed with at best a sympathetic condescension (“let’s hope they grow out of it”) and at worst a condemning ridicule (“even in this day and age, there are benighted people”).

Feodor Chaliapin, the Russian basso, has the title rôle in \\"Don Quixote,\\" and George Robey, the popular English comedian who last was seen here as Ali Baba in \\"Chu Chin Chow,\\" is the roving knight's faithful servant, Sancho Panza.The film is an episodic treatment of the novel which can more readily be pardoned for its alteration of scenes and sequence than for its failure to catch the essential meaning of the Cervantes work. Its Don Quixote emerges as a lunatic, but not a comic one nor one blessed with flashes of rational wit. Its treatment is heavy-handed and definitely on the tragic side.The explanation may lie in Chaliapin's performance, or, more accurately, in his very self. He is too majestic, too dignified a figure to appear ridiculous even when mounted on the ambulant hat-rack, Rozinante, and clad in fragments of dented armor. The most laughable incidents in the book—Quixote's historic tilt with the windmill, his charge upon a flock of sheep in the belief that they are giants, and his midnight combat with the wine-filled goatskins—fall flat on the screen. The beholder's feeling is merely one of grief at the spectacle of a man whose mind has given way","excerpt":"one cannot, in all humanity, find the heart to laugh.This fault is so primary that it overshadows the many excellent qualities of the film—its fine photography, settings and its novelty.The screen version begins with Don Quixote in the first stages of his lunacy, the old-fashioned Spanish gentleman who has sold his estate for books on knight-errantry and has become so enmeshed in deeds of chivalry that he decides to ride forth to rid the world of injustice. His mock-heroic antics eventually land him by the heels. His books are burned and, at the sight, the broken old man dies. This ending does not jibe with the novel's, but neither does the main body of the film.The picture probably will win greater favor with audiences who have not read the original work than with those who have. But that seems almost axiomatic of film adaptations of the classics.

Halperin for all the inspiration he has received from his illustrious namesake in fashioning \\"School for Wives,\\" the current film attraction at the Rialto. This title is enigmatic, but we are informed that the narrative was adapted from Leonard Merrick's novel, \\"The House of Lynch.\\" Victor Hugo Halperin of course is not responsible for the scenario, but he would have done well to insist on a new set of subtitles, as the utterances of the characters have all the spontaneity of a chorus girl imitating Henry James. Victor Hugo Halperin appears to have been guided by these captions in his direction, as even Conway Tearle, who gave a splendid performance in the screen version of \\"The Great Divide,\\" does not impress one in this photoplay with his ability to act before the camera.Mr. Tearle figures as Richard Keith, an exemplary artist who seems too good to be on this earth. He refuses to permit his wife to take any part of her father's $200,000,000, because, he declares, the money is tainted. Keith tells Betty prior to their marriage that no man who really loves a girl would consent to benefit by her father's wealth. He wishes that he could only marry Betty without her money!We come then to Betty declaring emphatically her hatred for Keith, while what she really means is that she is desperately in love with him. When Keith leaves for England Betty and a friend are aboard the same steamship. And after a couple of moonlights nights a caption sets forth:\\"Betty's icy aloofness is driving Keith mad.\\"In an ermine coat Betty, played by Sigrid Holmquist, looks wondrously attractive as she lolls lazily in her deck chair. Finally gallant Keith breaks the icy aloofness by spreading his overcoat over the girl. Another moonlight night of the brightest blue and Keith and Betty begin to see eye to eye with each other. So, of course, Betty flicks her fingers at her father's millions and becomes Mrs. Keith, her husband calling her \\"Kiddymalinks.\\"There is a girl who wants her portrait painted by Keith. She has obviously done a very good job herself in assisting nature. She might be called \\"Lips\\" from the exactitude with which the cupld's bow on her lips is outlined and the smashing effect these lips make when she appears on the screen","excerpt":"one could almost say that one sees her lips before noticing her face. Anyhow, this charmer says to Keith:\\"You are a sorcerer, Mr. Keith. You have made me feel as If I were alone on a desert island.\\"Jordan B. Lynch, Betty's father, looks as if he were trying to outdo Mr. Tearle in the mannerism of raising one eyebrow and lowering the other. Gold means much to him, and before Betty marries Keith he tells her that if she loves the young man he will buy him for her. Lynch is often, seen studying a globe map of the world, in which he naturally manifests much interest.Betty, with a permanent wave, looking scrupulously clean and neat, is depicted in one sequence scrubbing a floor, in which work she has but a passing interest. It occurred to us that she would not have to touch her hair or her face to officiate as hostess in any drawing room in the world.Miss Holmquist receives no more opportunity to show any histrionic ability than Mr. Tearle. We imagine that no further comment is needed on this Victor Hugo Halperin effort.

Miss Gore has been curious enough to investigate styles ranging from Handel (at Merkin, a florid Italian cantata with instruments) to Kurt Weill at his frankest (a group of songs from ''Three Penny Opera'') and to collaborate with contemporary composers and avant-garde stage directors. Absent in all this, one has to surmise, has been any particular ambition to sing well. This is not a matter of stingy endowment from nature: Miss Gore has a deep voice of fine quality. But it is uncultivated.

At Columbia University he found both: a job with the Columbia Press during the day, and an education in the classroom at night. Now Professor Luther tells his own evening class students at Hunter College, ''I know how you feel.''   ''It's tough to be a night student,'' he adds. ''To work all day and then come to class - you really have to know what you want.'' Dr. Luther was a night student in the days before many schools, including Columbia, offered complete degree programs for people who could not attend traditional day courses. Evening classes were offered, but the choices were severely limited","excerpt":"one could not fulfill all the requirements for a degree without being available some days.  ''Fortunately, my work schedule at the Press was flexible,'' Dr.  Luther said, ''or I could not have graduated.''   Times have changed, however. Since the early 70's it has become much easier for the nontraditional student, who must work days, for example, to get a degree. Many schools that previously offered only noncredit, continuing-education courses have developed full night curriculums. Other schools with limited programs have expanded them.  Most say the reason is at least partly economic.

Its third season ended Saturday with an orchestral program led by the festival's director, Gundaris Pone. It was well played","excerpt":"one could only wish that the music itself had justified the festival planners' faith in it more persuasively.    The most interesting piece was David Del Tredici's 12-year-old ''Vintage Alice,'' an early installment in what has become a long series of works based on the ''Alice in Wonderland'' stories and poems. Each shares the same main ingredients: earsplitting orchestra, amplified soloist, inordinate length (about half an hour in this relatively short instance), and repetitiveness. This one is based on the Mad Hatter's tea party: the soprano reads the story, with singing interspersed. ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'' (all five stanzas of the Jane Taylor poem) is introduced along with the Hatter's parody of it as ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat.'' ''God Save the Queen'' is prominent, as the Hatter was supposed to have been singing for the queen. The orchestra saws, bangs, and blares away (more dissonantly here than in some of the more recent ones). In this performance there was a blessedly musical hand on the amplification controls: the level was reduced as the singing rose in pitch. Even so, much of it was painfully loud.

His company, Stein & Day, published such best sellers as \\"The Arrangement\\" by Elia Kazan and \\"Confessional\\" by Jack Higgins, and he himself wrote eight novels, incluidng \\"The Magician,\\" which sold more than a million copies.    But Mr. Stein's world crumbled three years ago when Stein & Day was forced into bankruptcy. The company never published another book, and it went out of business last year. From Books to Software      Now, the 64-year-old Mr. Stein is making a remarkable comeback as a publisher. This time, however, he is not publishing books that tell stories, but computer software programs.    Mr. Stein's main program is called WritePro and it is designed to teach creative writing to aspiring fiction writers. Available in three packages of two lessons each, for $19.95 a package, the program has sold more than 20,000 copies in less than two years.    Mr. Stein's company, the WritePro Corporation, in Scarborough, N.Y., was started in 1989 on an investment of a few thousand dollars and has expanded rapidly as sales increased. Now it has seven full-time employees and annual sales of just under $1 million. And Mr. Stein is currently writing a software program for business people and is considering writing one for lawyers.    Mr. Stein, of course, has had plenty of dealings with lawyers because of the bankruptcy of Stein & Day. 'Starting Life All Over Again'      \\"I lost $2.8 million - everything I owned except the house I mortgaged heavily, trying to save our company,\\" he said.    The losses included the company's 11-acre estate in Briarcliff Manor, in suburban Westchester County, which was sold for $1.5 million to repay debts and lawyers' fees. \\"It meant starting life all over again,\\" he said.    Mr. Stein founded Stein & Day in 1962 with his wife, Patricia Day. The house published not only Mr. Kazan and Mr. Higgins, but James Baldwin, Budd Schulberg, the literary critic Lionel Trilling, and Bertram D. Wolfe, an authority on the Soviet Union. With a mix of the serious and the entertaining, Stein & Day published at least one best seller almost every year.    Its downfall began in May 1987 when R.R. Donnelly & Sons, its former printer, obtained a restraining order against Stein & Day, claiming more than $1 million in debts and legal fees. The following month Stein & Day - prohibited by the restraining order from publishing books, but still hoping to do so - sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company, however, was unable to emerge from bankruptcy. Fighting for a Comeback    Even though Stein & Day never published another book, Mr. Stein has been busy writing them. Next Summer, Random House will publish his new novel, \\"The Best Revenge,\\" about shady financial dealings on Broadway. And last year he wrote \\"A Feast for Lawyers\\" (M. Evans & Company), a scathing attack on Chapter 11 bankruptcy.    Mr. Stein began waging his comeback a few months after Stein & Day was served with the restraining order. WIth unexpected time on his hands, he bought a computer for his own writing. \\"I soon aw the possibliites, and began composing WritePro,\\" he said. He originally oped to sell as many as 1,000 programs.    Mr. Stein attributes much of WritePro's success to a review of the program in the Peripheras column of the New York Times in April 1989. That fabvorable article was soon followed by about 100 others in newspapers and computer magazines. Sales have been growing steadily ever since. Software Retailers    WritePro was the first software program offered by the Literary Guild (WritePro's single biggest customer) to its members. And it was the first software chosen for the Barnes & Noble catalogue.    Mr. Stein contends that an important distinction between his creative writing program and others is the difference in the teachers. \\"I've had 36 years of editing, and at the same time I've had nine novels published,\\" he said. 'So in a sense what I've got is not the attitude of a teacher, or of a failed writer, but that of the craftsman who wants to pass along that craft to others.\\"    WritePro emphasizes the importance of rewriting, rewriting and rewriting, and urges users to work on improving characterization, plot and pace in their fiction writing. But it offers no magic formulas or guidleines not found in many other creative writing courses.    The word-processing program does enable its users to write and rewrite directly on the computer screen and compare successive versions. Another feature allows users to remove all adjectives, or all cliche's to see how a story reads without them, and to be able to restore them.    Yet, while Mr. Stein is well along the comeback trail, some authors say privately that they have mixed feelings about his resurgence. Many Stein & Day authors lost royalties when the company entered bankruptcy. And as long as a decade before Stein & Day was liquidated, the Authors Guild recieved periodic complaints from members about late royalty payments. The Publisher's Defense    Mr. Stein defends the actions of Stein & Day in bankruptcy. \\"Part of the reason for undergoing that two-and-a-half year agony,\\" he said, \\"was to protect our authors and see that they got their royalties.\\"    And before that? \\"We managed to be up to date on royalties I'd say 95 percent of the time, although a few times we were late,\\" he said.    Mr. Stein says his role as a publisher has changed considerably. \\"With books, my main purpose was to give pleasure and pass on knowledge,\\" he said. \\"Software is fun, but it's a teaching instrument. So they're very different. One loves books","excerpt":"one doesn't love software.

Australian? We don't get much in the way of Australian wines in the United States. I had tasted Italian wines, Spanish wines, Portuguese wines, Austrian wines, German wines, Canadian wines, Chilean wines, Yugoslav wines, even Chinese wines. But never had an Australian wine passed my lips. So we ordered one of the more expensive ones at the equivalent of about $18, a Tyrrell's cabernet merlot 1978, and were delighted. The wine was light, fruity, low in acid and quite different from the heavier, tannic cabernets of the Napa Valley.   That started us off. We began asking questions about Australian wines, tasting them at every opportunity, and quickly learned that the Australians are very proud of their vintners. And there are many vintners for a country with only 15 million inhabitants, although it is, of course, nearly as large in area as the United States. Most regions produce wines of one kind or another, and there is fierce partisanship about them.

It was directed by Edward Sloman, producer of that worthy effort of the past, \\"His People,\\" and here again Mr. Sloman reveals his sympathy and aptitude for a similar subject. The acting in this film is uncommonly good and the principals are particularly well suited to their respective rôles.Although the humor is far from subtle, it is, nevertheless, a type of fun in keeping with the natures of the characters. Mr. Sloman adds a good deal of polish to this production by some cleverly arranged dissolves. This director has the happy knock of giving just the right footage to his scenes, irrespective of their spectacular value, and he is also careful in holding to the main thread of his story. There are omissions, it is true, especially when Mr. Sloman loses some of his characters by the wayside","excerpt":"one expects to see at least three of these persons toward the end of the picture, but they don't put in an appearance.The general theme of this feature is the illiteracy of the parents and their adherence to the customs of their native lands, opposed to the Americanism of their wide-awake children. In one instance this leads to a daughter being ashamed of her father and mother and their lowly abode.George Sidney is wonderfully effective as the middle-aged Russian tailor. To play this part Mr. Sidney grew a beard and his appearance is therefore true to a familiar type. The various moods of this character, Morris Levine, are singularly well expressed. His irritation sometimes affords amusement and yet one sympathizes with the weary man who has been ironing trousers all day. In an episode wherein he learns, while at night school with the other older characters, of the death of his son in the Argonne, Mr. Sidney is exceptionally fine. And yet his movements are slow. It is done with his eyes and only the almost imperceptible change in his mouth.Albert Gran, who impersonates a German postman in \\"Four Sons,\\" here fills the rôle of the German father, a butcher named Schmidt. His kindly eyes look as though they could never show temper, but when the occasion arises Mr. Gran's eyes blaze with fury. He is especially impressive in a pinochle game and also in the night school episodes. One second he is beaming, his big face glowing with good nature, and the next he is the personification of wrath.It is rare indeed that one discovers as many excellent character studies as there are in this film. Beryl Mercer officiates as Mrs. Levine. There is never a false expression on her countenance. The Italian immigrant also holds his own in the form of Michael Visaroff, who is even quicker at flying into a temper than Schmidt. He can call his son slurring names, but he resents any of his friends alluding to the young man in the same terms.The romance in this film is supplied by Patsy Ruth Miller and John Boles. Miss Miller has changed her coiffure for her rôle, in which she is quite competent. Mr. Boles is handsome, but a little stilted in his movements. Kathlyn Williams impersonates the snobbish and wealthy mother of an old family in this country. Edward Martindel gives a dignified performance as the man of culture.
