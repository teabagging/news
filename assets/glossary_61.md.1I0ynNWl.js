To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists.

As you watch this gifted folk-jazz singer, she emits a heady aura of places lived and music absorbed that floats her around like a ghostly multiple exposure of faces and voices from the past. Those places include Paris, where she forged her musical identity as a street singer, and Athens, Ga. where she was born. The dominant echo in her vocal style is Billie Holiday, whose stealthy phrasing and tangy inflections she replicates down to the tiniest detail. But instead of the raw sensuality and hungry yearning Lady Day and her descendants brought to their songs, Ms. Peyroux projects an ethereal, abstracted wistfulness.

Although this rhythm-and-blues legend has weathered one personal disaster after another, including a serious stroke four years ago, misfortunes that might have silenced a less determined performer have only added dimension to her already larger-than-life musical personality. Ms. Brown's raw shout has deepened into a forceful baritone that is matched by an introspection that confers a tragic monumentality on her material. Until now, she has never been known for reflection. A playful, fun-loving impulse has always up bubbled up in the background, and vestiges of it are still apparent.

The far-reaching series of free events performed in the plazas and parks around Lincoln Center offers an unusually wide spectrum of musical events this weekend. Tonight at 8:15, Mingus Dynasty, the band created in the late 70's to perpetuate the legacy of the jazz composer Charles Mingus, will perform his work at the Damrosch Park Band Shell. In Lincoln Center's North Plaza tomorrow and on Sunday, there will be demonstrations of jazz drumming at 2 P.M. (by Chico Hamilton) and frame drumming at 4:30 P.M. (by Glen Velez and Handance). There will be live music at the Fountain Plaza all afternoon on both days. At 7:30 P.M tomorrow at the Damrosch Park Band Shell, the legendary folk singer and songwriter Pete Seeger will lead a coalition of local choruses in a sing-along concert. At once eloquent and modest, Mr. Seeger, now 75, is still the most convincing spokesman for the sing-along tradition. Re-inventing Champagne    \\"The Night They Invented Champagne: The Lerner and Loewe Revue,\\" Rainbow and Stars, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, (212) 632-5000. The artistic anchor of this uneven tribute to the composers of \\"My Fair Lady,\\" \\"Brigadoon\\" and \\"Camelot\\" is Martin Vidnovic, a powerful theatrical baritone too rarely seen on Broadway. Mr. Vidnovic offers riveting renditions of \\"If Ever I Would Leave You\\" and \\"Gigi,\\" among other Lerner and Loewe favorites. Although the show's other performers -- Maureen Brennan, Eddie Korbich and Juliet Lambert -- don't inhabit the songs as completely, they are thoroughly professional. The director, Deborah R.

Our experience has been quite the opposite.    Each year, 98 percent of the birth mothers who place children for adoption with the help of Golden Cradle sign a waiver of confidentiality. Almost 100 percent of the birth families we contact after the adoption has taken place willingly provide letters and photographs or other information requested by the adoptive family.    Some go on to speak with or meet the adoptive family and child. Even without receiving a request from the agency, birth mothers very often send us new addresses and phone numbers with a note that says, \\"Just in case you need to reach me.\\"   Although none of the nearly 1,000 children adopted through our agency have reached 18, from our experience we believe that when they do, their birth parents will welcome contact.    Our birth parents know that deciding on adoption is painful, but it is never something to be ashamed of or to be forgotten. It is our hope that today's progressive adoption practices will remove the stigma from all birth parents and replace it instead with the honor that is due to any man or woman who has given the gift of life. Then perhaps there will not be any need to hide in shame but rather to rejoice when their child, after growing to adulthood, wants to say hello. MARLENE PIASECKI Exec.

You can listen to Wagner's \\"Faust\\" Overture forward, backward, upside down or out on the veranda of the Villa Wahnfried, and it's still a pretty dubious piece.   And there is a corollary: great music is not exclusively produced by great composers.

Because of enormous interest in the paintings, ''the museum will display them, in their current state, to the public and the media, for a short period,'' a statement said. Both paintings were damaged but ''are in better shape than expected,'' said Jorun Christoffersen, a museum spokeswoman, who added, ''They will need some major restoration work.'' A photograph, above, released by the museum on its Web site, www.munch.museum.no, showed that the lower left corner of ''The Scream'' was crumpled, and that ''Madonna'' had a scratch and a tear in the canvas. The paintings, stolen in 2004 in broad daylight, were recovered two weeks ago. The police have not said how they retrieved them. Before they were recovered, three men were convicted of complicity in the theft.    Turkish Novelist Faces Trial       A prominent Turkish novelist who faces trial next week for ''insulting Turkishness'' says the case is the first to pivot on words uttered by fictional characters, Reuters reported. The novelist, Elif Shafak, above, a feminist who writes in English and Turkish, has been charged in connection with her new novel, ''The Bastard of Istanbul.'' The case is being followed closely by the European Union, which says Turkey must foster more freedom of expression as a condition of membership. Ms. Shafak, 34, is scheduled to give birth during the week the trial, set for Sept. 21, is to begin. She has been charged under a provision of Turkey's penal code that has been used against several journalists and authors. Ms. Shafak said that to date the article ''has never been used against fictional characters.'' ''In that sense this is a new step,'' she said, ''and it's quite surprising and upsetting, because if they keep doing this, no one can write novels in this country anymore","excerpt":"no one can make movies, even.'' In her novel, Armenian characters make disparaging comments about Turks and refer to the genocide of Armenians during the Ottoman Empire, a massacre denied by Turkey.    Bush 'Assassination' Film Acquired for Wide Release       Newmarket Films, the company that handled Mel Gibson's ''Passion of the Christ,'' has acquired the distribution rights to ''Death of a President,'' the provocative Gabriel Range pseudodocumentary that depicts the assassination of President Bush, Reuters reported. Newmarket is expected to give the film a wide release in the next few months. It was seen recently at the Toronto International Film Festival and is to be shown next month on Channel 4 in Britain. ''We portrayed the horror of assassination,'' said Mr. Range, who said he had received five or six death threats as a result of his movie, which has evoked protests from some conservatives. ''I don't think anyone would get the idea of assassinating Bush from this film.''    Accolades       Britain will pay tribute to the Beatles in January when it issues a set of six stamps featuring album covers from their most famous recordings, above, the BBC reported. The collection includes ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' ''Abbey Road,'' ''Help!,'' ''Revolver,'' ''Let It Be'' and ''With the Beatles.''  The European Film Academy will honor Roman Polanski, 73, with its lifetime achievement award at ceremonies in December in Warsaw. Mr. Polanski's films include ''Chinatown'' and ''The Pianist,'' winner of the 2002 Academy Award for best director. Mr. Polanski fled the United States in 1977 after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl.  Shi-Yeon Sung, a 31-year-old South Korean, has become the first woman to win the Sir Georg Solti International Conductors' Competition, held every two years in Frankfurt, Agence France-Presse reported.

She perfectly mirrors the troubling pop-cultural climate over which she holds sway.   From that standpoint, \\"Truth or Dare\\" is at the very least a potent conversation piece. It can also be seen as a clever, brazen, spirited self-portrait, an ingeniously contrived extension of Madonna's public personality and a studied glimpse into what, in the case of most other pop luminaries, would be at least a quasi-hidden realm.

Paul seems to agree when he writes that ''the unconscious mind . . . is by definition not directly observable.'' That was my whole point, green cheese or no green cheese.    The passage that Howard Stein quotes from Leviticus is not necessarily an injunction to love universally. The word re'a in the original Hebrew can mean ''neighbor,'' or ''friend,'' or ''fellow man,'' and it has always been unclear whether this phrase referred to Israelites or to all people. Robert Alter, in his brilliant new translation of the Torah, does use ''fellow man.'' In any case, the passage occurs between an admonition not to bear grudges against other Israelites and instructions for breeding livestock and growing food. Universal love, including love of one's enemies, is the utopian essence of Christianity, unique to Western religion. It is not the essence of Judaism.     The Richardses make a welcome, if inadvertent, point.

He loves movies and video games, and he has 30,000 songs on five iPods. Two and a half years ago, he was at a company holiday party that featured a brief video titled, ''Who Is Marc Ecko?'' In it, Gary Coleman, the former child star, walked up and down Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, asking people if they were familiar with the clothing line Ecko Unlimited, which often features the stark silhouette of a rhinoceros on T-shirts, baggy jeans and other garments. They were shown photographs of four men and asked which one they figured was Ecko. Most picked the cool-looking black man. Hardly anyone chose the boyish white guy, who perhaps appeared a bit too much like a grown-up New Jersey mall rat to be running a multimillion-dollar clothing line that routinely turned up in rap videos. But that, of course, was Ecko. Everybody knew the brand","excerpt":"no one knew the man.     The man could certainly afford to join in the laughter that night.

Vocalists who influenced him include the usual pantheon of gods (Bessie, Billie, Frank, Bing, Nat, Ella, Louis) and grandes dames (Ethel Waters, Mabel Mercer, Connee Boswell, Helen Forrest), as well as a few artists not known primarily for their singing: Johnny Mercer, Woody Herman, Fred Astaire. A gifted arranger and composer as well as a pre-eminent performer of American popular music, Mr. Torme displays the extent of his musicianship as he discusses the songwriters, instrumentalists, arrangers, bandleaders, vocal groups, Broadway and film vocalists and scat singers who are among his \\"role models almost too numerous to mention.\\" I was fascinated to read that he numbers among his \\"heroes and heroines\\" the offstage Hollywood singers who were the \\"voices of the stars\\" in the film musicals of the 1940's, 50's and 60's: Anita Ellis, Carole Richards, Martha Mears, Marni Nixon, Buddy Clark and others.

TELEVISION  Is the Buzz the Message?  You didn't watch \\"Central Park West\\" last week? That took great strength of character, considering the mind-boggling effort that CBS, desperate to lure younger viewers with something glitzy, put into hyping the show. It went way beyond buzz -- the network enlisted every bee in its hive to promote this one: the stars' faces adorning Manhattan buses, \\"advertorials\\" (horrible word), board games, even a World Wide Web site. The goal, as one marketing type put it: \\"entertainment-fashion-media-advertising synergy.\\" Whew! That's a mouthful.  HEALTH CARE  Will This Fix Medicare?  House Republicans were determined to slash $270 billion out of seven years' worth of projected Medicare spending, and last week they said they'd found a way. But have they? Yes, premiums would rise -- slightly for most, sharply for the rich -- but the plan is short on incentives to nudge the elderly into H.M.O.'s. Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich insist that a free market in health care choices will make it all better -- even without those incentives. But critics like Representative Henry Waxman said cuts in payments to doctors would \\"destroy Medicare in a few short years.\\" And many elements of the plan are still vague, prompting Democrats to say crucial details are being hidden.  ROCKEFELLER CENTER  It's Hard Being a Trophy  How can this happen? One of the world's prize properties, Rockefeller Center, is caught up in such convoluted financial games that billions are being lost on it. The answer is that no one really \\"owns\\" such a place, one merely owns the right to collect rents and pay the bills -- but that right is a dubious trophy indeed when the bills exceed the rents. Last week Mitsubishi Estate decided it wanted no more of such losing math and bailed out -- and expects to pay $1 billion for its lesson in New York real estate economics. At which point more investors -- like Sam Zell and Goldman, Sachs -- rushed in, cash in hand, to make it even more complicated. The venerable buildings didn't even sway. POLITICS  Tobacco Money for the G.O.P.  At a time when it faces various regulatory threats -- Government efforts to label nicotine an addictive drug, for instance, and to reduce sales to teen-agers -- the tobacco industry is pouring money into Republican coffers. In the first half of this year, the industry contributed $1.5 million, five times as much as last year's first six months. Nearly half that sum came from Philip Morris. Representative Henry Waxman said the tobacco industry \\"has gotten its hooks into the Republican leadership.\\" And the head of Common Cause called the heavy donations \\"a desperate last effort.\\" But a spokesman for Brown & Williamson -- also a donor -- cited his company's belief in the Republican vision of \\"less government, less red tape.\\" COMMUNICATIONS Policing the Internet  Computer networks are indisputably glorious things. No stamps, no paper, no fuss. A generation that thought letter-writing had surely died in a sun-washed 19th-century morning room has suddenly started to communicate. Now, alas, comes the dark side. Some people are using this strange new toy to send out child pornography or even lure children to sex. This gets complicated, for even if you get past the ethical question -- isn't private communication private? -- a huge practical one remains: how can you possibly monitor the zillions of 1's and 0's zooming through cyberspace? You can't always, of course, but last week -- after a four-year F.B.I. investigation -- came dozens of arrests for on-line porn and solicitation. THE WORKPLACE  Women's Progress, Stalled  Are women moving steadily closer to equal status in the workplace? Surely nothing could stop the momentum of recent years. Or could it? In a poll out last week, only 56 percent of women said the role of women was continuing to change -- down from 73 percent five years ago. Do women \\"face more restrictions\\" than men? Yes, said 84 percent, with 77 percent saying sexual discrimination \\"remains a serious problem.\\" And 76 percent said there was sexual harassment in the workplace.  STATISTICS  Do-It-Yourself Inflation  Numbers flow mercilessly from the Government -- statistics with little apparent purpose except to keep statisticians busy -- and many are easily ignored. But not the Consumer Price Index. \\"This is real,\\" said Pat Moynihan. \\"Everything else is talk.\\" This mighty inflation gauge, after all, dictates cost-of-living increases for Social Security and adjustments in tax brackets, and the tiniest blip translates into billions of dollars. What a gift to budget-cutters, then, if the index was found to be flawed. Sure enough, last week a Congressional panel said the index greatly overstates inflation -- and fixing it could trim $634 billion from the deficit over 10 years. This wouldn't exactly be a gift to retirees, though. Part of the index's flaw, it seems, is that it doesn't pick up shifts in buying patterns in response to higher prices. So if this \\"flaw\\" is fixed, Social Security recipients struggling to stretch their budgets would, in a sense, be doing the Government a favor, not themselves.  TRANSPORTATION  Tunnel of Lost Cash  Talk about a money pit! The Channel tunnel cost such a staggering sum to build -- $15 billion -- that it now faces interest costs of more than $3 million a day. A day! The tunnel's doing fine, mind you -- Eurostar trains are 75 percent full. But there's no way it can shell out that killer interest, and last week the company that runs it said it would simply not pay much of that interest for perhaps 18 months. Which means, of course, that big changes are coming -- and investors will be out a lot of money. But it will certainly keep running. \\"You cannot sell a hole in the ground for much,\\" said a Eurotunnel executive, \\"if you've closed it.\\" THE MARKETS  Stocks Are Up. Period.

Hauser's vision of a Middle East peace initiative in which the Palestine Liberation Organization plays a prominent role (Op-Ed, Feb. 13) is off the mark and is discredited by your news report of the same day on dwindling support for Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman.   Ms. Hauser's unqualified support for the P.L.O. has blinded her to the realities of the P.L.O.'s position toward Israel and genuine peace. The P.L.O.'s support for Saddam Hussein, its praise of Iraqi missile attacks against Israeli civilians and its commitment to terrorism and Israel's destruction have further exposed the true character of the P.L.O. Indeed, even the Israeli left, which has advocated negotiations with the P.L.O., has acknowledged that the P.L.O. does not seek peace.   In the Arab world as well, contrary to Ms. Hauser's assertions, support for the P.L.O. has eroded. Egyptian, Saudi and other officials from the Persian Gulf countries vilify the P.L.O. and distance themselves from it. Exemplifying the Arab leadership's position is a statement this month by the Secretary-General of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Abdullah Y. Bishara:    \\"The P.L.O. and its cohorts committed an unforgivable crime against our people. Because of their bankruptcy and impotence, they tried to salvage what they could from the assault on the Kuwaitis.\\"   Furthermore, Ms. Hauser errs in her assessment that the P.L.O. has not lost the allegiance of the Arab street and remains the \\"legitimate representative of virtually all Palestinians.\\" In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, for example, the Islamic fundamentalist factions Hamas and Islamic Jihad are increasing their political clout and power among Palestinian Arabs. Hamas is widely believed to be supported by nearly 80 percent of Gazans. Moderate Palestinian leaders on the West Bank are quietly expressing their disillusionment with the P.L.O. leadership.   Ms. Hauser's advice -- that the United States should renew ties with the P.L.O. and refrain from advancing direct talks between Israel and Syria -- is detrimental to Arab-Israeli peace. The basis of the Arab-Israeli conflict is the refusal of 20 Arab states to end their state of war with Israel. If anything, we should prod the Syrians to sit down and talk with Israel. It is likely that other Arab states would follow if Damascus forged peace with Jerusalem.   Clearly, it is the Arab states and Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza who seek peace with Israel to whom the United States should turn. The P.L.O. has no role to play in the search for Arab-Israeli peace. ABRAHAM H.

And yet, despite that freedom of operation, Israeli soldiers continue to die there, because they simply have no answer for suicide bombers.

Mayor David Dinkins's latest demands could mean substantial teacher layoffs, and Gov. Mario Cuomo's new plan to close the state's huge budget deficit would cut $75 million from state aid to city schools.    Mr. Fernandez is surely right to fight","excerpt":"no part of municipal responsibility needs more help than education. But there's no denying the plunge in city revenues. At a time of widespread sacrifice, Mr. Fernandez appeared to have been taking obstinacy to the point of incredibility. New Yorkers who wish him and the schools well will welcome signs that he is moving to a more constructive approach.    The severe downturn in the city and state economies has obliterated all budget forecasts. The city is trying to close a $388 million gap this year; the state may be short $1 billion. Despite this, the city rashly agreed to a one-year salary increase for teachers of 5.5 percent. Part of the increase, which Mr. Fernandez supported enthusiastically, would be financed with $70 million out of $153 million in state aid that is normally used to cover inflationary costs in Board of Education programs.    In a healthier economic climate, that would be acceptable. But under present circumstances, committing $70 million to teacher salaries puts Mr. Fernandez in a bind. That's because City Hall, having promised raises to the teachers, has also asked the board to cut its budget by $90 million.    Initially, Mr. Fernandez was only willing to identify $57.5 million in cuts. He notes that in the last 10 months the school system has already been asked to absorb $183 million in cuts, and that the central staff has been reduced by about 1,000 people. To pare the system any further, Mr. Fernandez insists, would cut muscle.    He may be right. But instead of making his case coolly, he spoke melodramatically about laying off 1,600 to 6,000 teachers. A more sensible strategy would have been to exhort the 32 community boards to cut administrative personnel first, minimizing the impact on educational quality. Why couldn't the Chancellor, who has been an effective advocate for a beleaguered school system, press community districts with the same energy he used to resist the Mayor?   In recent days, Mr. Fernandez appears to have recognized the need for a shrewder approach. He still disagrees with City Hall's contention that the board is merely being asked to take its fair share of cuts. But he at last seems willing to sit down with City Hall, community board leaders, parents and concerned citizens in an effort to reach consensus on a plan that will not devastate classroom services.    The city's troubles are real; the issue is not whether school cuts are needed, but how to minimize the loss.

What he's been asked to do is simple enough: a publicity agent for his record label, Sire/Warner Brothers, has handed him a couple of black-and-white glossy press photos and requested that he sign them. But these few words have become a consuming labor for Mr. Scott. Left-handed, hunched over an office conference table, he writes each stroke and letter with an individual and painstaking precision. His concentration nearly stills the air. Several minutes later, he leans back with a slight smile and scrutinizes his work: \\"To Ron, may we always be friends, Jimmy Scott.\\" To something most performers accomplish in a few seconds, with minimal thought and effort, Mr. Scott has devoted himself, body and soul.   His singing is the same way. Not a note or a breath comes easily","excerpt":"no phrase, verse or sentiment is given over casually or lightly. Mr. Scott's voice does in fact possess the power to turn the world around him into silence. Unusually high without being a falsetto, it at first seems more like a woman's voice; his extremely unconventional phrasing extends some words and clips others, sometimes rewriting portions of a song's melody. But what is most potent about Mr. Scott's voice is the emotion that comes through it. Like the great blues-rooted jazz singers, from Billie Holiday to Louis Armstrong to Dinah Washington, he uses technique as a means to individual expression. When Mr. Scott touches a song, its story is begun anew.

Rapunzel, on the other hand, has the allure of her golden braid, which is long enough for the Prince to crawl up and into her lonely tower, where he devises a scheme to help her escape. The fairy tale ensues gallantly, although this rendition certainly scales back on the Witch's cruelty, and instead offers a positive, if not modern approach: Rapunzel and the Prince want desperately to be taken seriously, to explore their love for each other and the world. As Rapunzel puts it, \\"I want to take a bath in a stream.\\" This production's buoyant actors -- Rapunzel has an especially pretty, appealing face -- cheery costumes and quilted, versatile sets are richly empowered to create an hour of wise and cheeky fun. Tickets to the Saturday and Sunday shows, which are at 12:30 P.M., are $13 and $16. Children under 5 are not welcome","excerpt":"no refreshments are served and there is no intermission. Hackers, Hitters and Hoops  123 West 18th Street Manhattan (212) 929-7482 Recommended ages: 5 and up     Do your children have urges to throw a few hardballs at the sofa? Putt golf balls under the davenport? Shoot basketballs at the amphora? At least they don't have to contain themselves at Hackers, Hitters and Hoops, a new sports center in Chelsea. Housed under one roof and within 23,000 square feet are batting cages, computerized and miniature golf, basketball hoops and a regulation court, Ping-Pong tables and Orbitron, a workout station that rolls you around like a gyro. Indeed, expending energy seems to be the reason for being in this warehouselike space conceived by two New York entrepreneurs. The lounge, unfortunately, seems like an afterthought, serving hot dogs, chips, ice cream, popcorn and other quick energy-inducing goodies in a locker-room decor. Tokens (five for $5; 11 for $10, and 23 for $20) are used for all games, some of which can be rented out by the hour, like the batting cages for $30. Otherwise, the miniature golf costs 7 tokens for adults and 4 for children 12 and under; the hoops are 3 tokens per player for one round; the Orbitron is 2 tokens for a two-minute ride (you have to be at least 4 feet 6 inches tall to go on), and Ping-Pong is 7 tokens per hour per table; a robotic server is 8 tokens. The center's hours are Sundays through Thursdays, 10 A.M. to 10 P.M., and Fridays and Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 12:30 A.M. 'To Kill a Mockingbird'  Paper Mill Playhouse Brookside Drive Millburn, N.J. (201) 376-4343 Recommended ages: 9 and up Through March 23     It's not much of a task to venture out to suburban Essex County, N.J., to the Paper Mill Playhouse, which was rebuilt in 1980 after a devastating fire to accommodate a 1,200-seat theater. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel set in Alabama in 1935, makes the trip that much more worth your while. In this production, George Grizzard plays Atticus Finch, the sagacious lawyer who defends a poor black man accused of raping a white woman. Though Finch is the central character, it is his children, Jem and Scout, who express their disbelief over the racism and moral impoverishment in their town. Older children will undoubtedly find this story relevant, with its blunt depiction of peer pressure, ridicule and injustice, no matter where they live or what decade it is. Scout and Jem, with their intelligent plainspokenness, prove how unpopular you can be, sometimes, when you try to shape a strong moral conscience. As Scout says at the end, \\"I feel old.\\" The sets are handsomely evocative, with sleepy clapboard-house facades and ghostly Spanish moss and kudzu. Boo Radley's house is perfectly ramshackle. A 15-minute intermission, where the actors remain on stage during the courtroom recess, allows theatergoers to buy candy, cappuccino or Paper Mill Playhouse memorabilia. Performances up to March 19 are Wednesdays through Sundays at 8 P.M., with 3 P.M. matinees on Saturdays and Sundays, and one at 2 P.M. on Thursdays. Starting on March 19, performances will be Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 P.M., Tuesdays through Thursdays at 12:30 P.M. and Saturdays at 3 P.M. Tickets range from $22 to $36. Feld Ballets/NY  The Joyce Theater 175 Eighth Avenue (at 19th Street) Manhattan (212) 242-0800 Recommended ages: 8 and up Sunday     The Feld Ballets/NY dance company is offering a family matinee on Sunday, an afternoon of the troupe's \\"Meadowlark,\\" \\"A Footstep of Air\\" and \\"The Jig Is Up,\\" whimsical, droll and romantic pictorial ballets that sweep the long-awaited days of spring onto the stage. In \\"Meadowlark,\\" older children will be able to visualize how animated waltzes can be -- since they probably don't go to many themselves -- as the dancers seem to breeze off the page of a Russian novel, wearing cloudlike pastel costumes and flirting unabashedly to music by Haydn. \\"A Footstep of Air\\" continues the jaunt, with lightfooted but vivacious dancing to Beethoven's arrangement of Celtic tunes. \\"The Jig Is Up\\" takes the audience once more to Ireland, where eventually the entire ballet company displays, in ragamuffin clothing, how the jig transcends even the sorriest of youthful hearts. The ballets, all revivals choreographed by Eliot Feld, begin at 2 P.M. The intermissions give everyone enough time to leap down to the lobby for cheese sticks (50 cents each) or, for parents, a glass of champagne ($5). And though this program is meant to attract families, tickets are still $27 each. However, group rates for parties of 20 or more are available.  New York City Mounted Police  Unit Headquarters 42d Street, between 11th and 12th Avenues Manhattan (212) 239-9352 Recommended ages: 4 and up    The Mounted Police is an elite force within the New York City Police Department that coddles its \\"vehicles\\" as if they were right out of the cradle. Appointments are necessary for weekend and weekday visits at one of the department's six barns throughout the city, where you'll see firsthand how much these 90 beauties are pampered. Sometimes a horse won't have to venture out in cold weather, said an officer at TriBeCa's Troop A. Other horses have bad days, when everyday stress makes them peevish. The 142 troopers and the 90 horses are trained at stables in Brooklyn and the Bronx, where the horses undergo a three-month process to break them in for the streets, and the police practice eight hours a day for up to eight weeks. All the horses are geldings and most are Morgans, though H. Ross Perot once donated Tennessee walking horses, which make riding on the streets a little too uncomfortable. The presiding Commanding Officer picks the horses' names -- Galapo, Digger, Finbar, etc. -- usually after a notable police officer or commissioner; if he doesn't like you, he might choose a foolish name. Do the horses ever run away? \\"Occasionally,\\" said Officer Mike Melis, \\"but it's always back to the barn.\\" Do they obey the traffic rules? \\"Some meander back slowly, but then some don't even stop for red lights,\\" he said. The informal tours for children accompanied by an adult are usually conducted from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. on the weekends and weekdays, pending the availability of the troops.  KEEP IN MIND    \\"A GREAT NIGHT FOR THE IRISH,\\" starring the Irish tenor Frank Patterson and including the 12 Tiny Tots of Irish Dance and the Little Gaelic Singers of New York.

For the first time in nearly a century there was no parade. Its organizers, a veterans group, had canceled the procession after the state's highest court ruled that a gay grouphad the right to be included.   To South Boston, which has felt under siege ever since court-ordered busing for school integration began 20 years ago, it was yet another assault by outsiders. But some things don't change, and one of them is Billy Bulger's St. Patrick's Day luncheon at the Bayside Club. Mr. Bulger, who rose from a South Boston housing project to become not just the state senate president but one of the most powerful men in the state, presided today, as he has for 28 years.    And for a few hours in a packed, overheated old tavern, with Mr. Bulger singing Irish songs and roasting his friends and foes over boiled corned beef and cabbage and green ice cream, this St. Patrick's Day was like all the others. On this day Senator Edward M. Kennedy, United States Representative Joe Moakley, Gov. William F. Weld (one of only a few Republicans, and a token Yankee to boot) and Mayor Thomas M. Menino, along with dozens of state and city legislators, put on their green ties and made the journey over the bridge and across Fort Point Channel to South Boston.    So did Bob Sances, a guy from the neighborhood who made good -- he is an engineer -- and moved to the suburbs, but still returns to see his old friends from M and Seventh Streets. \\"Finally, after all these years I got in,\\" Mr. Sances said, taking his place at a long table festooned with green cloth napkins and pots of clover. \\"I grew up with Billy Bulger. He's a very deep thinker. He doesn't like to talk to the press.\\" The senate president reads Latin and Greek, and he doesn't hold press conferences.    Mr. Sances added, with some pride, \\"I came in the V.I.P. door.\\" It was the only door. To get there, the 600 or so invited guests had to climb the rickety fire escape. Mr. Sances was lucky. He got a chair, one of 200.    At 10:45 A.M. President Clinton himself was on the telephone. \\"I know that this morning I'm just the other President on the phone,\\" he said to Mr. Bulger, with his remarks amplified over the public address system.    Mr. Bulger said, \\"I commend you for your humility.\\"    While Mr. Bulger and the former Mayor, Raymond Flynn, who is now the Ambassador to the Vatican, are both from South Boston, they have never been close. \\"It's great you appointed Ray Flynn to the Vatican,\\" Mr. Bulger said to Mr. Clinton. \\"It shows you have a great sense of humor.\\" Later in the conversation, he added: \\"You were kind to take him from us.\\"    Towering over the compact Mr. Bulger, Governor Weld, who is 6 feet 4 inches tall, stood by, waiting for a word with the President.   The President from Hope, Ark., and the president from South Boston joked about Mr. Weld's patrician roots, his house in Cambridge (viewed as an elitist foreign country by South Boston), and his zeal for squash.    \\"Oh, does he love squash,\\" said Mr. Bulger, who keeps trim by running on a treadmill. \\"It's a real class thing. I never played squash. No one around here ever played squash.\\"    Mr. Clinton told Mr. Weld: \\"Your family came over here on the Mayflower and went to Plymouth Rock. My family came to Arkansas in a Plymouth pickup and went to work for Mayflower Van Lines.\\"    The crowd loved it.    And so it went, with more jokes, and lots of singing, for three hours. Toward the end, the podium was taken by John Hurley, president of the Allied War Veterans Council of South Boston, which canceled the parade after the state's highest court ruled it could not ban the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston from marching.   Mr. Bulger, who married his high school sweetheart, Mary, and raised nine children in South Boston, reminded his guests that community mattered more than anything. \\"The South Boston parade belongs to South Boston,\\" he said. And he led the room in a rousing chorus of an old neighborhood anthem, \\"Southie Is My Hometown.\\"    Back across the bridge, the Irish-American gay group that was not a part of Southie's traditions had its own St. Patrick's Day party, at the Arlington Street Church.

Giuliani yesterday read with relish the list of the celebrity criminals Howard Safir rounded up when he worked in the United States Marshals Service during the 1980's. But a moment later, he mentioned a more telling qualification possessed by Mr. Safir: The two men have been friends for two decades.         For all of Mr. Safir's 26 years of Federal law enforcement experience, his principal value to the Mayor may well be those decades of friendship and loyalty. After two years of William J. Bratton, a media-saturated Police Commissioner who never enjoyed taking orders, the Mayor has now filled his most  important commissioner's job with a man unlikely to give him much back talk or outshine him in the national spotlight.

[Page A1, Column 6.] The  Geneva meeting might produce an agreed-upon statement of ''guidelines'' providing impetus to the arms control negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, Reagan Administration officials said. But they stressed that there was only a slim chance of this. [A1:4.] Moscow condemned a radio speech addressed Saturday to Russians by President Reagan, charging the broadcast showed Washington was not interested in peace. [A1:5.] President Reagan gave his support to any move to repeal a resolution adopted 10 years ago by the General Assembly of the United Nations equating Zionism with racism in a message to the Conference on Israel, Zionism and the United Nations in New York. [A1:6.] Thriving free enterprise in Canton impressed and perplexed a Soviet parliamentary delegation that visited the city. ''If this is Marxism, I must re-read Marx,'' one of the Russians is said to have remarked after seeing Western-style hotels and many other signs that Canton is pursuing an ''open door'' policy. [A1:3.] 12 judges shunned memorial rites in Bogota, Colombia, for the scores of people who died in a siege at the Palace of Justice last week. The judges, who survived the battle in which 11 justices died, said they stayed away to protest the Government's handling of the crisis. [A3:1.] Poland took a step toward freeing political prisoners that was still far short of a general amnesty, which had long been hinted at officially. The Government asked prosecutors to make a case-by-case review of prisoners who could be released. [A9:1.] National King George III was defended by his descendant, the Prince of Wales, in a news conference in Washington. He also said his wife found John Travolta a good dancer. The Princess and the actor danced at a White House dinner Saturday night. [A1:1.] An Arizona community was erased because it contained an asbestos hazard. The attractive subdivision of Mountain View Mobile Home Estates, housing about 50 families, was built on the site of asbestos factory just outside Globe, Ariz. [A12:2.] The Soviet seaman who jumped ship off New Orleans had initially ''decided somehow that he wanted to come to the United States,'' Secretary of State George P. Shultz concluded. But he defended  the Reagan Administration's decision to permit the seaman to depart with his ship despite a subpoena by the Senate Agriculture Committee.

Montero (letter, Dec. 29), proposing elimination of transit fares, seem to recommend free rides only on New York City's subways, one arguing that eliminating token clerks would result in undisclosed savings","excerpt":"no such saving could be obtained on buses, though there would be time saved boarding.   To claim that fares are a \\"tax on the working poor\\" stands truth on its head. The fare does not pay the cost of the ride. The rider is subsidized.   It is doubtful that tourists, or anyone else for that matter, will find saving $1.15 an inducement to abandon taxis or automobiles. People use automobiles for convenience, comfort and time saving. They avoid subways because of the press of people, inconvenience, inaccessibility, fear of being molested or attacked, discomfort, noise, confusion in where subways go and how to get to them though a poorly marked maze of dingy, dirty tunnels, ramps, passageways and stairs, closed exits and entrances requiring four-block detours. They also avoid poorly scheduled, sometimes overcrowded buses, running in herds, leavings gaps of 5 to 10 minutes of waiting time, with bus stops as much as six blocks apart (47th to 53d Street on Fifth Avenue).   Auto drivers will shift to transit when the costs of parking, including fines, rise even further, gasoline doubles in price or becomes scarce and travel time increases.   The advocates of free fares are using the wrong arguments if they believe that a reduction of $1.15 in the transportation expense of someone who is willing to spend $25 or more for a one-way-trip into and within Manhattan is going to clean up the city's air or significantly reduce congestion.

A week from now, two weeks, a month, it is finally that unpostponable morning after that follows an unthinkable cancellation of the season. The exhilaration of those final frantic hours when, as owner or player, you stood proudly with your brethren and did what you had to do, is gone. Now it is done. Now nothing about hockey matters until September.   It is 5 years from now, or 10, and every year after that. You are a former player or owner, commissioner or executive director. You are a doer by nature","excerpt":"no thought sits long undirected in your mind, no feeling unchanneled, uncontrolled. But every time you see the line 1994-95 (No Season) you wince. You scramble and cover the wince, explaining to that holdout part of you why it happened, had to happen, how it was better that way, but you can never explain well enough. You see it; you wince.   Three days after, 5 or 10 years after, every year after that, was it worth it? Even remembering all the details of that time, everything that made you do what you did, but knowing the rest, too, would you still do it? Forget the effect on fans, sponsors, bottom lines and bank statements. Those you can argue any way you want. What about on you? How does it make you feel about you?   It is now. The owners, until yesterday, had been insisting on a salary cap or payroll tax. The players had refused. There was no common ground, \\"no basis for agreement.\\" Everybody was doing his job. Gary Bettman's was to get labor peace for the owners under a formula in which player salaries rise less precipitously. Bob Goodenow's was to build a player union strong and unified enough to resist, to allow the market to take salaries where they go. The problem needed only a nudge to start. Whose push turned to whose shove didn't matter. As with most strikes and lockouts, both sides wanted a fight.   Now, in light of yesterday's new offer by the owners, the question is: Do the two sides finally want to stop?   Issues don't divide, attitudes do. A partly cloudy day is mostly sunny if you decide to see it that way. When there is a will for war, fighting happens. When there is a will for peace, it stops. What can turn hockey's will for division into a will for agreement?   The fans have been remarkably patient. Supposedly passionate about their game and teams, they have done little picketing, issued few threats of future boycott. Perhaps it is because settlement (to them) has always seemed imminent; perhaps because for so long, the alternative game has seemed almost as exciting. Showdown meetings, team player against team owner, expressions of solidarity, not much that had \\"Play of the Day\\" potential, but something to talk about.   Yet the fans have been patient because they know their place. Players and owners can choose to play, or not play. The power is in their hands, and fans know that. They do not like it, but it's a power they respect. And between the fans, the players and the owners, some unexpressed bargain seems to have been struck. How much of a season you give me, a fan says, is your right. That you give me a season, is mine. Not because I have any power over that, but because it is right. Break the bargain, break the patience.   A sport seems unimaginably important during the early days of a strike or lockout. As days pass, it becomes clear how much greater fantasy is to any reality. Life does go on. Call the bluff, and you may get an answer you don't want to hear. What we always assumed was passion may have only been habit.   But the will to agreement needs a way, and the players and owners, until now, have found none. It may be they have been looking in the wrong place. They want to put this unrelenting squabbling behind them. They're tired, the fans are tired. Everyone needs to get on with it. Always fighting over who gets what share of the pie, they need peace to grow that pie. Years of it! But what is the formula, appropriate now, flexible enough to apply to all the changes of later, that both sides can live with? Basketball thought it had one; now its players don't think so, and they play the N.B.A. season looking for something new. Football and baseball are looking, too.   It's not there! That's the message of the length and vehemence of the baseball and hockey labor disputes.  History is moving in the players' direction; the owners want to stop the clock. For them, the future seems an impossibly difficult place. Next year is one thing; two, three, four years from now, they can see where the players are going and they can't see how they can get there themselves. But history isn't lived in four-year chunks. Today, you manage; tomorrow, you find a way. And tomorrow after that. There is no way that every baseball team in 1975 could survive this free agency era that has followed, and yet every team has.   The business of sport is changing too rapidly. The formula as solution is an illusion. Long-term interests, from the perspective of now, are too divided. If the search for formula continues through negotiation and seasons await the outcome, there will be no seasons. There isn't one team that can't survive until next year. Focus on four-year deals to put trouble behind you, and you put nothing but trouble in front of you. A four, five or six-year focus turns things ideological, hypothetical, rhetorical, makes the possible impossible. Yesterday's formula was power, and the owners had it. Now in all sports, there is a growing balance. It is hard to break the other guy, bring him to your way of thinking unless it is his way of thinking, too.   Deciding there must be either peace or war is disastrous. There is nothing wrong with muddling along. Maybe there will come a time when more is possible. If not, the parties still will have survived, the games will be played. And muddling along also forces players and owners to muddle together. In time, perhaps they will come to understand, trust, respect and get respect back, to work together and produce through the back door what neither side would tolerate through the front -- some form of cooperation.   It was time to fight; now, it's time to play. Time for Gary Bettman's and Bob Goodenow's job to be defined differently so that success for each is measured in a season played, in the 1995 Stanley Cup being won. So that neither side forces the other to carry the can of a bad deal, days and years later, having to wince even harder at that. Great performers in any activity have a sense of timing. Now, they realize, is when the game is being won and lost, now is when the big hit must be made, the goal must be scored. Now is when the deal must be done. Sports Peace in Our Time?
