For the first time, the Council will also have at least one openly gay member, Thomas K. Duane from Greenwich Village. It could have a second if Antonio Pagan's slim lead holds up in lower Manhattan.     INCUMBENTS    For all this change, though, the Council's political cast is not likely to change much. Seventeen of the 19 incumbents seeking renomination were victorious, while the two others - Miiriam Friedlander, in lower Manhattan and Noach Dear in Borough Park Brooklyn - trailed by tiny margins and were sure to challenge the outcomes. In addition, 12 incumbents did not face primaries.      THE ORGANIZATION AND THE INSURGENTS    While the Council leadership suceeded in protecting incumbents, its influence in open districts is still unclear. Six of its 13 newcomers won clear victories - compared to 3 supported by the insurgent Majority Coalition - but 5 others are locked in races that remain too close to call.      TURNOUT    Turnout was the lowest in memory, less than 20 percent citwyide. Interest was greatest in several hard-fought races in Manhattan and one each in Brooklyn and Queens, while nine others failed to attract 15 percent of the eligible Democrats.      CLOSE RACES    Low turnout and some large fields of candidates left an unusual number of races too close to call: In unofficial tallies, 170 votes or fewer separted the leaders in 9 of the 38 Democratic primaries. In addition, in 5 races, the winner had fewer than 2,000 votes. And in only half the races did a candidate get at least 50 percent of the vote.

Her focused, intelligent performance as the heroine of this Greek myth-turned-psychodrama was at times quite thrilling and even beautiful -- and this in a role that goes out of its way to resist beauty in favor of trauma, and parades its own difficulties before the ear like a showoff neurotic.    It was certainly not the singing of someone with a ravaged, spent and wasted voice, which many attributed to Ms. Behrens two years ago when she sang Elektra in the debut of this production by Otto Schenk. She is an uneven and unpredictable singer, technically flawed but ready to take risks. And when those risks pay off, as they did on Thursday, there are few other dramatic sopranos today who can match her accomplishments.

The codices were discovered by accident in 1965 in the National Library of Spain, where they had languished in obscurity for over a century due to a cataloguing error.

He promptly replaned and headed for Madrid, where he negotiated with the Spanish Government for permission to publish. There was some reluctance on the part of Spanish authorities to agree to what amounted to publicizing a rather monumental goof before the world, but eventually they relented and are now wholeheartedly behind the project. The translation plus the legal and technical problems involved in mounting an international publishing effort took six years.

So it may seem exceedingly bold for the Central Brooklyn Jazz Consortium to schedule a blowout Latin jazz concert for tomorrow night, and to call it Sabado de Gloria. But there is an idea at work here: the concert pays tribute to the departed heroes of Latin jazz, with an explicit dedication to the King of Mambo, Tito Puente. (You can only assume that the percussionists Ray Barretto and Don Alias, who both died this year, will be honored as well.) Among the all-stars assembled for this purpose are Dave Valentin, one of the leading flutists in Latin music","excerpt":"Hilton Ruiz, a versatile and articulate pianist; Giovanni Hidalgo, above, a well-traveled percussionist; and Papo Vazquez, an audacious trombonist. The Cuban drummer Dafnis Prieto and the Puerto Rican bassist John Benitez will represent a newer generation of Latin players; the trumpeter Randy Brecker and the alto saxophonist Sherman Irby will represent the so-called jazz mainstream. In terms of repertory, the concert will draw from both sides, with an emphasis on musician-bandleaders like Rafael Hernández Marín, Charlie Palmieri and Freddie Hubbard. The only voices unheard, it seems, will be those Catholics who maintain that Holy Saturday should be the quietest day of the year.
