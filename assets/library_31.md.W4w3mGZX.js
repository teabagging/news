That is not a sure-fire formula for concert or recital success, but he has attracted an audience that loves him all the more for his history of ignoring sure-fire formulas.   That audience came out in force for Mr. Serkin's recital at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday evening. It was treated to a typically quirky program of Brahms, Beethoven and Chopin, interleaved with shorter pieces by Peter Lieberson, Oliver Knussen and Alexander Goehr.

Departed peacefully in her sleep December 29, 1999. Beloved wife of the late Bill Schneider; loving sister of Eugene and the late Arnold and David; a devoted mother of Patty and Burton; and grandmother of their children. With her husband Bill, she was the founder and manager for many years of Treehaven School in Tucson, AZ; the Schneider Art Museum of Southern Oregon State University and the Ashland Community Educational Services Volunteer Organization for the Ashland Oregon School District. Also the Schneiders were major contributors to many charitable, religious, cultural and educational funds including a Scholarship Fund for the Graduate School of Social Work and Research at Bryn Mawr College; Rogue Valley Symphony; Oregon Shakespeare Festival; Rogue Valley Opera; Temple Emek Shalom; Special Facility for Ashland Community Hospital and endowments for Providence and Rogue Valley Memorial Hospitals; a general charitable fund with emphasis on the underprivileged in Jackson County, Oregon; and many others. During her life, Florence taught at the University of Arizona-Tucson, Santa Monica College, Rogue Valley Jewish Community Religious School, Southern Oregon State University, and conducted ''Perspectives For Women'', a monthly series of breakfasts for professional women at the Medford Chamber of Commerce. She started her working career as Director of Fact Finding of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs. The documentary film ''The Women of Summer'' was prompted by her doctoral research work at Bryn Mawr. All who knew Florence appreciated her intense interest in participating in the life of the communities she lived in, with a primary interest in helping the underprivileged. She was an energetic, dynamic, ethical, loving and sympathetic person who throughout her life devoted herself to many worthy causes.

The lavishly produced art books of the past promised a decorous private museum -- here a picture, there another -- behind the open doors of their opulent covers. Over the centuries, art has danced with many partners, including the natural sciences, movies and dance itself -- though not so often in art books. These days, the most interesting and eye-catching art books invite us to look at what has often been overlooked -- the omnivorous multiplicity of the aesthetic enterprise. Wandering at ease among this year's visual landscapes, I kept coming across new permutations of Mallarm&#233;'s encyclopedic fantasy. The dream of capturing the world in all its visual complexity seemed the immodest ambition of some particularly alluring pages.      THE EYE OF THE LYNX: Galileo, His Friends, and the Beginnings of Modern Natural History. By David Freedberg. (University of Chicago, $50.) Acting on a tip from the disgraced spy and eminent art critic Anthony Blunt, David Freedberg, an art historian at Columbia University, looked into a cupboard at Windsor Castle and entered another world. He found sheet after sheet of dazzlingly detailed watercolor drawings of . . . one is tempted to say everything: a flamingo's tongue; the paws, ears and quill of a porcupine; frogs arrested in American amber; and ''the most spectacular representation of a broccoli in the history of art.'' Freedberg dramatically unfolds the mysterious origins of his 17th-century ''paper museum,'' fingering a sophisticated international ring of savants known as the ''Linceans.'' The ''irascible and headstrong mathematician from Tuscany,'' Galileo, was the best-known member of the group, devoted to ''an extraordinary attempt to document all of nature -- both of the Old World and the New -- in visual form.'' In this enthralling book, which is illustrated by many of the drawings that inspired it, Freedberg, the author of ''The Power of Images,'' uncovers a buried chapter in the history of science and art, when the two were closely allied, and Galileo's friends turned his telescope around to view the microscopic intricacies of nature with the ''eye of the lynx.''

College officials expressed doubt about its contribution to the campus after the fraternity ran up about $15,000 in debt for heating and utility services and $85,000 in charges for structural maintenance.    Even if the fraternity, known officially as the Phi Chapter, could raise the money, it would not be reinstated because it had already missed the Dec. 10 deadline, said Swarthmore's president, David W. Fraser.    The college changed the locks to the fraternity's house during winter break last month, essentially disbanding the chapter. College policy prohibits fraternities from operating without a house. Two Fraternities Left    \\"As far as I'm concerned, the deadline has passed, and the fraternity is no longer a recognized college organization,\\" Mr. Fraser said.    He added that the fraternity \\"probably would have been given more time to work out its financial problems\\" had it contributed more positively to life on campus.    Phi Sig's demise leaves the college with only two fraternities. Nevertheless some of Phi Sig's 13 members have continued to meet, although a few concede that the fraternity is essentially dispersed. The entire fraternity met last week, but reached no decision on whether to continue functioning.    The fraternity would have to petition the college for reconsideration as a new organization, Mr. Fraser said.    Thomas E. Recker, executive vice president of the fraternity's national organization in Indianapolis, said the national group had taken no formal action to close the chapter. \\"We want to keep the group alive,\\" Mr. Recker said. The chapter, founded in 1906, is one of the fraternity's oldest.    Tedd Goundie, assistant dean, said the college told the chapter in May that it owed about $15,000 on bills incurred in the last six to 10 years. In addition to the debt, the fraternity would also have to pay about $85,000 to repair decades of structural damages to its house on campus, Mr. Goundie said.     The college became aware of the debt only after recently hired administrators reviewed old financial records, Mr. Goundie said.    Bernard M. Berman, the lawyer for the national organization and a 1962 alumnus of Swarthmore's Phi Sig., said the chapter's Alumni Association has paid the bills in the past. However, payment on some portions of the bills stopped yeaars ago, because of disputes over the amounts charged for heating, he said.    \\"As individuals, it's not our fault,\\" said one Phi Sig member, Jason Morton. \\"As an organization, we do owe the money.\\"    Mr. Morton, a senior English major from Phoenix, MD, conceded that \\"they've given us numerous second changes, and we didn't make good on any of them.\\"    John Curran, the chapter's president, said Phi Sig had not known of the accumulating debt until the college told it last year.     \\"No one notified us, so we assumed everything was all right,\\" said Mr. Curran, a senior economics major from Wyckoff, N.J. \\"It was partly our fault, since we should have been closer in touch with the alumni and the school.\\"    But while the debt might be legitimate, Mr. Curran said, the school had been uncooperative in helping Phi Sig meet its obligations. He said the fraternity had asked for a breakdown of how the debt was incurred but had received no information until well after the deadline.   College officials acknowledged that they failed to see Phi Sig as serving any positive role, except as an organizer of parties.    Mr. Curran said, however, that the fraternity sponsored a canned food drive last semester and was planning other ventures this semester, before learning of its closing.

At 26, this Philadelphia-based troupe is a venerable institution in dance terms. But the company has not lost its youthful verve or the freshness of its strong technical grounding.

But in George Faison's classic \\"Suite Otis,\\" Joan Myers Brown, the founder and director of Philadanco, made a bow to tradition that drew loud cries of \\"Work it, baby!\\" from the infectiously exuberant audience.         The evening opened with Milton Myer's \\"Variation No. 1.\\" Performed to coolly  pulsating drum music by William Catanzaro, the elegant quartet is both ritual and subtly plotted choreography.

Gradually, those verticals crook, curl, cling and push untidily through the ordered environment.

The elements of its jazz-dance style -- high, split-legged jumps, cross-stage runs and spinning turns -- have been seen on Broadway and on the concert dance stage for years. But there was a magnificent weight and evocative power to \\"Morning Songs\\" and to its surging score by Charles Mingus that are rare in modern and jazz dance today.

Prepared jointly over the last four years by the museum and the Henry Francis du Pont Winterthur (Dela.) Museum, the show presents the most concentrated and comprehensive documentation of the Pennsylvania Germans' contribution to the arts ever assembled, and marks the 300th anniversary of the founding of Philadelphia, as well as Pennsylvania, and Germantown, the first settlement of German-speaking people on this continent.   And what a happy occasion it proves to be, with virtually everything, including several portraits of plump, smiling men and women, exuding the spirit of well-being characteristic of these people. The sense of plenty pervading the displays will come as no surprise to folk-art aficionadoes, for this quality of sufficiency in furnishings - the robust chairs, the sturdy tables and outsized cupboards - is one of the style's major attractions. It helps explain why Pennsylvania German designs command the highest prices and the most loyal following among today's collectors, surpassing in popularity and, more often than not, in price, all other ethnic areas of American folk art. A BOUNTY FROM PENNSYLVANIA","excerpt":"PHILADELPHIA"},{"year":"1982","title":"One of the most likeable of all recorded Americans was William Rush, often called the father of American sculpture, who was born in Philadelphia in 1756 and died there in 1833. Rush had none of the outward pretensions of high art. He never went to art school. An apprentice he was, but never a student. He never socialized, never traveled, never sought exalted patronage. Nor did it enter his head to go to Europe. His work was primarily in wood, which many people regarded as a tradesman's material. Bronze and marble were the mark of the mainline sculptor in the 19th century, and to most of those for whom Hiram Powers and Horatio Greenough were major American sculptors, Rush was a mere journeyman.   This attitude persisted, though Rush's great fellow-Philadelphian Thomas Eakins in 1877 chose Rush as the subject of one of the most poetical of all his paintings - ''William Rush Carving His Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River.'' But as late as the 1920's Rush was seen by art historians as the victim of ''a poor conglomerate artistic education, picked up in this remote country from prints, casts, or the very few examples of European sculpture that he chanced to see.''
