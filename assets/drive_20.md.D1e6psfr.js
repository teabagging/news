notes widening of band was designed to permit larger differences in short‐term interest rates and other elements of credit policy between countries than was possible with former much narrower bands, so that countries could make greater use of monetary policy for domestic purposes;

1st, is that wife who works outside home incurs expenses of working‐extra clothing and its maintenance, transportation and lunches away from home; 2d, is that stay‐at‐home housewife does family's cooking, washing and cleaning, thus performing services that have real monetary value but that are not taxed because she is not paid in money;
