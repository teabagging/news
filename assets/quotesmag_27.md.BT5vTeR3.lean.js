Of New York City and Palm Beach, Florida, on March 29, 1998. Son of the late Benjamin and Hinda Finkle. Brother of Ann Odel and Edith Horwitt and the late Celia David and Mary Pollen. He is survived by his cherished wife Maria, loving daughter Joan Swirsky and son Jonathan Finkle, grandchildren, Seth, David and Karen, and great-grandson, Julian and brother-in-law Walter Weil. He was predeceased by his son Zachary Dan. In his lifetime, the vast scope of his charities addressed the needs of Jewish people throughout the world. He provided inspiration, leadership, and substance to every cause to which he devoted his formidable energy, and embodied vitality, optimism, and joie-de-Vivre in his everyday life. Funeral services were held on Monday, Fifth Avenue Synagogue. Shiva will be observed at 930 Fifth Avenue until Sunday A.M., April 4th. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in his memory to the Maria and Joel Finkle Center for counseling at Bar Ilan University, 91 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10003.    FINKLE-Joel. Bar-Ilan University in Israel and its American Friends mourn with great sorrow the passing of one of the University's most generous and cherished benefactors, Joel Finkle. An exemplary businessman of great principle, he commanded the respect and admiration of the Jewish and secular worlds for his keen business sense, unshakable personal integrity and abiding philanthropic spirit. Together with his beloved wife, Maria, Joel wrote an unforgettable chapter in the University's annals. The first chairman of Bar-Ilan American Friends, he and Maria became associated with the University as Trustees at the time of Rabbi Rackman's presidency. Since then, the Finkles shared every undertaking that was Rabbi Rackman's, traveling to Israel each year for the last twenty. Generous and devoted University leaders, the Finkle's created several scholarship funds at Bar-Ilan including one to benefit female students of the University's Law School, for which Maria received Bar-Ilan's Woman of Valor Award and an honorary doctorate. Together they established the University's Student Counseling Center for which Joel donated the building in the name of Maria and her adored friend Ruth Rackman. But beyond their philanthropic spirit and what made them so beloved to Bar-Ilan, was that all their benefactions were given selflessly, unostentatiously and with profound love for Israel and the Jewish people. To Maria and the entire Finkle family, we extend heartfelt condolences and pray for Maria's lasting good health and continued leadership in our cause. Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, Chancellor Bar-Ilan University Prof. Moshe Kaveh, President Bar-Ilan University Selik Wengrowsky, Chairman Bar-Ilan Global Board of Trustees Melvin Stein, President American Friends of Bar-Ilan President, American Friends Brig.

His generosity which benefitted so many deserving causes was all the more meaningful because of the humble and unassuming way in which he offered support. He was joined in all his noble endeavors by his partner in life and philanthropy, his beloved Maria, who serves with distinction on our Board of Directors. Together they established major scholarship endowments in memory of both Zachary Dan Finkle and Walter Weil, and they dedicated the Maria and Joe Finkle Garden in the Children's Park representing a special scholarship fund in memory of Boys Town's alumni and family who made the supreme sacrifice defending the State of Israel.

Kaufman and Marc Connelly, may not be as smooth or as subtle as the original, but as the adapters have had the good sense to keep close to the parent effort and the direction was entrusted to King Vidor, it makes a breezy entertainment. Edwin Justus Mayer, in selecting the dialogue for the film, which is entitled \\"Not So Dumb,\\" has not been ashamed to use lines from the play whereever possible. He is to be congratulated on his work, for there are so many film writers who think that they are only doing good work when they emasculate the novel or the play to be brought to the screen.Marion Davies, who has done so well in the comedies directed by Mr. Vidor, gives another pleasing portrayal as the chatterbox. Dulcy, the young woman who flounders in her figures of speech, garbles platitudes, broadcasts secrets and keeps Gordon Smith, her husband in the play and her fiancé in the film, on edge, wondering what this attractive blonde bungler is going to say next.Dulcy at one time announces that it's the \\"early worm that gets the bird.\\"When admonishing her brother Bill that he must be more tolerant, she vouchsafes:\\"Yon know that there's so much good in the best of us—and so much bad in the worst of us—well, it ill behooves the best of us\\"—She, like a certain English woman of the upper ten, deserves to be known as \\"The Babbling Brook.\\" Miss Davies handles Dulcy's weaknesses in an adroit fashion, and if the part does not seem as effective as it was on the stage, it should be remembered that for the screen it had to be acted under lights and without the continuity of the play. Farce comedy though this may be, it is the sort of talking picture that ought to be encouraged, and when one harks back to some of the efforts of studio workers to conjure up laughter, this is a masterpiece. And most of the thanks are still due to the authors.Bill, who is well aware of his sister Dulcy's shortcomings and who tries to cure her of calling him \\"Willie,\\" after studying the temperaments of Dulcy's week-end guests declares that it is probably going to be the first week-end party on record that ended on a Friday night. And one is prone to think that Bill is not far wrong, for besides having a man who is on a suspended sentence as a butler, Dulcy's party includes the irascible C. Roger Forbes, to whom Dulcy's prattling is anathema","excerpt":"Mrs. Forbes, a silly woman; Miss Forbes, a silly girl; Schuyler Van Dyck, presumed for a time to be a mad golfer, but who eventually proves to be no golfer; Vincent Leach, a scenario writer who fancies his own work to the extent that he is generous enough to go through the whole action of his pictures before they are filmed, and then Dulcy's fiancé, Gordon Smith, and her brother, Bill. It is a gathering arranged by Dulcy to help Gordon in his business discussion with Forbes, a power in the artificial jewelry world.Mr. Forbes has his trials listening to Dulcy, and once he seeks refuge in a game of billiards with none other than that lunatic at large, Schuyler Van Dyck, whose hallucination is that he has millions and is interested to some small extent in several industrial lines, including jewelry, motion pictures and railways.This Van Dyck is impersonated by Donald Ogden Stewart, who succeeds in creating plenty of fun. Van Dyck seems to favor Dulcy's type of mentality by looking upon her bromidic utterances as something quite original, so when she hazards that after all there's no place like home he agrees, adding that he had never heard it put quite that way before.Mr. Stewart, as the golfing fanatic, essays shots through the bathroom window and then uses a mashie or a niblick on Dulcy's lawn. Elliott Nugent, who acted in the original play, here figures as Gordon. William Holden makes a real human being out of Forbes. Mr. Holden's work is splendid. He is the personification of restrained fury most of the time.Franklin Pangborn lends amusement to his rôle of Vincent Leach.\\"All the King's Men.\\"SECOND WIFE,\\" an audible pictorial adaptation of Fulton Oursler's play \\"All the King's Men,\\" is a film with enough common sense and good acting to make up for sagging lines and stereotyped action. It is a dissertation on a young woman marrying a widower whose first wife had left him with a little boy. The argument is not profound and the reason for friction is strained, but Lila Lee and Conrad Nagel do so well with the rôles allotted to them that even when the incidents are somewhat illogical the characters still evoke enough sympathy to hold one's attention.In an early scene Florence Wendell calls upon her fiancé, Walter Fairchild, accompanied by Gilbert Gaylord. Mr. Gaylord is in love with Florence himself and soon he goes to great pains to point out the chances of her unhappiness in marrying Fairchild, who, of course, has not yet put in an appearance. His argument is helped along by a convenient painting of Fairchild's late wife. Mr. Gaylord, with a villain's oiliness, then tells Florence how tired she will get of having the furniture that had been arranged and bought by her predecessor.Fairchild sets at rest this argument later at dinner when he consents to move into another house and buy new furniture. Eventually Florence, in spite of Mr. Gaylord's warning, becomes Mrs. Fairchild and Gaylord goes to South America. In course of time Junior, Mr. Fairchild's likable young son by his first marriage, is sent to school in Switzerland and for a while it is to be presumed Florence is quite happy as Fairchild's second wife.Just when Florence is about to become a mother Fairchild receives a cable message setting forth that Junior is seriously ill. He insists that he must go to Europe to see the boy, and Florence then accuses her husband of thinking more of Junior than he does of her.Gaylord pops up again and tries to prevail upon Florence to leave Fairchild, seek a divorce and become his wife. By that time Florence's baby has been born and she and her husband are hardly on speaking terms. The young woman hearkens to Gaylord's proposal and is about to leave her husband, when she mentions the fact that she must, of course, take her child with her. Mr. Gaylord may be quite sincere about his affection for Florence, but he is emphatically opposed to having the offspring by a former husband in his home, and this leads to a happy ending for the Fairchilds and perhaps to a temporary period of disappointment for Gaylord.The son, Junior, is played by Master Freddie Burke Frederick, a charming youngster who has a gentle voice and remarkable ability for thinking about what he is saying. His scenes with Mary Carr, who impersonates a gentle and sympathetic housekeeper known as Mrs. Rhoades, are captivating.Hugh Huntley lends a certain polish to the róle of Gaylord in spite of the fact that his actions are not always logical.A Gallant Card Sharp.A NICELY produced talking picture is the latest screen version of \\"Cameo Kirby,\\" the romantic play of New Orleans in 1850 by Booth Tarkington and Harry Leon Wilson. In this production J. Harold Murray as Cameo Kirby has an opportunity to sing four or five songs and they are recorded most effectively.It is a picture with a flourish of a Mardi Gras in New Orleans and a number of scenes aboard a river steamboat. The Southern accent is not stressed, but when it is heard it possesses a real charm. Norma Terris, who sang as Magnolia in Florenz Ziegfeld's stage production of \\"Showboat,\\" plays the part of the Southern belle, Adele Randall, but for some strange reason she is not called upon to sing in this film. She gives a pleasing performance, one well becoming the róle she acts.Robert Edeson is seen as Colonel Randall, Adele's father, who unfortunately comes to a tragic end due to losing in a card game with a rapscallion named Jack Moreau and the sometimes honest but always gallant Cameo Kirby. Mr. Kirby in this instance had right on his side, for he goes into the gambling seance uninvited by Moreau, just to rescue Randall from a rascal's clutches.Irving Cummings, the director, is responsible for many charming scenes in this production, the story of which is not highly dramatic. It would, however, be difficult to say where more could have been done with the play material, for it is the type of subject that does not stand much tampering.Mr. Murray's pleasing songs, together with occasional choruses, enhance this Southern adventure. Mr. Murray also acts his part with a rational conception of the character. Robert Edeson deserves praise for his admirable portrayal of Colonel Randall and Douglas Gilmore is a glib and persistent Jack Moreau. The languid Stepin Fetchit seems so tired in this film that he makes slow-motion photography seem fast. He drawls a song in a way that gives one a clear conception of the character's dislike for toil.An Interesting Theme.SINCE the theme of \\"Caught in Berlin's Underworld,\\" the German silent film at the Cameo last week, is so interesting and the film work so poor, one may hope that a talking film may be produced of the same idea, which is one concerned with the hard life of the children of criminals and their merciless treatment by society.The narrative in this production is not at all badly worked out, except that there are some rather startling coincidences. It tells of a convict's son, whose mother, to safeguard him from the ostracism and harsh treatment by people, takes the boy to a prison warden interested in the theory of environment as it applies to the offsprings of felons. The boy is sent to a well-to-do family under a new name. When he is old enough he goes to a university, where one night a nobleman's son, also a student, challenges the convict's son, asking him who are his parents and where he was born. It seems here that the young man's secret has been permitted to leak out for the sake of the story. But be that as it may, there is a duel, and the convict's son is the victor.There are other craftily contrived situations in which the nobleman and the felon's son come together. The hero's mother becomes the victim of an underworld drunkard, who tries to find out the name her son has taken so that he can blackmail either the young man or the people who have adopted him. Another angle to the film is that the convict's son falls in love with the daughter of the murdered warden of the prison —the man who was responsible for his being adopted by gentle folk—little knowing that his father's last crime was the slaying of that prison official.Whatever rough corners this narrative may possess, they could be planed down. The film itself, while the acting is quite fair, darts from one scene to another and glosses over just the very years that ought to have been pictured at length.
