All combine to form a choreographic style that is at times nuttily peculiar but always great fun and exciting for the way it glories in gutsy physicality, and for its colorful music and vivid bits of dramatic detail. Although the program did not include the kind of ardent piece about the founding of Taiwan that is usually a feature of Taiwanese modern-dance performances in New York City, Mr. Yu did take on the similarly solemn theme of modern life and its trials and tribulations, as program notes put it, in \\"To Seek and You Will Find.\\" Blessedly, however, this was a spirited jazz-dance piece, set to rock and jazz music, that made modern life look eminently enjoyable.

Mishima's lyricism is in service to an extraordinarily perverse tale: a young adolescent, Noboru, spies on his mother and her lover, a sailor, through a hole in their bedroom wall. He shares his revelations with a youthful gang whose members ruthlessly practice honing heroic impulses by smashing a kitten against a board, then dissecting it and immersing themselves in the \\"warmth of the scattered viscera.\\" It is easy enough to imagine what happens when they turn to the sailor who has abdicated his heroic seafaring role for a bourgeois life.

A journalist with a Brandeis degree and 14 years at The New York Times behind him, Mr. Gupte was in India visiting his ailing father in Bombay when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated. Foreign journalists had been barred from the Punjab, where terrorism had led to a military assault on the Golden Temple, the Sikhs' principal shrine, and army rule. Mr. Gupte, an Indian national, was asked to cover the most severe test since independence in 1947 of Indian unity and democracy.   The book is mostly about headline events - the assassination of Mrs. Gandhi by Sikh bodyguards","excerpt":"her 40-year-old-son, Rajiv, succeeding her as Prime Minister; the orchestrated and spontaneous killing of Sikhs in northern India; the triumph of terrorism over moderation in the Punjab; the rising tide of regional and agrarian politics; the decay of India's cities ands environment; Rajiv Gandhi's sweeping electoral victory in last December's parliamentary election.

INSIDE THE VICTORIAN HOME: A Portrait of Domestic Life in Victorian England, by Judith Flanders. (Norton, $34.95.) A nimble piece of social history that draws from archives, novels, advice manuals and newspapers to show home becoming what it still ideally is: a refuge from the Industrial Revolution and an expression of morality sequestered from the harsh world.    THE CREATION OF THE MEDIA: Political Origins of Modern Communications, by Paul Starr. (Basic Books, $27.50.) A scholar's cautious, detailed, convincing account of the deliberate framing of information carriers, from cheap postage to privatized electronics (telegraph, telephone, radio) to saturation by movies, networks and magazines.    THE HOLLYWOOD DODO, by Geoff Nicholson. (Simon & Schuster, $23.) The author's highly professional 14th novel concerns an aspiring director who wants to make a dodo movie; a 17th-century scientist who tries to save the bird back in the 1660's; and well-handled clichés of popular culture (success and failure in movies are equally corrupting).    WILCO: Learning How to Die, by Greg Kot. (Broadway, paper, $14.) A brisk, entertaining biography of Jeff Tweedy, the uncommonly thoughtful and inquisitive (or paranoid?) leader of the band Wilco, reporting his struggles with music, the music business, his bandmates, his family and himself.    BEASTS OF EDEN: Walking Whales, Dawn Horses, and Other Enigmas of Mammal Evolution, by David Rains Wallace. (University of California, $24.95.) A lively and deeply researched history of the ''bone hunters'' who have scoured the earth since the 18th century to elucidate mammal development in geological time and work out theories to account for it, from catastrophism through transmutation to Darwinian evolution.    SO YOU WANNA BE A ROCK & ROLL STAR: How I Machine-Gunned a Roomful of Record Executives and Other True Tales From a Drummer's Life, by Jacob Slichter. (Broadway, $21.95.) An unusual rock memoir by the drummer of the Minneapolis power-pop band Semisonic, unusual because of Slichter's understanding of business principles and his undampened enthusiasm for his craft.    DYLAN'S VISIONs OF SIN, by Christopher Ricks. (Ecco, $26.95.) Ricks, the notable critic who has been elected the next professor of poetry at Oxford University, brings close, intense, learned scrutiny of the text -- the basic tool of the New Criticism -- to the songs of Bob Dylan, unveiling allusions, teasing out recalcitrant intentions and otherwise treating Dylan as he has treated Housman and Tennyson.

The university recently provided documents to The Times demonstrating the error. Corrections"},{"year":"2004","title":"AND NOW YOU CAN GO, by Vendela Vida. (Anchor, $12.95.) The opening sequence of this offbeat and absorbing first novel -- a young woman escapes after being accosted at gunpoint by a suicidal man determined not to die alone -- propels Vida's heroine on a manic, almost quixotic search for sanctuary and self-discovery. Vida, a co-founder and editor of the literary journal The Believer, ''writes with a sense of urgency, and with leapfrogging good humor,'' Stephanie Zacharek wrote in the Book Review in 2003.    HAWTHORNE: A Life, by Brenda Wineapple. (Random House, $16.95.) Wineapple, the author of biographies of Janet Flanner and of Gertrude and Leo Stein, combines meticulous research and able storytelling to distill Nathaniel Hawthorne's essence: his contradictions, his fatalism and his artistic processes. The result, Brooke Allen wrote here last year, is ''a vivid account of a highly interesting life.''    STRAPLESS: John Singer Sargent and the Fall of Madame X, by Deborah Davis. (Tarcher/Penguin, $14.95.) The scandal ignited by the fallen shoulder strap in Sargent's legendary portrait of the Parisian beauty Virginie Gautreau provides the inspiration for Davis's own literary portrait of Sargent, Gautreau and late-19th-century Paris. Last year our reviewer, Miranda Seymour, called this a ''lively'' first book with ''intriguing details.''    THE KING IN THE TREE: Three Novellas, by Steven Millhauser. (Vintage Contemporaries, $12.) This collection by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ''Martin Dressler'' (1996) celebrates the unfettered imagination and the ferocious desires it can unleash. The title novella retells the tragic love story of Tristan and Ysolt -- retrofitted with secret passageways in castle walls and an automaton replica of the queen -- through the point of view of a counselor to the king of Cornwall. Millhauser has ''used his lush prose and archetypal motifs to trace the outer arcs of passion, places where eros and violence meet,'' Laura Miller wrote in these pages in 2003.    TWENTIETH-CENTURY ATTITUDES: Literary Powers in Uncertain Times, by Brooke Allen. (Ivan R. Dee, $14.95.) The 18 essays in this tart collection dissect the lives and work of some of the last century's most eccentric literary talents, including Edith Wharton, Evelyn Waugh, Carson McCullers and James Baldwin. Allen's appraisals of their work ''are both shrewd and generous","excerpt":"her accounts of their lives . . . are perhaps even better,'' Evelyn Toynton wrote here in 2003. In CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE NOVEL: Connected Essays (Harvard University, $16.95), the English novelist David Lodge explores the subtle creative interplay between authors' lives and their fiction. Last year our reviewer, Sherie Posesorski, described Lodge as ''a well-tempered critic, more a supple reconciler of theories than polemicist.''    SEX, DRUGS, AND COCOA PUFFS: A Low Culture Manifesto, by Chuck Klosterman. (Scribner, $13.) Whether deconstructing America's obsession with reality television, exploring the symbolic importance of the Celtics-Lakers rivalry or assessing Billy Joel's artistic legacy, Klosterman has an eerily exhaustive knowledge of popular culture at his disposal. He ''is insidious,'' Virginia Heffernan wrote in the Book Review in 2003. ''Arguing motley points about music and celebrity,'' the author ''huffs and puffs so hard that periodically I just gave in.''    TRIANGLE: The Fire That Changed America, by David Von Drehle. (Grove, $14.) Von Drehle, a reporter at The Washington Post, reconstructs one of the worst disasters in New York's history -- the Triangle shirtwaist company fire of 1911 -- and the turbulent time in which it took place. Both a precise social history and an elegy to the 146 garment workers killed, ''Triangle'' is ''sure to become the definitive account of the fire,'' Kevin Baker said here last year.    THE BOBBY GOLD STORIES, by Anthony Bourdain. (Bloomsbury, $9.95.) In ''Kitchen Confidential'' (2000) Bourdain laid open the sordid secrets of the restaurant business; in this fast, pitch-perfect novel, he introduces Bobby Gold, an ex-convict with an existential soul stuck inside a hulking physique, who works security in the New York club and restaurant scene. Last year our reviewer, King Kaufman, called this ''a Manhattan tale with Elmore Leonard flavor.''

But the upper range of her voice proved to be problematic. She possesses a dazzling virtuoso technique, and can also float a shimmering pianissimo, but her high notes were often harsh and inaccurate. While the Mad Scene was intriguingly meditative and rhapsodic, its peak E flats failed to materialize. Some of these difficulties were probably due to nervousness: Ms. Rowland will undoubtedly have greater success in the future.   Also new to the \\"Lucia\\" cast were Haijing Fu as Enrico and John Fowler as Edgardo. Mr. Fu has a strong and eloquent baritone, rich in the darker colors; his portrayal of Enrico might have been a little stiff, but he was a substantial vocal presence.

Staying on the line produces the same music and intermittent recordings as on the Tax Hotline. 1:27 P.M.: A live voice that by now is almost disconcerting breaks in and introduces itself as Scott Patterson, asking in a polite tone how  can he help. When a filing extension application is requested, the voice simply  asks for a name and address and says the application will be sent out right away, along with a tax information booklet. The voice also says it can answer various other questions if necessary. 1:30 P.M.: Mission accomplished.

She is survived by her husband of 47 years, Alan Lind Bain, her daughter, Heather Lind Bain, her son, Ian Alexander Lind Bain, her daughter-in-law, Jill Calabrese Bain, and twin grandchildren, Andrew Michael Lind Bain and Emma Angelina Lind Bain","excerpt":"her brother Dr. Byron Strongman Miller and her sister, Gail Hart Miller. Linda was born at Doctor's Hospital, New York City, on July 30, 1937 to Florence Hart Miller and Byron Strongman Miller. Her childhood was spent in family homes in Miami, FL, Honesdale, PA, and the Sherry Netherland in the New York City. In 1954, she relocated to Greenwich, CT where she attended the Greenwich Academy and later St. Margaret's School, Waterbury, CT. During her senior year she met her future husband, Alan L. Bain, who was attending The Gunnery School, in nearby Washington, CT as an English speaking Union Exchange Student. After graduating from Wheaton College, Norton, MA in 1957, with a B.A. in English, and, following her June marriage that year, Linda took up residence in Cambridge, England where her husband Alan was completing his law studies at St. Catharine's College, Cambridge University and in London. She returned to New York in 1961, becoming active in the Junior League of the city of New York, of which she became president in 1977. Linda's intellect, organizational skills, practical good sense and keen wit were much in demand. She served on the Board and Executive Committee of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies and was a Board Member of Jobs for Youth, The New York Urban League, and the Women's Economic Roundtable. She also served as Vice President of the National Association of Women Business Owners (Philadelphia Chapter) and on the NYC Mayor's Task Force on Awards and Recognition. Her wide range of contacts and her keen interest in art made her an ideal founding member of the American Associates of the Royal Academy Trust. In recognition of the value of her time at Wheaton College, Linda remained a loyal alumna until the time of her death serving as a Vice President of the Alumnae Association, as well as participating on a variety of its committees. For over 20 years, her Alumnae Board participation lead to annual reunions of many with whom she had served, the last one taking place in Woodstock, VT in September of this year. Commitment to volunteerism and to serving others was a cornerstone ofher life. She practiced as a psychotherapist/counselor for private clients, often on a pro-bono basis for those who did not have the means to pay. Training for this role, she had graduated from The New York Open Center Integrative Therapies Program in 1991 and The Center for Intentional Living Program in 1992. Linda also had an active life in business. Following a graduation in 1967 from the New York School of Interior Design her career as an Interior Designer started with the firm of Robert E, Helbig, A.S.I.D., successors to Cleveland and Randall, a firm with which her family had dealt for many years. In 1970, she co-founded, with her husband, World-Wide Business Centres, Inc., a pioneer of the serviced office industry locally and internationally. Her design skills were put to use in the expansion of that company's operations to Philadelphia, PA and North Miami Beach, FL. Her interpersonal and diplomatic skills were essential to the successful development and maintenance of the company's European network. At the time of her death, she was serving as corporate secretary and as invaluable counselor to her husband. At Wheaton College she took as much studio art as was then permitted under Ruth Dryden Deshaies. A particular favorite subject was print making. After graduation and until 2001, when she began studying water painting at the 92nd Street Y under Elizabeth Terhune, art had continued to play an important role in her life. Together with her daughter Heather, she participated in the Jane Cooper Bland Mother/Daughter Art Program at MOMA and as a volunteer with the Junior League, she provided an arts and craft program for terminally ill children in New York City hospitals. In 2001, Linda resumed her artistic endeavors at the 92nd Street Y when she began studying water color painting. While a student at the 92nd Street Y, her watercolors were accepted for juried shows at the 92nd Street Y, the East End Arts Council in Riverhead, NY, and at The University Club in NYC. Linda was a member of the Cosmopolitan Club for which she served on the Membership and Members Dinners committees. Linda loved life, people, music, and travel. She was an accomplished photographer and poet. She was also an exceedingly generous patron of a wide variety of projects, causes and institutions, not the least of which was The American Scottish Foundation Inc. on the Board of which she served for a number of years, and of which her husband was president. The Miller family were MacFarlane's by heritage. For that organization she edited its newsletter, ''Calling All Scots'', reviewing books and films. She also maintained a detailed photographic record of the Foundation's activities over the past 15 years. Linda will be sorely missed by the many whose lives she touched.

It always helps to know people with power and it's likely that without that connection, someone else would have Ms. Trotti's job today. But environmental officials say she is qualified and is doing a good job in the department's Westchester office. So the hiring might not be worth examining except for two factors. First, the timing: the connection to watershed negotiations. Second, the reaction: when news of Ms. Trotti's job first became public, top officials in City Hall issued highly misleading statements to create the impression that they knew nothing about it.

In essaying to unravel the strange disappearance of an English visitor from a Paris hotel during the 1889 exposition, they have kept the plot properly thick and have employed a platoon of professionals who handle their lines, which, for the record, are both French and English, with facility and conviction.That their excursion into Gallic crime is less than taut may be attributed to a a somewhat leisurely introduction to the basic baffling business at hand and the fact that this period piece may be recognized, almost from the outset, as stemming from a somber narrative that has become almost legendary.Although the cognoscenti may not find the events at the Hotel de Licorne as suspenseful as might by expected, chances are that they, as well as the uninitiate, will not yawn. For scenarists Hugh Mills and Anthony Thorne are spinning their variant of a yarn that has intrigued listeners, readers and writers, among them the late Alexander Woollcott, since Queen Victoria's time.They are, in short, telling the story of an English brother and sister who arrive at a Paris hotel from Marseille on one leg of their continental trip. They register in rooms previously reserved for them, dine, see the sights and then retire. The next morning, the sister, Victoria Barton, gaily ready for a tour of the festive city, is puzzled to discover that not only is her brother missing but there seems to be no trace of his room.The proprietress, a coolly correct and efficient dame","excerpt":"her brother, and the rest of the hotel staff are certain Mademoiselle Barton is mistaken. She arrived alone, there was no brother and wouldn't it be best all around if she went home? The lady, terrified but undaunted, is not easily persuaded, however. And, it is only after she checks what seems to be every lead and finally enlists the aid of a young English artist—the sole, person in Paris who is certain of her story—that she succeeds in her quest.Since it is a violation of an ancient code to reveal such matters, the dénoument is, this corner feels, strictly the property of the viewer. Suffice it to say that although it is unusual, it is plausible.As the distraught sister, Jean Simmons gives a characterization of the wide-eyed and winsome lass seeking the key to an enigma that is not only plausible but gives the role beauty and dignity as well. As her handsome vis-à-vis, Dirk Bogarde is, despite an excess of nonchalance, a solid help to a lady in distress. And, Cathleen Nesbitt, as the calculating hotel owner; Marcel Poncin, as her prissy and jittery brother; Felix Aylmer, as the stiff but kindly British consul; David Tomlinson, as the sought-after brother, and Austin Trevor, as a police commissaire, give excellent support to the principals.Terence Fisher and Antony Darnborough, who directed, have chosen to have their cast speak quite a bit of dialogue in French, a circumstance which may confuse American audiences. But they have also taken the trouble to set that cast, charmingly attired in Victorian bustles and top hats, in authentically bustling, carefree and gay Parisian locales.If the atmosphere in \\"So Long at the Fair\\" is not as tense as might be expected, it is, nevertheless, a well told and intriguing tale, which has stood the test of time from gaslight to klieg light.

NEW AND COLLECTED POEMS: 1931-2001, by Czeslaw Milosz. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $45.) In the winter of his 70-year career, Milosz appears to be locked in insoluble argument with himself: where he once credited poetry with the power to rescue mankind from the void, he now demurs, maintaining that language is inadequate to the task of capturing verity. But if that is so, is not his latest assertion itself suspect?    BILLANCOURT TALES, by Nina Berberova. (New Directions, $24.95.)

WHY DID I EVER, by Mary Robison. (Counterpoint, $23.) In Robison's first novel for a decade, Monica Breton has three ex-husbands she can't quite remember and two children she loves immensely but can't figure out how to help; she defends herself, painfully, with wit and irony, Ritalin and lots of rules for living.    AUSTERLITZ, by W. G. Sebald. (Random House, $25.95.) A middle-aged Welsh architectural historian discovers that he is really the son of Holocaust victims from Czechoslovakia in this rich, gloomy novel by a writer who has specialized in characters crippled by the past.    THE OFFICERS' WARD, by Marc Dugain. (Soho, $21.) Cast as a memoir, this novel takes place in a Parisian hospital for gravely disfigured veterans of World War I -- men who are literally faceless but have nonetheless retained shreds of humanity; it is a measure of the narrative's artful artlessness that it reads as if it were truly nonfiction.    THE FEAST OF THE GOAT, by Mario Vargas Llosa. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) A bloody end is never in doubt in this novel starring Gen.

In this British novel, a young journalist awakens from a coma after a traffic accident to find she has no memory of the last three years","excerpt":"her creepy former boyfriend, seeing an opening, tries to marry her before she recovers her past. The result is ''intelligent fiction, vigorous both in its observation of human foible and in its speculation on the role that memory plays in underwriting our sense of choice and direction in our lives,'' Michael Upchurch wrote in the Book Review last year.    The Other American: The Life of Michael Harrington, by Maurice Isserman. (PublicAffairs, $14.) Michael Harrington (1928-89) was a Socialist critic whose 1962 book, ''The Other America,'' was a landmark study of the culture of poverty, and whose life work was to create a ''left wing of the possible.'' In 2000 our reviewer, Victor Navasky, called this a ''fair and fascinating account of a charismatic and appealing actor on the American political stage.''    Sick Puppy, by Carl Hiaasen. (Warner Vision, $7.99.) This gleefully chaotic novel, in which a deranged eco-terrorist takes aim at a corrupt lobbyist (and litterbug), is populated by depraved and awful Floridians of all stripes, from crooked politicians to swamp-dwelling vigilantes. '' 'Sick Puppy' begins with an absurd premise and then gets nuttier,'' Joe Queenan wrote here last year.    Shakespeare's Kings. The Great Plays and the History of England in the Middle Ages: 1337-1485, by John Julius Norwich. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $16.) The British historian assesses the reliability of Shakespeare's plays about the later Plantagenets, setting the chronology straight and sorting out conflated or confused figures for the ''enthusiastic but cheerfully nonexpert'' Shakespeare lover. ''Lord Norwich takes to his task with characteristic panache,'' R. N. Swanson wrote in these pages last year. ''His style is easy and highly readable.''    A Member of the Family, by Susan Merrell. (Perennial/ HarperCollins, $13.) In this first novel about the limits of familial love, an American couple who adopt an emotionally disturbed Romanian orphan are forced to contemplate some tough decisions when his disruptive behavior threatens to destroy their family. The result is ''a heartbreaking story about an adoption gone very wrong,'' Betsy Groban said here last year.    The Nature of Economies, by Jane Jacobs. (Vintage, $12.) The social critic best known for her groundbreaking 1961 work, ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' maintains that economies mimic natural systems in the way they evolve, and that they need to be understood in ecological terms. ''She draws upon a rich knowledge of diverse literatures . . . and has lost none of her astute wit,'' Robert Kuttner wrote here in 2000.    The Verificationist, by Donald Antrim. (Vintage Contemporaries, $12.) This slender novel features a bunch of squabbling psychoanalysts (none with medical degrees) who meet in an all-night pancake house to chew over their livelihood and their sexuality, among other things. The narrator observes most of the action while floating around the ceiling. The result is ''a book that clatters and whirs like a Rube Goldberg device, spitting out, on every page, perfectly formed pellets of intellection, rude humor, grief and longing,'' Dwight Garner wrote here last year.    The Tulip, by Anna Pavord. (Bloomsbury, $14.95.) A British garden writer blends botany and history in charting the remarkable ascendancy of the tulip, a humble wildflower from Central Asia that captivated Europe in the 17th century and became a global craze. Her narrative, which has been reissued with fewer illustrations than in the hardcover edition, ''will create many new devotees,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote here in 1999. Tulipomania: The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower and the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused, by Mike Dash (Three Rivers, $12), is a close-in study of the speculative buying and selling of tulips that gripped the Netherlands in the 1600's, creating the world's first futures market before ending in a spectacular crash. '' 'Tulipomania' captures the frenzy of a fascinating phenomenon,'' Carol Peace Robins wrote here last year.    Acts of Mutiny, by Derek Beaven. (Picador USA, $13.) The narrator of this ambitious novel sets out from England to Australia in 1959 with his mother and her lover aboard a liner filled with disaffected &#233;migr&#233;s, and discovers that the military has stashed a deadly weapon in the hold. Last year in these pages, Mark Schone praised the book's ''exciting, geopolitical plot.''

Liberated from the draconic attire of ''Merlin'' and looking in every way terrific, Miss Rivera is in command of a Broadway stage for the first time since her 1975 appearance in the Kander-Ebb ''Chicago.'' And if her song is more likable than inspired, Miss Rivera raises it higher: Her voice is firm and sparky","excerpt":"her crinkly smile, often forced in recent years, is spontaneous; her taut dancer's body is in perfect concord with the music's beat.    Miss Rivera has been a powerhouse performer for roughly three decades, and it's a pleasure to see that power unleashed again, its force undiminished by time. As ''The Rink'' lurches forward, the star continues to delight - whether she's leaping and high kicking in a jitterbug or brassily harmonizing with her co-star, Liza Minnelli. Indeed, Miss Rivera is a performer you could watch forever - but, in the end, even she's not enough to save ''The Rink.'' The show's running time is forever and a day.

She led the Parsons Board of Governors in the 1980s and was involved in every facet of the University from her earliest days on the Board to her last. As Chair, she expressed a passionate commitment to the rebuilding of the Graduate Faculty, and the tradition of a committed Board bears her imprint.

Hirshon Fellowship, which provides funding to students from nations in which intellectual freedom has been abridged. She later established the Dorothy H.

She also envisioned the University as a national center for the arts and played a major leadership role in the Mannes College of Music and the School of Dramatic Arts, as well as Parsons.

It can boast of its lavish staging, certain tuneful melodies, and its host of attractive girls. But the mystery concerning its two murders is never particularly disturbing.Occasionally there is a flash of good comedy, such as when one reads over a stage door the Carroll line: \\"Through these portals pass the most beautiful girls in the world,\\" and an instant later one beholds the figure of an adipose charwoman with her weapons in the doorway. Jack Oakie as a harried press agent and Victor McLaglen as a busy police lieutenant also amused an audience yesterday afternoon.Carl Brisson, a Continental player who achieved distinction as a pugilist before taking up acting, plays Eric Lander, the leading man of this \\"Vanities\\" show, which in the story is supposed to be under the Carroll management. The excuse for Carroll not appearing on the screen is that he has decided to stay in Florida because he is indisposed. So far as Mr. Lander is concerned, he has a prepossessing appearance and sings pleasantly. Not much can be said for or against his acting, for he is thrust into a rôle which scarcely gives an actor any opportunity to distinguish himself, beyond going about his performance in a routine musical comedy manner.It falls to the lot of Kitty Carlisle to portray Ann Ware, who is head over heels in love with Lander. She and Lander are somewhat late for the first night of the show and at the moment Jack Ellery (Mr. Oakie) is quite agitated because of their tardiness in comes Lieutenant Murdock (Mr. McLaglen) in evening attire, complaining loudly because the press agent has completely forgotten to set aside seats for the policeman and his inamorata.The bewildered Ellery is relieved eventually by the sight of Lander and Ann, who report that they are going to be married after the show. It is then that the mysterious incidents occur. Ann is almost killed by a falling spotlight","excerpt":"her door mirror is shattered by somebody slamming it, and a sandbag drops from the flies. It looks as though something were rotten in Denmark and any spectator of the film could give odds on knowing who is responsible for the dirty work.Then blood drips on Ann's hand, and notwithstanding that there is a suggestion that it is nothing but paint, one knows better. Therefore it is not really surprising when the body of a young woman, a private detective, is discovered in the rafters. It is then that Lieutenant Murdock threatens to close down the show, but Ellery prevails upon him to let it go on. A dagger, a half of a pair of scissors and a pistol are employed to help curdle the blood of the onlooker.Yes, the spectacular items are far more interesting than the story. There is the fan waving by a group of girls who succeed in giving with the feathers an impression of lazy waves on an ocean beach. Besides those already mentioned, other players who give valiant support to this blood and thunder musical comedy are Gertrude Michael, Dorothy Stickney, Gail Patrick and Barbara Fritchie.

Alfred A. Knopf. $22.     Like the heroines of Susanna Moore's other two novels (\\"My Old Sweetheart\\" and \\"The Whiteness of Bones\\"), Clio Lynott is an \\"island girl,\\" a girl brought up in the fierce, Edenic beauty of Hawaii, and unprepared for the confusions and seductions of that other world that lies, beckoning, on the other side of the ocean. Like theirs, hers is the story of a woman's search for identity and her attempt to mediate between the claims of the past and the present, family and self, home and the world.   Clio is the cousin of Mamie, the heroine of \\"The Whiteness of Bones,\\" and she shares Mamie's tortuous family history. Clio's great-grandmother was a full Hawaiian princess who married a shipwrecked Irish sailor in 1871","excerpt":"her dowry, Ms. Moore writes, included \\"a coastal plain on the island of O'ahu that was one day to become the city of Honolulu.\\" Her house, once the center of all that was lovely in island society, has been handed down to Clio's eccentric aunt Emma, the self-appointed custodian of the family's past.   Clio's own immediate family has disintegrated, a victim of the centrifugal forces of selfishness and dislocation. Her mother, Kitty, a flighty, impulsive woman vaguely reminiscent of Lily's mother in \\"My Old Sweetheart,\\" has abandoned Clio and her brother, Dix, to start a new life with a new husband in Australia; she occasionally mails Clio presents -- a flea- bitten ermine muff, a stained bed jacket, an alligator handbag with a broken clasp -- then later asks for them back.   Clio's father, John Lynott, is an equally negligent parent. He marries a cruel, mocking woman named Burta and allows her to terrorize his children: Burta starves Clio and Dix, humiliates them and kills their beloved pets. Unable to cope any longer, Clio runs away from home to live with her aunt Emma.   Emma's house, formerly the princess' town residence, is filled with treasures from Hawaii's past: feather capes from the time of Kamehameha I, carved idols with abalone-shell eyes, koa chests filled with musty, fragrant antiques. And Emma has set herself the task of preserving Hawaii's less tangible treasures from the past: the long songs without meter or rhyme known as meles, the oral genealogies of its island families, its hulas and its myths of gods and goddesses and spirits. Knowledge of such matters is disappearing in the new Hawaii of tourists and fancy hotels, and she wants Clio to become \\"the next keeper of the flame\\"; she wants Clio to become the repository of the family's and the islands' history.   This dedication to the past has already warped the lives of Emma and her mother, Mabel. Many years ago, each of them gave up the chance to run away with the man she loved to stay on at the family homestead. Both now live willfully in the past: Emma spends hours recording and memorizing \\"the lore of her race\\"; Mabel actually thinks she's living in a bygone era, inviting the likes of Mark Twain and Jack London for tea.   Clio dutifully absorbs her aunt's lessons, and she soon finds she can \\"no longer separate what had happened a hundred years earlier from what she had dreamed in the night.\\" \\"She used to say laughingly,\\" Ms. Moore writes, \\"that she knew the ritual ceremony for wrapping the bones of a chief, but she could not divide fractions. She could steer an outrigger canoe through rough seas, but she had never learned to iron.\\"   The weight of her family's past, however, has begun to suffocate Clio, and she yearns to explore the bright, mysterious world beyond Hawaii's shores. At the age of 27, she meets and marries a movie star named Tommy Haywood, a modern-day Prince Charming who is her complete opposite, a man without a past, a man who lives relentlessly in the present. Tommy -- who seems to have been modeled on another Tom, Tom Buchanan, the hard-nosed, careless husband of Daisy in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" -- takes Clio away to California and introduces her to a world of rich, vapid movie people, a farcical West Coast version of the frivolous world of New York socialites encountered by Mamie in \\"The Whiteness of Bones.\\"   This world is delineated in overly bright comic-book colors of greed, stupidity and shallowness, very different from the lyrically described world of Hawaii rendered in a shimmering chiaroscuro of soft, tropical tints; and it's consequently hard to understand why someone as thoughtful and intelligent as Clio would linger there for even a moment. And yet she does linger, convinced that Tommy has awakened her from years of sleepwalking, convinced that she has escaped the fate of her aunt and her grandmother. It is only when her marriage comes to a sudden and violent end that she is forced to return home to Hawaii and finally grapple with her family's emotional legacy.   Clearly \\"Sleeping Beauties\\" would be a better novel if Ms. Moore had modulated her satire of Tommy's Hollywood world and depicted the people surrounding Clio in more muted, realistic terms. As it is, Tommy and Clio's father and stepmother are cardboard villains, devoid of any real emotional reality, and hence flimsy foils to Clio's dreams and aspirations.   What redeems the book is Ms. Moore's persuasive ability to delineate Clio's inner life and the place she has come from. Clio's childhood in Hawaii and her relationships with her aunt and grandmother are so fervently and authentically described that we feel we know her, not just as a character, but also as a flesh-and-blood human being. As a result, we can sympathize with her struggles both to embrace and to flee the claims of her past.

But her choices of metals and surfaces can suggest high-priced baubles.   In her latest effort, Ms. Horn disperses 18 gleaming knoblike forms across the newly whitened floor at Mary Boone. Made of either copper or brushed stainless steel, they suggest high-tech mushrooms or an extended suite of space-age hat forms. Although little more than ankle-high, these forms exude a dominating sense of scale that can actually make the viewer feel a bit dwarfed. In addition, they're all unique, with varying heights or diameters, differently curved or slanted sides, slightly rounded or flat tops, and sharp-edged or rounded transitions betwen side and top. Contemplating their differences can be quite an engrossing lesson in geometry. One expects an underlying system but can find none, except that a smaller gallery holds another set of identical forms -- the second half of the piece -- in a different arrangement that creates a different sense of space.   The contradiction between such pure thoughts and such rich materials -- inherent in much Minimalist-inspired art -- still nags, but this is the best piece Ms. Horn has yet exhibited in New York.

On the nonfiction side, the highest ranking new entry is Joan Didion's memoir ''The Year of Magical Thinking.'' It's Didion's eighth book to make The Times's fiction or nonfiction list in hardcover. Her first two books, the novel ''Run River'' (1963) and the essay collection ''Slouching Towards Bethlehem'' (1968) did not appear here, and neither did her two most recent books, the essay collection ''Political Fictions'' and the family history ''Where I Was From.'' But in between, almost everything she has published -- with the exception of ''Miami'' (1987) -- has made the hardcover lists. Didion's most popular books, in terms of this page, appeared in the late 1970's and early 80's. Her novel ''A Book of Common Prayer'' had a 15-week run in the spring and summer of 1977","excerpt":"her essay collection ''The White Album'' hung on for 13 weeks in the summer and fall of 1979; and ''Salvador'' spent 8 weeks on the nonfiction list in the spring of 1983.      KING AND HOBBES: Stephen King's new novel, a paperback original called ''The Colorado Kid,'' is a meta-mystery tale written for the Hard Case Crime series. The book, packaged to resemble a 40's-era pulp novel, enters the paperback fiction list at a mildly disappointing -- for King -- No. 5. (A critic writing in the trade magazine Publishers Weekly called the book's pacing ''glacial,'' and added: ''The real mystery: why would the editors publish a story that will only frustrate anyone looking for the kind of hard-boiled detective novel they're promised on the cover?'') On the hardcover miscellaneous list, ''The Complete Calvin and Hobbes,'' a thick anthology of Bill Watterson's comic strips, makes its debut at No. 4 -- surprising only because, at a list price of $150, it is one of the most expensive books ever to make the Times list. Watterson retired the strip in 1996, and it has clearly been missed. In an interview posted recently on his publisher's Web site, the reclusive Watterson gave some laconic answers to questions posted by fans. One of them asked what led him to resist merchandising his characters. His response: ''For starters, I clearly miscalculated how popular it would be to show Calvin urinating on a Ford logo. . . . Actually, I wasn't against all merchandising when I started the strip, but each product I considered seemed to violate the spirit of the strip, contradict its message and take me away from the work I loved.''

Possibly the most modern of Greek dramatists, Euripides demands an intense psychological realism from actors - and that is what Miss Caldwell has bestowed on her marathon role. This actress makes us believe in the warped logic by which Medea murders her two sons to wreak vengeance on Jason, the ambitious husband who has betrayed her for a Greek princess. And because she does, we are, by evening's end, brought right into the thunderclap of Euripides' tragedy.   As befits a barbaric sorceress lost in exile, Miss Caldwell is set off from the rest of the company by her swarthy complexion","excerpt":"her eyes are dark horizontal slashes that summon up an exotic East. There is a seething physicality to her every gesture; mercurial and sinuous, she is indeed, as Robinson Jeffers's adaptation has it, a mixture of ''serpent and wolf.'' Yet she is a woman, too. Though Miss Caldwell has many opportunities to chew up the scenery, she usually resists them by shading her portrayal with carefully considered nuances.  This at times almost Hedda-like Medea makes the lineage from Euripides to Ibsen abundantly clear.

It is 150 miles from the Lancaster, Pa., farmhouse where this scene was shot to the restaurant in Brooklyn's Park Slope where Kelly McGillis is explaining how she prepared for the role of Rachel Lapp, the young widow. The somber Amish dress has given way to jeans, a black leather jacket and heavy-duty running shoes. In place of dark ringlets peeping out from beneath a muslin cap is a cascade of light brown hair, loose and flowing. The lilting German sing-song has been replaced by the flattened accents of Southern California. But the same gravity and serenity, the same unadorned beauty, shine through.   It was these qualities that led Peter Weir, the Australian director, to select Miss McGillis for the role of Rachel in ''Witness,'' an ambitious film that juxtaposes the modern world against that of the insular Amish. The film, which opens this Friday at Loews Tower East and Paramount, also stars Harrison Ford as the wounded police officer with whom Rachel falls in love.

It is in some respects quite an interesting production. There is Miss Garbo's compelling performance, splendid camera work and praiseworthy atmospheric effects, but the dialogue is often choppy and most of the incidents are set forth rather hurriedly.Robert Z. Leonard is an expert in the silent film technique of the popular form, but in his enthusiasm for a captivating scene he does not pay enough attention to the lines of the players. One would imagine during several scenes that he was afraid to permit Miss Garbo to make herself heard, and, while she is always mistress of her characterization, she is naturally handicapped by unnatural periods of silence, when one expects to hear her talk. As for Clark Gable, who plays opposite her, he is often in a recitative mood, apparently waiting for his cue to get the words off his mind.This film tells its story without much in the way of drama. Things happen according to schedule and one rather anticipates more than a few of the developments. Miss Garbo, however, atones somewhat for the lack of suspense in this presentation, for she never fails to hold one's attention, whether she is clad as a humble girl on a farm or arrayed in alluring creations. Her voice does not sound as deep as it did in her other films, and her Swedish accent is accounted for by the surroundings in which Susan was born. For her uncle, played by Jean Hersholt, speaks English in much the same fashion as his niece does.At first this illegitimate girl is known as Helga. The name Susan Lenox is given her by the tattooed woman of a traveling carnival. She flees from her uncle's farm because she does not want to marry the man he has selected for her. She is at the moment in love with Rodney Spencer, an engineer, who afterward comes to the carnival to take her away, but because he believes that she has been intimate with the owner of the show, he goes away without her, telling Susan before he leaves what happens to women of her type.Susan then flings aside all ideas of propriety and succeeds financially as the mistress of a politician. As for Rodney he is so infatuated with Susan that he kills his chances as an engineer by drinking. Susan, while living a luxurious existence, learns of Rodney's whereabouts and has him invited to her house without revealing her identity. This ends in heated words.She abandons the politician and follows Rodney to San Francisco and then to Java, where she is employed as an entertainer in a disreputable resort. Then follows a third meeting between Rodney and Susan and she finally satisfies him of her good intentions.One of the outstanding scenes is where Rodney, the day after he first encounters Susan, undertakes to teach her to fish. This episode is not only nicely acted, but it has a fund of amusement and is beautifully pictured.The scenes on the carnival train are rather extravagant, but there is no denying that they possess a certain effectiveness. Among the individuals with the show are the tattooed woman, a midget, a bearded lady and several other performers.Jean Hersholt figures only in the early stages of this story, but his portrayal is painstaking. John Miljan gives a rational interpretation of the carnival owner. Alan Hale injects a touch of villainy in an early episode as the man Susan's uncle wants her to marry.

(Ages 10 and up) Although popular accounts of Maj. John Wesley Powell's exploration of the Colorado River made it seem like one trip, in fact there were two, and the records of the 16-month second expedition were carefully kept. The story of the perilous journey as told through the experiences of a teen-age artist, including some of his drawings as well as photographs, is an exciting adventure.    LAST LICKS: A Spaldeen Story. By Cari Best. Illustrated by Diane Palmisciano. DK Ink. $15.95. (Ages 5 and up) You remember Spaldeens, don't you? But have your children or grandchildren discovered the pleasures of those small, smooth balls essential for city street games? This story is about Annie, a great player who lives in a friendly neighborhood.    LUBA AND THE WREN. Written and illustrated by Patricia Polacco. Philomel. $16.99. (Ages 5 to 9) This version of the familiar story of the fisherman and his wife is set in Russia long ago and tells how Luba, a sweet-natured peasant girl, rescues a wren with magical powers. Her greedy parents demand that she ask the wren for grander and grander gifts, until they are returned to the freedom of rural poverty. The illustrations are in a familiar witty style.    RUSHMORE. Written and illustrated by Lynn Curlee. Scholastic. $17.95. (Ages 7 to 10) The story of the monumental stone faces carved on Mount Rushmore between 1927 and 1941 is a tale of obsession, imagination, art and engineering. The design and execution were the work of Gutzon Borglum, an autocratic and determined artist whose name is not carved on the mountain -- the only thing modest about his achievement.'' Stunning, almost photorealistic paintings convey the engineering problems and the scale of the endeavor. The text, which deals with the history of the project as well as the technology and the danger, is engrossing.    BUILDING. Written and illustrated by Elisha Cooper. Greenwillow. $16. (Ages 4 and up) Here, in a small, pleasant-to-hold book, is a detailed account of a different kind of project. It tells how a vacant lot near an urban downtown was transformed by the construction of a modest building. It is illustrated with airy, impressionistic watercolors. There are a few unclear steps, but the anecdotes and the glimpses of the workmen are charming.    NAME ME NOBODY. By Lois-Ann Yamanaka. Hyperion. $14.99.

Gaab, a working photographer since 1996, contributes to Arena Homme Plus and i-D. For his art project ''Sensation,'' based on the five senses (published by Steidl in March 2003), Gaab recruited his son Aaron (left) to be his model.

This guarantees that the science in his coming novel, ''Precious Blood'' (a thriller to be published by HarperCollins), will be absolutely authentic. ''I don't think I've read anything that actually captures medical death investigation,'' says Hayes, who lives with his cats Bates and Petey (left) and loves to travel (though it's usually for work). The self-portrait (far left) was taken in a Lucerne hotel.    Katherine Wolkoff  Katherine Wolkoff, who made her first trip to Texas to photograph the Smith family farm, on Page 144, was surprised by the state's beauty and lushness.

''It was pretty amazing -- there's nothing out there except a very large insane asylum.'' Wolkoff is also an assistant professor at the Massachusetts College of Art, in Boston.

That \\"everyone\\" includes Robert Dhery and his rubber-legged wife, Colette Brosset, who entertained Broadway theatergoers a few years back with \\"La Plume de Ma Tante,\\" which, despite considerable shortcomings was a delight compared to this film.I would wonder, indeed, how this raillery about a Frenchman who gets into a jam, while on a visit to London, by accidentally putting on a policeman's uniform could ever have got to this country from its place of origin, France, if I hadn't seen it aboard a liner returning from Europe last June. They showed it aboard ship, and the consensus was it should have been dropped into the sea, but evidently somebody sneaked it ashore when we reached New York.Anyhow, it showed up yesterday at the Little Carnegie, and this is to give you fair warning that you see it at your own risk. It counterweighs Mr. Dhery against the platinum-blonde Diana Dors, which seems a fair balance of talent, if not of avoirdupois. He is the tongue-tied little Frenchman who is generally mistaken for a London cop, and she is a British movie actress who wants to reward him for saving her life.The twain do not meet, except in passing, until almost the end of the film, after a great deal of racing and chasing through the streets of the city has been done. Involved in these violent exercises are the horrified Miss Brosset","excerpt":"her fictional husband, Ronald Fraser, a clattering gaggle of London police and a busload of drunken Frenchmen who have attended a football game.To the tune of a lot of witless chatter, they chase down alleys, fall off roofs, pile up in waves in police stations and get underfoot on the Horse Guards' Parade. But somehow these things aren't as funny as they were when they were done by the Keystone Cops. Eventually, the mix-up is untangled by Mr. Dhery doing what he should have done early in the picture: He takes off the uniform.Lost in the clutter is Pierre Olaf, the little Frenchman with the owlish look who was one of the major adornments of \\"La Plume de Ma Tante.\\" Lost, too, is whatever Gallic flavor the idiocy may have had before the whole thing was dubbed into a babble of English dialogue.

At the age of 18, Andrew McCarthy was plucked out of New York University to star opposite Jacqueline Bisset in ''Class,'' and today - at 23 - he has three more movies on his resume.   Demi Moore is also 23, but she, too, has a string of movie credits, most recently as the romantic lead opposite Rob Lowe in ''About Last Night . . . .''   Their faces already recognizable icons of the big screen, their bank accounts fattened by Hollywood salaries, these young film actors might easily confine their creative activities to lucrative movie sets and Hollywood's quick takes. The fall season, however, finds all three braving the colder climate of New York theater, where each is starring in a different Off Broadway production.   Last week Ms. Moore made her stage debut in ''The Early Girl,'' a new Caroline Kava play at the Circle Repertory Company. Set in an exclusive bordello, the play focuses on its madam and the lives of the young women who work for her as prostitutes.

(Ballantine, $12.95.) Far more than a pastiche, this prequel to ''Hamlet,'' chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2000, invents sumptuous, deep lives for Hamlet's mother","excerpt":"her first husband, the king of Denmark; and his younger brother, Claudius, who seduces the queen and usurps the throne. (Hamlet shows up as an arrogant brat.) Drawing on both Shakespeare and older accounts to conjure its rich medieval world, the result is a ''pleasurable and wonderfully dexterous novel about three figures in complex interplay with their public state, their private longings and one another,'' Richard Eder wrote here.    DRIVING OVER LEMONS: An Optimist in Spain, by Chris Stewart. (Vintage Departures, $12.) The author, a former drummer for the British rock group Genesis, describes the ups and (mostly) downs of owning a run-down sheep farm in southern Spain. ''The ability to write hilarious travelogues featuring excruciating scenes of discomfort may well be a national characteristic,'' Karen Karbo said here last year. ''It's certainly possessed by Chris Stewart.''    ADDRESS UNKNOWN, by Kathrine Kressmann Taylor. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $8.95.) Originally published in 1939 (it appeared a year earlier in Story magazine), this slender, emotionally packed novel is a series of letters tracing the growing rift between a Jewish art dealer in San Francisco and his former partner, who has returned to Germany. The result is ''the most effective indictment of Nazism to appear in fiction,'' Stanley Young wrote here.    BRUCE CHATWIN, by Nicholas Shakespeare. (Anchor, $18.) According to this biography, the author of ''In Patagonia,'' ''The Songlines'' and other works of nomadic questing, who died of AIDS in 1989, was a lonely man whose wanderlust was both a virtue and a flaw. Even if his subject ultimately remains elusive, Shakespeare ''worked diligently, read everything, traveled everywhere'' and his ''literary appraisal is intelligent and judicious,'' Richard Eder said here in 2000.    THE SIBYL IN HER GRAVE, by Sarah Caudwell. (Dell, $5.99.) In her final novel, the author mixes literary genres -- from the English village mystery to the academic satire -- as she deploys her heroine (or is it hero?), the Oxford don Hilary Tamar, and her band of legal scholars to solve a case involving insider trading, murder and a trip to Cannes. ''The humor is wicked, but the intelligence behind it is smart and sweet,'' Marilyn Stasio wrote here in 2000.    THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, by Robert V. Remini. (Penguin, $14.) A noted historian argues that the climactic battle of the War of 1812, which pitted a ragtag American militia led by Andrew Jackson against a superior British force, was America's first great military victory and a defining moment for an insecure nation. In 1999 our reviewer, Carlo D'Este, called this ''an exceptional book that combines impressive scholarship with a riveting narrative.''    THE RIVER KING, by Alice Hoffman. (Berkley, $14.) The author's 14th novel is set in the fictional town of Haddan, Mass., and at the Haddan School, an exclusive prep school whose reputation is threatened when a gawky freshman drowns in the nearby river. It looks like murder, but everyone seems eager to call it a suicide, except one local cop who is helped in his investigation by the victim's ghost. ''Storytelling, refreshingly, is Hoffman's strength,'' Amanda Fortini wrote in these pages last year, and her tale ''is full of . . . satisfyingly odd twists and turns.''    THE ROSE GARDEN: Short Stories, by Maeve Brennan. (Counterpoint, $14.50.) Most of these tales first appeared in The New Yorker in the 1950's and 60's and expose the pretensions and vulnerabilities of housewives, servants, loners and social climbers in Dublin and New York. Last year our reviewer, Linda Barrett Osborne, admired Brennan's ''shrewd eye'' and ''sense of justice.''    ORDINARY RESURRECTIONS: Children in the Years of Hope, by Jonathan Kozol. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $14.) A scholar and social critic records the lives of a group of black and Hispanic schoolchildren in the South Bronx. The results are mixed, but ''over all the book is affecting, in places deeply moving,'' Ethan Bronner said here in 2000. The same publisher has reissued And Still We Rise: The Trials and Triumphs of Twelve Gifted Inner-City Students, by Miles Corwin ($14), an account of the year the author spent at a high school in South Central Los Angeles that shows how some youngsters persevere in the face of adult-size pressures. Last year our reviewer, Bob Blaisdell, praised the book's ''unexpected, fresh and interesting'' classroom dialogue.

For a stretch of almost 30 years -- from the publication of ''Henderson the Rain King'' in 1959 through the release of ''More Die of Heartbreak'' in 1987 -- nearly everything Bellow wrote appeared for two months or so on the hardcover fiction or nonfiction list. It took the public time to pick up on Bellow's busy, rueful, comic charms. None of his first four novels -- ''Dangling Man'' (1944), ''The Victim'' (1947), ''The Adventures of Augie March'' (1953) or ''Seize the Day'' (1956) -- made this page. Bellow's real breakthrough came in 1964 with ''Herzog,'' a novel about a failed academic whose wife leaves him for his best friend. The book was praised on the cover of the Book Review and held on at No. 1 for more than seven months. (The book it bumped out of the top slot: John le Carré's ''Spy Who Came In From the Cold.'') Twenty years after the publication of his first novel, Bellow was financially secure. In his biography of Bellow, James Atlas writes that female readers were particularly taken with ''Herzog,'' and with its dashing author. Women would write to him, Bellow said in a television interview, ''to ask me how they should behave with intellectuals, for recipes of dishes mentioned in the book. They make me feel like an editor of Vogue.''    CHANGING PLACES: There are new No. 1 and No. 2 books on both hardcover lists this week. On the nonfiction side, ''My Life So Far,'' by Jane Fonda, and ''The World Is Flat,'' by Thomas L. Friedman, knock off last week's Nos. 1 and 2, Malcolm Gladwell's ''Blink'' and Catherine Crier and Cole Thompson's ''Deadly Game.'' On the fiction list, Mary Higgins Clark's ''No Place Like Home'' and Sue Monk Kidd's ''Mermaid Chair'' climb atop Dan Brown's ''Da Vinci Code'' and Matthew Stover's ''Revenge of the Sith.'' Of these four new books, Sue Monk Kidd's is the stealth best seller. ''The Mermaid Chair'' is her second novel","excerpt":"her first, ''The Secret Life of Bees,'' was published in 2002 and caught on gradually with readers in its softcover edition -- it appeared on the paperback list for more than 80 weeks. Before she turned to fiction, Kidd published several books about spirituality and was a contributing editor for Guideposts magazine. She wasn't fully aware of how popular ''The Secret Life of Bees'' had become, she has written, until she turned on ''Jeopardy!'' in a hotel room one night and heard a contestant select the category ''Women Writers'' for $600, after which Alex Trebek intoned, ''Sue Monk Kidd's debut novel is about this insect.''

Mrs. Brunetti, 88, was the widow of the real estate magnate Joseph J. Brunetti. Born in Brooklyn, New York in 1914 to Lucia and Joseph Prisco, Mrs. Brunetti was one of eight children. Ann and Joe Brunetti married in 1930 and shortly thereafter gave birth to son, John J. Brunetti, and daughter, Lucille V. Costa (deceased). In 1939, Mr. and Mrs. Brunetti founded the Joseph J. Brunetti Construction Company, and went on to build developments in New Jersey known as Brookchester, Richfield Village, Wright Village, Maybrook Gardens and others. The company went on to become one of the most prominent real estate companies in New Jersey and Florida. Today it is known as the Brunetti Organization located in Old Bridge, New Jersey, with son, John and grandsons, John Jr., and Stephen at the helm. In 1942, the Brunetti family settled in Hackensack, New Jersey and three years later gave birth to their third child, Jo Ann H. Brunetti. The Brunetti's spent winters at their Florida residence and summers at their homes at Sea Girt and Hackensack, New Jersey. Anna and Joseph Brunetti, in the late 1950's developed a love for thoroughbred racehorses and owned such champions as ''Vertex'' and ''Staunchness''. In the late 1960's they built Red Oak Farm in Ocala, Florida and began breeding thoroughbred racehorses. Mrs. Brunetti served as a member of the Board of Directors of Hialeah Racetrack in Hialeah, Florida, which had been acquired by her son, John, in 1977.

Also, contributions have been made to various schools such as the New York Military Academy, colleges and universities, some of which were attended by her children and grandchildren. Her wish was to provide students with the opportunity to achieve their educational goals. Additionally, medical centers such as Hackensack Medical Center, St. Barnabas Medical Center, Broward General Medical Center and others have been recipients of contributions from the Brunetti Foundation.

Born in Columbus, Ohio on August 14, 1944 to John Edwin Farmer and the late Ruth Cooper Farmer, she is survived by her father and stepmother, Jeannine of Columbus. She graduated from DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana and spent her early business career with the strategic consulting firms, Management Horizons and The Doody Company in Columbus, and then as Executive Vice President, Marketing, for Lerner Stores and the retail divisions of American Can, both in New York. Her prominence and recognition grew in the mid - eighties when she opened her own firm, Carol Farmer Associates, first in New York City, then in Boca Raton, Florida and, in 1994 in France. Carol was actively involved in numerous management and retail-related organizations and served as a director of two NYSE listed companies ---The Sports Authority and Lowe's Corporation. She was respected for her unique angle of vision, one that translated complex social, economic, political and cultural issues into business solutions. In the early nineties, Carol launched trendtrax as an interactive video newsletter for senior management. Her latest body of work converged in the concept she termed, ''Second Wind,'' insights and analysis of how baby boomers are continuing to re-define the aging process. Carol was a voracious reader, a lifelong learner and an early adopter of the creative use of computer technology.

We join her daughters Jeannie and Deborah, her two grandsons, and her four great-grandchildren in mourning her passing. Gwen Ackerman devoted herself to the well-being and comfort of everyone she met and will be greatly missed by many. Jane P.

Her grandmother Lillian Fuchs, who died in October, played viola before her","excerpt":"her great-uncle Joseph Fuchs is a violinist; her mother, Barbara Mallow, a cellist, and her aunt, Carol Stein Amado, a violinist. She is a worthy successor to this tradition, playing with dusky, aristocratic tone, exacting intonation and a kind of conversational musicality that seems second nature. She employs generous portamento and rubato, but nothing is forced or mannered.         The high point of Ms. Mallow's recital at Weill Hall on Saturday afternoon was Brahms's grandly sighing Sonata in F minor (Op. 120, No. 1). Her searching musicianship seemed encapsulated in the final phrase of the first movement, which was played in something like a broken voice, distant and expressionless but with an almost imperceptible return of vibrato in the last held note. Overall, the interpretation was more engaging in the melancholy opening movements than in the energetic third and fourth; there, Ms. Mallow sometimes seemed a little stolid.

Thanks to the sentimentality and the neatness of literary construction peculiar to the 19th century, she proves worthy of her birthday and her naming: \\"Her cheeks and lips were as red as holly-berries","excerpt":"her hair was for all the world the color of a Christmas candle-flame; her eyes were bright as stars; her laugh like a chime of Christmas-bells, and her tiny hands forever outstretched in giving.\\"   Unfortunately, when 19th-century authors created angelic children, they all too often felt the need to elevate them to truly angelic status.

''...She is robed in strength and dignity and cheerfully faces whatever may come...She opens her mouth with wisdom, her tongue is guided by kindness ...Her children come forward and praise her","excerpt":"her husband, too, and he lauds her:'Many daughters have amassed achievement, but you surpass them all.'...Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a G-d revering woman is much to be praised...wherever people gather, her deeds speak her praise.'' (Proverbs) Beatrice Diener's deeds speak her praise. Boys Town Jerusalem mourns with profound sorrow the passing of a most cherished member of its extended family. We are honored that one of Boys Town's crown jewel institutes bears the illustrious Diener family name-The Beatrice and Leonard Diener Torah and Science Academy. Together with her beloved husband, Leonard, z''l, who was her partner in life, business and tzedakah, the Dieners demonstrated their commitment to the future builders and leaders of Israel through their magnanimous support of virtually every Boys Town program and project. Mrs. Diener took great delight in the accomplishments of Boys Town's students and truly regarded them as ''her'' boys. Mrs. Diener exuded aristocracy in her very word, action and manner. Her Hebrew name, Bracha, reflects the blessing and inspiration of her lasting memory. Leonard and Beatrice Diener's legacy of Torah im Derech Eretz is not only manifest in the philosophy of the institution they so generously endowed with great modesty and humility, but is evident in the sterling character of their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and indeed, the entire family. Like the Torah itself, whose ideals they personified, the Dieners' ways were ways of pleasantness. To her children, our esteemed Board Members and benefactors, Larry (Adele) and Marjorie, her treasured sister, Toby Greller, her cherished grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces and nephews, we extend heartfelt condolences to the family and offer our prayers.

The Yeshiva University family is deeply grieved by the passing of an outstanding leader in the Jewish Community, a kind, gentle, generous and elegant Grand Lady, and who together with her late husband, Leonard Diener, was a Benefactor of YU where they established the Leonard and Beatrice Diener Institute of Jewish Law at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. At Stern College for Women, with her daughter, Marjorie Blenden, she dedicated the Leonard Diener Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory and, with the Blenden family, she dedicated the Beatrice Diener Dining Hall. She was also a Fellow of Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. Heartfelt condolendes are extended to: her daughter, YU Trustee and Benefactor, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Stern College for Women, Marjorie Blenden; to her son, Lawrence Diener, a Yeshiva College Board member and to his wife, Adele, YU Guardians; to her sister Toby Greller; to her eight grandchildren, and to her six greatgrandchildren.

The tale involved is somewhat of a hit and miss affair which causes one to reflect that even in farces mortals can be fools but they are nevertheless expected to see and hear. In this adventure a pretty girl outwits three or her husband's friends with amazing ease, and through their attentions to her she regains her spouse's undivided admiration.To be a patient of Dr. Josef Rittenhaus, it is first necessary to be of the fair sex, and then to be pretty, judging by the beautiful ailing creatures that flock to his office. Laura Rittenhaus, his attractive wife, is impersonated by Marie Prevost, who in this feature seems hardly the type of young woman who would be neglected by a husband. She dresses in good taste, always has her hair carefully marcelled and has an alluring way of using her dark eyes.Victor Heerman, the director of this subject, has done some very good work. In fact the picture has moments when it rivals some of Ernst Lubitsch's sophisticated efforts, and it seems only to be weakened by the rather inadequate story and the wholly impossible situations. Laura plays cards with her husband's friends and Dr. Carl Tanzer, who appears to think that a true friend ought to be permitted occasionally to steal a kiss from a pretty woman even if she is married.In one scene Laura is beheld in a card game with Tanzer, Schwerman and an elderly professor, named Von Waldstein. Laura has the temerity to write an affectionate message on the ace of spades. She passes it under the table, and it goes to the three men in turns. Laura amuses herself by having the three men making excuses to stay in the house, which results in situations that elicited peals of laughter yesterday afternoon. Laura, after being caught kissing each one of the men, turns them over to the tender mercies of the housekeeper, who is by no means bashful when it comes to depriving them of their worldly goods.The kissing scenes are also enacted before the husband, who comes to the conclusion that the only friend who is faithful to him is the Professor. But, alas, the Professor also has a very weak spot in his heart for Laura, and he is himself caught by Dr. Rittenhaus with Laura in his arms.This comedy is based on a play called \\"The Critical Year,\\" which was written by Rudolph Lothar and Hans Bachwitz.Victor Varconi is well suited to the rôle of the handsome physician, Rittenhaus. Charles Gerrard has a busy time as the leader of the trio. Arthur Hoyt impersonates one of the hopeful admirers of Laura and Claude Gillingwater figures as the Professor.

Her pictures have been characterized as amateurish, formless and mystifying. She has been called a careerist, a lazy photographer.  Why, we might ask, does she arouse such vituperative passions in some, while enjoying the appreciative responses of others? Why do her photographs, and her success, remain both enigmatic and annoying to many eyes?   The answer, I think, is that Miss Sonneman's photography straddles the line between the traditional practice of photography and a more Conceptual, art-world approach to the medium. Her pictures are traditionally photographic to the extent that they describe events and interactions that occur out in the world, employing a loosely organized, free-hand style associated with the 35-millimeter camera, but they violate both the norms of print quality and doctrine of the decisive moment. Miss Sonneman refuses to fetishize technique, and her prints show it","excerpt":"her intentions, we are forced to conclude, lie elsewhere than on the surface. By presenting related pictures in pairs, as diptychs separated by a black line and as little as a fraction of a second of time, she suggests that all moments are created equal - that ''decisiveness'' is a convenient fiction.

Her father founded Edison Brothers Stores, an enterprise in which he was joined by his four brothers. It began as a single shoe store in Atlanta and grew nationally to become the largest chain of women's shoe stores in the country.

As a teacher she was revered by her students for her concern and sensitivity. As a poet her work was widely published and anthologized, and her readings well-received and attended.

It was once said of Edith Wharton and her friend Theodore Roosevelt that that they were both self-made. This is the true subject at the National Academy: how Edith Wharton, born into Old New York of the 1860's and raised in it during the 1870's and 1880's, found her way out of it -- and fully into her own life -- by the first decade of this century.\\n\\nTo the argument that the Wharton career has been too ubiquitous of late (\\"The Age of Innocence\\" and \\"Ethan Frome\\" filmed","excerpt":"her last unfinished novel, \\"The Buccaneers,\\" completed and published; the woman herself impersonated onstage by Irene Worth), the answer is that here, refreshingly, is a collection of iconography contemporary to Wharton's actual New York.

The Envelope, Please"},{"year":"1921","title":"\\"Prisoners of Love,\\" which came to the Capitol Theatre yesterday, violates some of the most approved, or at least widely observed, movie traditions. It falls into the category of \\"social drama,\\" yet it is genuinely dramatic and its people are such as one meets in social life. It is full of \\"plot,\\" it even has \\"punch,\\" and yet the photoplay-wright does not appear as the immediate cause of everything that happens. Much of it seems to come about quite naturally, and though coincidence is by no means excluded, the work allotted to it is the entirely legitimate duty of bringing the characters into situations in which the emphasis comes on the characters as people rather than on the situations as \\"plot.\\" And the \\"hero\\" and \\"heroine,\\" not to mention the \\"villains,\\" have their human sides. In fact, the only place in which the photoplay runs strictly true to movie form, is in its title, which like most titles, doesn't mean much and is obviously a matter of form, rather than substance.The story of \\"Prisoners of Love,\\" in outline, would run about like other screen stories. There is a girl of sincere nature, but with more animal magnetism, or what Barrie calls \\"charm,\\" than she can control, or rightly estimates. But she has character, and when she discovers that her father is normally deficient in this commodity, she leaves his house, to try life independently. She proves magnetic for the inevitable man, and her untrustworthy impulses persuade her that she has found true and lasting love. The man is a butterfly, however, and, having fluttered over one flower for a moment, quickly files to the next, which happens to be the girl's younger and more frivolous sister. Through this fact, the girl is brought back to her father's house where the main crisis of the story comes, and, though it is melodramatic, it does not seem unreal, and, besides throwing the characters into strong relief, it opens a plausible way for the expected happy ending.This plot, treated in the usual fashion, would be just usual. But players, director and cameramen have co-operated to endow it with life. Every member of the cast is good, and the best of all is Betty Compson in the leading rôle. This young woman after a??? prenticeship in comedies and other lesser works that passed practically unnoticed, came under the expert direction of George Loane Tucker and suddenly brightened the film firmament as a real star in \\"The Miracle Man,\\" but how much of her radiance was due to Mr. Tucker, and how much to her own ability, no one could say positively. So many \\"stars\\" have only reflected the light of their directors. But Miss Compson, it seems, is a competent person, and, after \\"The Miracle Man,\\" proceeded to organize her own company, and take charge of the affairs of its business office as well as those of its studio. \\"Prisoners of Love\\" is the initial result of her energy, and the immediate conclusion is that she has not been wasting her time. Her most important accomplishment, however, is as an actress on the screen. She has made good the promise of \\"The Miracle Man.\\" In her silent photogaphs she is expressive","excerpt":"her looks, gestures, positions mean something, and with the rare quality of expression, she has the even rarer quality of restraint, which defines and deepens the ???.The others in the cast, especially Ralph Lewis as the father, are clear and good in their parts. They are Claire McDowell, who adds a genuine touch as the mother, Clara Horton as the sister, ???, Kate Toncray as his mother, and Roy Stewart as the bulwark between the story and an unhappy ending.Arthur Rosson, who directed the picture, and his associates behind the camera have done excellent work. There is more imaginative photography in \\"Prisoners of Love\\" than in most motion pictures. Apparently Mr. Rosson's idea was to put the story, its people and their meaningful actions, rather than a thousand nonessential details, into moving pictures, and he has achieved noteworthy success. He has not just photographed a succession of stage sets.Also on the Capitol program is one of Grantland Rice's Sport Pictorials, the first of which was shown some months ago. It is to be hoped that the series will now continue with regularity, for besides reminding cliff-dwellers and subway sun-dodgers that there are such things as exercise, outdoors and health, the two Pictorials seen by the writer are good works in cinematography, with the touch, of humor that makes their message entertaining. This week's issue is called \\"Making Man-Handlers,\\" and shows interestingly that classroom studies and military drill are only a part of the life of the West Point cadet.The joy in the screen version of \\"The Devil,\\" at the Strand this week, is in the acting of George Arliss, one of the latest and most valuable acquisitions of the screen. Mr. Arliss photographs well, as they say, and is an easy actor. When he walks away from the camera out of a room there is significance in the way he tosses his opera cloak over one shoulder and in the angle at which he sets his walking stick. He even stands intense close-ups without destroying the illusion.But as a photoplay \\"The Devil\\" doesn't score heavily. Those who saw the original play will probably set up a howl, and their anger will be justified, for \\"The Devil\\" seems one of those plays that should not be attempted by the camera. Apparently it requires sounds, voices especially, to make it effective. Perhaps, also, in the adaptation, the course of the plot has been altered. At any rate, on the screen, its diabolical principal seems merely a meddlesome busybody who ought to be shot or ignored, and his victims do not arouse much sympathy. They are so idiotic. It is possible that a more imaginative treatment would have made the story impressive in pictures, but it has been rather literally handled, and except when Mr. Arliss simply compels attention by his pantomime its hold on the spectator is not firm. Only occasionally does one or the moving pictures assert itself.Those in the cast, none of whom can be held responsible for the weakness of the photoplay, are Sylvia Breamer, Lucy Cotton, Mrs. Arliss, Edmund Lowe and Roland Bottomerley. The director was James Young.George Fitzmaurice's \\"Paying the Piper,\\" with Dorothy Dickson, and the second installment of the Vandenbergh African pictures are at the Rivoli. \\"Something Different,\\" with Constance Binney, directed by R.

Born in New York, NY in 1939, passed peacefully from this life at the Holland Farm in Amenia, NY on June 17 after a brief, but intense struggle with cancer. Known within her community--and far beyond--for her tireless energy, community service, and great sense of style, she was active on many committees: the hamlet of Amenias Master Plan, CIPC, New York Relief, Amenia's street tree and flower planting, Cornell Cooperative Extension Dutchess County, Amenia's Business Womens Club, and the Sharon Garden Club. Her immense contributions will be greatly missed. Recently Dolores was named Amenia's Citizen of tHe Year 2006. Dolores (the name she preferred after being amongst so many other Maries in Catholic school in the Bronx) gave to all who knew her stories and impressions that will last forever. After retiring from her work at the Metropolitan Transit Authority in New York City, she and her beloved husband, Larry, moved from NYCs Upper West Side to Amenia full time in 1996. Their farm, the EastWest Bamboo Farm and Garden, is much sought after for garden tours and was included in The Garden Conservancy listing in 2004. In addition to her community work, Dolores was an active member of the New York Master Gardeners, The Mad Gardeners, the American Bamboo Society, and the Conifer Society. Her world travels, often for international bamboo conferences, included Europe, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Borneo,Thailand, Viet Nam, Laos, China, India, Sikkim and Nepal. Her library, home and garden are scattered with significant artifacts documenting her travels, often with close friends. In the 60s, 70s and 80s, Dolores was fascinated by ancient history and archeology, and was a founding member of the Westchester Chapter of the Archeological Institute of America. She traveled during those years to remote areas of Egypt, Morocco, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Mexico. Her professional life at this time was as varied as it was impressive. She worked for the prestigious law firm of Sherman and Sterling, the New York State Atomic and Space Development Authority, and held a position on the Wang Advisory Board. Amid all of this, throughout her exciting life, was a passion for theatre, dance, Asian film, museums, red sports cars, Chinese custard and cannolis. Before moving to the country, Dolores was an active member of the Indoor Gardening Society in Manhattan and became very proficient at growing a wide variety of houseplants, especially succulents and bonsai gardens. With just a few years in the country air, she created a wonderful garden, collecting conifers, bamboo and many unusual trees.Her gardens speak for themselves, but anyone who was lucky enough for a guided tour learned something. Dolores attended mass at the Church of Immaculate Conception in Amenia. Loved by so many, Dolores leaves those who loved her mosther witty, charming husband of 28 years, Larry Dana Holland","excerpt":"her loving son Anthony Poveromo and his wife, Anne-Marie and their precious baby Emily Anne ofHartsdale, NY; her stepsons Kevin Holland of Elkhart, Indiana, and Larry Holland Jr. of Middleboro, Massachusetts, and her siblings Basil Ianni of Hartsdale, NY, and Lydia Narcissi of Lakewood, NJ, and their respective spouses, Joanne and Ron.

It is a film story which glides along merrily most of the time, but now and again it has its off moments.The main reason for the title is a carefree young man named Tony, who is given to reckless driving and drinking. In fact he is never actually sober, and occasionally he is beheld in his evening clothes at high noon making a call on his friends. Apparently he would sooner give a bottle of wine to a girl than a bouquet of flowers. Monroe Owsley does exceedingly well by the part of Tony.As for Miss Crawford, she gives a better portrayal here than she has in any of her previous talking pictures. As Valentine Winters she succeeds in being quite convincing in cheery and serious moments. A further asset to this production is Pauline Frederick, who figures as Diane, Valentine's divorced mother, who until the closing scenes is the mistress of a Frenchman named André de Graignon.Valentine turns up in Paris to see her mother, after being for many years in the custody of her father. It is not until the climax is reached that she learns of her mother's relations with de Graignon.An instance of implausibility is where Valentine first meets Bob, a Harvard football player and the son of well-to-do, conservative parents. Tony and Valentine are in an automobile which turns turtle after a crash. Bob, who is in another car, helps Valentine to crawl out of the wrecked conveyance. She talks to Bob as though nothing untoward had happened and a few moments later she thinks of Tony. No sooner is his name mentioned than the inebriated young man extricates himself from the overturned automobile. All thought of the accident is quickly dismissed, as neither Tony nor Valentine is hurt. But it is quite plain that cupid has scored, for from then on the narrative is chiefly concerned with the love affair between Valentine and Bob.When Bob and his father and mother go to see Valentine and Diane, their quiet game of bridge is rudely interrupted by Tony bursting into the house. He is followed by a group of friends, all presumably the worse for wine. Then there is trouble from de Graignon and the truth comes out concerning Diane. But the shadow-story tellers, as might be surmised, find a way to end matters satisfactorily.Neil Hamilton does very well as the noble Bob and Albert Conti rises to what is demanded of him as de Graignon.Nicholas Grinde, director of this picture, has done splendid work by his comedy, but his serious interludes might have been handled more effectively.Chester Hale's stage contribution, \\"Going! Going! Gone!\\" has some glamorous scenes and several good numbers. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Her Loyal Daughter. A German Danton. Movietone News.
