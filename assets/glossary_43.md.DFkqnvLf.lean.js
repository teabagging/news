Today, the Soviet Union is becoming more knowledgable about the multifaceted nature of alcoholism and the alternative treatments available for alcoholics and drug addicts.\\n\\nExpanding that awareness was one of several goals set last month by a group of 50 American lawyers, research scientists, treatment specialists and others who attended a Soviet-American conference on alcoholism in Moscow. At least one group member, Paul Crotty, senior vice president of ETP Inc. of Windsor, looked at the possibility of establishing employee assistance programs in Soviet factories. The programs that his company offers are intended to help employees and their families with a wide range of personal problems.\\n\\nMr. Crotty discussed the conference at his office shortly after he returned from a 10-day trip to Moscow in November. Here are some excerpts from the conversation. \\n\\n\\nQ. How did the conference differ from earlier meetings with the Soviets on the same subject?\\n\\n\\nA. What was unique about this trip was that experts were talking to each other about their fields. There was a real matching of disciplines. Lawyers talked with lawyers about the legal aspects of alcoholism","excerpt":"research scientists talked with research scientists about the medical aspects of alcoholism; treatment professionals talked with and visited their hospitals, and those of us in the employee assistance program field visited factories and hospitals associated with these factories. \\n\\n\\n\\nQ. The Soviets' version of our Prohibition by many accounts has not worked. What have they instituted in its place? \\n\\n\\nA. I think they see it just as a failed experiment. One factory director told us they should have learned from our experience with Prohibition. It was really something. They burned vineyards, destroyed breweries and changed them into other types of factories. It is still very difficult to get liquor. \\n\\n\\n\\nQ. How does the Soviet perspective on alcoholism differ from that found in the United States?\\n\\n\\nA. It is a very difficult adjustment for them to look at alcoholism from a social and psychological point of view. Their treatment programs are focused on medical aspects of the problem. It's only been in the last couple of years that they have started to look at a recovery process that involves families and self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous.\\n\\nThey also look at it as a moral weakness. It's not that different than the way we looked at alcoholism in the United States 20 years ago. In some cases, we still look at it that way.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. How is A.A. doing in the Soviet Union?\\n\\n\\nA. Very well. Just before we arrived there, the first A.A. group in Moscow had celebrated their third anniversary. Also, a large number of recovering alcoholics were involved in the conference, both on the American side and the Soviet side. That was unheard of two years ago, that any Soviet would speak openly about their alcoholism. Their view of alcoholism is that an alcoholic is a person who is drunk and in the gutter.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. In other words, their definition of an alcoholic is someone we would consider to be in the advanced stages of alcoholism?\\n\\n\\nA. Yes. They have no concept of functional alcoholism, that is, alcoholics who can drink and get through their daily lives and still have families and jobs. They also do not have a concept of someone being in recovery and abstaining from alcohol and leading highly productive lives.\\n\\nSome of my friends who are recovering alcoholics were at the house of a Soviet doctor who treats alcoholism and drug addiction as a livelihood. He was trying to force them to drink. He still didn't get it. These people didn't fit his idea of alcoholics -- suit and tie, looks great, wonderful personality, how can he be recovering? \\n\\n\\n\\nQ. What is the latest count on the number of alcoholics in the Soviet Union? \\n\\n\\nA. They officially list 4 million to 5 million alcoholics. That's out of a population of 285 million. \\n\\n\\n\\nQ. But isn't the problem much more widespread than that?\\n\\n\\nA. Yes. In fact, at this conference a number 10 times that was mentioned here and there.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. Is this discrepancy in numbers because the Soviet Government only counts those alcoholics who are hospitalized?\\n\\n\\nA. Yes, and those who don't make it there, the ones they find in the gutter.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. What happens to Soviet employees who are found intoxicated on the job or who are suspected of having a drinking problem.\\n\\n\\nA. Up until October, anyone who was found to be alcoholic would have to register with the state. They would lose that day's pay and another day. If it was a repeated problem, they might have their vacations changed from summer to winter. If caught repeatedly, especially if they were on the street, they probably would be arrested.\\n\\nTheir pictures would be posted on the factory walls. I saw one gentleman's working papers, which are passport-like papers that list all of the jobs you have had, and his showed that he had spent one year in an alcoholic labor camp. That meant that he would not be able to get a decent job. Alcoholism has been de-criminalized, but they haven't come up with any new wording for the law.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. Do they still send alcoholics to labor camps or work farms?\\n\\n\\nA. Not as much. They have moved to more treatment-type hospitals, but you are still there against your will. There have been these coalitions that have developed between factories and hospitals. Once a worker is well enough to go back to work, they might go work at a factory associated with the hospital. In one place there was a factory that made building supplies. We met with the director of this factory, and his office was in the hospital. In the beginning, they were sending some employees who had problems with alcoholism over to the hospital for treatment. But more and more, they are going out to find alcoholics, bringing them to the hospital, treating them and then putting them to work in a factory. They realized these hospitals could supply them with at least unskilled laborers and in some cases skilled workers.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. Were the Soviets interested in employee assistance programs for their factories?\\n\\n\\nA. They don't really have a counselling orientation. They have a psychiatric or psychiatric research orientation. They did seem to be interested in family problems. They were very interested in issues specific to women, problems in the workplace, and women and alcoholism.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. What are the prospects for a proliferation of employee assistance programs in the Soviet Union?\\n\\n\\nA. The business leaders seemed to grasp the fact that alcoholics can be becoming functioning productive workers, more so than a doctor. The problem is that the people they have treated in the past were not people who were productive workers.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. What is the next step?\\n\\n\\nA. We ended with several joint resolutions. They're going to send people here to be trained, and we are going to send people there to learn their system and work in their hospitals and in their factories with the eventual goal of setting up an employee assistance program. The most likely factory will be an auto factory that is connected with the hospital whose doctors were involved in this conference. We are going to identify people at earlier stages of alcoholism than they have been willing to do.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. Why have they been unwilling to identify workers they suspect have a drinking problem?\\n\\n\\nA. Because they need workers.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. The basis of A.A. is a belief in a power greater than the person with the alcohol problem. Do the Soviets have trouble with this concept?\\n\\n\\nA. Although the Communists tried to squash the church, they didn't do a very good job of squashing the spirit of the people and their belief that God is at work.\\n\\nOne woman said to me: \\"Church is in your soul.\\" CONNECTICUT Q&A;: PAUL CROTTY;\\nExpanding Awareness on Alcoholism"},{"year":"1935","title":"Engaged to L C Gay MISS LUCIA GAY ENGAGED.","excerpt":"Research Secretary to Become the Bride of Darnall Burks."},{"year":"1939","title":"WASHINGTON, July 11.--In the first part of a study of the flow of stock trading on the New York Stock and Curb Exchanges from early 1935 to June 30, 1938, the research and statistics section of the ...

In contrast to the situation with stocks and bonds, there has not been a variety of broadly available and widely understandable vehicles for selling limited partnership units to other buyers at a fair price. Moreover, the paperwork involved in the existing informal markets has usually been exceedingly cumbersome.

A large transparent cube in the courtyard of the building, a stony 19th-century edifice, immediately recalls I. M. Pei's pyramids at the Louvre. (It houses the hotel's reception desk.) Just beyond, the building hides a low-lit universe of geometric interiors, faux-fur surfaces, electronic gadgets and furnishings by brand-name designers -- as well as France's first ice bar. Is that Barbarella in the corner?    THE LOCATION       The Kube boldly goes where no Parisian luxury boutique hotel has gone before: a remote, rough-edged section of the 18th arrondissement that's known for cheap Indian and Turkish restaurants. By pioneering this other-side-of-the-tracks location, the Kube effectively throws a litchi martini in the face of its upmarket rivals, which have generally clustered in the environs of the Champs-Élysées.    THE SCENE       Welcome to shag central. Dark and outfitted with furry black sofas, furry black columns, black mirrors and hanging spaghetti-like strands of red light, the multipurpose lobby-restaurant-bar has the pleasingly decadent feel of a sci-fi bordello. A Tuesday evening in February found it surprisingly happening. As a D.J. spun house music and plasma-screen TV's flickered with computer-generated images, a diverse crowd that included many unshaven guys in sport coats and Pumas and their dates sipped Champagne and munched tapas-like ''aperifood.''     On the mezzanine level, hanging rows of Aarnio Eero's transparent plastic bubble chairs accommodated people waiting for 30-minute shifts in the Ice Cube. Sponsored by Grey Goose vodka, the chamber, constructed of 22 tons of ice, serves colorful vodka drinks in bored-out ice blocks. Arctic wear included. (Admission is 38 euros, or $47.50 at $1.25 to the euro, which includes drinks","excerpt":"reservation required.)    THE ROOMS       The very angular, very white interiors are splashed with strawberry-hued desks, mint green side tables, gumdrop purple gelatinous throw pillows and other confectionary colors. Technophiles will enjoy the fingerprint scan that opens the door, as well as the Internet-equipped Sony Vaio computer serving triple duty as a flat-screen TV and CD/DVD player. (The hotel has no CD or DVD library yet.) Even the drinks have designer credibility: the minibar stocks Kronenbourg beer in bottles designed by Philippe Stark (7 euros).    THE BATHROOMS       You should get frequent-flier miles for using the toilets, which are crushed into gray windowless closets like those of an airplane. More accommodating are the deep Starck bathtubs.    AMENITIES       As befits this high-tech property, the exercise machines in the hotel's smallish fitness center have individual TV's, and the two meeting rooms are equipped with lots of audio-visual equipment.    ROOM SERVICE       The offerings, available 24 hours, are surprisingly old-school. Only 10 items were available on a recent visit. They included a cheese plate (15 euros), an assortment of cold meats (15 euros) and a serving of 12 oysters (12 euros).    THE BOTTOM LINE       Already a cult address among the Parisian in-crowd, the Kube is fun, funky and comfortable. Because of its distance from Paris's sightseeing and dining areas (which are accessible by Métro), the hotel is not geared toward first-time visitors wanting to be in the center of the action. Rather, this is a niche property seemingly aimed at those from the fashion-media-creative set who may want to explore a less-seen Paris.

The fearless comedian, singer, actress, fashion maven and queen of ambivalence is emotionally mercurial, to the point that you're not always sure when she's kidding and when she's not. Who else would think to perform a furious riot girl version of \\"The Ladies Who Lunch\\" in the same set with a San Francisco reverie that includes a homage to Sylvester, the disco drag queen? Shows are at 11 P.M. and 2 A.M., with doors opening at 9 P.M. Tickets are $40. STEPHEN HOLDEN Do the Hustle    France Joli, Martha Wash and Vicki Sue Robinson, Expo Nightclub, 124 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 819-0377. \\"Disco Space Odyssey\\" is the nostalgic name for an evening of dancing and music. The club plans to feature a 45-foot video screen showing the activities in Times Square and three performers associated with the golden age of disco. France Joli, who is to go on at 11:30 P.M., was a one-hit wonder with her lush, dreamy disco ballad, \\"Come to Me.\\" Martha Wash, who is to go on at 1 A.M. scored her biggest hit, the humorous disco-gospel anthem \\"It's Raining Men,\\" with her group, the Weather Girls. Vicki Sue Robinson, who is to go on at 2:30 A.M., had one of the first and toughest disco hits, \\"Turn the Beat Around,\\" which was recently rerecorded by Gloria Estefan. Doors open at 9 P.M.

The stars of this promising triple bill are the younger generation's leading torch-bearers for old-fashioned pop-soul romance. Boyz II Men, the Philadelphia quartet that has led the revival of post-doo-wop harmony-group singing, has sold more than six million copies of its second album. Its latest hit, \\"On Bended Knee,\\" with its lush vocal blend and ardent plaintiveness, is as delicious a piece of ear candy as the genre has produced. Show time is 8:30 P.M. Tickets are $50 and $35. S. H. Angelina Reaux    Angelina Reaux, Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 362-8719. One of the few opera singers with the ability to relax and stretch into vernacular music, Angelina Reaux is performing a program that juxtaposes Jerome Kern, Stephen Sondheim and Richard Rodgers with Poulenc, Satie and Britten. Ricky Ian Gordon is to accompany on piano. The evening is to begin at 8 P.M. with hors d'oeuvres and Champagne, with the concert at 9. Tickets are $50. S. H. Sanborn and Schuur    David Sanborn and Diane Schuur, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. The most popular saxophonist after Kenny G, David Sanborn makes appealingly soulful music that begins with a rhythm-and-blues base and ripples out to embrace elements of world music and jazz-fusion without settling into the snoozy formulas that have given electric jazz a bad name. Ms. Schuur is a technical powerhouse of a singer whose style suggests a more formalized Ella Fitzgerald inflected with Kate Smith's clangy brightness. The first seating, from 7 P.M. to 12:30 A.M., is $175 at tables and $90 at the bar. The second, from 1 A.M. on, is $100 at tables and $60 at the bar. S. H.

Starting at 9 P.M. on New Year's Eve, each of the three rooms atop the General Electric Building in Rockefeller Center will have its own year-end celebration. Like an apparition from a 1930's movie musical, Tommy Tune is to strut down the staircase of the Rainbow Room at 11 P.M. and perform with a swing band led by Michael Andrews. The evening, which includes dancing to Mr. Andrews's orchestra, includes a seven-course dinner and costs $375 a person, not including beverages, tax and gratuities. Down the hall at the Rainbow and Stars cabaret, Maureen McGovern, the most vocally disciplined and technically resourceful of New York cabaret singers, is to perform her new show, \\"My Reel Romance With the Movies,\\" a program of classic movie songs, at 11 P.M. High points are medleys of songs by Henry Mancini and Harold Arlen. The evening, which includes a seven-course dinner, costs $325 a person. In a more rock-and-roll vein, holding forth at the Rainbow Pavilion after 11 P.M. are to be the Impalas, the vocal group best remembered for its 1959 hit, \\"Sorry (I Ran All the Way Home).\\" Dance music is provided by Uptown, an eight-member jazz band. The evening includes a seven-course dinner and costs $325 a person. The Promenade Bar will be open from 9 P.M. on and costs $50 a person. At midnight, Rainbow's Fellini Fantasy Parade, a conga line, is to make its way across the complex. No matter which room you choose, the setting offers the essence of Manhattan glamour. S. H. Mary Cleere Haran    Mary Cleere Haran, Russian Tea Room, 150 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-0947. Mary Cleere Haran is something like a 90's Doris Day, but hipper and jazzier, with a feminist sensibility and an intellectual take on pop nostalgia. She is to perform her acclaimed show of 1950's movie songs, in which gorgeous renditions of songs like \\"An Affair to Remember\\" are accompanied by witty, sometimes barbed commentary on the Eisenhower era. Shows are at 9 and 11:30 P.M., and there are two dinner seatings, at 8 and 10:30 P.M. There is a $45 music cover charge and a $30 food and beverage minimum. S. H.

Four other rising comics are to join him on the bill: Jim David, Linda Smith, Greg Giraldo and John Henson. There are two shows: an 8 P.M. dinner package at $65 a person and a 10:30 P.M. countdown celebration (with dinner) for $110 a person. Reservations required. S. H.
