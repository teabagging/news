Since the Spanish-American War in 1898, the United States has increasingly sought to defend itself with military forces far from American shores.

Without hesitation, Mr. Clinton replied, \\"The short answer is yes.\\"\\n Well, maybe. Mr. Assad's record suggests that it is wise to be skeptical about his intentions. As in the bad old days when he was a Soviet client, he still engages in aggressive activities, aimed mostly at Israel, Turkey, Lebanon and the United States. They include the following:\\n * Building up Syrian unconventional military capabilities. Damascus now has thousands of chemical warheads, appears to be on the verge of putting anthrax agents into weapons and is starting nuclear research. Its Scud-C missiles from North Korea can reach most of Israel's population.\\n * Getting more involved in the drug trade. Top officials participate in trafficking drugs to the West, according to a 1992 Congressional report.\\n * Sponsoring Lebanese and Palestinian groups that attack Israelis as well as Palestinians who favor Yasir Arafat, and sponsoring the PKK, a Kurdish Marxist group, in its assaults on Turkey.\\n\\n* Nurturing an alliance with Iran. So close is this bond, the Syrians have distributed counterfeit U.S. currency produced in Iran, according to a report by the House Republican Research Committee.\\n In short, Mr. Assad's policies have made Syria one of the Middle East's rogue states, along with Libya, Iraq and Iran. No less important, Mr. Assad represses his own people with a harshness second only to Saddam Hussein's. But while Washington puts pressure on the other rogue states by working to isolate them, it woos Syria. Rather than isolating the regime, it has tried for years to bring Syria into the \\"family of nations.\\" Our diplomats hold out small bait to encourage cooperation","excerpt":"last month, for example, we permitted Syria to acquire American-made jets. Secretaries of State and other dignitaries regularly travel to Damascus, and now four U.S. Presidents have met with Mr. Assad. Our companies operate in Syria almost without restrictions.\\n Mr. Assad has avoided the harsh treatment dealt to Muammar el-Qaddafi, Saddam Hussein and Iran's mullahs because he's smarter than they are.

That is typical of the remarkable redevelopment of New England through a decade's growth in high technology and service industries.     There is no agreed-on definition of high-tech. Should, for example, the automobile industry be added in, since it employs large numbers of engineers? Still, a recent study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that under three definitions Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire ranked among the top six states in the proportion of high-tech workers.

Lesser presentation is worth seeing for its authentic glimpses of the primitive Laplanders eking out an existence beyond the Arctic Circle, never far from their life-giving reindeer herds.Mr. Host is supposed to have roamed northern Norway for nearly a year, shooting at random—and this, unfortunately, snows. It's a crime he didn't have the late Robert Flaherty at his side every minute.What lifts the picture out of the straight documentary category is a harmless little trumped-up romance involving two neighboring clans. Once the main business gets under way—the guided seasonal migration of a huge herd of reindeer to the coast—the footage takes on real pertinence, even as the camera strays in all directions. The rather graceless handling of one birth sequence, for instance—as a tiny reindeer comes to life on the trail—is typical.However, the English narration is competent, the color is quite attractive and the beguiling costumes and ancient customs of the hardy Laplanders come across absorbingly. One courtship sequence is charming. But it is the great mass of reindeer, thundering toward the grasslands, that dominates the picture. One shot of some 1,500 of them churning across a wide river is terrific.The picture isn't, by a long shot, but it's by no means a waste of anybody's time.

The National Tobacco Festival was killed in 1984 by its sponsor, the National Tobacco Council, as part of an effort to avoid public attention. When Richmond citizens wanted to revive the festival, \\"they didn't want us to use anything with the name tobacco in it,\\" says Dick McClure, an organizer of the festival's successor, the Southern States Autumn Harvest Grand Illuminated Parade.

The company, in Covent Garden, made a last-minute change in its plan for Verdi's opera ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' with the mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe in the role of Ulrica, a fortune teller. She had been ''blacked up,'' as it is known, for rehearsals, but when the opera opened on Thursday her skin was its natural white color. In its decision the company overruled the director, the Italian filmmaker Mario Martone, who was informed just hours before the curtain went up. His production of ''Un Ballo'' opened at Covent Garden earlier this year with another singer in black makeup. ''Blacking up'' has long been banished from theater and television in Britain but has remained common in opera, The Observer reported","excerpt":"last summer, controversy surrounded a production of Verdi's ''Otello'' at the Glyndebourne festival.    War Protester's Book       Cindy Sheehan, the California woman who drew wide news media attention for her 26-day protest camp last summer near President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex., has written a book that will be published tomorrow. ''Not One More Mother's Child,'' issued by a new publisher, Koa Books of Hawaii, contains journal entries, speeches, letters and new writings, The Associated Press reported. Koa has printed 20,000 copies so far and paid Ms. Sheehan a ''modest'' advance; she said she had accepted the company's offer because she didn't care about the money and wanted the book printed quickly. Ms. Sheehan's son, Specialist Casey A. Sheehan of the Army, was killed in Iraq in April 2004.    On Broadway       Phylicia Rashad will play the title role in a new musical by Michael John LaChiusa at the Lincoln Center Theater. ''Bernarda Alba,'' an adaptation of the Federico García Lorca play ''The House of Bernarda Alba,'' about a newly widowed mother's struggle with her daughters, is to begin previews on Feb. 11 and open on March 6. Gracile Daniele will direct and choreograph, and the show will also feature Nikki M. James, Sally Murphy, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Saundra Santiago as the daughters. Ms. Rashad won a Tony Award for ''A Raisin in the Sun'' last year.  Jonathan Pryce will return to Broadway for the first time in nearly 15 years to replace John Lithgow as Lawrence Jameson, the con man in ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' He will start on Jan. 17. Mr. Pryce has won two Tonys, for ''Miss Saigon'' in 1991 and ''Comedians,'' his Broadway debut, in 1977. The show is at the Imperial Theater on West 45th Street.    Baltimore Museum to Grow       The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, where space has already become cramped since a renovation was completed four years ago, has signed a contract to purchase a nearby building from the Maryland Historical Society. The three-story, 36,000-square-foot building, on Centre Street a block west of the Walters, now houses the Contemporary Museum, offices of the Maryland Humanities Council and storage for the historical society. It is to be bought for $1.5 million, which was contributed from a museum donor, and the sale is to be closed by the end of the year.    Casting Call       David Bowie, below, is in talks to play the inventor Nikola Tesla in a new thriller from Christopher Nolan, who directed ''Batman Begins'' and ''Memento,'' according to The Hollywood Reporter. The film, ''The Prestige,'' based on the 1995 novel of that name by Christopher Priest, is a tale of rival magicians in early 20th-century London; the Tesla character is based on the real-life Serbian-American scientist who discovered the rotating magnetic field. The cast already includes Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine, and shooting is scheduled to begin in January.    Musical Chairs       The conductor of the Tehran Symphony Orchestra, Ali Rabari, quit the orchestra and left Tehran for Vienna on Saturday, according to the Mehr news agency of Iran. He said he would not return unless all the musicians of the Tehran orchestra gain their rights and get appropriate salaries. ''I cannot bear this situation when I see a good musician of this group gets paid 800,000 rials a month,'' he told a crowd at a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in Tehran on Friday, citing a figure worth about $90.

In 1992, its guitarist, Stefanie Sargent, died of a heroin overdose","excerpt":"last summer, one of its friends and label mates, Mia Zapata, the lead singer of the Gits, was abducted and murdered. The female quartet's first album, \\"Sick 'Em,\\" is dedicated to Ms. Sargent; its second, \\"Viva Zapata!\\" (C/Z), is dedicated to Ms. Zapata. With the recent death of another friend, Kristen Pfaff, the bassist in Courtney Love's band, Hole, it seems as if the group could spend the rest of its career dedicating albums to absent friends.   Understandably, when the band performed on Saturday night at CBGB, its rock-and-roll was forged from anger and hate, and delivered in the form of threats and accusations. It played dirty, funky heavy metal anchored in the big, sinewy bass lines of Elizabeth Davis, who writes most of the band's music. Selene Vigil's vocals were screamed instead of sung. When she injected the line \\"Twinkle, twinkle little star, sometimes I wonder who you are\\" into one verse, it came more from the point of view of a bitter, abandoned adult than that of a child in awe of the mysteries of the universe.

A1    Curbing Mideast Violence  Israeli and Palestinian leaders took their first promised steps to avert further violence.

The building is the Reichstag, which has stood for a century at the heart of German politics and is to resume its traditional role as seat of Germany's parliament by the end of the decade. The artist is Christo, famous for wrapping Florida islands in pink plastic","excerpt":"late last month, after a 22-year quest, he won permission to wrap the Reichstag in a million square feet of silver fiber for two weeks next year, as a symbol of the passing of one era and the beginning of another.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and some other Germans hate the idea, but the legislators who approved it have more in mind than attracting attention (and tourists) to Berlin: They hope for a kind of exorcism of ghosts, knowing that this building, which carries the name of Germany's first national parliament, symbolizes like no other the heights and depths of Germany history.   Above the Reichstag's main portal are the chiseled words, \\"To the German People.\\" The inscription is apt. In the decades following its completion in 1894, the building was the scene of tumultuous debates that led to the birth and later the death of German democracy. Set afire in 1933 by an arsonist or arsonists, captured in 1945 by Soviet soldiers, left eerily empty for years afterward and now being rebuilt to house another freely elected Parliament, it embodies the hopes and fears of a nation that has never fully come to terms with itself.   The debate about its immediate future is an example. When Parliament voted in 1991 to move itself and the executive branch from Bonn, it was fulfilling a pledge that West German leaders had been repeating for decades: Once Germany was unified, Berlin would resume its historic role as the nation's capital. But for a determined band of politicians and bureaucrats from western Germany, the idea of moving 350 miles east -- from near the Dutch border to an hour's drive from Poland -- remains unthinkable, and they have been using every available means to delay the move. Supporters of the move admit that they want not just a geographical change, but also a political and psychological one.   The need to erect the building in the first place stemmed from just such a psychological shift, the first unification of Germany and the creation of a national parliament in 1871. After much debate, a design by the Frankfurt architect Paul Wallot was chosen, though it was later revised. The building became one of the most imposing in Central Europe, its main facade the length of one and a half football fields, its style Italian Renaissance sprinkled with Victorian ornamentation.    Germany's first Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, who viewed parliaments as nuisances, generally stayed away. But the legislators grew more assertive. Late in 1918, as Germany faced military defeat, crowds gathered outside the Reichstag, sensing that history would soon be made. They were rewarded on Nov. 9, when a leading Social Democrat, Philipp Scheidemann, appeared at a second-floor window and proclaimed the death of the monarchy and the birth of a republic.  A Doomed Democracy    Street fighting flared in the following months, and rather than convene in the Reichstag to write a new constitution, legislators moved temporarily to peaceful Weimar, a cradle of German culture that had nurtured Goethe, Schiller and Liszt.   During the 1920's, the political splintering that ultimately doomed the Weimar republic was clearly visible in the Reichstag. Dozens of parties vied for power and many citizens became so fed up with the squabbling that they felt relieved when Hitler, who promised order, was named chancellor in January 1933. The next month, on the night of Feb. 27, the Reichstag was enveloped in flames. A Dutch Communist was executed, though suspicions that Nazis planned the fire persist to this day.   More important than the fire itself was Hitler's reaction. He imposed repressive laws under which he arrested tens of thousands of opponents, closed anti-Nazi newspapers and banned opposition parties, thus consolidating his dictatorship. The gutted Reichstag stayed empty, but the Fuhrer resisted a suggestion from his favorite architect, Albert Speer, to tear it down.   Soviet troops, who treated the Reichstag as the supreme symbol of German unity and power even though it had been an empty shell under Hitler, were jubilant when they finally captured it in April 1945. A photo of the hammer-and-sickle banner flying over its battered facade was one of the most vivid images of the war. Two years later, with Berlin under occupation, the Soviets sought to have the building demolished, but failed because it lay in what became West Berlin.   In the postwar years, the bombed-out land around the Reichstag became a center for the black market, and reconstruction did not begin until the 1960's. By then, the building lay just a few yards west of the Berlin wall. It was used for low-level political meetings, and since 1971 for an exhibition called \\"Questions of German History.\\"   East and West Germany were finally reunited at midnight on Oct. 3, 1990, and it was natural that the center of festivities be the plaza that stretches from the Reichstag to the nearby Brandenburg Gate.    Last month, the Reichstag was again the subject of heated debate as Parliament considered Christo's proposal to wrap it. Ultimately, it was approved over Chancellor Kohl's objections -- in the hope that when the fabric is removed, the building will re-emerge not only as the center of a modern new Government complex, but as a symbol of Germany's long-thwarted desire to build a united, peaceful and stable democracy.

The occasion is mainly nostalgic, for Raimu, the star, is now dead and this film, along with the others, was made in France many years ago. It treats on a world and on peoples which are plainly and perceptibly pre-war. And it will most likely be appreciated only by those who have seen the previous films.Folks who attended those others will recall the embarrassing plight of Fanny, the pint-sized fishmonger, when Marius, her lover, went away and left her not only broken-hearted but about to bear his child. Particularly, they will remember the outrage and anguis of Cesar, Marius' bar-tending father, and how he helped Fanny marry old Panisse. Fondly they'llturn their recollections to the milieu and atmosphere, to the gusto and understanding of Pagnol's rich comedy.And it is mainly those folks who will follow with affection and concern this final report on the destinies of Fanny, Marius, Panisse and Cesar. For the simple fact is that this story of the way in which Fanny's grown-up son is reconciled to the knowledge of his father, after the death of Panisse, is rather slow, diffuse and neglectful of the more amusing reactions of Cesar.True, there are lovely scenes in it in which Raimu, playing Cesar, expands and expounds upon matters with the explosive velocity of a bursting tire. His discourse on meeting one's Maker, while Panisse is dying upstairs, is one of the most amusing yet touching cries at death we've ever heard. And his one or two blasts at his cronies, who seem to take delight in his abuse, have all the familiar adornments of hands and shoulders that were mastered by Raimu.But, most of the time, he is silent—or not even to be seen—while the problem of Fanny's distraught youngster is tediously discussed. And this problem, for all its human aspects, is a little hard to take at the length and repeated argumentation that have been devoted to it. Occasionly glints of Gallic nature, glowing with humor and wit, pop out of it at odd moments, but for the most part it's rather dull.Orane Demazis, the Fanny of the two previous films, is still the same—a curiously mousey little creature with an amazing vitality. And Pierre Fresnay plays Marius, her long-lost lover, in the same old casual way, while Charpin is delicate and touching in his one brief death-bed scene. Andre Fouche's performance as Fanny's indignant son is a little too pallid and monotonous, but the old cast of cronies is superb.Adequate English subtitles translate the rich dialogue.

The first of these was \\"The Titan—the Story of Michelangelo,\\" a comprehension of that great artist's impulse, told through his works, which was offered here two years, ago. The second is \\"St. Matthew Passion,\\" a film that quite simply combines a display (in black and white) of sacred paintings with music from the oratorio, \\"The Passion According to Saint Matthew,\\" of Johann Sebastian Bach. This latter film was presented yesterday for a limited engagement at the Park Avenue.With all due respect for the enthusiasm of Mr. Flaherty for this film—and, of course, for the classic contributions of the individual artists represented in the work— it must be said that the offering, which runs for an hour and twenty minutes on the Park Avenue's screen, is more formidable as a musical recording than as a piece of motion-picture art.Bach's majestic oratorio is beautifully played and sung by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Vienna (where the picture was made) and by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Elisabeth Hoengen, Karl Schmitt Walter, Walter Ludwig and Hans Braun, assisted by the Viennese Singverein and the Vienna Choir Boys. Indeed, the whole musical production, under the direction of Herbert von Karajan, strikes the ear of this reviewer as a top achievement of eloquence and reverence in the musical line.But the visual component of the offering is literally nothing more than a succession of photographed details from sacred paintings in museums abroad, selected and arranged to illustrate the sacred story of Christ's last passion the music tells. The details are taken from paintings by Da Vinci, Masaccio, Caravaggio, Van Eyck, Velasquez, Cranach, Hieronymus Bosch, Titian and many more, and individually they have the serene beauty and distinction of the originals. However, the montage of these details, slowly and solemnly paced, achieves little or no sense of dramatic movement. Virtually the same thing, could have been done with slides, synchronized to the music—acknowledged as a graphic but static device.The consequence is that \\"St. Matthew Passion,\\" while it is an impressive thing to the ear, is a slow and eventually monotonous—or even tedious—offering to the eye. Unlike \\"The Titan—the Story of Michelangelo,\\" it is without true dynamic quality and represents no achievement hi the creative use of the screen.
