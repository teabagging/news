In most ways, Graham McCann's well-researched CARY GRANT: A Class Apart (Columbia University, $24.95) does, and gratifyingly well. Grant's 72 movies illuminate the delectable, self-made style that was his and his alone. ''Nobody talked like that,'' Mr. McCann writes, ''not even Archie Leach in earlier years.'' Archibald Alexander Leach, born in Bristol, England, on Jan. 18, 1904, was a child for whom the good times ended early: one day the 9-year-old boy came home to find his beloved mother gone. His alcoholic father, a tailor's presser, had secretly committed her to a local asylum. Elsie Leach languished in the filthy, negligibly supervised asylum for nearly 25 years. It wasn't until her husband died that her son, by then 32 years old and a movie star, was alerted to her existence. Grant, a reserved, hard-working perfectionist who easily won the love and respect of friends and colleagues, lived by his own credo that ''it takes 500 small details to add up to one favorable impression,'' and was apparently no picnic for wives and lovers, who ultimately discovered the devil in his details. But at least three women in his life found him just perfect: his mother, to whom Grant was devoted after their reunion until she died in 1973, shortly before her 96th birthday","excerpt":"Jennifer Grant, his daughter; and his fifth wife, Barbara Harris. For the rest of the world, as the critic Pauline Kael noted, ''It makes us happy just to look at him.'' There are pictures galore in Geoffrey Wansell's CARY GRANT: Dark Angel (Arcade, $29.95), but the text is superficial. Mr. Wansell faults his 1984 biography of Grant, ''Haunted Idol,'' because ''it brought the dark side of his character to life, certainly, but did not quite balance it with proper tribute to his incandescent screen presence.'' Perhaps a third one will be the charm.

Serge Diaghilev, the artistic director of and the guiding genius behind the Ballets Russes, which is in the process of revolutionizing the dance world, has just learned that Vaslav Nijinsky, his principal male dancer and choreographer as well as his lover, has married Romola De Pulsky, a rich young Hungarian woman with a will of steel.Diaghilev is outraged. Nijinsky, he swears, will never again dance with the Ballets Russes. Later he becomes even nastier. He insists that neither Nijinsky nor Romola ever attempt to get in touch with him. Vassily Zuikov, Diaghilev's faithful old valet, feels compelled to speak up.\\"Serge,\\" Vassily says to Diaghilev, \\"can't you just this once listen to your heart?\\"This advice, which occurs toward the end of Herbert Ross's new film, \\"Nijinsky,\\" and which, of course, goes unheeded, pretty much defines the emotional level on which this handsome, squashily romantic movie operates most of the time.It reduces personalities of great complexity and fearful contradictions to the dimensions of people who, crazily, refuse to listen to their hearts.It's also the kind of movie that takes us to Igor Stravinsky's music room in Switzerland where we hear Igor playing something familar on the piano. \\"Tell me, Igor,\\" says a thoughtful Diaghilev, \\"what are you going to call it? \\" \\"The Princess,\\" says Igor, \\"suggests 'Le Sacre du Printemps.'\\"\\"Nijinsky\\" is full of such thunderclaps of recognition but I can't help but suspect that Mr. Ross, the director of such considerable popular successes as \\"The Goodbye Girl\\" and \\"California Suite,\\" knows exactly what he's doing. If you're going to make a big commercial movie about Nijinsky, you better stick to terms that can be understood by even the dimmest member of the audience, someone who still thinks of ballet as a lot of odd people wearing tights and tutus and clomping around on their toes.With \\"Nijinsky\\" Mr. Ross, himself a choreographer, reaffirms the reputation he won with \\"The Turning Point\\" as the great popularizer of ballet. However, it's a reputation that's been gained at some cost, even, it seems, at the cost of ballet. I didn't have a stopwatch with me when I saw \\"Nijinsky\\" but I have the impression that there is far less ballet in it than there was in \\"The Turning Point.\\" Perhaps it only seems that way.\\"Nijinsky,\\" which was written by Hugh Wheeler, who's done much better things, including \\"A Little Night Music,\\" is a mostly unexplored, three-sided love story dominated by the visionary, astonishing personality of Diaghilev (Alan Bates). At the start of the film, which covers the years 1912 and 1913, the young Nijinsky (George de la Peña) is at the height of his fame as a dancer. He is about to become a controversial choreographer and he is, seemingly, blissfully happy with Diaghilev, who is his father, mother, teacher and artistic conscience as well as his lover.It is the movie's contention that Nijinsky, none too stable anyway and believing that he has been abandoned by Diaghilev, allows himself to be seduced by Romola (Leslie Browne) and to marry her, which leads directly to his madness.The way the movie ends — with a shot of Nijinsky, in a straitjacket, staring into space — one would assume that his life virtually ended in 1913, though he later did go on to choreograph another ballet for Diaghilev and to father two daughters by Romola.Facts are not the problem with \\"Nijinsky,\\" though. The problem is a sort of insistent superficiality that is most apparent in the writing and in the performances of Mr. de la Peña and Miss Browne.Though he has dark good looks and a dancer's fine, lean physique, Mr. de la Peña has no appreciable presence as an actor on the screen. In his heavy ballet makeup, he tends to disappear so completely that one fails to recognize not only the character and the dancer, but also the actor, which leaves a certain number of holes in the picture. It may be that the very qualities that have earned Mr. de la Peña acclaim as a dancing actor on the stage work against him on film.We don't even see that much of his dancing in \\"Nijinsky,\\" certainly nothing to compare with the exhilarating way in which Mr. Ross presented Mikhail Baryshnikov in \\"The Turning Point.\\" There are bits and pieces of a number of ballets in \\"Nijinsky\\" but only three — \\"The Spectre of the Rose,\\" \\"Afternoon of a Faun\\" and \\"Games\\" — are more than mere excerpts.Miss Browne brings no particular life to an impossible role that does not allow her to dance at all. What is intended to be Romola's forceful, obsessed personality looks to be ordinary stubbornness. Though I assume her character is meant to change within the film, Miss Browne doesn't, only her costumes do.Without a riveting Nijinsky and Romola, any movie titled \\"Nijinsky\\" is in trouble. This one is lucky to have Mr. Bates carrying on in high style as the great Diaghilev. He's a witty, intelligent actor whose presence is felt even when he is off the screen. There are also a number of good subsidiary performances, including those by Alan Badel, who appears as the effete, sympathetic Baron de Gunzburg, the man who bankrolled the Ballets Russes","excerpt":"Jeremy Irons as the choreographer Fokine and Carla Fracci as Karsavina, Nijinsky's dance partner.The movie, which was photographed by Douglas Slocombe, looks terrific. Mr. Ross appears to have listened to his heart and not his head when it came to spending money on locations around Europe and on his pre-World War I sets, as well as on ballet sets said to be based on the Ballets Russes originals.\\"Nijinsky,\\" which opens today at the Coronet Theater, is an opulent movie but a largely untenanted one.

Their efforts are commendable even If they are not entirely in keeping with some American, emotional standards.The small but thoroughly professional cast—including a trio of engaging youngsters—tussles with a sad but familiar problem and arrives at an expected answer. If there are but a few fireworks in what should have been an extremely volatile set of circumstances, the principals do manage to extract the basic poignancy and potential destructive effect of divorce from them.Warren Chetham-Strode and Don Sharp, who adapted Mr. Chetham-Strode's play to the screen, are not involving their players in purple passages or embarrassing situations. Barbie Lomax and her lawyer-husband John have been married for sixteen years, the last two of which have seen the seemingly strong edifice they had built begin to crumble under the effects of constant bickering. When the final decision to part is made, it is not because of another man, although Bill Ogden, a friend of the couple, already has declared his love for Mrs. Lomax. Although there is no tawdry specter of backstreet amour here, there are hurdles to be faced by the resolute pair.Informing their children—a scene, incidentally, which is uncommonly tender—is a major task, but one which is accomplished with understanding and compassion. The children, however, are another matter. This shocking revelation has varying results. \\"It is simple to us but not simple to them,\\" their mother says, underestimating her youngest daughter's plaintive question, \\"but where will be our home?\\" and the effects on her son and older daughter. The children, as may be guessed, eventually assure the happy ending toward which this sentimental journey is inevitably headed.The children, it should be added, contribute the acting highlights to the drama. Sensitivity of direction and performance is evident in the portrayals of Mandy Miller (seen here in the fine English drama \\"Crash of Silence\\") as the pitifully disturbed youngster of the moppets","excerpt":"Jeremy Spenser as the son who is childishly ready to commit murder to preserve the family and Janette Scott, the teen-age daughter, who selfishly regards the affair as a new and happy adventure.Although she suffers and yearns in standard fashion, Valerie Hobson's characterization of the mother is competently turned. Philip Friend's delineation of her husband is a mite stiff and austere. Norman Wooland genially plays the other man and Lilly Kann does well by the role of the solicitous family retainer.

He graduated New York University Law School in 1928 and began practicing law. He started his law career at Pines and Sterling, a leading firm in Peekskill, where his starting salary was $5 per week. He practiced until 1970 when he formed a partnership, Hersh and Hersh P.C., with his sons, which is still carried on by his son, Robert, at the old County Trust Bank Building located on Central Avenue in Peekskill. Never afraid of hard work, Ben was at the office every day well past his 90th birthday. An accomplished attorney, Ben was at times, Counsel to Peekskill Hospital, Counsel to the Mohegan Fire District, and Counsel to Caring for the Homeless of Peekskill. He served as Special Counsel to the Town of Cortlandt and was a Trustee of The Security Title Company. He served a term as director of the YWCA, although, as he put it, he was neither young, nor a woman, nor Christian. In the sixties, he served as closing attorney for Chase Manhattan Bank. During the term of Peekskill mayor Michael J. Dibart, Ben served as Prosecutor for the City of Peekskill. He was also elected to the Board of Directors for the Westchester County National Bank. While still a student at Columbia Law School, Governor George Pataki clerked for Ben Hersh and got his first experience in the practice of law. Ben was a longtime friend of the Pataki family, and represented the Governor's father, and grandfather. Two of his siblings followed Ben into the practice of law","excerpt":"Jerome and Frederick. So did his two sons, Robert and Philip as well as three of his nephews, Eric, John, and Scot. All continue to practice on the same street in Peekskill, except for Eric who is deceased. The legacy of attorneys seems to be continuing as Ben's granddaughter, Sarah, graduated Denver Law School in May 2005. An active member of the First Hebrew Congregation, Ben Hersh served three terms as president. As Chairman of the Building Committee, he was instrumental in the property acquisition and construction of the First Hebrew's Rt. 6 Building in Peekskill. He was the beloved husband of Anita Joseph for 58 years. Devoted father to Philip and Robert and cherished grandfather of Jenn, Sarah, Vicki, Jeff, Zack and Becky. He was the devoted father-in-law to Patrice; brother to Esther, Fredrick and Jerome, uncle to Scot, John, Richard, Anne, Todd, Baron, Miriam, and Nicole. A service was held at the First Hebrew Congregation on Monday morning. 350 people attended. In lieu of flowers, the family has suggested donations to the First Hebrew Congregation of Peekskill.

It has the same virtue of richness in simplicity. It has, like the earlier ballet of 1953, a score by Debussy. Now, too, the ballet poetically implies a subtext that stems directly from Debussy's own inspirations - which were the poems of French writers he admired. Moreover, the poetry in each case found its theme in the mythology of Ancient Greece.     Nonetheless, ''Antique Epigraphs'' comes across as a startingly fresh experience. It suggests, as it were, Mr. Robbins's own inventions - as if he had originated Greek friezes and archaic sculpture on his own. Whatever it was that Keats said about Grecian urns, holds true in this case. ''Antique Epigraphs'' is a thing of beauty - a term not always associated with the occasional turbulence of Robbins ballets - and it is certain to be a joy for many a season.    The literary associations shared by ''Antique Epigraphs'' and ''Afternoon of a Faun'' should not be considered irrelevant but they are not found within the new ballet itself. This is because ''Antique Epigraphs'' has a style of its own. And while Mr. Robbins has worked with simplicity and stillness before, ''Antique Epigraphs'' hones these qualities to an organic perfection that is newly impressive.

Mashaw and Philip L. Harvey. (Basic, $22.95.) The misunderstanding is simple, persistent and discouragingly familiar: this country's welfare system is a mess, an incoherent jumble of programs that are undesirable, unaffordable and ungovernable. But the reputation is unearned, and \\"America's Misunderstood Welfare State\\" explains why. The authors -- Theodore R. Marmor, a professor of public policy and management at Yale University","excerpt":"Jerry L. Mashaw, a law professor at Yale, and Philip L. Harvey, a New York lawyer -- blame what they call \\"undisciplined rhetoric\\" in part for the problem. For example, Americans expect a program extravagantly labeled a War on Poverty to end poverty. That the poor are still with us is taken as a failure not just of particular programs but of welfare itself. The authors point out that although Aid to Families With Dependent Children has become synonymous with welfare in public discourse, \\n\\nmost \\n\\nwelfare spending goes either to elderly recipients of Social Security or to people who are not expected to work, such as the disabled, and both these programs have long been supported by the American public. The 50-year history of social insurance, the authors argue, shows that the welfare system was neither designed nor funded to end poverty, but rather to reduce and to alleviate it. Measured thus, programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security have succeeded in keeping millions out of poverty. As \\"America's Misunderstood Welfare State\\" makes clear, failure to acknowledge these successes draws energy, talent and support away from genuine welfare reform. Worse, inaccurate but fashionable talk about welfare as a \\"mess\\" and a \\"crisis\\" blames the poor, scares the elderly and replaces such economic security as they have with unnecessary and demeaning anxiety.
