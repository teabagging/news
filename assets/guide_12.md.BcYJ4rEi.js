Giuliani's mayoral campaign, the Republicans were leading in a contest in the Rockaways, where Alphonso C. Stabile appeared to be on the verge of defeating the Council's most senior Democrat, Walter Ward, who has served for 25 years. Mr. Stabile led Mr. Ward 53 percent to 47 percent with 70 percent of the vote counted. On the East Side of Manhattan, the outcome of another hotly contested race remained uncertain, with the Republican incumbent, Andrew S. Eristoff, and the Democratic challenger, Jane R.

Andre Le Vot wants to lift Fitzgerald out of the too narrow context of American literature and make him international, French in particular, since ''he was one of the very rare Americans able to speak convincingly of women and love'' (not often convincingly, to my ears) and since he gave primary importance to the ''Flaubertian tradition, to problems of structure and the artfulness of writing'' (even with ''Gatsby'' as evidence I find it hard to think of Fitzgerald as Flaubertian).   There follows an ambiguous reference to the ''sexual uneasiness'' of this writer on women and love, as a man who was drawn to ''assertive'' personalities like Hemingway and Gerald Murphy, and ''around whom may hover an air of unconfessed homosexuality.'' May it? Who is perhaps not confessing, and where is the homosexuality hovering, or did the translator have a problem with Mr. Le Vot's French?

Cortina is a people-watching place. Discovered in the 1930's by a member of the Rothschild family sent there to convalesce, it is still today the chic place in Italy to go skiing.

This preoccupation is not usually patriotic","excerpt":"indeed it has nothing much to do with a country at all. America, in this context, is not a place or a nation but a condition of the soul tied to a habit of the possession of power.   Don DeLillo's first novel was called ''Americana.'' ''The Names,'' his seventh, is a dense, brilliant, ultimately rather elusive meditation on the relation of this half-mythological America to the historical world. A series of discreet markers gives us the time: ''This summer ... was the period after the Shah left Iran, before the hostages were taken.'' The principal settings of ''The Names'' are Greece and India, but the Americans in this novel mainly live in their own time and place, a sealed compartment, a subculture. They are executives of banks and insurance companies; they live in Athens, have lived in Teheran, Beirut, Cairo, Cyprus. They travel constantly to Turkey, Kuwait, Pakistan, Jordan, Zaire. ''It is like the Empire,'' one of them says. ''Opportunity, adventure, sunsets, dusty death.'' It is like tourism, another says: ''Errors and failings don't cling to you the way they do back home.''

Back in the house, I would peel away its outer sections -- the dread, perplexing news, the regimental financial tables -- to unfold the Magazine, so cold and flattened there in the middle that it hardly opened: the innermost bud. At once, I turned within it to the crossword, which was as yet promising and unfulfilled, like the day. For a boy from the suburbs of Philadelphia, the puzzle suggested the warrenlike mystery of New York City itself: a huge apartment block of tiny, numbered rooms, each with a uniquely apt, but missing, occupant.

Dupont is one of the most off-and-on quantities in the international film world. His early career in German films was not very stirring","excerpt":"indeed, he was responsible for some pretty awful silents in inflation days, when every assistant director and property man got a chance to make \\"superproductions.\\" And then out of a clear sky came \\"Variety,\\" about which I do not have to tell you. And then an uncompleted American picture which is said to have been rather peculiarly appalling. And then a couple of moderately interesting silents made in England. And then \\"Atlantic,\\" successful here because it was the first 100 per cent German dialogue film; however, the two English-made talkers which followed it were not more than so-so, even from the business viewpoint. That is the evidence—what do you make of it?Dupont's last picture, \\"Salto Mortale,\\" which had its première at the Atrium this week, answers the Dupont riddle quite explicitly. It contains most of his faults and virtues in well equalized balance. First of all, it is clear that Dupont is one of those directors who consider their scenarios of comparative unimportance. For him the script is merely something to embroider upon. Consistent character development and concentrated building of the plot to achieve climax are neglected in favor of directorial subtleties and diversions. But it must be said that he now achieves with real mastery the effects he seeks. There are photographic ideas in this picture that have certainly never been surpassed, even in silent days. And there is no denying that there are few dull moments. For all his willingness he remains a director whose films are usually as stimulating as they sometimes are boresome—and that is saying a good deal.A Circus Affair.The fable of the present work is the usual circus affair, of the formula of \\"Variety\\" and \\"The Four Devils.\\" The hero and heroine are up on a trapeze with the \\"menace\\" stationed at a lever which, if it is set in motion too late, will mean the probable death of both. And this villain is jealous of the pair, one of whom is his wife and the other his best friend. However, it is distinctly to Dupont's credit that he has made these figures human, especially the villain, who is more loud-mouthed than actually bad-hearted. Reinhold Berndt, who plays this role, also gave by far the best performance of the evening—despite his bragging and general nastiness he still remains sympathetic. I should say that Berndt was a new and rather useful type for the film, a somewhat less powerful edition of Lon Chaney, but with considerably better comedy and more of a real person. The Russian film actress, Anna Sten, who did well in \\"Karamasof,\\" and Adolph Wohlbrück were not so successful with the considerably less colorful rôles at the other corners of the triangle.Gustav Ucicky, the Ufa director, is also a problematical figure—not so much on account of his actual directorial work but because he, a Czechoslovakian, is becoming a specialist for German nationalistic pictures. Last year the Ufa assigned him \\"The Flute Concert of Sans-Souci,\\" an opus about Frederick the Great which closed with an encouragement to the German people to start immediate war on the Allies. And now he has opened the Ufa's Fall season with \\"In Geheimdienst\\" (In the Employ of the Secret Service) at the Ufa Palast. This otherwise conventional spy picture has a prologue in which the Reichskanzler Bethmann-Hollweg reads to the Reichstag the German peace proposals which were made in the Winter of 1916. The full text, however, is not given—you probably will recall that Germany proposed to annex almost everything that was lying around loose. At the close the Reichskanzler remarks that if the Allies do not accept this offer the responsibility for the continuation of the war will be on their shoulders. And then we see the Prime Ministers of all the allied countries turning down the proposal—and the war goes on. It seems to me that one could safely say that this sequence was slightly tinctured with propaganda.Spies in Russia.The main part of the picture is a spy story along the lines laid down by Oppenheim & Co. A young German gets into Russia under the pretense of being an American violinist. He enlists the services of a German girl, the wife of a big Russian General, and by putting a dictaphone in a reading lamp in her sitting room tries to overhear the plans for the Russian Spring offensive. But this to unsuccessful and he persuades the wife to steal a document containing the information he needs. The husband discovers the loss and changes the paper before it can get into the German's hand. So the spy sends false information to his government. Then he is arrested, but manages to escape. And the two meet in Copenhagen, to which city the big-hearted Russian has allowed his German wife to escape.This is all gorgeously photographed by Carl Hoffmann, and well, if a trifle solemnly, played by a cast which included Willi Fritsch as the German spy, Oskar Homolka as the Russian General and Theodore Loos as a Russian nihilist who is helping the Germans. Only Brigitte Helm as the wife seems badly miscast. This young lady, whom you may remember from \\"Metropolis,\\" is 'on the wrong track. In roles where she can bring her heavy sensuality into play she is intriguingly Teutonic. But here, where she tries to be wistful and pathetic, she only resembles a poor little cow looking for its stable.But the director, Gerhardt Lamprecht, is no problem at all. For years he has been turning out innumerable films laid in the tenement milieu and usually strongly colored with the fruity Berlin dialect. When I have happened into one of them I have always left the theatre in a state of considerable depression—and this was not engendered by the squalidneas of the atmosphere, but by the general mediocrity of Lamprecht's direction.His latest, \\"Zwischen Nacht und Morgen\\" (Between Night and Dawn), playing at the Titania Palast, is no exception to that rule. And what makes it doubly annoying is that it is founded on the same scenario which lay behind \\"Dirnentragödie\\" (A Prostitute's Tragedy), one of the best films of silent days. Then Asta Nielsen, that unforgotten luminary of the film's youth, made a real masterpiece out of the leading rôle, that of an aging street-walker. But instead of recasting her for the part in the talker version Aud Egede Nissen was selected. This Danish actress, who some years ago added considerable charm and beauty to many silents, showed that the exacting emotional demands of the rôle were far out of her reach. She merely fluctuated between forced coquetry and even more artificial melodrama. Only Oskar Homolka caught the quality which the whole production should have had. His introspective brutality had a real flavor.Mr. Laemmle's Plans.IN reporting recently the plans of the American film producers in Germany for the coming season I left out the firm which has laid out the most elaborate program. This was Universal Pictures, which had kept its announcements back, saving them until they were entirely ripe. Carl Laemmle, himself of German extraction, spent some time at Carlsbad and has been in very close touch with the German industry. Under the supervision of Joe Pasternack and Julius Burnheim, who have just arrived from the West Coast, a very elaborate program is to be carried out.First of all, in affiliation with Tobis, the German sound patent holders, a series of six all-German talkers are to be made in Berlin. Here the Germans are to give their recording equipment, studios and a certain portion of the necessary financing, so that the sharing division will be approximately sixty to forty, with Universal carrying the larger share. This scheme, on which I reported last Spring as a possibility, seems to me to promise much—indeed, to be the most efficient way for Americans to produce in the Reich.Further, Harry Piel, Germany's best-liked stunt star, has been engaged for a series of three pictures. Piel has a big following which is as much enamored of his personality as of his way of climbing down the front of skyscrapers and boarding flying express trains. BERLIN SCREEN NOTES; A Circus Affair.

When it first appeared in translation in the United States, in 1953, this country's major literary critic, Edmund Wilson, declared that ''Malraux's history of art is not simply one of his best productions but perhaps one of the really great books of our time,'' and Joseph Frank pronounced it ''a towering achievement.''    Although many art historians disagreed with these glowing estimations of the value of the book, which weighed in with 638 illustrations from all over the world and every period of art, it certainly was one of the earliest ambitious accounts of the globalization of art and culture. Malraux found the similarities among themes, formal elements and expressive goals in artworks to be atemporal and unrelated to geographical location in a wide variety of media. He made his case through photography, which of course enabled this kind of global compare-and-contrast operation and, at the same time, eliminated the need for traditional museums where actual works were exhibited","excerpt":"indeed, one of the chapters was entitled ''Museum Without Walls.''

Richard Weichert, former general manager of the municipal theatre in Frankfort, is the artistic director of this Terra film. One senses from the very beginning the hand of a stage director with ideas, a stage director who knows how to handle actors.

One feels in many of the scenes the two personalities pulling against each other. Weichert is attempting to stylize, while Basch is always for solid, undiluted naturalism.

This piece is built around the entertaining idea of a waiter who changes his black tie for a white one with a guest at a ball who wants to escape in the guise of a waiter because the police are after him. For this service the crook gives Jean, the waiter, 1,000 marks and a raffle ticket, on which he wins a round trip to America. Mabel, an American millionairess, is at the ball and persuades Jean to take advantage of his prize and to visit her mother, the widow of a pork packer, in Florida. Before he sets out, Jean gives the 1,000 marks to Trude, his little Berlin sweetheart, and she uses the money to follow him to America in the steerage. On the way over she meets an old Berlin lawyer who is hunting for the heiress to a $40,000,000 fortune and who discovers that she is the very person he is looking for. An influential dry Senator comes to one of Mabel's parties and Jean remembers having served him at a fast party in Berlin. Through his resultant pull with the Senator Jean is a made man, and both Mabel and her mother are out to catch him. But Trude appears and, owing to her newly acquired fortune, is able to bid more for him than either of them. Jean knows nothing about this transaction, however, and, leaving all his financial chances behind him in America, sets out for Berlin and Trude. They are again on the same ship without knowing it, but this time he in the steerage, she in first class. When they get back to Berlin, they are, of course, reunited.In the leading rôles are Michael Bohnen, whom you may remember from the Metropolitan Opera; Olga Tschechowa as Mabel, looking younger and more charming every year; Trude Lieske as Trude, and Ralph Arthur Roberts as the lawyer.

Despite the fact that it was supervised by Erich Pommer, a leading figure in the German film world, it is pretty musty stuff. The story of the tenor who loses his voice is really due to be packed away with a healthy supply of mothballs. As might be expected, we were also treated to other dogeared scenes. And there is also a long-suffering wife who is splendid at forgiving and forgetting. To make sure that nothing was left out, in the sequence when he loses his voice Emil is made up as Pagliacci. Considering that he spent most of his time in his last picture, \\"The Blue Angel,\\" costumed in much the same fashion, that would seem to be a record in originality.And, then, I do not fancy Emil in anything that suggests a straight part. He is best when concealed behind a thick hirsute hedge, or at least playing a strongly characterized rôle. Here he bounces around too much of the time as the everyday Emil.Of course, the picture, under the direction of Hans Schwartz, has moments of amusing subtlety, and the women, Renate Müller and Olga Tschechowa, pleasantly fill in the edges left over by Jannings. But it is a real crime how little of that wonderful comedian, Hans Moser, gets onto the screen and through the loudspeaker.But I shall have to be frank and admit that the German audience does not at all agree with my estimate of these two films. They roared their enthusiasm for Jannings and \\"Darling of the Gods\\" will run along indefinitely. They took objection to some of the too heavy and serious scenes in \\"Two Neckties\\" and almost succeeded in booing it off the screen. It retired from the Universum after only three days. However much the audiences and the critics may cry for something new and original, they are not willing to make the slightest concessions for it. So that rift in the film heaven has closed right up again. The talker is just where it was.Subsidized Film Companies.THE German Government has sold the Emelka Film Company. Thus ends a period in German film history. For years the government has been directly or indirectly supporting the film industry, and it has not been any sort of a success. From now on the picture business will have to take care of itself.Shortly after the war the subsidization began with the Ufa. The Germans were so in the habit of supporting the theatre that it was easy to convince them that they had the same duty toward the art of the camera. But gradually the realization began to trickle through that pictures are something different again. The movie fan simply would not swallow the pabulum which was fed to him under the name of art. He attended only lighter or more sentimental fare. When the government finally managed to extricate itself its loss was considerable and it had accomplished next to nothing.But that lesson was not enough. A couple of years later the heads of the Reichswehr, the National Guard, sunk almost twenty million marks in the Phoebus Film Company as a return for the promise that this company would turn out films which would encourage the national military spirit. All the Phoebus really made was a couple of pictures so bad that they could not even be shown.But politicians are persevering and they just went right ahead. Last year the government bought a controlling interest in the Emelka, the second largest film company in Germany. The reason given for this by the Republican faction was that they wanted to keep the firm away from the Ufa, which is controlled by the conservative, reactionary Hugenberg interests. The Ufa owns a good percentage of the best first-run theatres, and if they added the Emelka's chain it would mean that they would have almost a monopoly of first-class theatres. The Republicans feared that this would mean a powerful weapon for propaganda against the existing government in the hands of the reactionaries. So they outbid the Ufa, paying a very fancy price for the controlling stock.But then the German prosperity bubble burst and the State was left high and dry with a tremendous deficit in its budget. They had no money to carry out the elaborate production plans which the director, Dupont, was to supervise. So they had to look around immediately for some one to take the Emelka off their hands—no matter at how big a loss. For producing under governmental control always means big losses: there are so many officials to take care of.The group that is now taking over the Emelka is headed by Krauss, who is the former director of the organization. And it is not at all sure that any of the original objects given for the acquisition of the firm will be achieved. In the first place, Krauss admits that there is a lot of French capital behind him. The French film millionaire Albert Cohan, representing Gaumont and Pathé, has his finger in the pie. This will probably mean that quite a number of German versions of French pictures will be shown in the Emelka theatres—and surely that was not what the government wanted. And then Krauss is quite frank in admitting that he has no hostility to the Ufa. He is going to work with them whenever he finds it advantageous. If he should find it very advantageous, it will probably mean that the Emelka theatres will be added to the Ufa chain.So that is the end of the subsidization of the moving picture industry in Germany. The government is walking hastily away, ruefully licking its burned fingers.Marlene Dietrich will leave Hollywood on Dec. 2 for New York, where she will take ship for Germany, to spend the Christmas holidays with relatives in Berlin.

New York has the glamour now, not Paris","excerpt":"indeed, the filming of the French capital in \\"The Inheritor,\\" which opened last night at the 68th St. Playhouse and the UA Eastside Cinema, tries to make their city look as much like ours as possible. Glass buildings, clamorous demolition and construction, cranes, chrome reflected in chrome: it's our shiniest surfaces that beguile some Europeans.You no longer hear them accusing us of forcing the most commercial aspects of our culture on them. Instead, they reproduce the trappings eagerly—in the name of the vitality we're said to have.Along with exultant shots of administrators striding through a factory, there are enthusiastic references to \\"la technique Kennedy,\\" and a Harvard degree is as flashy a product as the pocket calculators that the French tycoons brandish. Yet, one of the charms of this movie is that we can enjoy the borrowed slickness, because it has been romanticized by uncritical French eyes.No shabbiness here, no urban glut or rot, no apathy or fatigue; the American style projected by director Philippe Labro evokes a confident, glossy world of action where everything is new.This delightful thriller casts Jean-Paul Belmondo against type: as a businessman combatting the murderous intrigues of international financiers. (He's also supposed to have a radical concern for the rights of workers, but we can't believe that—since this is a hymn to capitalism.)Belmondo at 40, buttoned into an executive suit? Yet he's the same headlong ruffian we first saw in \\"Breathless,\\" and when he impatiently rips a Band-Aid off his bullet wound, the calculated incongruity of his role seems almost like a joke between him and the audience. And he still pulls down the corners of his mouth in the quick, disgusted smile that Bogart used.More than ever, we can see what he learned from (and loved in) Bogart's acting. But he's never been a mimic. Instead, a living talent has perpetuated certain qualities of a dead one, while continuing to flourish on his own.There's always that wide stripe of lunacy in Belmondo: the resilient clown prepared to be outrageous, ready to throw a stinkbomb or to provide pratfalls for others, and that trait has nothing to do with Bogart. But although we will see many apings of Belmondo, it's doubtful that anyone will catch the spark of Bogart preserved in him.Seduced by history, the director did make one slip: one of Belmondo's girlfriends (Maureen Kerwin) is made to imitate Lauren Bacall in \\"To Have and Have Not.\\" But she can't even inhale like Bacall, let alone touch her performance.However, I'll forgive anything for one detail in this picture: at the graveyard where Belmondo's father is being buried, a sinister figure appears with one hand sunk in the pocket of his trench coat. Moviegoers over 4 know what that means: there's a gun that's about to shoot. Then the hand pulls out . . . a package of cigarettes. (Again, the French learned that from us. The apparent assassin is revealed to be an investigative reporter, who soon displays the heroism inseparable from his profession.This exuberant entertainment has a silly, sham-tragic ending. But until then it throbs with the energy and the rueful gaiety that Belmondo brings to almost any part, and that's worth even the cost of tickets these days.

Therefore, courage is all the more praiseworthy, all the more deserving of encouragement.There has come to the Babylon Theatre here a picture called \\"Cyankali.\\" It is a European Fox Production, one that is based on the play of the same name by Dr. Friedrich Wolf. Were it to be judged by the ordinary standards, it more than likely would crumple away entirely. However, it does have courage; without the slightest compromise it boldly attacks the German penal code for its attitude on the subject of birth control.The theme of the picture concerns a young working girl whose prospective husband is out of a job because of a strike. He steals food for his girl, to keep her alive, but is captured and sent to prison. Refused aid by a physician, whose hands are bound by the law, the girl finally goes to an illegal practitioner whose methods cause her death.Grete Mosheim the Star.The film has had its first run at the Babylon, a newly opened theatre in the north of Berlin, where the workers live. Among that audience, any of whom might have been figures in the plot, one felt the reality with double force.

As they left the theatre at the end, their faces showed that the picture had been worth making.Grete Mosheim plays the leading feminine rôle in \\"Cyankali.\\" She has had the courage to use ugliness as a form of expression. An attractive young girl, capable of the most charming comedy, she has been willing to sacrifice her beauty in order to wring the last bit of emotion from the rôle.

And now for some plans:Jannings's New Picture.Germany has always led the world in the experimental and the tragic. But this year the Ufa is hardly announcing a single production that would not fit into an average Hollywood quota. The German organization deserves credit for fearlessly taking a leap into the uncertain waters of the talker last season. Its \\"Blue Angel,\\" directed by Sternberg with Jannings in the leading rôle, and \\"The Last Company,\\" in which Conrad Veidt was featured, upheld the German tradition. But let us look at 1930-31.Corell, the business head of the Ufa, told the press that primarily the productions supervised by Erich Pommer were aimed at the international market. First and foremost of these is Emil Jannings's starring vehicle, \\"The Favorite of the Gods,\\" which will be directed by Hanns Schwarz, who was responsible for \\"The Hungarian Rhapsody.\\" This will be a light farce concerning the tribulations of an opera singer.Then begins the group aimed at the German language area. These are: \\"The Flute Concert of Sans Souci,\\" with Otto Gebühr giving his impersonation of Frederick the Great; \\"A Student Song From Heidelberg,\\" directed by Ucicky, who did \\"The Immortal Vagabond,\\" evidently a sentimental college story; \\"Hocuspocus,\\" founded on the amusing mystery play by Kurt Goetz, which should have distinctly more international possibilities and of which, I understand, an English version has been prepared.Undoubtedly an excellent and astute program which will bring in money but where are the \\"Doctor Caligaris,\\" the \\"Madam Dubarrys,\\" the \\"Last Laughs\\"?

Among those new investors are many who do not even know what commodities their money is riding on, whether they are long or short any market, or how price moves are affecting their investments at any given moment - nor do they particularly care.

That theoretical framework, paradoxically, stressed the intuitive, instinctual basis of their music, as opposed to the supposedly overfancified decadence of their immediate predecessors. But these supposedly anti-cultural diatribes were written with considerable passion and intelligence","excerpt":"indeed, they had a considerably greater intellectual depth than their more mindless, hedonistic precursors. And the unwillingness of the mass audience to abandon the old and to accept this brave new world merely proves that pop music is meant to be popular. A pop audience will generally resist elitist innovators, even when those innovators drape themselves in populist rhetoric.   As with most polemically drawn distinctions, the actual differences between the old and new British rock receded with time. Partly that has to do with the retreat of British rock itself from the primitivism of 1977-78. The ''new Romantics,'' after all, deal in conscious recyclings of the psychedelic filigree of the late 60's, and as such are a long way from punk purism. That master careerist Robert Fripp has even managed to resurrect his early-70's British art-rock band, King Crimson, and with a few adjustments of style has made it sound completely au courant in dance-rock clubs.

Barcelo got a head start while still in his teens, so that by the time he was 25, he had made it in both the Sao Paulo Bienal and Kassel's Dokumenta. Then came exposure in the Venice Biennale and Kynaston McShine's roundup of contemporaries at the Museum of Modern Art, both in 1984. The following year, Barcelo was one of the five painters that Donald Sultan chose to represent - at Artists Space - the new Spanish scene, a scene that he now contributes to from Paris. Antoni Tapies is said to have been an influence - by way of his early canvases built up in sand, if the younger artist's surfaces are anything to go by. Still, the connection is tenuous, for Barcelo is a figurative artist who makes paint his primary medium, even though he drags it across canvases seemingly pre-strewn with string, cigarette butts and sheets of paper.

Lanza was born Alfredo Arnold Cocozza in 1921, and died, after years of personal excess, in 1959. In the late 40's, he had ambitions to be an opera star, and there were some - George London, for instance, with whom he toured for two years as part of Columbia Artists' Columbia Bel Canto Trio - who felt he was about the most prodigally gifted vocal talent ever to emerge in this country.

Don Francisco first appears in Galdos's novel ''El Doctor Centeno'' as ''a fierce, cold man, with the face of a sacristan, who used to lend money to students.''

A detailed account of his early life and methods can be found in the intimate epic ''Fortunata y Jacinta,'' a work that towers over the rest of the Spanish literature of the 1880's as ''Bleak House'' towered over the English novel of the 1850's and ''Our Mutual Friend'' over the 60's.

In a sense, opera did that, too, with its evolution out of intermezzos and pastoral plays in the late 16th century. But in another sense, it can be said to have been invented by a group of Florentine aristocratic intellectuals. The first surviving complete opera can be precisely identified as Peri's ''Euridice,'' from 1600.   If opera has an exact beginning, it sometimes seems to have had an exact end, as well - 1926. It was then that the last opera to claim an undisputed place in the international repertory, Puccini's ''Turandot,'' was premiered. Since that time, often appears to the traditional opera-lover, we have been confronted with a depressing string of dry, dissonant, unsingable experiments. Opera as a lyric art seemed moribund.

Mr. Block sympathetically details the struggles of three film makers and the stumbling blocks they have encountered, from raising money to trying to find theaters where independent films are welcome. His own film, which is actually an hourlong video, opens today at the Anthology Film Archives.    A lot of what is revealed here will be of interest only to fellow would-be film makers, like the problems inherent in trying to find investors for untried talent and an iffy project. But Mr. Block, who is well attuned to the amateurish eagerness of some of his subjects, eventually moves on to the dark humor inherent in making films that may never see the light of day. The collaborators on something called \\"Only a Buck,\\" who have credits like \\"cowriter/accountant\\" and \\"lead actor/art director,\\" are seen joining the director, Gerry Cook, for a National Rest Stop Tour in a flamboyantly painted camper, out of which they sell videocassettes of their film \\"factory direct.\\" They also give out a phone number, (800) HECK-YES, which is cute enough to land them on local news shows in the cities they visit. All that this eventually gets them is video distribution in a handful of countries, including Turkey and South Korea. This extremely limited success comes despite the film makers' vow to distributors that \\"we're not too fully committed to any of it -- so we can take any of it out, or put any of it back in.\\" Review/Film","excerpt":"Independent Movie Displays"},{"year":"1928","title":"Independent theatre owners will meet ???

But consider the story of a destitute Muslim woman who,  two decades ago, dared to file for alimony in an Indian court when her well-to-do husband divorced her after 43 years of marriage. Her case provides a  window into the agonies of modern India, demonstrating why it is often hard to reconcile the ideals of civil society with the anxieties of a beleaguered minority community.         In 1985, the Indian Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, the divorced woman, was entitled to a $40 monthly payment from her ex-husband, even though Muslim law calls for no such thing. Instead, Muslim law requires a divorced women to get financial help from her own family or the community at large. After a storm  of protest by Muslims that their own personal law should govern the Muslim community, as promised from India's earliest days of independence, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi rammed a bill through Parliament reversing the Supreme Court decision. It was a deeply unpopular move, contributing greatly to the disenchantment with Mr. Gandhi among feminists, secularists and, most of all, the broad Hindu middle class.

America must avoid the condition that has afflicted the Indian trucking industry at the cost of thousands of lives. In India, trucks are kept in operation so long that, in wear and age, they are beyond the point of being junk heaps and may be classified as museum pieces.

Meyer's evenhanded discussion of Columbus and Spanish colonial policy (Editorial Notebook, June 27). Bartolome de Las Casas saw that the root of the trouble came from the land-grant system whereby a Spaniard who was given an estate also got possession of the Indians on it, making them in effect slaves.   He returned to Spain in 1515 to appeal to the king. His plea: \\"If your majesty would reserve to yourself alone the jurisdiction of the Indies, without sharing it among the Spaniards, it would be the greatest happiness imaginable to the Indians.\\"   This same theme ran throughout his \\"Very Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies.\\" He proposed that the Indians remain under their own chiefs, who would be subject only to the Spanish king. This had been the design of Queen Isabella, he said, when days before her death she commanded the governor of Hispaniola to treat all the Indians as free people.   His plan was never adopted, but in 1542, de Las Casas was influential in getting Charles V to issue ordinances intended to secure better treatment of the Indians and limit distribution of their lands among the Spaniards.
