Yet the United States, with \\"more will than wallet,\\" in President Bush's words, is still taking the lead in efforts to deal with crises all over the world: dispatching American planes to Saudi Arabia to force Saddam Hussein of Iraq to yield to United Nations inspection of his nuclear, biological and chemical warfare plants","excerpt":"pressing the Israeli Government to change its settlement policy in the occupied West Bank by holding up $10 billion in loan guarantees for resettling Soviet Jewish immigrants; trying to achieve a Middle East peace agreement; seeking to prevent economic and political chaos in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe; trying to construct what Mr. Bush calls a new world order while maintaining the world's largest military budget and tackling (or, his critics would say, neglecting) America's own social, economic and environmental problems.

People are seen all over the countryside and along the roadways, tagged by children and family dogs, doubled over and scrutinizing the ground with eagle-eyed concentration. What they are seeking, however, are not eggs but walnuts. The Dordogne is walnut country, where production of the nut is a study in waste-not. Walnuts figure in nearly every aspect of a menu, from bread and salad dressing to ice cream, walnut cake and liqueurs. (Fresh walnuts macerated in the French brandy called eau de vie also make a mellow aperitif - liqueur de noix - when served over ice.) One of the best byproducts of the region's walnuts is oil (huile de noix). An appreciation for it is heightened by a visit to the mill at Ste.-Nathalene, which is about five miles northeast of Sarlat, just off Route D47. The mill, powered by water and employing wood-burning fires for heat, has not changed its method of production, and has been in constant operation, since the early 16th century. How this ancient method, compared with a modern mechanization, affects the final product may be a matter of debate, but the Ste.-Nathalene oil is unquestionably a highly refined version. Whereas some local walnut oils can be so harsh and assertive in flavor that they need some olive or peanut oil to cut the intensity, Ste.

It won't be as bad as all that, if Amtrak survives. Take Elizabeth Dole's word for it.  As Secretary of Transportation, she affirmed last September that she shared the view of Federal Railroad Administrator John H. Riley that Amtrak had made ''great strides'' toward ''modern, cost-efficient intercity rail passenger service'' - running in 1985 ''more route miles than it did in l981 at approximately 28 percent lower funding.'' Mrs. Dole, far from sharing young David's hysteria about what he cutely called a ''mobile money-burning machine,'' had asked for a $765 million Amtrak subsidy for fiscal 1986. But that was before the youthful Budget Director began to drum his heels.   He and President Reagan squawk frequently about a $35-per-head subsidy that each Amtrak passenger supposedly receives. This prestidigitation requires adding the Amtrak subsidy to the amount that Amtrak business travelers can deduct from their income taxes, and dividing by 20 million passengers","excerpt":"presto! $35 a head.

Through one calamity or another, his deft, witty and deeply lyrical operas seemed to vanish from the stage almost as soon as they appeared. And so it is that \\"L'Etoile\\" came to New York over the weekend as a relative stranger. In Friday's performance by the L'Opera Francais de New York at Gould Hall, it showed itself swift, compact and original in spite of Christopher Alden's marginally vulgar rendition of it.   Chabrier, a well-to-do esthete and Government functionary, quit his job for composing in 1880, three years after \\"L'Etoile\\" appeared at the Bouffes-Parisiens. Unsuccessful on the stage, sunk in debt and long afflicted by health problems, Chabrier died 14 years later. He was friend to every major literary and musical figure of his time and became a tireless devotee of Wagner.

And, with spring training in full swing and baseball fever, as sportcasters like to call it, in the air, the crowds are getting bigger.

Laver is an edible seaweed that clings to rocks and is common to the shores of Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Known beyond Wales primarily for its medicinal qualities, laver was thought to inhibit circulatory and digestive ailments. Fine potted laver was hawked through the streets of 18th-century Bath and sent to Derbyshire in central England to counteract a lack of iodine in the water and prevent goiter. Welsh mothers admonished their children: ''Eat your laverbread or you'll get Derbyshire neck.'' The threat was unnecessary if one can judge by local enjoyment of the dish, which is still served (sometimes daily) in Swansea homes.   Laverbread usually is brought to the table finely chopped and potted with a bit of butter or dipped in oatmeal and fried in bacon fat. Sprinkled with the juice of lemon or sour orange, it is made into a sauce to accompany green vegetables or mutton.

ROADSIDE MEMORIALS -- Some members of the Legislature want to put signs along state highways as memorials to people killed in accidents caused by drunken drivers. The signs would be placed close to the site of the accident and would warn against drinking and driving. SPECIAL PLATES -- Think you've seen every special license plate imaginable? There are 38 bills pending that would allow new plate designations for everything from the Great Falls in Passaic to shade trees and forests. LIGHTS ON -- Under a bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Clare M. Farragher, a Republican, and known as the Dead Battery Bill, drivers would be required to keep their headlights on at all times. The current requirement is for drivers to use their headlights from 30 minutes before sunset until 30 minutes after sunrise. BIKE TO THE TRAIN -- An Assembly bill would require New Jersey Transit to provide space on trains to store the bicycle, except during rush hours. The catch is, they could charge a fee for the storage.  HELMETS -- Those whose wheels are limited to skateboards and Rollerblades would not be free from the watchful eye of the Legislature. A bill sponsored by Assemblyman John V. Kelly, a Republican, would require anyone under 18 to wear a helmet, knee pads, elbow pads, and wrist and palm guards. The bill also would require bicyclists under the age of 18 to wear helmets; currently, anyone under 14 must wear a helmet.

To be fair, this is surely not the goal of the Bose Corporation, which makes loudspeaker systems and other audio equipment. Nevertheless, Bose seems willing to put a lot of responsible, worthwhile journalism at jeopardy in its effort to win dollar compensation for wounded pride.  In May 1970, Consumers Union, an organization that tests and rates consumer products, published a survey and evaluation of stereo loudspeakers in its monthly magazine Consumer Reports. That article examined the novel design and distinctive features of Bose's latest model, explained how that unit was tested, and offered an appraisal that was complimentary in part and cautionary in part. The appraisal didn't seem fair to Bose, which, after years of court appearances, must now convince the Supreme Court that it was the victim of damaging, untrue product disparagement. If Bose wins, assessments of goods and services become risky. NOT CRITICIZE PRODUCTS?

It was also in the last of the ninth in the fourth game of last Fall's world series that the Yankees, capitalizing on Mickey Owen's fatal third-strike slip, sent four runs crashing over the plate, with two out, to change the trend of the series.Fonseca Again DirectorNeedless to say, those stirring episodes receive full play in the film, which again has been written and directed by Lew Fonseca, with Bob Elson doing the narrating.In fact, in the opinion of nearly all the more than 200 observers who attended the private showing, the picture, developed more thoroughly along pictorial lines than any of its predecessors, is for that reason the most entertaining yet produced.There has been a considerable curtailment in the technical and educational portions of the film. These, of course, are still there in ample numbers ‚Äî slow-motion scenes and stop-action shots of such diamond luminaries as Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio and Bob Feller, along with Joe Kuhel revealing the intricacies of covering first base in his own matchless style.But in the main the film's most attractive features are to be found in the skillful handling of the season's highlights as they actually occurred on the diamond, such as DiMaggio blasting away to achieve his fifty-six-game hitting-streak record, the All-Star game that culminated in Williams's deciding homer after Arky Vaughan had hit two to put the National Leaguers ahead, and, finally, the world series. Scenes are shown from each of the five games, and both in continuity and clarity of action the production is of an unusually high order.Medwick's Catch RecordedMany of the difficulties encountered in the past in taking motion pictures of ball games seem finally to have been overcome. For instance, in the first game of the world series one not only sees DiMaggio cutting loose with a tremendous drive, but on the end of that drive one also sees Joe Med-wick leaping high in the air to make a sensational catch in front of the left wing of the grandstand that robbed Jolting Joe of what looked like a certain home run.The picture, dedicated to the memory of the late Lou Gehrig, opens with a few scenes of Larruping Lou performing in his prime. Later there is still another sentimental touch when the American League's all-time \\"Hall of Fame outfield,\\" Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker, is brought together in uniform with each taking a few practice swings.As in the past, the picture is being made available to all clubs, schools, colleges and fraternal organizations at no cost except for expressage of print from and to Chicago, but in his introductory remarks Fonseca stressed the point that requests coming from naval and military camps would receive preference. All applications should be made to Fonseca at the American League headquarters, 310 South Michigan Building, Chicago.MacPhail Frowns on BonusesIndication that major league club owners are doing some heavy pondering over their 1942 player contracts was seen yesterday when Larry MacPhail revealed that Dodger contracts would not be mailed until next month. In the past the Dodgers usually have been among the first to complete their salary adjustments with players.MacPhail, however, denied that he was contemplating the adoption of bonus clauses or otherwise offering players \\"conditional contracts,\\" suggested in some quarters as a means to safeguard clubs against heavy losses in the event of unforeseen war developments. On the contrary, the head of the National League champions expressed doubt that a bonus arrangement would prove a satisfactory solution.\\"As a matter of fact,\\" said MacPhail, \\"none of us knows just what to expect. Admittedly we are confronted by a very uncertain year and it is for the purpose of getting as much information as possible that we have decided to wait until the last possible moment before sending out our contracts.\\"Under baseball law, players must receive their contracts by Feb. 15 and MacPhail indicated that he would send his documents out soon after Feb. 1. Two Dodgers, Pete Reiser and Kirby Higbe, have already signed.In contrast with this, the Giants announced yesterday that they would send their contracts out \\"as usual\\" about Jan. 15, and looked for no serious difficulties. The Yankees, who rarely have mailed their contracts before Feb. 1 in the past, expect to follow the same procedure this year, according to President Ed Barrow.

AN ARTIST'S INFLUENCES    An exhibition of works by George Segal and the artists who influenced him, including Picasso, is on view through Saturday at the Whitney Museum in Stamford. It has inspired a performance piece to be seen on Saturday at 6 P.M. in the exhibition space. \\"Seated Man at a Table\\" -- also the title of a series of cubist works by Picasso -- is the title of the presentation by Michael Rush and the New Haven Artists Theater; it will be performed by Emily Rubin and Joy Sweet, in collaboration with Mark Schmitt, a film maker, and Gregory Thorp, a photographer.    Museum officals said the work is \\"an abstract montage of text, music, movement, film and sound\\" that attempts to draw a parallel between the fragmented cubist images in Picasso's paintings and 20th-century society.    The museum is on the ground floor of the Champion International Building at the corner of Atlantic Street and Tresser Boulevard. Tickets, at $5, may be reserved by calling 358-7652. Admission to the exhibition, open 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday, is free.

He has written a dozen books on this and related topics, and he has been a recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship, the Matchette Prize in Esthetics and grants from Columbia, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Rockefeller Foundation.    His advocacy for individual thinking as opposed to rote learning is evident in the titles of his talks. He will speak on \\"Philosophy for Children: Reasoning and Judgment in the Elementary Grades\\" at 11 A.M. on Friday in Room 112 of Engleman Hall at Southern Connecticut State University. The second session, at 2 P.M., is titled \\"Thinking in Education.\\" ACROSS AND DOWN     Crossword puzzle fans will battle for supremacy when the 14th Annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament convenes at the Marriot Hotel in Stamford Friday through Sunday.

'VOYAGE UP THE NILE'    Familiarity with the art and culture of ancient Egypt, commonly referred to as Egyptology, is a relatively modern phenomenon in the Western world, highlighted in an exhibition at Trinity College in Hartford called \\"From Napoleon to Petrie: The Development of Egyptology in the 19th Century.\\" The exhibit, on view through May 15 in Watkinson Library, will open with a reception Thursday at 4:15 P.M., followed by a lecture.    The speaker will be John William Pye, a collector of Egyptian photographs, books and ephemera. His subject will be \\"A Victorian Voyage up the Nile: Egyptian Antiquities in 19th-Century Photographs,\\" including accounts of a climb up the Great Pyramid at Giza, an ascent of the first cataract of the Nile, the opening of a royal mummy case and the removal to Manhattan of Cleopatra's Needle.    Among the Egyptologists whose works are included in the exhibition are Jean-Francois Champollon, decipherer of hieroglyphics; Giovanni Battista Belzoni, an excavator, and Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, one of the earliest scientific archeologists.

Non-mothers must pay the usual $2 admission, or $1 for children.    The Antiquarian and Landmarks Society of Hartford, which owns and maintains eight homes including these two, opens them all for the season on Wednesday. While visiting hours may differ slightly from house to house, each one is architecturally significant and holds a cache of lore, furniture and artifacts. Most of the houses offer guided tours almost daily at fees of around $3, $1 for children.    Five of the homes were built in the 18th century, two in the 19th, and one, the Joshua Hempstead House at 11 Hempstead Street, New London, was built in 1678. It survived the burning of New London in 1728 by the British and was occupied by the Hempstead family until 1937.    Hatheway House is considered to be a prize among New England's architectural landmarks. It contains many of the original French wallpapers in remarkably bright condition and a display of handmade domestic linens. For a complete list of homes and visiting hours call 247-8996. MISSISSIPPI DELTA TALE     A rich mixture of storytelling, folk traditions and gospel music underscores the series of vignettes in \\"From the Mississippi Delta,\\" a new play opening on Friday at the Hartford Stage Company. Focusing on African-American life in Mississippi during the 1950's, the work is performed by three actresses in numerous roles -- male and female, rich and poor.    Much of the content is autobiographical, recalling the teen-age years and young adulthood of the playwright, Dr. Endesha Ida Mae Holland, during a time that the civil rights movement was gaining national attention.    Dr. Holland, who founded the Lorraine Hansberry Writers Workshop in Minneapolis, is an associate professor of American Studies at the State University of New York at Buffalo and author of several plays that have been produced in the United States and England.    Performances are scheduled on Tuesday through Thursday at 7:30 P.M., Friday and Saturday at 8 P.M., Sunday at 2:30 and 7:30 P.M., Wednesday matinees at 2 P.M. and additional matinees on some Thursdays and Saturdays through the end of the run on June 16. Tickets are $23 and $28","excerpt":"previews, today through Thursday, cost $15. The Hartford Stage is at 50 Church Street in downtown Hartford, and the box office phone number is 527-5151. DR. JOHNSON'S LIFE     James Boswell's \\"Life of Samuel Johnson\\" was first published in England 200 years ago, and today it is considered to be the most famous biography in the English language. Two free exhibitions of original manuscripts, first editions, related prints, drawings and paintings have been assembled at the Yale Center for British Art and the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.    The British Art Center exhibit, which will remain until June 9, consists of Boswell's papers; portraits of Johnson, Boswell and their families; first editions of major works by both men; portraits of 18th-century London literati; views of the city at that time, and prints illustrating Johnson's and Boswell's trip to the Scottish Hebrides. The center, at 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Sunday from noon to 5. Call 432-2850 for more information.    The papers on view at the Beinecke Library, at 121 Wall Street, date to a parchment document of 1431, involving a property dispute instigated by David Boswell, an apparently litigious ancestor of the author. The exhibit will remain through June 28, available for viewing Monday through Friday from 8:30 A.M. to 5 P.M., Saturday from 10 to 5. The phone number is 432-2977.    James Boswell was a lowly law student when he met Johnson in 1763, and the two hit it off amazingly well, considering the fact that Johnson was the foremost literary figure in Britain. The first \\"Life of Johnson\\" was published in 1791.    Some of the material was discovered in 1925 by Chauncey Brewster Tinker, an English professor at Yale, and bought by Ralph Heyward Isham, a Yale graduate and collector. The entire cache was purchased by Yale with help from the Old Dominion Fund and the McGraw Hill Book Company in 1949. ON BEHALF OF . . .     \\"The Art of Advocacy,\\" running from Saturday through Sept. 22 at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield, contains works pertaining to politics, AIDS, the environment, sexism, racism, homelessness and war.   Contributing to the show are 30 major artists, including Robert Colescott, Leon Golub, Robert Longo, Barbara Kruger, Andres Serrano, Carrie Mae Weems and David Wojnarowicz and video artists like Ida Applebroog, the Guerrilla Girls and Paper Tiger Television.    The museum is at 258 Main Street, open Wednesday through Friday from noon to 4 P.M., Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 5 P.M. Admission is $3, $2 for students and the elderly. Call 438-4519 for more information. PARTY FOR TWO     A double anniversary will be observed on Thursday at the Hartt School of Music, celebrating the 95th birthday of Moshe Paranov, a founder of the school, and the 70th birthday of the school itself.     Julius Hartt, the other founder and an organist at the Asylum Hill Congregational Church, died in the mid-1950's, shortly before the music school became one of the charter divisions of the new university in 1957.    A concert at 8:30 P.M. will feature the Hartford Ballet, directed by Michael Uthoff; the Hartford Symphony Orchestra conducted by Michael Lankester; the Connecticut Opera, conducted by Robert Ashens; the Portland (Maine) String Quartet, and the Hartt Commencement Orchestra. Soloists will be Grant Johannesen, painist, and Arthur Thompson, baritone.     Mr. Paranov will conduct the concluding selection, the overture from Offenbach's \\"Orpheus in the Underworld.\\"    Tickets are $25, $20 for the elderly and $12.50 for students.

The composers, Britten, Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev, are hardly strangers. Yet in selecting from the works of each, Mr. Previn sidestepped the obvious choices.   Instead of Britten's Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge, or the Simple Symphony, he offered the early Sinfonia da Requiem. Instead of Rachmaninoff's crowd-pleasing Second or Third Piano Concertos, Mr. Previn and the French pianist Jean-Philippe Collard collaborated on the less frequently heard First Concerto. And the lure of Prokofiev's popular First and Fifth Symphonies was resisted in favor of the Seventh. These works cannot truly be called rarities, given their availability on recordings.

Yet in Monday night's Mostly Mozart concert at Avery Fisher Hall, these disparate works seemed far less urgent and far too gracious. As played by the Tokyo String Quartet, assisted by Andre Previn at the piano, they took on a uniformly warm character and an overly lush tone.

In Act II, a Russian Orthodox priest tells Sonya how he understands her \\"cry from the heart.\\" Such are the playwright Leon Katz's florid elucidations on the overwrought behavior of Countess Sofya Andreyevna Tolstoy, who spends much of her namesake play's three hours making a nuisance of herself, demanding to be let into the cottage where her husband of 48 years lies dying, while hostile forces keep her  out. The year is 1910. Since Julie Harris is possessed of the power to communicate an interior life, her enlightened presence gives a playwright the golden gift of time. He can save it. He can cut words. He can redirect priorities. Bluntly put, he can rework his play. As Sonya, Ms. Harris reveals the depth of distress, the ambivalent pull of fierce love in conflict with ideological discord. In a single moment, the actress sums up her reason for being there: to put the stamp of finality and forgiveness -- the buzzword is closure -- on a troubled, unreconciled life with a sainted man. Their \\"totally opposite ideas of the meaning and purpose of existence,\\" in the words of a letter Tolstoy wrote to Sonya four months before his death, led to estrangement. Sonya could not forsake the materialism that a spiritually converted Tolstoy renounced, or understand his loyalty to his leading disciple,  Vladimir Gregorievich Chertkov, with its intimations of homosexuality and an idealism that eluded her. While the puzzling and fascinating ramifications of an extraordinarily volatile  marriage that produced 13 children, 4 of whom -- 2 daughters and 2 sons -- figure among an eye-popping stage full of 15 characters, are unexplored, the ravings of Sonya are overexplained. Neither historically lucid nor dramatically fulfilling, Mr. Katz's play reveals  a gaping hole at the center, an unsettling inconclusiveness. That Tolstoy remains unseen in a many-peopled play is an interesting challenge Mr. Katz has created, but he has failed to give a revered man a rich offstage life. Yet no playwright could reasonably expect, in three weeks' playing time, a more  solid ensemble or a more bountiful production than the Phoenix Theater Company at Purchase College in Purchase, N.Y., has lavished on \\"Sonya.\\" It all starts with the audience's gasp at the sight of Campbell Baird's imposing set, a whopping train that revolves in an obscure railroad station, Astapovo.

Reno Roop (as Tolstoy's oldest son) is a holdover from that production, which also had Charles S. Dutton and John Turturro in small roles and Jan Miner as Sonya. For this production, the artistic director of the Phoenix, Bram Lewis, orchestrates the feuding and fussing family, the invading press -- Tolstoy's retreat into the woods at 82 was some media event -- and the stars' iridescent moments as though there were real drama somewhere in there. Ms. Harris, in a flash, retreats into the reassurance of memory, madness and considerations of suicide, shades her voice to the darkest reaches of the virago who means business and glancingly acknowledges the comedy inherent in any photo-op, amid all her protestations. In support, note a capital cast. Philip Baker Hall (Chertkov) is an unrelenting  threat, and Timothy Jerome (Dushan) is a well-tempered adversary. Jennifer Harmon, Miriam Healy-Louie, Jud Meyers and Mr. Roop are so intensely and individually effective as the Tolstoy daughters and sons -- Sonya's \\"jailers\\" -- that they make it theatrically clear that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
