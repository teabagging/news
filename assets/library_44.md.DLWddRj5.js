But Mahler was more than that: he was also the precursor of a 20th-century Romantic symphonic tradition that shows few signs of dying out. Critics often talk today of our compositional eclecticism, but in fact parallel stylistic evolution has been common throughout the century. At the same time Schoenberg and his disciples were pushing music toward extreme rational control, the Neo-Classicists were reviving the past, the experimentalists were pursuing their own constructively anarchic dreams, and a busy symphonic style was carrying on, undaunted by everything else.   That style existed on both sides of the Atlantic, but it is on several key figures in the European symphonic tradition, from Mahler himself to Zemlinsky, Scriabin, Sibelius, Nielsen and Shostakovich, that I wish to concentrate here. All of these composers have been the subjects of recent attention by major conductors and orchestras on major record labels.

Yet in the rarefied precincts of classical music, the millennium is almost too big to think about.

Eliot, Flannery O'Connor, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Lowell and Bernard Malamud, Robert Giroux is about to have a book published next month under his own name: ''The Book Known as Q: A Consideration of Shakespeare's Sonnets'' (Atheneum).   Mr. Giroux, chairman of the board of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, attempts in his book to answer questions about the publication of Shakespeare's sonnets in the 1609 quarto, known as Q, which he calls ''one of the most famous and mysterious books in the history of publishing.'' Among the questions: Why did the publication of Q meet with almost total silence when Shakespeare was at the height of his fame? Why was it never reprinted? Why was it almost unknown to 17thcentury writers?   Mr. Giroux has been interested in Shakespeare's sonnets ever since he studied at Columbia University with Mark Van Doren, the late poet and scholar. ''The first paper I wrote for Mark was on the sonnets,'' Mr. Giroux recalled recently. His book grew out of a lecture he gave at Wesleyan University in 1978. Several academic friends who read the manuscript warned him that some Shakespeare scholars may ''scream'' about an amateur invading their turf, but Mr. Giroux does not seem particularly disturbed by that prospect. ''I've kept up with the scholarship,'' he said in his quiet manner, ''and 40 years have gone into the book.''

Yet this is the ideal time, especially in the Northeast, to enjoy the plenty of the garden. Corn, tomatoes and zucchini are at their best, and these vegetables are less expensive now than at any other time of year.   We are still - partly, at least - in our summer mood. The nights are mild and we continue to enjoy grilling outside, although we move on, from a lighter fish or poultry to something a little more substantial, like the pork chops in this recipe. This is also the time of year I like to go to a beach on Long Island Sound not far from my home. The summer crowds have disappeared, so the setting is quite tranquil, and the water is still warm enough to make swimming enjoyable.   I have selected a menu that uses the bounty of our late-summer harvest in ways that announce the arrival of fall. I make a gratin, for example, with zucchini and tomatoes, flavoring it with Parmesan cheese, olive oil and sprigs of fresh oregano leaves (or dried oregano, if fresh is not available). The gratin can be prepared and assembled, ready for the oven, up to a day ahead and refrigerated until cooking time.   The corn tempura can be prepared on the spur of the moment and served as an appetizer, a first course or a meat accompaniment. It is a simple concoction of corn, flour, ice water and a single egg, and the recipe yields 18 pancakes, each about three inches in diameter.   It is important that you use a nonstick pan and very hot oil for the pancakes; canola oil can withstand the high temperatures without burning, although for best results the pan should be cleaned between each subsequent batch of four pancakes. Notice that when you prepare the batter, you add only a little water to the flour and egg mixture. This creates a thick batter that you can smooth with a whisk before adding the rest of the water. If all the water is added at first, the flour would form into little lumps and the batter would have to be strained.   I like the pork chops grilled, but they are also good cooked on the top of the stove in a very hot, heavy skillet - cast-iron or thick aluminum are best - after being macerated with the seasonings, thyme and olive oil. Cook the oil-coated chops for the same length of time in the open skillet as on the grill. On the grill, cook them close to the source of heat. My grill has a lid and that intensifies the heat. If your grill doesn't have a lid, cook the chops a minute longer on each side.   When the chops are removed from the grill or skillet, they should be set aside to rest in a warm place; they will continue to cook in their own heat. The juices inside will equalize and the chops will be uniformly juicy throughout.   Serve this menu with a good, inexpensive red Bordeaux or a white Graves from Bordeaux.
