Last Thursday night, four of the six major carriers, led by Northwest, raised those fares by $50, but retreated when it became clear over the weekend that two carriers, Delta and American, were not participating. By yesterday, the last holdouts, Northwest and Continental, had withdrawn their increases on the fares, which are typically used by business travelers making last-minute plans. In addition, airlines that late last week increased less-expensive advance-purchase fares by $5 to $10 each way dropped those increases over the weekend, said Terry Trippler, the airline analyst at Cheatseats.com.    MORE FIRST-CLASS SEATS -- Not long ago, Continental Airlines removed 12 first-class seats to expand coach seating in its fleet of Boeing 757-300 jets, which have been used primarily on medium-haul, low-margin routes. Yesterday, citing growing demand for first-class tickets as well as a need to accommodate more upgrades, Continental said it was adding 12 seats to the front of the 757-300s, returning the first-class cabin to a 24-seat configuration. The airline also said it was expanding its fleet of 757-300's from 9 to 17.    SECURITY CONCERNS -- Business travelers want the government to give them a break when passing through airport security, according to a survey commissioned by the Business Travel Coalition. Travelers biggest complaint was inconsistency in the treatment they received from airport to airport, which was cited by 38 percent of those questioned. Long lines came in a close second, named by 37 percent of travelers. Seventy-seven percent supported the introduction of a so-called registered-traveler program that would speed security procedures for frequent fliers allowing the government to keep their personal information on file. Among corporate travel managers 60 percent said their companies would support such a plan.    HIGHER BILLS AT THE FRONT DESK -- The rebound in the hotel industry is so strong, driven by an increase in business travel, that PricewaterhouseCoopers has revised its domestic lodging forecast for this year. Among the new predictions: revenue per available room will increase 7.8 percent, compared with 7.3 percent in the previous forecast","excerpt":"room rates will increase an average 4.3 percent this year compared with last year, the most since a jump of 5.4 percent in 2000.

Answer: According to several lawyers, yours is a difficult situation and a court action is probably the only way to determine the answer.  That fact that you have been living in the apartment as a roommate of the lessee for 10 years does not mean that the owner has to include your name on the lease. That the rent has been paid out of a joint account does not necessarily mean the landlord has accepted your tenancy, especially if there is no evidence that he knows you are living in the apartment and thus no evidence that he has accepted you, implicitly or explicitly, as a tenant.

The exhibition, on display at the Museum of the City of New York, includes an overview of Mr. Cook's life, highlighting his childhood in Chicago, his early career with his dance partner Ernest (Buster) Brown -- with whom he gained fame  for combining tap dancing with acrobatics and comedy -- his solo career and his  inspiration from musical legends like Eubie Blake, Duke Ellington and Sammy Davis Jr. Mr. Cook, who died in 1991, is remembered through photographs, personal memorabilia and a 37-minute videotape in which he and Mr. Brown reminisce.
