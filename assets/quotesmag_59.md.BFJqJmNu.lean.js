M. Best Company in a 1984 commercial. At the time, Best was the only insurance rating company, and it carried considerable weight.\\n\\nSince then, four more rating agencies have emerged, assigning letter grades to insurance companies based on the companies' abilities to pay future claims. Despite greater scrutiny and more competition, the agencies have not always done a good job of predicting trouble. Beginning with the failure of Executive Life in April 1991 and continuing through the collapse of Confederation Life last summer, a number of insurers failed, though they carried adequate or better ratings from at least some agencies.
