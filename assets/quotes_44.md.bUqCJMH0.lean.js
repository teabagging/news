In the Bush Administration, Russia enjoyed a distinct primacy among other former republics and was treated as the successor to the Soviet Union in arms controls and other areas. It was evidently for this reason that President Boris N. Yeltsin pushed to sign the latest strategic arms reduction treaty, known as Start II, while Mr. Bush was still in charge.
