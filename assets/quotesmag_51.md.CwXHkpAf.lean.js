The type of reading material found in the guest bedroom says a lot about their interests as well as what they think you might find interesting. And what better choice for a guest room than a couple of lavishly illustrated books on beds? THE BED (Stewart, Tabori & Chang, $45) is exhaustively informative. Did you know that ancient nomadic Persians slept on goat skins filled with water? (And you always thought the water bed was invented by those libidinous 1960's flower children.) The early Saxons slept on sacks stuffed with hay, hence the expression \\"making a bed.\\" Alecia Beldegreen, the creative director of Bride's magazine, also tells us that in the Middle Ages \\"beds were designed so that the sleeper sat upright\\" in a fully illuminated room with sword at the reach. Sleeping was \\"a communal affair\\" at both ends of the social spectrum until well into the 16th century, when \\"an invitation to share a bed was recognized as a mark of political esteem\\" and it was not uncommon for former enemies to share a bed as a symbol of reconciliation. In France during the Bourbon and Empire periods, the aristocracy slept, and often entertained, in beds of elaborate extravagance, several of which are depicted here. The graceful and simple four-poster beds that turn-of-the-century French nuns slept in are nearly as fascinating as the photograph of the vast one-room, 15th-century hospice where patients slept two to a bed as opposed to three or four in other hospitals. The most beautiful bed in this book must surely be that of the editor of Bride's, Barbara Tober, who has created a king-sized fantasy out of antique lace and linens, chintz and mirrors. Ms. Beldegreen has also thoughtfully included an extensive source list and advice on how to choose and care for all types of bedding and bedclothes. Diane Von Furstenberg's BEDS (Bantam, $35) is a very handsome and captivating volume filled with photographs of beautiful beds with fascinating histories from some very exclusive private homes. If you have always wanted to peek inside the bedrooms of the European aristocracy, past and present, as well as those of prominent American artists, designers and socialites, this book is a must-have. There are at least a dozen pages devoted to the beds of Napoleon, Josephine, Louis XIV, Marie Antoinette, Madame Du Barry and the perpetually recumbent Madame Recamier. In the event you are ever asked to stay the weekend with Kelly and Calvin Klein, you might do well to check out three of the guest rooms photographed here so you can put your dibs in for the one you like best. The next time you visit Gloucestershire, England, you simply must call in every favor ever owed you in order to wrangle an invite to the country home of Lord Jamie Neidpath, whose drawing room holds two of the most incredibly fabulous Chinese Chippendale daybeds. Real showstoppers these! I personally plan to stay a bit closer to home in the unlikely event Pauline Boardman or Baroness Marie-Helene de Rothschild need an apartment (or should I say bedroom?) sitter. These two grandes dames sleep in rooms a storybook princess would covet. It was quite puzzling to come upon the photograph of a 19th-century Kang opium bed. It is very difficult to imagine anyone snoozing on something so clearly hard and cold.

The company has grown and changed, surviving adulthood and changes in personnel but keeping its identity as a freewheeling collective of choreographing dancers who all look as if they have had some training in gymnastics. Now, however, Pilobolus seems to be going through a new kind of transitional period. The distance it has gone from its raw beginnings could be seen in the fourth and last program of the company's monthlong season at the Joyce Theater, which ends on Aug. 15.   In \\"Walklyndon,\\" a 1971 signature work, four men stride, crawl, tumble and lunge in straight paths that take them from one side of the stage to the other, pausing in their busy or addled voyages for physical collisions and colliding social manners.

In addition to Pilobolus standards, with their sensual body sculptures and free-for-all playfulness, there will be three new works. DANCE","excerpt":"Pilobolus at 21: Still a Combative Collaborative"},{"year":"1993","title":"Pilobolus unveiled a lavish array of dances on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater, rather like a street merchant setting out bright-colored wares. At their best, Pilobolus dances have a wonderfully rich simplicity. But there was something to enjoy even in the less impressive pieces on this second program of the company's four-week engagement.   The evening opened with \\"Untitled,\\" a 1975 work created by Pilobolus's original performers -- Robby Barnett, Alison Chase, Martha Clarke, Moses Pendleton, Michael Tracy and Jonathan Wolken -- as many of the company's dances are. \\"Untitled\\" is the Pilobolus classic in which two women repeatedly rise to twice their height, then subside from that towering perspective. On an idyllic Edwardian picnic together, they encounter two dandies, have children, then settle back for a spell on dandy rocking chairs. One can watch the dance as magical shape-play and illusion or as social commentary. The fine cast caught every nuance.

The evening included \\"Pilobolus,\\" the prankish dance that gave the company its name. Choreographed in 1971 by Lee Harris, Steve Johnson, Moses Pendleton and Jonathan Wolken, who were Dartmouth College students at the time, it made quite an impression at its premiere.

Increasingly there were stories. The performers' dance skills grew so that they no longer relied on the scruffy charm and intelligence exhibited by the founding Pilobolians, Moses Pendleton and Jonathan Wolken, college students who rebounded from their first dance classes right into choreography. But that early delight in sheer physicality was at the heart of a program presented by Pilobolus on Tuesday, the opening night of an anniversary season to run through Jan. 6 at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street).   The program's premiere, \\"The Particle Zoo,\\" was fairly thin. The fault may lie with Pilobolus's characteristic method of choreography by committee. \\"Zoo\\" was created by Mr. Wolken, Robby Barnett and Michael Tracy, all artistic directors of the company, in collaboration with Jack Arnold, a former dancer with the company, and the cast members Adam Battelstein, Kent Lindemer and John-Mario Sevilla.

During these long days of summer, when the sun takes its time moving over the horizon, diners can linger over drinks or dinner on breezy decks or in glass-walled dining rooms witnessing the whole technicolor, kaleidoscopic collaboration of water and sky.   We have limited our selection of waterfront restaurants to those situated right at the water's edge, excluding for this article places that have an eagle's eye view as well as those separated from the water by railroad tracks or thoroughfares. With an attempt to balance the quality of the food with the joys of the view, we present the restaurants in order of our preference.   Whether from its deck and strollable grounds or from the gardenlike glassed-in dining rooms, The Chart House in Dobbs Ferry provides a suitable placed to enjoy both food and view.

But it has limitations: at Yankee Stadium on Friday night, the audience, estimated by various officials to number anywhere between 55,000 and 100,000 people, was almost exclusively white.   The band, now nearing its 30th year, has figured out how to make a show more than your standard stadium rock concert, neither an amplified opera nor a sports event set to music. With a stage set high above the audience and lined with flat, black or silver panels and an unceasing, watt-sucking light show that only in part was emitted from the stage and filled up the entire stadium with neonlike lasers, fireworks, and strobe lights, along with falling inflated pigs, and a wraparound sound system, the band was working in part with Albert Speer-like architecture and a Spielbergian reproduction of wonder.
