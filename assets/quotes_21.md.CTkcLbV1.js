It is a building that has woefully inadequate backstage space, awkwardly designed and cramped public areas, and old and deteriorated mechanical systems. The greatness of its warm, intimate and resonant auditorium cannot be questioned - but it is, in fact, a glorious house set within an architectural shell that is both poorly functioning and notably ungraceful.   The lack of grace is the result of the constant additions and changes made to architect William B. Tuthill's building over the years; it can be improved somewhat, though this building will never glow with the perfection of ideal composition. The poor functioning, on the other hand, can be remedied much more completely, and it is in recognition of this that the Carnegie Hall Corporation, which has run the house since 1961 for its landlord, the City of New York, last month unveiled plans for a $20-million renovation of the fabled hall, to be completed in time for the building's centennial in 1991.

The same artists, the same ensembles, the same composers, all crop up week after week and season after season, from one hall to the next.    Dissatisfaction with this situation is reflected in increasing critical complaints about the sameness of the city's concert programming and in a slight but widespread decline in ticket sales throughout the city. That decline has been attributed to the recent recession. It may also, however, reflect the public's disenchantment with the very similarity among all those different offerings from our major concert halls and, perhaps, the public's growing sophistication.
