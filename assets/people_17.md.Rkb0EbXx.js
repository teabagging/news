Mr. Carroll is such a dashing chap! We see him first at the head of his rebel caballeros singing \\"Ride, Amigos, Ride,\\" and it hardly seems any time at all before he has driven the forces of oppression from Mexico and is folding little Movita in his arms. Quite the grand manner has Mr. Carroll, and quite the bad actors has Monogram's little romance. In fact, they're so bad they're almost good. Given just a mite more room for self-expression, they might have turned out a brilliant parody of \\"Don Q,\\" \\"Zorro\\" and the rest.At the 86th St. Garden TheatreWhen American motion picture producers turn out films having to do with epidemics, graft and governmental inefficiency in foreign countries they almost invariably locate the action in some imaginary land. Less sensitive, the big German UFA company has made Puerto Rico the scene of \\"Die Heimat ruft\\" (Home Is Calling), the new offering at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre.Consequently, Zarah Leander, the Swedish actress who has become rather popular on the Teutonic screen during the last year or so, has to contend with what American audiences (without exaggerated patriotism) are bound to consider an impossible story.The stately Zarah, whose lovely, low-pitched talking and singing voice and exotic charm gradually grow upon the spectators, stops at the island, marries a handsome and jealous local don (Ferdinand Marian) and begins to get homesick for her native Sweden.After ten years comes a former sweetheart in the person of likeable Karl Martell as a doctor seeking to solve the mystery of a deadly fever, the cause and cure of which have baffled even the scientists of the Rockefeller Institute. Zarah's husband, as uncrowned king of Puerto Rico, insists there is no such thing as this malady because if the world knew of its presence the market for the island's produce would be ruined. As he has the Governor and the local hospital heads under his thumb, he makes things pretty hot for the \\"nosey\\" Swede. He also is enraged at the attempt of his wife to flee to Sweden with their little boy. The ending, while not unexpected, is well Worked out.Herren Marian and Martell, newcomers to the Yorkville screen, act well under the handicap of settings which might be taken for a burlesque of Puerto Rico. Detlef Sierck's direction is good.At the Teatro HispanoThe best things about \\"El Derecho y el Deber\\" (Right and Duty), the Aspa film now at the Teatro Hispano, are a few interesting Mexican dances and some catchy music. Otherwise it is a routine Enoch Arden story with Juan Orol as the long absent husband and Consuelo Moreno as the wife who has married another. Señor Orol also directed the picture. The mechanical defects are too numerous for comfort.

This Alexander Korda presentation opened at the Plaza yesterday.On the surface, Mr. Rattigan's literate drama of a civilized English wife who leaves her titled husband and tries to live with a harum-scarum lad still possessing the emotional insecurity of a Spitfire pilot of World War II shows dye-markers indicating serious troubles way down deep in both of them. And Miss Leigh's strangely tense and fierce performing seems to indicate a depth charge set to go.All the way through the picture, from the opening scene in which she is found on the floor of a squalid apartment where she has unsuccessfully attempted suicide, she gives evidence of a restless nature that, because of some queer psychology, insists upon throwing her always between the devil and the deep blue sea. Her eyes often tend to abstract wandering. Her mind seems perpetually involved. And now and again, her physical movements have a peculiarly volcanic force.Likewise, the giddy performing of Kenneth More in the role of the good-natured but unreliable fellow to whom she fiercely commits herself suggests some erratic turbulence that is furiously driving him. Something profoundly pathetic is the matter with this amiable man.But what's eating on these people—what it is that prevents Miss Leigh from going back to her patient, generous husband, whom Emlyn Williams plays, or compels Mr. More to leave her and then return with his heart in his hands—is never defined in the drama. There's some wonderfully gay and graphic, stuff about the couple's left-handed courtship at an alpine resort and in his \\"digs.\\" And there's a heart-rending sequence of her tráiling him through London's night clubs and pubs toward the end. But nowhere—not even when she gives him his final walking papers at the close—is it clear what's going on inside her. Or what's going on inside him.This is particularly disappointing because the picture is so handsomely produced in CinemaScope and color and so magnificiently played. In addition to the people mentioned, Eric Portman is intriguing in the role of a mysterious unfrocked physician","excerpt":"Moira Lister is tricky as a girl who lives by her physical attractions and Arthur Hill is fine as a fly-boy friend.

Such is the sparkling case in his adaptation of his play \\"Who Is Sylvia?\\" now more pointedly titled \\"The Man Who Loved Redheads.\\" The picture was introduced at the Paris Theatre yesterday.With the aid of an expert cast and a director endowed with a deft, comic touch and a high regard for the subtleties of the English language, Mr. Rattigan and the producers have created a charming lark, light as a zephyr and just as welcome these days.His frothy plot is not labyrinthine. And with the guidance of a wry, off-screen commentary by Kenneth More, it is obvious at once that it will not be treated ponderously. Mr. Rattigan's sly fiction, it is safe to assume, might be the dream of many men. He is concerned with the male worship of one ideal feminine face. And he is also dealing with the type who attempts to enjoy simultaneously domesticity and extra-curricular love while keeping them separate.Perhaps a viewer will find these aspects of the saga faintly reminiscent of \\"The Captain's Paradise,\\" but this is coincidental, as they say in the movies. Specifically, this gossamer tale spans something like half a century in the life of Mark, Lord Binfield, a budding statesman, who falls in love at 14 (\\"for eternity\\") with an auburn-haired lass, Sylvia, two years his senior. Although he weds another lady, the memory of this paragon never fades.The fates, of course, take a hand in the matter when he runs into a Cockney miss with the haunting face of his dreams. It is 1917, and a friend in the Army is willing to let our smitten Lothario borrow his diggings for a tryst. In fact, this buddy agrees to rent his cozy nest, complete with an understanding butler. Thereafter a succession of pseudo-Sylvias parades in review up to an ironic denouement that is fairly transparent, but which cheerfully stresses our hero's sad deflation and the clear view he gets, at long last, of his tactful and ever-loving wife.In essaying the roles of the \\"redheads,\\" Moira Shearer has developed acting talents that are both surprising and refreshing. The ballerina, noted for her performance in \\"Tales of Hoffmann,\\" moves gracefully from the role of a dewy-eyed 16-year-old, to a mincing Cockney, to a temperamental but tender Russian première danseuse and, finally, to a smart manikin. And a good glimpse of her dancing range is evident in an artistic interpretation of an excerpt from Tchaikovsky's \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" ballet, as well as a few steps from a spirited Charleston.John Justin's amorous diplomat is a man willing to take a sporting chance, but one who is harried by conscience. It is a restrained but shaded characterization, especially in one scene in which his son, played in quiet, polished style by Denholm Elliott, discovers his father's double life. Gladys Cooper contributes a delightful bit as the civilized wife who gently reveals her knowledge of the secret, as well as her constancy. And Roland Culver is genuinely funny as the bumbling sidekick.One might expect more vivid hues of Technicolor than the slightly faded shades seen here. But Mr. Rattigan's situations and dialogue never lack for color and his lightweight dig at dalliance is a pleasure.

Marie Alston, 76, no longer sleeps in her apartment and enters only with a surgical mask tethered to her face. Her stucco walls sprout black wisps of Stachybotrys atra, a highly toxic organism she blames for skin rashes, heart palpitations and respiratory problems. The mold, she says, has killed her parakeets, tropical fish and house plants. \\"For years, everyone thought I was crazy,\\" said Ms. Alston, a retired nurse. \\"Now at least I'm not the only one complaining.\\"         NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: KIPS BAY","excerpt":"Moldy Walls Put Tenants on Edge"},{"year":"1930","title":"Meeting of Greens Section","excerpt":"mole cricket pronounced deadly enemy of links Mole Cricket Pronounced Deadly Enemy Of Links at Greenkeepers' Meeting Here"},{"year":"1929","title":"Hawthorne PRINCE PAT VICTOR","excerpt":"MOLE HILL SECOND; Hawthorne Feature Is Captured by Three D's Farm Entry by a Length.

In the play, which has been variously translated as ''The Robust Invalid'' and ''The Gay Invalid,'' the patient needs the doctor in order to believe he's sick, or sicker than he really is.

But while Mr. Wegman's subjects,  being Weimaraners, look mostly soulful, doleful or moderately embarrassed, Vivian Olausen, a housewife now in her 70's, can personify any affect you can name. And what a game gal she is! In MOTHER (Penguin Studio, $24.95), she allows herself to be dressed up in frumpy housedresses and ratty furs, bedraggled hats and hideous wigs, and, in more than 50 deliriously funny pictures, submitted to any number of indignities. There is a program here: many of the images are a commentary on the lot of women in the 1950's, a period when, Ms. Olausen believes, depressed housewives dragged themselves to the cocktail cabinet or medicine chest for relief (see \\"Mother's Little Helpers,\\" with Mother spaced out on Valium). Mrs. Olausen, on the other hand, remembers the decade as  one in which she had fun pottering around the house and entertaining, and everyone drank (see \\"Mother as Enabler\\"). But while the pictures of Mother carrying a huge wooden cross through the supermarket or chained to an ironing board or, best of all, in pink baby-doll pajamas and marabou mules (pace Marabel Morgan) make a feminist point, others transcend dogma to attain an almost Monty  Pythonesque lunacy. Only consider \\"Mommy Deer,\\" in which Mrs. Olausen, antlered  and befurred, is tied to the roof of a car. Worth noting, too, that the car is a Plymouth Volare, one of a vast number of authentic, and frequently covetable, props and artifacts that repay careful study. (Remember Ike buttons?

In the restaurant's backroom, Mr. Zanes (who was the lead singer and songwriter for the Del Fuegos through the 1980's) performs roots-rock music for children -- much of it from the new band's first album, ''Rocket Ship Beach,'' which includes appearances by Sheryl Crow, Suzanne Vega and Lisa Loeb. Apparently, ''Polly Wolly Doodle,'' Bob Dylan-style, has charms that extend beyond the toddler set: in the audience last Sunday were Gwyneth Paltrow, Stella McCartney and Liv Tyler. The Sunday before, David Duchovny and T&#233;a Leoni followed their daughter onto the dance floor. The response has inspired Mr. Zanes to start his own record label, Festival Five Records, on which the band's second album is scheduled for release in September.
