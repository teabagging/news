Franjo Cardinal Seper of Zagreb could then say, \\"I am not at all optimistic that celibacy is in fact being observed.\\" At that synod, nearly half the bishops voted in favor of a married priesthood.   My 25-year study of the practice of celibacy among Catholic priests in the United States, \\"A Secret World: Sexuality and the Search for Celibacy\\" (New York) demonstrates that Cardinal Seper's misgivings were well founded. Celibacy is not a very successful discipline.   Other bishops, like Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago, did speak up recently at the Vatican and are to be commended for their honesty in attempting to address problems related to sexuality and priesthood. But most statements avoid the key issues -- the celibate structure of the church hierarchy, which defends, encourages and in some cases produces psychosexual immaturity and even sexual aberration in clergymen. A more sophisticated selection of candidates will not solve that problem.    To concentrate on a \\"better image\\" of the priesthood, in the phrase of Bishop John Marshall of Burlington, Vt., or to argue defensively that the church is countercultural, as does Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk, head of the United States Bishops' Conference, misses the point: celibacy in the Roman Catholic priesthood needs a fundamental reformation -- for the whole church, both clergy and laity alike.

Parts of this old Ufa film are peculiarly ingenious, but it is so old-fashioned in its acting and in the make-up of the players that it affords quite a good deal of amusement. It is a picture that if anything elicits sympathy for the apaches, for while they are fools they do at times show flashes of intelligence. On the other hand the so-called American reformers (made in Germany) have ideas about up-lifting the cabarets of the Boulevard de Clichy in Paris and to shame the blackguards into taking the narrow path, the Uncle, Aunt and niece act in such a way that would cause one to suspect that they were lunatics at large.The girl, whose mouth is doctored with make-up to obtain the cupid's bow effect, wears about as much jewelry as she can conveniently carry. The Uncle affects a cap, and while he pretends to frown on strong drink, when he tastes wine, his expression is quite beatific. The German producers meant to prod America with drinking as well as the reform idea.The pseudo hero happens to be an apache. Call him Montmorency, after the dog in \\"Three Men in a Boat,\\" because he hasn't got a name. Montmorency meets the fair (she hasn't a name either, but she looks as if she would turn her head if one shouted Bedelia) creature, henceforth known as Bedelia. Montmorency has eyes like a Christmas doll and ideas on dress that hover between those of a careless fishmonger and a commonplace Chicago thug. In short, Montmorency snatches from Bedelia's wrist a bracelet which must have cost, roughly, $75,000. Bedelia is credulous. Her eyes are etched with mascaro, with a penciled arch above them. The lashes are fairly distinct. Whether in anger, repose, amusement or love, the expression in these blue orbs changes but little. The same thought always seems to be in them, and that thought may have been: \\"Will I, I wonder, make good in this picture? I think I ought to knock them cold.\\"This clever Bedelia only discovers her loss when she reaches her hotel, and not long afterward Montmorency, eyes glazed with admiration, returns the piece of jewelry, and from then on to the closing cuddle and kiss, it is certain that Bedelia unwittingly is going to uplift one apache by marrying him.In one chapter of this absurd fable there is a French Hawkshaw who tells the three reformers that, while it may astonish Uncle, Aunt and Bedelia, the girl suddenly could lose a piece of jewelry and recover it in less than ten minutes. This Hawkshaw arises from the table, stands behind Bedelia and forthwith, unknown, of course, to the damsel, removes her diamond pin and puts it in his pocket. A murderous apache (quite a sympathetic chap), unknown to Hawkshaw, deftly takes the pin from the detective's pocket, and then Hawkshaw, for a few moments, is more than slightly embarrassed. Montmorency, whose doll-like eyes have seen the dark deed, quickly gains possession of the diamond pin and attaches it to Bedelia's gown, to the surprise and relief of Hawkshaw.Uncle and Aunt and also Bedelia continue their strange efforts to reform Paris, until Montmorency takes Bedelia in his arms.On the same program is that stirring short film, \\"Killing the Killer,\\" depicting a remarkable battle between a mongoose and a cobra.
