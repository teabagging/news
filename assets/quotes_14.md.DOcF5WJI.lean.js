It was directed by Jacques Feyder, a Frenchman, who, it may be remembered, produced \\"Faces of Children\\" and the shadow version of \\"Carmen,\\" with Raquel Meller. It was made in Germany with both French and German players.The technical side of this picture may not be up to Hollywood standards, but the manner in which the story is told is most impressive. M. Feyder exacts your attention and except for one or two minor shortcomings his presentation of this drama is trenchant. Because a murder is committed by means of drowning it will at once bring to mind something of \\"An American Tragedy,\\" and also F. W. Murnau's motion picture, \\"Sunrise,\\" which was an adaptation of Sudermann's \\"Trip to Tilsitt.\\"This \\"Shadows of Fear,\\" as it is called on the screen, is a production that sinks into one's mind and even the individual characters will be remembered. It is an excellent example of sustained suspense in all its chapters and, while the chronicle is unpleasant, it is filmed with an intelligent conception of human psychology. Its restraint is another point in its favor.The characters are admirably drawn, even to the manifestation of nervousness on the part of Thérèse's detestable husband. His artist friend, Laurent, undertakes to paint Michauds portrait, and the romance between Laurent and Thérèse begins behind the easel as the unsuspecting husband is seated in frock coat and white tie in the big chair.Laurent finally decides to get Michaud out of the way. They hire a boat during a carnival and Michaud, Thérèse and Laurent go forth one night on the water. M. Feyder gives at first no conception of how the drowning occurred. He waits until it is time to turn a flashback. Immediately after the drowning of Michaud cries for help are heard, and those who go to the rescuse discover Laurent and the almost unconscious Thérèse near the boat, which is filled with water, but apparently still floating.No suspicion is attached to the two. But their guilty consciences shadow them constantly. When some time later Laurent and Thérèse are wedded they have a frightful quarrel and the almost crazed Laurent rips off the wall the painting of Michaud. The noise brings up the old aunt, Michaud's mother, and she hears the truth about her son's death and falls unconscious. Laurent and Thérèse finally become more composed, evidently thinking over the fact that their secret is out. Then they discover that the old woman is paralyzed from head to foot, being able only to use her eyes. The artist and Thérèse bear with this old woman's steady stare for quite a long while, but in the end life becomes so filled with torture that they take poison.It is heavy, gruesome, but M. Feyder's admirable work makes it an impressive study, and perhaps because the husband was despicable and the other two deserved their horrible existence and fate, it is not depressing.Gina Marus gives a most understanding portrayal of the rôle of Thérèse. H. A. Schlettow, one of Germany's most able actors, is capital as Laurent. Charles Barrois as Michaud makes every gesture and expression tell. He is the accountant, adding up figures. He is the little-minded man who would like to meet some of Laurent's models, an idea that makes the character repugnant. The other players also do their share to make this an unusually worthy effort, black though the tale be.

And the Soviet film, \\"The Last Hill,\\" which celebrates the heroism of that defense, is strictly in the tradition of a legendary report. This film, now showing at the Stanley, is as thoroughly and obviously removed from documentary recital as have been some of Hollywood's noisiest films.It purports to tell the story of a group of Russian sailors from a destroyer who join the defenders of the city after their ship has been sunk and give their lives in the effort to hold the last critical hill. The five key sailors in this saga are encouraged in their heroic attempt by the pretty blonde widow of a soldier who was earlier killed in the defense.As a purely emotional idealization of Russian courage and self-sacrifice, this picture has certain selling-points. It is expansively valorous, and it images Russian determination in tremendously robust terms. But it is utterly unrealistic in conception and performance all the way—at least, to the eye of a person viewing it from this point in time and space. The limitation of the action to the experience of a handful of men and the extravagance of their acting make it seem a script-writer's dream. If this sort of film were turned out by a Hollywood studio, it would be labeled the worst sort of \\"whoop-la.\\" And there is no reason why \\"The Last Hill\\" should not be.

At least they seem so. Furthermore, Artkino, the distributor, calls the Stanley's tenant a typical \\"new\\" Soviet export under last year's film edict prescribing more love and fewer tractors.Well acted by a good cast, and with a handsome color production that affords some striking glimpses of a bustling Moscow, the import remains a slow, meandering and even oblique approach to a perfectly comprehensible emotional crisis.As the picture opens (with becoming bluntness), a middle-aged engineer makes an agonized decision to forsake his loving wife, a son and three ideal in-laws for his mistress. With the various reactions of these decent, civilized people—all of them—set forth in simple terms, there is real pathos and persuasiveness, as long as the picture sticks to the immediate business at hand.However the emotional continuity in persistently broken by the graceless direction of K. Pyryev, who wrote the scenario with the Tur Brothers. At times, the action stops for a stream of reminiscences about the citizen's duty to the state. At others, the principals even toss off a song, apparently just for the fun of it. And the entire picture, which unfolds against a May Day celebration background, is riddled with attractive but meaningless scenes, as happy throngs spill over what looks to be the entire city. The couple, incidentally, is reunited in a melodramatic climax. That it matters at all must be attributed to sheer dint of acting.As the tormented pair, L. Gallis and N. Ladynina are really outstanding. Excellent in their briefer roles are S. Romodanov, V. Toporkov, N. Grebeshkova, A. Mikhailov and S. Chekan. If only Mosfilm productions had told a simple story simply. The Screen: 'Devotion'","excerpt":"Russian Import Has Debut at Stanley"},{"year":"1957","title":"\\"GIFT FOR MUSIC,\\" a boy Russian import about a boy prodigy of the piano, is a film primarily for children, the second to arrive during the last week.Add, now, to Walt Disney's \\"Johnny Tremain,\\" this happy, wholesome close-up of the junior division of the Moscow Music Conservatory, unveiled Saturday, by Artkino, at the Cameo. If neither is first-rate, by any standards, both remain movies that the small fry can rightfully claim as their own, to enjoy and even profit by. There are precious few.The most disarming aspect of this Gorky Studio product, directed and produced by Maria Fyodorova, is its rapt pride in the talented Russian kids. American parents, trying to drag a young \\"mule\\" to musical water, would do well to expose the offspring to these sparkling and dedicated youngsters.In their small, expert hands, various excerpts from Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Grieg fly past like lightning. But the same, unfortunately, cannot be said of a lightweight but punctiliously interfering plot that continually halts the musical flow.The eager-faced hero, Andryusha Demyanov, is a war orphan befriended by a conductor and a professor, who becomes the pride and joy of the school in the climatic recital. The fly in the ointment is a jealous, rival pianist, a chubby lad named Misha Tyagunov, who struts and sulks through the picture like a baby Mussolini, all but stealing it.As the two guiding adults Leonid Gallis and Grigory Belov are excellent, and their utterances on sportsmanship and manliness should make good, thoughtful listening for young audiences.The cold fact remains that the picture's first half uses every excuse to keep its sensitive little hero off the piano bench, where he emphatically belongs. Not for a good forty minutes are we treated to one selection in its entirety, when a rubbery-fingered lass polishes off the Beethoven \\"Rondo.\\" It seems a long wait indeed from Master Demyanov's early \\"Swan Lake\\" improvising to the finale, a condensed (apparently) movement from a concerto of Leonid Afanasyev.As for the boy's shark-like attack on this splashy, colorful number, reminiscent of both Prokofieff and Gershwin—wow! The loveliest musical interlude — complete, actually—is a youthful trio's simple rendition of Glinka's \\"The Lark.\\"Alert parents, who might wonder if the film's title applies to someone at home, now have a chance to get some interesting, young reactions first-hand.

Perhaps the Cannes jury was simply jolted by the very idea of a tender, idyllic and extended love interlude from the U. S. S. R., as penned by G. Koltunov.But forget the sensitive emoting of Oleg Strizhenov and Izolda Izvitskaya. Forget their rather tedious trek across a desert, in a stranded Bolshevik safari, before they are paired off on that island. And forget, even, that the new lovers' political arguing is presented with curiously detached compassion by the stoical Russian film people. In this commendably simple but familiar tale from afar, it is the photography alone that counts, and magnificently.For here is the second color import from the Crimean sector in recent months (\\"The Mexican\\" also featured Mr. Strizhenov) where the sound track hardly matters as the backgrounds smite the eye. As the stranded caravan straggles across the Kara Kum sands toward the Aral Sea, camera man S. Urusevsky wondrously frames the travelers, their camels, their officer captive and some random Mongolians against a burnished canvas.And never, we'll vow, was a remote lovers' island so poetically set afloat in such a visual swirl of clouds, moonlight, waves and curling tides. Oddly enough, Miss Izvitskaya and Mr. Strizhenov aren't quite overpowered by nature, and the picture ends in a tragic endorsement of the lady's contention that Bolshevik might makes right.\\"The Forty-first\\" (Miss Izvitskaya kills forty-one enemy officers) unfortunately never catches up with the genius behind the camera.

A1    The United Nations flew 186 children and 50 other refugees from Kisangani, Zaire, to Rwanda.   A12     Mexico Reforms Drug Force  Mexico dismantled its main anti-drug force, which was disgraced in February when its director was discovered to be working for traffickers.

With balancing the budget made easier, officials said a deal between President Clinton and Congress was possible within hours.   A1    The Senate tried to use a flood-relief bill to grab an advantage in the budget negotiations. President Clinton threatened to veto it.

The film tends to show that the brain of the dog, frog, hippopotamus or ape as well as that of the child or adult all operate on exactly the same principles. It is the result of experiments during the last twenty-eight years in the laboratory of Professor Ivan Paviov, who received the Nobel Prize for his work with the so-called \\"conditioned reflex.\\"\\"Human beings learn such processes as eating in exactly the same way that animals must learn these processes,\\" said Dr. Howard Scott Liddell, Professor of Physiology in Cornell University, in his talk accompanying the film. \\"An animal could build up in time eating rituals as complicated as those of human beings if it were not for the limitations imposed by the smaller capacity of the animal cortex.\\"Subjects Considered Machines.The film, surveying animal and human behavior, pictures the mechanisms which are necessary for simple as well as complicated types of behavior, so that both the animal and the human being are considered as machines. Pavlov dismantles these machines to show how they are constructed.\\"The result of this mechanical view of behavior is that all behavior can be analyzed into reflexes, a re-flex being the response of the animal to a change of environment which involves the nervous system,\\" Professor Liddell explained. \\"According to Pavlov, the reflex is a mechanism because it always occurs with machinelike regularity whenever conditions remain the same. So-called spontaneous or voluntary activities of animals or man seem to be capricious and not reducible to mechanical conditions.\\"When, however, proper precautions are taken spontaneity or capriciousness disappears, and by careful analysis and experiment even the most complicated behavior can be shown to occur invariably according to laws which can be formulated definitely.\\"Elaborate experiments with dogs, cows, frogs and apes, as well as children and adults, were shown to support this theory.Ape and Baby Compared.One experiment compares the ways in which an ape and a baby learn to associate environment with food, fear and play, tending to show there is no essential difference. When a red ball is shown to the ape, the animal immediately drops whatever it is doing and runs for food. It shows no reaction when the experiment is repeated with a blue ball.A dog is shown which had learned to associate 78 vibrations on the metronome with food, but reminds unaffected when the number of vibrations is 200. In the same way, an elephant received a coin with his trunk and, having learned to associate it with food, immediately takes it to the keeper and exchanges it for meat and potatoes.The first and only public showing of the film in New York City will be held on March 19 at the Engineers Club in connection with a lecture explaining the work of Pavlov. It will be under the auspices of the New School for Social Research and the American Society for Cultural Relations with Russia.

It consists of \\"Life in the Arctic,\\" a Soviet feature-length actuality film, and a cartoon feature, \\"Snegurochka\\" (\\"The Snow Maiden\\"), produced by the Russian Soyuzmultfilm Studio.Of the two, the Arctic documentary has by far the more attractive qualities, it being a first-rate observation, in excellent color, of fish, bird and animal life in and along the polar sea. Though serene in its factual presentation of remarkable close-up views of polar bears, sea lions, Arctic foxes, gulls, eagles, mollusks, walruses and fish, it is casually punctuated with several tense and exciting sequences.Most striking of these is a scene in which a polar bear attacks and destroys a mother seal, which makes itself a decoy to attract the bear away from its helpless pup. There is also a fascinating sequence showing sea-gulls driving an eagle from their rookery, and a lively and amusing stretch of footage recounting the adventures of a young polar bear. \\"Life in the Arctic\\" has an English commentary and waves absolutely no political flags.\\"Snegurochka\\" is a crude imitation of the style and spirit of Walt Disney's \\"Snow White.\\" Its drawing and animation are surprisingly primitive and its color is disappointingly dull. The story is that of the snow maiden who is sent in the spring by Father Frost to dwell among the people of a tiny village and there falls in love with Lell, the sun. The one attractive feature of the picture is the familiar music of Rimsky-Korsakov, which is sung well by dubbed-in voices and the chorus of the Bolshoi Theatre.
