It offers some engaging pieces, although the primary contribution is the scope it suggests for the theme.\\n\\nIn terms of scale, for example, the range is from Sharon Ligorner's tiny fantasy-fish images, which are transformed by collage and presented on matchbooks, to Jean-Marie Martin's seven-foot \\"East River,\\" which places simulated and real elements, including a light fixture, in a large mock gold frame to suggest a landscape and to symbolize the preciousness of light, air, earth and water. \\n\\nWith regard to materials and their interpretations, the approaches cover a broad span, too, ranging from Keith Long's reliance on a single medium, recycled-wood fragments, to Charlotte Brown's evocative, sometimes sensuous, combinations of a dozen or more ingredients, including handmade paper, collage, thread, glass and Mylar, which become incongruous yet beautifully mysterious boxes holding objects that have the resonance of private memories. \\n\\nWhen independent, conceptual or semiconceptual ideas are part of what is layered into the construction, the results can be particularly effective. Ellen Sullivan's small iconic pieces might involve just three cylindrical jars. But when one in the sequence is swaddled in old gauze or caked with cracking paint, their sense of relevance to both past and present helps make the assemblage strangely and hauntingly powerful. \\n\\nCamille Caggiano's appealing assemblages fabricate a small intricately detailed setting by using bits and pieces of plastic figures, beads and cutouts. Filled with rich puns and double meanings, they are absurd but timely. \\n\\nMore somber messages, including philosophical musings about death are woven into Louise Weinberg's brightly colored constructions. One of her best pieces is a windowless house bearing the sign \\"Fetish for Obsessive Love.\\" \\n\\nPhotography has enormous potential for leading the mind toward layered sequences of images. Examples by Stanislaus Dubowski, Paul Glorioso and Annette Merlis hint at that in different ways. Mr. Dubowski's chromogenic color composites present the illogical, but are the most straighforward. His \\"Wading River\\" creates a vertical stack of the same plate of fruit seen from four distinct angles to give the impression of shifting viewing positions on the part of the observer. \\n\\nThe conceptual challenges are more subtle in Ms. Merlis's \\"Omen,\\" which superimposes a nearly abstract skyscape photograph over a chalky, vigorously brushed, loosely interpreted landscape. One element is a record, the other a suggestion.  Greatly enlarged antique portrait photographs personalize Mr. Glorioso's largest assemblage, which is constructed from old weathered windows and other components that conjure a dwelling. Some of the three-dimensional additions can be as delicate as a candle or a vase of flowers, and those tend to give the sculpture the appearance of an altar honoring nostalgia. \\n\\nCollage is the starting point for Suzan Jivan, who combines color illustrations of famous paintings with those from product advertising, and for Kathy Frey, whose ordered patterns of common debris offer a certain social content. \\nModern Meets the Masses: 1910-1920\\n The Parrish Art Museum, 25 Jobs La., Southampton. Mondays and Thursdays through Saturdays 11 A.M. to 5 P.M.  and Sundays 1 to 5. To April 10. \\n\\nIn the museum world there is a trend toward developing exhibitions that relate art to a broader context.  This second effort in a collaborative program between the Parrish and the Southampton School District is in that vein, and the students, working with an advisory panel, have produced a show with many elements that should be crowd pleasers.\\n\\nIncluded are Charlie Chaplin, Mack Sennett and D. W. Griffiths films, jazz highlights that can be selected from a computer and early motoring costumes on loan from the Bridgehampton Historical Society. \\n\\nAnother local spin, and a strong touch, is a section devoted to the World War I history of Camp Upton in Yaphank. The best of the art borrowed from other institutions includes George Bellows's wonderful circus painting, very good pieces by Stanton MacDonald Wright and Marguerite Zorach and Marcel Duchamp's \\"Boite en Valise.\\" \\n\\nThe central theme of the exhibition deals with the arrival of modern-art styles in this country and the transition from traditional modes to the more avant-garde. The established art history is taken quite seriously.\\n\\nExamples of the 19th-century idyllic pastoral attitudes are present to contrast with the change in subject matter shown by John Sloan's seamy tenement scenes and the change in style revealed by the exuberant and fragmented sea and cityscapes by John Marin. In portraiture, too, one can see the transition from conventional approaches to the simplified expressive linear treatments of Eli Nadelman and Abraham Walkowitz. \\n\\nCentral to the art story is the impact of the 1913 Armory Show. To suggest the weight of that event, which introduced the work of many major Europeans to the United States, as many of the right people as possible have been included, like Braque, Cezanne and Gauguin, even if they could be represented by just a small etching or lithograph. The Braque, nevertheless, demonstrates the innovative Cubist surface faceting, while the Gauguin nicely shows the artist's flattened, synthesized forms. \\n\\nIt is good to see how the examination of a specific period will provide an opportunity to reconsider noteworthy work by artists who are now footnotes to history. Such is the case with Robert W. Chanler's oil-on-glass study for one of his eight screens that decorated the entrance to the Armory Show.

She twirled around in a velvet frock and tossed her hair around, rocker style. She punched her fist into the air. But when the spotlight on the drums and the guitarist faded, and Ms. King sat at the piano, her fans quickly turned silent. They were rapt in anticipation of what old songs she would sing, of what little piece of life Ms. King would lay bare with her lyrics.\\n\\nThat the theater's sound technicians twisted knobs from \\"muddy\\" at the beginning of the evening to \\"extra loud\\" for the duration was only a minor irritation: Ms. King's performance was effervescent. Thoughtfully planned and loosely executed, Ms. King easily balanced old and new material. Never folky, maudlin or cabaretlike, Ms. King's performance combined the best of singer-songwriter sensibilities and rambunctious showmanship. Some of her moves seemed calculated (like the inclusion of a black choir for two songs), and some of her newer songs, like \\"Hold On,\\" sounded like positive-thinking tracts. As she performed a song co-written with Mariah Carey, \\"If It's Over,\\" Ms. King screeched through a note Ms. Carey probably would have hit precisely. Her encore included \\"Been to Canaan,\\" \\"You've Got a Friend\\" and the Little Eva classic \\"The Locomotion,\\" which Ms. King co-wrote with Gerry Goffin.

CECIL BEATON, who died six years ago at the age of 76, was an English photographer, set designer, illustrator, portraitist and writer. Critics used to argue over whether he was a true artist in any of these pursuits or merely slick. But on one point everybody, tout le monde, agreed. Cecil Beaton was a great snob. He was not just a big snob but a great snob, an ingenious snob and a daredevil on top of that, a perfect snob and a snob clear through. So much so, that this book by Hugo Vickers, the biographer Beaton chose shortly before he died, turns out to be something Beaton may not have envisioned: an enormous, sloughing, tireless, unsparing, inch-by-inch trench-warfare chronicle of an English snob's progress through the 20th century.   Snob is a purely English term. There is no direct translation of the word in any other language. The French were reduced to importing it intact as le snob.

After you have sat through the featured photoplay, you come to this real feature of the bill. It's only some two or three reels long and it makes no pretentions as to plot or magnificence of setting. It probably cost less than one reel of the intercontinental concoction which precedes it. But there is more genuine entertainment in any hundred feet of it than in all the celluloid mile of agony and adventure that prolongs the heavy hour of the photoplay.\\"In this \\"Fruits of Faith\\" Will Rogers enters as a hobo without particular destination and only a general location somewhere west of the cactus line. He has only one problem in life—how to eat and at the same time avoid work. He is successful at once so far as work is concerned. He just won't, and that's all there is to it. But the problem of eating is not so easily solved—until an itinerant preacher brings the message of faith. He says, in effect, \\"If you don't see what you want, pray for it,\\" and the tramp decides to give the thing a trial. He prays for food and the paper bag in which a passing stranger is carrying groceries bursts open at his feet.And so on through some twenty or thirty minutes of slender story made human and humorous by the humanness and humor of Will Rogers. There would be little or nothing to the picture without him, of course—that is, without him and the baby and the mule. He finds the other two in the desert and adopts them. And he has ways of his own with both. Although the baby is not named on the program it is Mr. Rogers's own. No one has said so, but any strange child handled the way Rogers bundles this husky youngster about would certainly register long and continuous objections. The little quadruped in the picture enjoys it, however. He's been used to it ever since he was born, probably, and would wonder what was the matter if, for example, he was carried any other way than by the back of his belt, hanging down like a traveling bag.At the end the picture becomes somewhat moral and sentimental, but only briefly and to a moderate degree, not enough to dull the points of its humor, nor those of its satire, or banter, either.\\"Drums of Fate,\\" the photoplay mentioned, and passed over, above, is about a supercivilized girl who loves big men and strong and marries one, an African explorer with a thick mustache, but commits bigamy by marrying a crippled musician when she receives the false news of her first husband's death at the hands of savages. Husband No. 1 turns up again, of course, but dashes back into the jungle when he finds his place occupied. The musician dies, however, and then the girl is free to follow her true lord into the camp of musical comedy savages with whom he has sought to escape from the world. The only real acting in the piece is done by Fawcett, who doesn't have much of a chance as the girl's guardian, and Casson Ferguson, who makes the most of the musician's r$#244","excerpt":"le.Also at the Rialto is another Music Film in Prizma colors, a pleasant little bit of \\"The Mirror\\" dance done by the Fairbanks Twins.
