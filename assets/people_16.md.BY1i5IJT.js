In fact, the name \\"sick building syndrome\\" has been given to an array of symptoms among office workers that are sometimes associated with indoor pollution.   In part, the problem can be attributed to the increased energy efficiency of modern buildings. Because of better insulation and a tendency to let in less fresh air, the air becomes stale and contaminants linger. The latest standards recommended by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning require four times as much outside air as older standards. The challenge is to improve air quality without increasing energy bills as fresh air is brought into the building.

You could say that it's the novelistic equivalent of Sandy Wilson poking fun, in &#8220;The Boy Friend,&#8221; at his equally obviously adored twenties musical comedies &#8212; except that Goldman goes even further. He has set up the story with an intro telling how as a boy, he loved having his father read him the alleged S. Morgenstern classic, but that when he himself gave the book to his 10 &#8208; year &#8208; old son, the kid stopped reading after an early chapter. Goldman goes on to say that he then actually read the book for the first time and found that his father, in reading aloud to him, had simply and wisely skipped or telescoped the boring parts, hence this &#8220;good parts&#8221; version &#8220;abridged&#8221; by Goldman. He keeps breaking up the narrative with red&#8208;inked passages, explaining what he's cut here and why.
