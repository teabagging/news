One of these is John Mortimer, an  Englishman best known in this country for his mystery stories starring the comic and gallant barrister Horace Rumpole. Mr. Mortimer knows his territory, and his  comments on the vagaries of the English legal system and the small value it places on common sense and moral standards are as sharp as ever in RUMPOLE AND THE ANGEL OF DEATH (Viking, $22.95), the 10th volume of stories in the series. In Rumpole, Mr. Mortimer has created a wonderfully durable and attractive character, henpecked as a husband but masterful with a jury, an honest man whose only cause is \\"preventing the conviction of the innocent.\\" Rumpole's true home is the courtroom, but we are also made privy to life in the gloomy flat in Froxbury Mansions where he exists in pitiful thralldom to his wife, Hilda, otherwise known as She Who Must Be Obeyed. This moniker notwithstanding, the forbidding Hilda has occasional moments of decency, and Rumpole fans will be amused to find one story narrated by Hilda herself, in which she reveals surprisingly romantic yearnings as she contemplates an affair with a smarmy colleague of her husband's. In his happy ability to play a seemingly infinite number of diverting variations on the same theme, in the fluidity and panache of his prose, his combination of high intelligence and low foolery, John Mortimer is worthy of comparison to P. G. Wodehouse. \\"Rumpole and the Angel of Death,\\" like all of the preceding Rumpole volumes, makes for ideally civilized light reading.

The play has been at the center of one of the most furious controversies in the theater in years, even though few people in New York have seen it. The brouhaha began earlier this year after the New York Theater Workshop announced that it was delaying the play.

Fräken Tidblad, as the shepherdess whose love, first for a handsome neighbor youth (Sven Bergvall) and then for a stray lambkin, forms the basis of the action, has a certain calm charm that becomes more appealing as the film unrolls. The acting of the principals and their supporters is good and the direction is effective, despite the fact that the picture is rather lengthy.
