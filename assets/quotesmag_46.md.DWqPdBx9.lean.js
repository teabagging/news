In the popular vote, the Tories did not do as well as 1979. Their 42 percent was down about a point. But the winner-take-all, singleseat constituency system gave them 397 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons and increased their majority from 33 to 144 over the combined opposition. Labor, with 28 percent of the popular vote - and 209 seats - lost almost seven points because of defections to the Social Democrats and a radical-sounding platform that turned off many voters. Most of the defectors did well, as did the Liberals, but the Alliance's popular vote (25.8 percent) was spread so widely that it could win only 23 seats, or less than 4 percent of the House.
