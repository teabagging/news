But this king-sized cad's vehicle moves erratically over too long a trail. Although attempts are made to dissect a complex character who charms a covey of beauteous women and gullible men to build a quick fortune in the stock market, it is only absorbing as melodrama. \\"Death of a Scoundrel\\" seems to have no point of view as drama.Although some viewers may find this fiction vaguely reminiscent of the storied career and unsolved death of a local financier and gallant, it should be pointed out that it is presented as an original script by Charles Martin, who also produced and directed. In this instance, Mr. Sanders is a callous but suave European opportunist who gets to America simply by informing on his brother. That luckless gent is killed by the police.Once here, the long arm of coincidence, abetted by a succession of rich and poor (but always lovely) ladies, helps our schemer on his quick ascent to a Park Avenue mansion and riches. The labyrinthine plot notwithstanding, suffice it to say that our manipulator incurs the enmity of a platoon of patsies, male and female, before he gets his come-uppance.It should be mentioned, however, that the scenarist-director apparently was not certain whether to make his central character a complete villain or merely a dastard with some decency. As the story is unfolded in flashback, he is shown as being contrite on occasion. He begs for his mother's forgiveness although he has wounded her to the quick. He changes his mind about ruining the career of the decorative young actress who spurned his advances. And he does an about-face in admitting that he loves the girl he dragged from the gutter to financial respectability. In short, it is often difficult to ascertain whether our \\"scoundrel\\" really deserves that designation.As the hero-villain, Mr. Sanders is thoroughly at home in the role. He is urbane, elegant and deft with the upper and lower crust whom he blithely opportunes to a fare-thee-well. Yvonne De Carlo does a solid and professional job as the adoring petty thief who rises to eminence with him.Zsa Zsa Gabor is strikingly blond and gowned as the society widow with an exotic accent whom he charms. Nancy Gates, as the young actress","excerpt":"Lisa Ferraday, the ill-fated widow of his brother; Celia Lorsky as the heart-broken mother, and Coleen Gray, as the wife of a woman-chasing industrialist, briefly but competently support his portrayal.

The show is the second in a three-part series the museum is staging of contemporary American Indian work, in this case by artists of the Plains, Prairie, Plateau and Pacific cultures in the United States and Canada, along with those of Alaska and Hawaii. The artists' concerns range from cultural and political issues, as in the power-and-real-estate game of Monopoly translated by Gerald Clarke into a race relations engagement called ''Ethnopoly''; to the taking of traditional form beyond function, as in the Alaskan-born Jerry Jacob Laktonen's ''Dream Paddles,'' which reincarnates as objects of sculptural beauty the oars used by generations of American Indians. Ancient techniques like weaving, woodcarving, beading (''Postcard'' above), stitchery and quill and feather work take on new dimensions here, while inventive use is made of newer forms like video, photography, installation art, tattooing, even carving in chocolate. A prime aim of the show is to demonstrate that the American Indian art of today has a distinctive place in the larger art world, a point that it more than makes.
