data from spacecraft confirm predictions that radiation from high-energy particles trapped by Jupiter's magnetic field is roughly 1-million times greater than earth's Van Allen radiation belts; radiation levels recorded by spacecraft reached peak of intensity 90 mins before Pioneer made its closest approach to Jupiter, suggesting that radiation levels vary with planet's latitude; instruments detected much higher number of electrons and energy levels of electrons than had been expected; although proton count of Jupiter's radiation belts was not much higher than those of earth, it was by no means insignificant since 4-million protons passed through detector having size of postage stamp every second during peak intensities; spacecraft indicated that it was bombarded 8 times by micrometeoroids shortly after it entered Jupiter's magnetic field, leading to speculation that Jupiter's powerful gravity is attracting certain amount of fine debris as rate of such micrometeoroid impacts usually occur in interplanetary space only once in 25 days; scientists express relief that spacecraft survived 1st closeup exploration of Jupiter, noting that its sensors were almost saturated with radiation during its closest approach and that its voltage dropped 10% and temperature of its nuclear power generator increased; say spacecraft's outer walls contracted slightly after it had been swept behind Jupiter and out of sun's light but that situation returned to normal after spacecraft's re-emergence on other side of planet;

Before ''You've Got Mail,'' starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks as rival bookstore owners who fall in love by way of e-mail, there was this gem, in which James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play co-workers in a Budapest gift shop who, unbeknownst to each other, have been conducting a romance through the mail. Too bad they can't stand each other. At 10, Judy Garland and Van Johnson set the story to music in ''In the Good Old Summertime.'' That's a little Liza Minnelli in the finale.    9 P.M.

D'Abbie D'Arrast's brilliantly directed comedies. This sparkling affair is known as \\"The Magnificent Flirt,\\" and while the story is no weightier than the bubbles in champagne, it is fashioned so delightfully that yesterday afternoon it kept the audience of young and old in a constant state of glee.\\"The Magnificent Flirt\\" is one of those rarities in which the acting of all the players is of such excellence that it is not a question of criticism or comparison, but rather one of extending praise. As this film is unfurled there are charming dissolves, modernistic conceptions of furnishings, artistic high lights and shadows, coupled with an intelligent and natural development of the various incidents.Mr. D'Arrast has the happy faculty of leaving enough to the imagination, but he puts his episodes together so that the spectator feels that nothing has been held back. Gales of meriment greeted the \\"morning after\\" of Count Castelle and Tim, a gentleman from Indiana. Without giving any direct filming of the nocturnal experiences of these two men, Mr. D'Arrast depicts these citizens of different republics asleep in bed. It is not long before you have more than a foggy notion of the exuberant spirits of the Count and Tim during their early morning hours, for a cabby reports that Castelle and his American friend had bought his (the cabby's) none-toowell nourished horse and therefore the apprehensive butler, after stepping on a stray automobile horn, is compelled to awaken the sleeping men with:\\"The horse is here.\\"First the Count sits up in bed and soon Tim performs the same feat. There is in their actions every evidence of intemperance. The Count finds his voice and says:\\"Send him up,\\" apparently not quite sure at that particular instant of the meaning of the word horse, or, as it was, \\"cheval.\\" The animal is not brought to the bedroom, but there ensues a funny continuation to this stretch as the Count and his American pal gradaully regain their thinking powers.This yarn of a mother and daughter and a Count and his nephew happens within the shadow of the Eifel Tower. Florence Vidor and Albert Conti figure in the featured rôles, those of the mother and the uncle. Ned Sparks impersonates the philandering Tim, and he does so with genius. He portrays the stiff-necked species of water-wagon dodger, to whom the most melodious music is the gurgling of liquor as it is poured from a bottle. He finds even the moving of his eyes an effort after a thick night.The winsome Miss Vidor has not neglected the matter of costumes and neither has Fifi. During one of the episodes it is with distinct chagrin that these two fair creatures discover that they have both invested in identical costumes. Listening to Fifi, Tim urges this young woman to stop bleating, asserting that he never worries because some other man has similar trousers to his.The juvenile romance is supplied by Loretta Young and Matty Kemp. They both respond nicely to Mr. D'Arrast's imaginative direction.Mr. Conti proves himself a formidable rival of Adolphe Menjou. He conveys the Count's feelings by simple expressions. When he makes his final and successful proposal of marriage to Florence Laverne (Miss Vidor) his eyes frequently dispense with the need of a subtitle. In this sequence, Mr. D'Arrast first shows a tête-á-tête dinner being served and then he skips to the demi-tasse stage, and one discovers Florence rubbing the rouge off the Count's lips. The Count by a suspicion of an eyebrow movement permits the butler to appreciate that he (the Count) was not so keen on coffee at that moment and that he does not wish to be disturbed for a while.

A conversation with the Mulleavys -- the sisters behind Rodarte, the year-old California label that's set to show in New York next month -- is an exercise in connecting the dots between Kate Moss, James Joyce, the Temple of Dendur and Clover the orphaned rhino. Their first collection was championed by Cameron Silver, who allowed the girls to use his store, Decades, in Los Angeles, to show Anna Wintour their old-Hollywood-style dresses. They scored a Women's Wear Daily cover, and orders came in from the likes of Kirna Zabête in New York. But Kate and Laura remain charmingly free of pretension. Quite the opposite: how many fashion players do you know who get caught running in museums? Which all goes back to their exotic provenance. To call the sisters and their family the Royal Tenenbaums of Fashion is not an overstatement.    The Mulleavy sisters' first, entirely improvised marketing effort (they are self-taught in all aspects of the business) was the creation of 30 handmade paper dolls, each delivered with a paper armoire containing seven paper Rodarte dresses.    ''Listening to Nirvana was the first time I understood why I tend to go for Tolstoy,'' Kate says of the grunge band's first album, ''Bleach,'' which she describes as extravagantly minimal. ''But what I really find interesting is Hemingway.''    ''Our idea for our spring collection is memories of winter,'' Laura says about their first presentation, to take place during New York's fashion week. One inspiration is this 1973 photograph of their parents' car in Death Valley, dusted with snow.    Their uncle George Rodart is an artist in New York who currently works in aluminum. A cousin, Greg Mullavey (who has moved the E), played Tom Hartman on  ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.'' His father, also Greg, was a coach for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers. Another cousin, Father Bartholomew Ruben de la Torre, entered the Order of Preachers after seven years in L.A. seminaries.    Kate and Laura adore  ''Murder, She Wrote,'' starring Angela Lansbury as a nosy mystery writer who moonlights solving crimes. ''Mysteries are just the best,'' Laura says. ''Kate once had a birthday party that she planned for three months. She wrote her own mystery play, and it was a period piece. She was in third grade.''    They are champion pen pals. One notable correspondence describes their experience researching Robert Rauschenberg's ''Bed'' and then digresses into a discussion of electric tubes and how much their father loves them: ''He still acts like we don't understand why they are so great and always gives us the big long speech about why tubes are an amazing asset to sound and design.''    Their most cherished style icon is Charis Wilson, the muse and second wife of Edward Weston. ''Laura and I have always been obsessed with the idea of an untamed, romantic California, and she is the perfect example,'' Kate says.    ''I'm freaking out -- it's even better than I imagined!'' Laura screams after discovering how this souvenir glove from 1824 may have commemorated the Marquis de Lafayette's visit to America. ''Isn't that genius?''    Laura (left), 25, and Kate (right), 26, live with their parents in Pasadena, Calif., in a cottage at the back of the home that belonged to their grandfather, an engineer on the Manhattan Project. Their grandmother, who lives in the front house with their uncle Billy, is an opera singer. Their father is a former botanist with a specialty in fungal genetics who introduced them to hot-air ballooning and spore photography, which they look forward to interpreting someday as prints. Their mother handmade the line's Peruvian skull necklaces carried by Barneys New York. Rodarte is her family name (the E has come and gone among relatives).

Such was the effect of the recent discovery by the theorists Nathan Seiberg and Ed Witten of a powerful mathematical tool for use in the small domain of particle physics. Within this segment of society, the discovery of a new way to plumb the depths of a theory called supersymmetry was a far bigger deal than landing a man on the moon.   For those on the outside looking in, this might all sound very esoteric. But what Dr. Witten and Dr. Seiberg have wrought may be an important milestone on the road to a grand unification theory -- physics' ambitious plan to wrap up creation with a single elegantly knotted bow.      The need to unify seems to be hard-wired into the human brain. Faced with the munificence of creation, people feel compelled to reduce it to a single essence, some all-inclusive whole. Thales declared that all was water. No, Heraclitus said, everything is made of fire.   But the universe inevitably turns out to be more complicated than our maps. Aristotle chopped up the world into four essences: earth, air, fire and water. The heavens, he said, were made of a mysterious fifth element, the quintessence, called ether.    Mankind Keeps Striving    Driven by the urge to simplify, mankind unified earth, air and water into a single substance. All were different forms of matter -- solid, liquid and gas. Fire too was made of matter -- gases and carbon particles. But it also manifested something very different -- energy. Ether was later shown to be nothing more than empty space, leaving us with two phenomena that make up creation: matter and energy.    But just when everything starts to seem simple, science comes along and messes it up again. To explain the behavior of matter, chemists were forced to replace Aristotle's four elements with the 93 elements in Mendeleyev's periodic table. Order reigned again when it turned out that all these different atoms were made of just three kinds of particles: protons, neutrons and electrons. Then physicists in the 20th century discovered there were not just three but hundreds of subatomic particles. A degree of simplicity was restored when it was found that the particles could be divided into two classes. The first, called hadrons, consisted of those heavier particles like neutrons, protons and mesons that are made of still tinier particles called quarks. The second class was the leptons: light particles like the electron and neutrino that are not made from quarks.    In the meantime it was found that energy too can be thought of as particles. A fire radiates photons of light. The strong and weak nuclear forces are carried by other particles. And it is assumed that gravity is carried by something called gravitons.    Loosely speaking, then, we live in a world of matter particles and energy particles. More precisely, scientists speak of fermions (the parts of atoms) and bosons (the carriers of forces). But still creation seems too cluttered for our symmetry-seeking minds. Light (or more generally, electromagnetism) and the weak nuclear force have been shown to be shadows cast by a single underlying \\"electroweak\\" force -- a step toward unity has been achieved. The next milestone would be to unify the electroweak force with the strong nuclear force (some progress has been made here) and then to rope in gravity. And to truly satisy the craving for simplicity, the all-inclusive one, the fermions (the matter particles) and the bosons (the energy particles) would have to be united. The goal of supersymmetry is to forge a mathematical lens through which fermions and bosons appear the same. Hold a cylinder upright so that it casts a shadow against a wall. Rotate it along its axis and its silhouette remains the same. But rotate the cylinder in the other two dimensions and its shadow changes. Since the cylinder is only symmetrical to a rotation along a single dimension, this is called N=1 symmetry. Or think instead of a sphere. It can be rotated in three dimensions and maintain its appearance. This is a symmetry of N=3.   Physicists seek symmetries in imaginary mathematical spaces. This is not that mysterious. Draw a graph in which age is plotted on one axis and weight on the other. You have created a two-dimensional space whose dimensions are measured in pounds and years. In supersymmetry, particle physicists are studying spaces in which a fermion could be rotated along one dimension and turn into a boson. An electron would turn into a hypothetical particle called a selectron. A photon could be rotated to become something called a photino. Both the particle and its so-called sparticle would be different shadows cast by the same mathematical object hidden behind the scenes. Or maybe the symmetry is of a higher dimension. In an N=2 symmetry, a particle could be rotated along either of two dimensions and turn into one of its supersymmetric counterparts.    A Basis (Gulp) in Reality?    Why are the particles and their corresponding sparticles not identical, like the shadows of the cylinder or the sphere? Because, in the language of physics, the symmetries are broken. Once upon a time, in the instants after the big bang, particles and sparticles were one. But the identity was shattered in giving birth to the world. Or so the legend goes.   Before the breakthrough made by Dr. Witten and Dr. Seiberg, the equations describing supersymmetry were intractable. Now they can be solved, allowing physicists to better understand the theory and how it might hook up to the real world.   But good mathematical tools are not enough. Scientists need the proper physical tools as well. So far, experimenters have been unable to create sparticles in their accelerators. Either the machines are not powerful enough or supersymmetry is wrong. With the Superconducting Supercollider project abandoned, the only hope is the less powerful accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, being built in Geneva. Even if supersymmetry finally tells us nothing about our world, mathematicians will admire its beauty, a perfection that exists in the land of numbers. Now if only they could find it here on earth.
