In the first part of this lushly detailed novel, a dreamy 13-year-old English girl witnesses a flirtation between her older sister and a poor college student in the summer of 1935, then tells a lie about a crime on her family's estate that has devastating consequences for the student's future. The rest of the plot explores the ripples of that fateful event for all three characters during World War II and later. McEwan is an accomplished expert on human violence and its aftershocks, and ''Atonement,'' chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2002, is ''his most complete and compassionate work to date,'' Tom Shone wrote in these pages.    Secret Agents: The Menace of Emerging Infections, by Madeline Drexler. (Penguin, $15.) Tracking changes in Americans' diets and the emergence of drug-resistant bugs, the author focuses on a variety of threats, including bioterrorism, insect-borne infections, influenza and diseases arising from foods. The result is ''an authoritative, well-paced, vividly written book that will scare the pants off you,'' Derek Bickerton said here last year.    The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, by John J. Mearsheimer. (Norton, $18.95.) Shrugging off dreams of a new world order that binds open societies and open markets, the author lays out a grim theory he calls ''offensive realism,'' in which everything boils down to a relentless grab for power among nations both great and small. In 2001 in The Times, Patricia Cohen found this ''a refreshingly systematic analysis of power.''    The Translator, by John Crowley. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $12.95.) Set in 1961 and steeped in cold-war paranoia, this novel revolves around the relationship between an exiled Russian poet (who may or may not be a spy) and a fragile American college student who falls hard for him. The tale is ''so suffused with beauty that its inhabitants manage to speak in fragments of poetry without sounding pompous or absurd,'' Jessica Olin said in these pages in 2002. ''Crowley's subject mater is grand and serious, involving nothing less than the souls of nations and the transforming power of language.''    Me Times Three, by Alex Witchel. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $13.) In her first novel, a style reporter for The Times recounts the rocky coming-of-age of a fashion editor in 1980's Manhattan who is stunned to find that her well-heeled fianc&#233","excerpt":"is engaged to two other women. ''This tender novel is . . . about accepting the sometimes monstrous flaws in the people we love, about forgiveness and about what it means to move on,'' Karen Karbo said here last year.    Tom Paine: A Political Life, by John Keane. (Grove, $20.) A professor of politics maintains that the globe-trotting author of ''Common Sense'' and ''The Rights of Man'' (who took part in two major revolutions) was something of an 18th-century Che Guevara, and suggests that the ''citizen of the world'' was a misfit everywhere he went. In 1995 our reviewer, Pauline Maier, called this ''an engaging perspective on England, America and France'' at the time and ''a good introduction to a complex historical character.''    Searching for Hassan: A Journey to the Heart of Iran, by Terence Ward. (Anchor, $14.) The American author, who spent part of his childhood living in Tehran in the 1960's, tells of how he set out with his parents and his brothers in a minivan in 1998 in a quixotic search for their former cook and gardener and his family. Miraculously, they found them, safe and alive. The result is ''an unexpected ode to Iran,'' Adam Goodheart said in these pages last year. Ward's ''enthusiasm propels you along.''    My Wicked, Wicked Ways, by Errol Flynn. (Cooper Square, $17.95.) The Tasmanian-born actor (1909-59) portrays himself not as a debonair swashbuckler but as a chronically unhappy soul whose luck, talent and high spirits vaulted him to fame, even as he remained unfulfilled until the end. Flynn's ''solid, entertaining and satisfying'' autobiography is ''a sad one,'' Allen Churchill wrote here in 1960. ''The reader has a feeling of talent wasted.''    Four Corners, by Diane Freund. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) With her mother off at a sanitarium, her father busy at the local bar and a peeping Tom and a child molester walking the streets, this first novel's 10-year-old heroine gets some harsh life lessons in a tiny town in upstate New York during the 1950's. '' 'Four Corners' is an affecting examination of the way sadness trickles down from generation to generation,'' Sarah Ferguson wrote here in 2001.

It began in this country just 100 years ago, when the Parisian dealer Durand-Ruel introduced the Impressionists to the American public and Mary Cassatt was a substantial contributor to the eighth and last Impressionist group exhibition in Paris. A New York collector called Erwin Davis had bought two important paintings by Manet even earlier - in 1881, to be precise - and when he gave them to the Metropolitan in 1889 he inaugurated one of the world's most majestic holdings of Impressionism.   So far from waning, the love affair in question has waxed in ways more common in legend or mythology than in day-to-day human traffic. Dante, in comparison, was halfhearted in his feeling for Beatrice, and Tristan and Isolde lacked both sap and substance. Remembering how much visitors enjoy what has been acquired for American museums as a consequence of this 100-years' passion, we may decide that French Impressionism is one of the greatest single sources of happiness that have come our way in the last 100 and some years.

When the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and the United States met in Paris from January to June 1919 to decide the outcome of the Great War, four old empires had fallen and the fate of hundreds of millions of people was unclear. This account of the making of the Treaty of Versailles -- which dictated a new world order and produced a recipe for decades of political disorder -- was chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2002. Our reviewer, Tony Judt, found it ''full of colorful detail and as comprehensive as anyone could wish.''    BAUDOLINO, by Umberto Eco. (Harvest/Harcourt, $15.) The author may be an ultraintellectual polymath, but he steers a fairly accessible narrative ship in this adventure about a 12th-century Italian peasant gifted in learning languages, telling lies and putting himself in the middle of genuine historical situations. ''With its richly variegated haul of medieval treasures'' and Eco's typical fascination with forged manuscripts and fake relics, the novel is ''compulsively readable,'' Peter Green said here last year.    THE LOST GARDEN, by Helen Humphreys. (Norton, $13.95.) In the Canadian poet's third novel, a socially awkward horticulturalist abandons London during the Blitz for the English countryside, where she organizes a group of girls to plant crops for the war effort. Along the way, her life is altered by encounters with a grief-stricken officer waiting to be posted abroad, and a young woman whose fianc&#233","excerpt":"is missing in action. In 2002 our reviewer, Margot Livesey, admired the book's ''meticulous, lucid prose'' as well as its ''sparkling dialogue and lyrical description.''    PARADISE ALLEY, by Kevin Baker. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $14.95.) Seven major characters are deployed in Baker's fictional retelling of the worst civil disturbance in American history, the draft riots of 1863, when Irish mobs filled with smoldering resentments terrorized New York City for three midsummer days. ''The author takes the reader on a careering, kaleidoscopic tour'' of the mayhem and the wretched world of Manhattan's immigrants, Geoffrey C. Ward said in these pages last year. ''Rich in color and drama,'' this ''extraordinary'' novel is ''a triumph.''    LIVE FROM NEW YORK: An Uncensored History of ''Saturday Night Live,'' by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $15.95.) In their effort to take the measure of a cultural phenomenon that has ebbed and flowed for nearly three decades, the authors interviewed veterans of the show about their experiences, then arranged the recollections chronologically and supplied a few transitional passages. ''The result is a door-stopper that nevertheless contains some fascinating material,'' Martha Bayles wrote here last year.    HOW TO BE ALONE: Essays, by Jonathan Franzen. (Picador, $14.) Whether it's a bittersweet love song to cigarettes, a defense of serious reading or a lament for the novel's loss of scope and prestige, these 13 essays, published between 1994 and 2001, record a sensibility in constant conflict with itself and with the world around it -- agonized by contradiction and addicted to ambivalence. '' 'How to Be Alone' reaffirms the novelist's prerogative to engage in social criticism,'' A. O. Scott said in the Book Review last year. The result is an ''unfailingly intelligent, intermittently infuriating and notably coherent collection.''    ONE MAN'S BIBLE, by Gao Xingjian. (HarperCollins, $13.95.) Set in China during the 1960's and early 70's, when families were decimated and scattered by political claustrophobia and paranoia, this novel by the Nobel Prize-winning author of ''Soul Mountain'' is ''a powerful narrative, barely fictional, of the Cultural Revolution's insidious, corrosive terror,'' Barbara Crossette wrote here in 2002.    DEATH MAKES A HOLIDAY: A Cultural History of Halloween, by David J. Skal. (Bloomsbury, $14.95.) In this grab bag of lore, myths, rituals and anecdotes, as in Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night, by Nicholas Rogers (Oxford University, $9.95), the holiday's evolution is traced from quaint ethnic celebration to commercial juggernaut. ''They say that the devil is in the details, and both Skal and Rogers are connoisseurs of delicious tidbits of the macabre,'' Karal Ann Marling said here last year.
