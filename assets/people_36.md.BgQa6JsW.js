The two-CD set includes one album with 10 electric rockers, full of the fast blare and inner turmoil of Hüsker Dü, and one with 10 acoustic songs that evoke Beatles ballads and Neil Young. In either guise, the band's leader and songwriter, Dave Grohl, is more pensive than ever, reflecting on death, loss, loyalty and freedom. The rock CD overpowers the acoustic one. Yet among the quieter songs, there are enough supple melodies and hypnotic guitar patterns to suggest fine prospects for a follow-through album that would dare to mix plugged-in and unplugged.    Emiliana Torrini      If it were any more delicate, Emiliana Torrini's new album, ''Fisherman's Woman'' (Rough Trade), might waft away. Ms. Torrini, the Icelandic singer who performed ''Gollum's Song'' in ''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,'' has left behind the electronica of her previous recordings for songs that are just substantial enough. Most of the new ones use just an instrument or two behind her fingerpicked guitar and her gentle voice, the perfect setting for folky, finely etched melodies and lyrics about how elusive love can be.    Nikka Costa      On her album ''Can'tneverdidnothin'' (Virgin), Nikka Costa knocks herself out to be funky, sassy and sultry. Her vocals flaunt their screams, breaks and nasal curlicues, while the arrangements revere Sly Stone and Prince. They're packed with extra bits of wah-wah, orchestration and Ms. Costa's overdubbed backup singing. There's overcompensation here: Ms. Costa has long been self-conscious about being a white woman singing rhythm and blues. But the songs, proffering boasts and exhortations to self-improvement, repay every exertion.    Audioslave      Majority doesn't rule: three members of Rage Against the Machine plus Soundgarden's lead singer add up to Soundgarden II on Audioslave's second album, ''Out of Exile'' (Epic/Interscope). That's a good thing. Like Soundgarden, Audioslave has mostly outgrown its Led Zeppelin imitations and concentrated on melody. Most of the album places sinewy hard-rock riffs behind Chris Cornell's existential manifestoes, while Tom Morello's guitar solos fling staccato patterns, string-tapping and the quasi-scratching he used for Rage. The most immediately memorable song, though, is a folk-rock strummer, ''Doesn't Remind Me,'' that may even hold a distant glint of humor.    Pine am      Cute, perky, poppy female bands may be one of Japan's major exports. Yet Pine am's album ''Pull the Rabbit Ears'' (Eenie Meenie) has more than novelty appeal. The group's three women, who sing in English, have the requisite breathy voices and irrepressible optimism, but they also concoct electronic tracks that are both sparse and dizzying, with blithe pop hooks tucked inside. At low or high beats-per-minute, the songs blip and buzz with infusions of garage-rock organ, funk guitar, disco beats or an Erik Satie melody. There's a wily intelligence behind the deadpan voices and ricocheting synthesizers. Download ''Do I Know You'' free at www.eeniemeenie.com/mp3.php.    Robert Cray      The title song of Robert Cray's album ''Twenty'' (Sanctuary) is the atypical one. Not for the slow, aching groove of its music, but for its lyrics about a soldier who dies in Iraq, fighting a ''rich man's war.'' For most of the album, Mr. Cray stays with his specialty: songs about love, usually love gone wrong, that are steeped in 1960's soul and topped by his poised, pained voice and his fine-point guitar solos. One song, ''My Last Regret,'' could double as a kiss-off and as a smoker's vow to quit: ''I want to see you burn all the way down/ I want to see your ashes all over the ground.''    Ellen Allien      If minimal techno has stars, Ellen Allien is one of them. She's a Berlin disc jockey and producer who keeps her tracks rigorously austere. Minor keys and buzzing synthetic bass dominate ''Thrills'' (Bpitch Control), with occasional vocals that are more like chants than tunes. She hints at sensuality -- ''my body, your body'' -- but the ambience is sterile and ominous: lust in a lab coat.    Shelby Lynne      Shelby Lynne's albums are either elaborately produced or virtually homemade. ''Suit Yourself'' (Capitol) is her most overtly casual one yet, raising the verité quotient with studio chatter and remnants of multiple takes. With a little folk-rock and a little Memphis soul, the cozy arrangements are supposed to play down her craftsmanship and bring a listener closer. But that only happens in the best songs: ''Where Am I Now,'' ''I Cry Everyday,'' ''I Won't Die Alone'' and ''You Don't Have a Heart.'' The others sound like rough drafts, despite some flinty insights like Ms. Lynne's view of the government: ''They want us to pray and then they'll protect us.''    Head of Femur      Glockenspiel","excerpt":"horns; strings; weedy, high voices -- yes, Head of Femur is a band of pop obsessives that proudly overstuffs its songs on ''Hysterical Stars'' (SpinArt). But its frantic mix of confessionals, character studies, childhood reminiscences and reflections on art are both endearing and smart, not least because there's some Band and Beach Boys stateliness to ground the music. The tunes make sense even when the lyrics don't.   From a Love Gone Bad to a Government Gone Wrong"},{"year":"1921","title":"ST.

In \\"Satiro, Mexico,\\" a man is dressed up as a satyr, complete with furry legs and hooves and with little horns sprouting from his head. But the silliness of this image is given a sharp twist by the fact that the man has no arms, an aspect that Mr. Witkin, in a typically histrionic gesture, emphasizes by ringing the places on the man's torso where his arms should be with crowns of thorns.

''We couldn't be happier with this hostile takeover of the box office,'' said Steve Rothenberg, president of domestic distribution for Lionsgate, who added that the film had already grossed more than four times its production budget. (It was made for less than $5 million.) ''Hostel'' (starring Jay Fernandez, right) displaced two blockbusters that had been competing at the top of the chart for a month. ''The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' (Buena Vista) dropped to No. 2 with $15.4 million, bringing its total sales to $247.5 million, and ''King Kong'' (Universal) fell to No. 3 with $12.5 million, for a total of $192.5 million. Two hit comedies also dropped a notch. ''Fun With Dick and Jane'' (Sony), at No. 4, took in $12.2 million, and ''Cheaper by the Dozen 2'' (Fox), at No. 5, grossed $8.3 million. Steven Spielberg's ''Munich'' (Universal), about the aftermath of the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics, expanded to 1,485 theaters this weekend and reached No. 6 with $7.5 million.

Along with legions of the dead, these are some of the individual victims of the so-called \\"Rape of Nanjing,\\" shown in vintage film clips from 1937, the year Japanese troops stormed into the city that was then the capital of China. Over the next six weeks, the Japanese Army massacred 300,000 civilians, including many thousands of women who were systematically raped before being killed.

The fact remains, however, that this horse opera (with music, of course) is cut from a hoary pattern. It is fairly obvious that Arln, an erst-while Civil War officer temporarily under the cloud of an unfair court-martial, will find his refuge, Nevada Springs, a den of iniquity. And it is obvious, too, that the villains will be covetously eying the Big Bonanza mine. So, keeping the romance oblique, the dialogue at a minimum and the action frequent and muscular, Arlen and justice win out in the end—but obviously.Astride a horse or as the top man in a saloon brawl, Arlen makes the most of his assignment, while Robert Livingston, Jane Frazee, George (Gabby) Hayes, Lynne Roberts and the child actor, Bobby Driscoll, handle the chief supporting roles competently.

Physicians gave them orders and expected no backtalk","excerpt":"hospital administrators kept them running for low pay. But all that is rapidly changing. For quite a while, nurses have shown their discontent by dropping out in great numbers. At the same time, bolstered by the spirit of feminism and by a better bargaining position that has been fostered by greater technical responsibilities and greater need for their services, nurses are making their demands with greater force. And, partly because they must, doctors and hospital administrators are beginning to pay attention. In an era when health care eats up nearly $1 of every $10 in the G.N.P., many nurses are receiving long overdue recognition in the form of higher wages and better work status.   Registered nurses hold licenses in record numbers -1.4 million, the American Nurses Association estimates -but the dropout rate has been high enough to have created a chronic shortage. The American Hospital Association estimates that 100,000 staff nurse positions are going begging. The American Nurses Association says more than 400,000 nurses are inactive and 300,000 others work only part-time.  Moreover, with government scholarship money fading, applications to nursing schools are down.
