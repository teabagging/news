They work in the round, but they can also work in the flat, making drawings on paper that they may or may not translate into sculptural mediums.  They thus enjoy both dimensions, 2-D and 3-D, whereas painters have only one, unless they are those rare polymediastes who can switch back and forth between disciplines.   So relaxed are the rules today that most sculptors no longer regard - where once they used to - drawing as simply a preliminary step in designing a 3-D work. They are apt to draw for lots of other reasons: inventing shapes and studying their combinations, exploring color, playing with scale or simply flexing their imaginations. What sculptors produce on paper can be anything from the simple outline of a proposed form to a ''narrative'' scene unrelated to a sculptural piece and as rich and ''finished'' as the work of a painter. Richard Serra's smudgily outlined triangle of Stygian black that thrusts dynamically across a sheet of white paper has obviously to do with his sculptural concerns, but it also holds together as a drawing on its own. The late H.C. Westermann, known for his punny, enigmatic constructions of beautifully crafted wood, also made cartoony drawings, such as ''The Amazon,'' a hilariously grim scene of a downed airplane pilot besieged by jungle fauna.

A painter and sculptor involved in the 1970's with the neo-Dada Fluxus group, she  did her first video piece, \\"Video Chess,\\" in 1975, inspired by a visit to the grave of her idol, Marcel Duchamp. Since then she has conceived her sculpture in terms of video, creating works that reflect her own life and her interest in nature as well as Duchampian jokes and ironies.         Her show of 1990's work at the Whitney Museum of American Art is a dense galleryful of separate pieces transformed into a cheerfully charged environment  by means of projections, mirrored shards, movements and sounds that keep the viewer hopping. Amid this hyperactivity, humor and invention abound. But there are problems, too, to which we'll return. Two robotic figures catch the eye at once. One, \\"Jogging Lady,\\" a dumbbell-wielding runner of galvanized metal and junk parts, arms and legs pumping, has video monitors in her stomach, breasts and mouth that flash images of marathons. The other robot is a perpetual fountain, a man urinating into a bucket. A monitor in his forehead carries images of the video pioneer Nam June Paik, Ms. Kubota's husband.

The outdoor sculpture season in New York City is all over the place, geographically and figuratively speaking. Sculptures are to be found as far afield as the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx and the Snug Harbor Cultural Center on Staten Island. Not only are they on view at the scrubby patch of riverfront that is the Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, Queens, but they also appear unexpectedly a few blocks away in the parking lot of the P.S. 1 Museum. There are sculptures in the courtyards of colleges in Brooklyn and Queens, and at squares and street corners all across lower Manhattan. You can literally trip over them in Tom Otterness's installation at the new Hudson River Park, or mistake one of them for a No Parking sign on Wall Street.   Outdoor sculpture this summer is also across the map in terms of its interests. In this sense, it is an inevitable extension of the larger art scene. If a preponderance of sculptures put forward political and social agendas, and if many of them continue to use humble materials that are themselves an expression of a certain political point of view, there are a few works that unapologetically extend the legacy of monumental sculpture.

This wasn't unusual. Plays often go through substantial adjustments on their way to opening night, and Mr. Wilson is probably more eagle-eyed, more persnickety, more of a tinkerer than most.         But the change, so seemingly mundane and so late in the game, was indicative  of the somewhat old-fashioned luxury in which Mr. Wilson has earned the right to work. In collaboration with his longtime director, Lloyd Richards, Mr. Wilson has brought a critically acclaimed series of plays, exploring decade by decade the black experience in 20th-century America, to the Broadway stage.

Entitled \\"Sixty-ninth Parallel,\\" it was produced by Belayeff and Oshurkoff as a documentary work concerned with the activities of the Red Fleet in northern waters.Batteries on the Rybachi Peninsula are seen covering the entrance to the Petsamo fjord. Attacked by German Stukas while the cameraman was operating, the batteries shot down a plane and sank a transport. A young Hurricane pilot, Peter Sgibneff, a hero of the Soviet Union, was present to see himself on the screen in the act of shooting down his fifteenth plane in his 307th battle sortie.Russian patrol vessels are seen on the way to meet the Allied convoy. Enemy high-level and torpedo bombers attack the convoy.

From ancient times Korea has struggled successfully to preserve its national independence. To the native culture—marked by a warrior aristocracy, shamanic religion, and a subject class of rice cultivators—was added, under continuous Chinese influence, a strong adherence to Buddhism and a system of government modeled on Chinese Confucian bureaucratism. The three rival kingdoms of Silla, Paekche, and Koguryo were united, through Chinese intervention, in the seventh century A.D.; unified dynastic rule was maintained thereafter. The Yi dynasty (1392–1910), under which Korea was known as the Kingdom of Choson, was a staunch tributary ally of China under both the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties. A Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592 conquered most of the country but was finally repelled by combined Chinese and Korean forces. From the late 17th century to the 1870's, all non-Chinese foreign influence was rigorously excluded from the country. Korea's isolation, and its status as a Chinese tributary, ended in 1874, when Japan imposed on it the Treaty of Kangwha, guaranteeing Japanese commercial access and other interests. The Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95 was fought primarily over the status of Korea; following Japan's victory in that war, Korea was made a Japanese protectorate and was annexed as a Japanese colony in 1910. A harsh regime was established with the aim of eradicating Korean culture and incorporating Korea entirely into the Japanese empire. During the colonial period, Korean resistance to the Japanese regime was violently suppressed, but resistance movements survived in exile—notably the Korean Communist party in the Soviet Union and a republican movement in China. During World War II, tens of thousands of Koreans were conscripted as forced laborers to work in Japan and in Japanese-occupied territories. Following Japan's surrender, Korea was arbitrarily divided into zones of Soviet and American occupation, north and south of 38° north latitude. The dividing line split Korea economically as well as geographically and politically; Korea's industry and hydroelectric power was concentrated in the north, while the south was primarily agricultural. In contrast to well-laid Soviet plans for installing a Communist government in the north (see “North Korea”), American attempts to reunify the country under a republican regime were inept. By 1948 it had become clear that plans for reunification were hopeless. In May of that year, the Republic of Korea was organized in the south, with Dr. Syngman Rhee as president. The United States withdrew its occupation forces in June 1949. On June 25, 1950, North Korean troops invaded the south in an apparent attempt to unify the country forcibly under the communist regime. An emergency session of the U.N. Security Council voted to send troops to Korea; the U.S.S.R., having boycotted the session, was unable to exercise its veto on North Korea's behalf. U.N. troops, dominated by American forces and commanded by Gen. Douglas MacArthur, launched a counterattack in September with a landing at Inchon and swept north, reaching the Chinese border by Nov. 20. On Nov. 26 the tide turned again when Chinese troops entered the war, ostensibly to defend the Chinese border but also to aid their North Korean allies in driving the U.N. forces south again. Seoul fell once more on Jan. 4, 1951. In February and March another U.N. counteroffensive drove the combined Chinese and North Korean forces back to the 38th parallel again. Thereafter, the battle lines remained generally stable, although fierce fighting continued at intervals for another two years. On Apr. 11, 1951, Gen. MacArthur was relieved of the Korean command for making unauthorized policy statements and was replaced by Gen. Matthew Ridgway. Armistice talks began in July 1951 but broke down repeatedly. A truce was signed on July 27, 1953, creating a demilitarized zone along the 38th parallel and establishing a framework for talks on a permanent settlement of the war. Negotiations have continued fruitlessly at the Panmunjom armistice conference headquarters ever since. Postwar reconstruction, with significant U.S. aid, was overseen by the government of Syngman Rhee. Pres. Rhee resigned in 1960 after a wave of student demonstrations charging him with corruption and undemocratic practices. On May 16, 1961, Gen. Park Chung Hee seized power in a military coup. The military government was given democratic trappings when in 1972 a referendum was passed allowing Gen. Park to run for an unlimited series of six-year presidential terms. Gen. Park was assassinated on Oct. 26, 1979, by the government's chief of intelligence. Gen. Chun Doo Hwan rose to power, continuing the military rule of Gen. Park. Gen. Chun's regime was marked by widespread violent political protests but the economy made great strides. The traditionally agrarian country was transformed into a modernized, urban, industrial nation. In 1986 South Korea for the first time achieved a favorable balance-of-payments ratio in foreign trade, and the favorable balance has increased rapidly, led by exports of automobiles, textiles and clothing, and consumer electronic goods. After weeks of widespread demonstrations in mid-1987, Gen. Chun agreed to allow direct presidential elections to choose his successor. In the elections, the government candidate, Roh Tae Woo, achieved a plurality over the sharply divided opposition parties. Under Pres. Roh, the political situation calmed, although student demonstrations continued, calling for greater efforts for Korean reunification and protesting the presence of large numbers of American troops. High-level talks between North and South began in 1990, and an agreement in principle was reached that reunification would take place in the near future, a wish that remains unfulfilled. In 1992 South Korea was a strong economic power in Asia and North Korea would become increasingly isolated, the establishment of diplomatic relations with China was a clear signal that it would remain so. Also in 1992, longtime political opposition leader Kim Young Sam won election as South Korea's first postwar civilian president. Although he was initially able to liberalize some aspects of civil rights, the renewed threat of war with North Korea became the overriding preoccupation of the government until late 1994, when an agreement was reached calling for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear facilities in exchange for new reactors. The ruling Democratic Labor Party was plagued by scandals that hampered its effectiveness. Pres. Kim's predecessor, Pres. Roh, was arrested for bribe-taking, as was his predecessor. Several key businessmen, including Kim's own son, were jailed for corruption. In elections in April 1996 the party lost its parliamentary majority but continued to govern as part of a coalition. South Korea's economy was battered by the Asian economic crisis of 1997-98, leading to severe hardship for many workers. On Dec. 18, 1997, long-time democracy advocate and dissident Kim Dae Jung was elected. In May 1999 (after promising economic figures suggested a rising GDP and falling unemployment) he was able to reshuffle the cabinet to more closely accord with his “sunshine policy” of reforming the great conglomerate business empires and of improving relations with North Korea. In June talks with the North, held in Beijing, were abbreviated after South Korea sank a North Korean torpedo boat in a fishing grounds dispute in the Yellow Sea. Yet talks in Geneva continued and secret talks began in March 2000, leading to a “summit” in Pyongyang in June between President Kim and Kim Jong Il which promised peace and reunification. Domestically, financial scandals involving Pres. Kim's son and some of his aides led him to distance himself from the Millenium Party, resigning as its head in Nov. 2001 and from the party itself in May. October by-elections had seen the party lose three seats, leaving it one short of a majority. A June 2002 North Korean naval attack called the “sunshine policy” into serious question. In December's presidential election, the Millennium Democrats' candidate, Rho Moo Hyun, defeated Lee Hoi Chang of the Grand National Party. His inaugural address stressed reconcilation through dialogue in the face of the grave threat of North Korea's nuclear blustering.

Israeli warplanes struck targets in southern Beirut and southern Lebanon, killing 45 people and wounding more than 100, according to local reports. The impact of the deaths on both sides and the missile strike marked a qualitative and psychological escalation of the conflict on its fifth day.  A1    The Lebanese militia Hezbollah fired 10 powerful rockets -- a kind it has never unleashed before -- which traveled more than 20 miles over northern Israel before slamming down in Haifa. The attack confirmed what Israeli security chiefs have warned for years: that Hezbollah has large, powerful rockets able to reach major Israeli cities.  A8    Arabs Publicly Blame Hezbollah  Arab governments are taking the rare step of publicly blaming Hezbollah. Saudi Arabia, supported by Jordan, Egypt, several Gulf states and the Palestinian Authority, chastised Hezbollah for ''unexpected, inappropriate and irresponsible acts'' at an emergency Arab League summit meeting in Cairo.  A1    Tacit U.S. Approval for Israel  The Bush administration appeared to give Israel tacit approval to cripple Hezbollah, casting the conflict in the Middle East in terms of a wider war on terrorism. That was a central theme of both public and private statements from senior American officials, even as President Bush and his aides issued a statement including a request for restraint in Israel's attacks on Lebanon.  A10    Group of 8 Focuses on Oil  The world leaders at a Group of 8 summit meeting issued a communiqué on energy policy that touched lightly on alternatives to fossil fuels, like biomass and wind power, but focused mostly on how to bring more oil to the market.  A11    Sunnis Shift View of U.S. in Iraq  As sectarian violence soars, many Sunni Arab political and religious leaders once staunchly opposed to the American presence in Iraq are now saying they need American troops to protect them from the rampages of Shiite militias and Shiite-run government forces.  A1    Iraqi Officials' Safety Shaken  Gunmen in vehicles resembling those used by Iraqi security forces kidnapped Adil Mohamed al-Qazaz, president of one of Iraq's state-owned oil companies in Baghdad, an Oil Ministry spokesman said. The abduction underscored the danger that high-level Iraqi officials face and the power of criminal groups who strike at them seemingly at will.  A12    2nd Mexican Recount Protest  For the second time in a little over a week, thousands of supporters of the leftist presidential candidate, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, filled Mexico City's central plaza to demonstrate their support for his demand for a recount in the disputed election.

A1    Aid Arrives for Gulf Coast  Nearly $10 billion in federal aid is starting to flow into the hands of people in Mississippi and Louisiana who lost their houses in last year's hurricanes, the culmination of a year of political battling and bargaining between the states and Washington.  A1    A Reward for Arizona Voters  A proposal to award $1 million in every general election to one lucky Arizona resident simply for voting -- no matter for whom -- has qualified for the November ballot. Mark Osterloh, left, a political gadfly who is behind the initiative, is promoting it with the slogan ''Who wants to be a Millionaire? Vote!''  A1    Plan Cuts Medicare Payments  The Bush administration says it plans sweeping changes in Medicare payments to hospitals that could cut payments by 20 percent to 30 percent for many complex treatments and new technologies. The changes, the biggest since the current payment system was adopted in 1983, are meant to improve the accuracy of payment rates.  A13    SCIENCE/HEALTH    A Diabetes- Alzheimer's Link?  Several new studies suggest that diabetes increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease, adding to a store of evidence that links the disorders. The studies involve only Type 2 diabetes, the most common type, which is usually related to obesity.

Bloomberg's Commission on Economic Opportunity has been focused on how to solve the problem of rising poverty in a city as wealthy as New York.

B1    Church Divided Over Gays  Though All Angels Church in New York City is a theologically conservative branch of the Episcopal Church, it serves a liberal diocese.

Review and article dates are in parentheses. Prices are current.     Manhattan Ocean Club     57 West 58th Street, (212) 371-7777 -- The name Manhattan Ocean Club summons images of an exclusive wood-paneled enclave festooned with navigational charts and nautical art. But this restaurant is not a club and does not look particularly maritime. Rather, it is a handsome and sophisticated midtown seafood house where the fare is pleasing and the wine selection exceptional.    The main dining room, two flights below street level, is done in creams and pastels and brightened by hand-painted reproductions of Picasso ceramics mounted behind glass.   On the current menu you might start with warm potato and smoked salmon tart","excerpt":"sea urchins with curry and sauteed apples or lobster salad with couscous and Moroccan spices.    Among the entrees are seared tuna with grapefruit and deep-fried leeks; broiled monkfish with curried lentils; roasted blackfish with chanterelles and pennetine, and red snapper in a rosemary crust.   For dessert, try the warm chocolate tart or cheesecake with orange granite and orange salad.   Appetizers are $5.50 to $11.50; main courses $21.50 to $28.50. Sunday dinner hours are 5 P.M. to 11:30 P.M. (Review, June 10, 1988.) Da Tommaso     903 Eighth Avenue, near 54th Street, (212) 265-1890 -- Amid the cacophony of the Broadway theater district, Da Tommaso is a snug and tranquil place that offers reasonably good food at modest prices.    The setting is a wood-partitioned room with a bar near the entrance, pale yellow walls and smoky mirrors.  The largely traditional menu has few surprises and the food is fresh and wholesome, which is more than can be said for some of the mass-feeding corrals in the theater district.    Appetizers include grilled wild mushrooms; spiedino alla Romana (deep-fried mozzarella with capers and anchovy sauce) and the house salad, which is a mixture of chopped arugula, endive, radicchio, capers, olives and balsamic vinaigrette.   For main courses there are sauteed breast of chicken with a sauce combining portobello, shiitake and porcini mushrooms; gnocchi alla Romana with a bechamel sauce and fontina cheese, and pappardelle with cream sauce, mushrooms and fresh tarragon. Also, Parmesan-coated medallions of veal with a lemon-white wine sauce and baby artichokes, and a seafood stew of John Dory, mussels, shrimp and clams in a light garlic-white-wine-tomato sauce.    Appetizers are $6 to $8.50, entrees $12.50 to $17. Sunday service is from 4 to 11 P.M. (Review, Aug. 11, 1989.) Harlequin     569 Hudson Street, at West 11th Street, (212) 255-4950 -- The owners of this inviting Spanish restaurant, Ileana and Jose Barcena, seem genuinely grateful that you have chosen their restaurant, which is rare today. The well-trained service staff reflects their attitude, endearing Harlequin to regular customers.    The dining room is cool gray, with well-separated tables and dishes carrying the Harlequin logo. On one side is a bar and on the other a display case filled with Lladro porcelain.   The cooking here is more refined and Continental in style than at most Spanish restaurants in New York.  One of the best appetizers is shrimp in garlic cream, a half-dozen grilled shrimp arranged atop two sauces: one an aggressive blend of garlic, cayenne, white wine, lemon and brown stock; the other a thick and heady combination of garlic, white wine, fish stock and cream.   Brandada de bacalao -- what the French call brandade de morue -- is terrific here. It is a garlic-powered puree of dried salt cod and potatoes that is eaten with black bread.   Among main courses, the paella for two is a winner. It is a melange of lobster, shrimp, sausage, clams, mussels, scallops and sometimes pork and chicken. The yellow rice is moist and complex with a blend of saffron, garlic, crushed tomatoes and chicken stock. Among the meat dishes, honey-glazed rack of lamb for two is always satisfying. Other options include a traditional Basque fish stew in a light tomato and white-wine sauce, and roasted duck with Chinchon (an anise-based liqueur) and grape sauce.    Appetizers are $5 to $8, entrees $12 to $22. Sunday dinner is from 5 to 11 P.M. (Review, June 24, 1988.) Anatolia     1422 Third Avenue, between 80th and 81st Streets, (212) 517-6262 -- Anatolia offers a colorful rendition of cuisine from Turkey and the Middle East in an upbeat setting. The formula succeeds up to a point, but the food can be inconsistent.   The pastel-washed dining room sets a lighthearted tone with its lavender ceiling, simulated stone walls, faux Doric columns, streaking neon tubes and spacy saucer-shaped lights. Waiters glide around in billowing costumes, patiently describing the exotic cuisine to customers.   You might start with pan-fried eggplant served with a garlic and yogurt sauce; zucchini pancakes or grape leaves stuffed with rice, currants and pine nuts.    Among the entrees are sultan's bliss -- lamb that is seared and then baked in a light tomato sauce and accompanied by roasted eggplant puree; lamb shank with lemon sauce; boneless quail wrapped in grape leaves and grilled over charcoal, and grilled chicken breast served with garlic mashed potatoes.   For dessert try Turkish apricot stuffed with whipped cream, or the pistachio baklava.   Appetizers are $3.50 to $5.75; entrees $12.50 to $15.75. Sunday dinner is served from 5 to 10:30 P.M.

And although Spyros Zouzias, the owner, keeps a strict eye on the quality of the ingredients, the kitchen could use some closer attention as well and might be encouraged to handle more delicately and with greater dependability the fresh ingredients at its disposal, so that the food, rather than the decor or staging, might fall under the brighter spotlight.\\n\\nIn general the best courses at Corinthian were appetizer and dessert.

While the farmhouse may be a relic, the restaurant's cooking philosophy espouses the best of today's culinary trends - basic ingredients of high quality, light sauces, reasonable invention - brought, for the most part, to their logical conclusion by the chef, Davis Barnes, whom many may remember from Covington in Armonk.

The changes are particularly noticeable in network television and magazines. They are beginning to seem more like radio and newspapers, filled with ads emphasizing prices, sales, limited-time offers and contests.   \\"Every bit of economic news is negative,\\" said Pete Vetowich, executive vice president and director of retail at Ross Roy Group, which creates campaigns for K Mart and the K Mart Corporation's chains of office supply, sporting goods and home-improvement stores.   \\"You put that on top of the short selling season,\\" Mr. Vetowich added in a telephone interview from his office in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., \\"and there's reason to be very promotional.   The changes are apparent in campaigns for K Mart, by Ross Roy","excerpt":"Sears, Roebuck & Company, by Ogilvy & Mather Chicago, and Toys \\"R\\" Us Inc., by J. Walter Thompson New York, and they echo what has been occurring in brand-name consumer products from cereal to soap. There, too, long-term image advertising has become subordinate to short-term promotional programs.   \\"In this tough economy, to keep the stores open, you've got to sell product,\\" said Susan Marber, vice president and group management supervisor at Grey Advertising Inc. in New York, which creates broadcast spots for Bloomingdale's. Today and tomorrow, she added, the agency will shoot two holiday television spots for the retailer; one, called \\"Give Hope,\\" will be altruistic, listing charities to which donations can be made, while the other, called \\"Best of Gifts,\\" will be packed with products and prices.   When the spots start running on Dec. 13, \\"we'd love to do them 50-50,\\" she continued, but in all likelihood the sales pitch will predominate.   For Toys \\"R\\" Us, Thompson New York has produced a television commercial touting the toy stores' selection of lower-priced video games, at $14.98 to $19.98, in addition to another spot, sans prices, devoted to the new Nintendo Entertainment System.   Toys \\"R\\" Us executives \\"wanted to make sure they were viewed as having reasonably priced video games as well as the higher-priced ones,\\" said Marty Rose, a senior vice president and management director at Thompson New York, adding, \\"They know people are not as generous in spending money as in the past.\\"   Among similar measures that Toys \\"R\\" Us is pursuing, Mr. Rose listed radio commercials centering on a guaranteed-low-price program and booklets of coupons good for discounts on purchases of Mattel Inc. toys.   At K Mart, shoppers will find they can enter a sweepstakes, called \\"Celebrate a Magical Disneyland Christmas,\\" that offers more than 100,000 prizes like a $500,000 annuity and 3,000 trips to Disneyland.   While in previous, more economically robust years, it would have been unusual for retailers to sponsor such consumer-enticing contests, \\"when economic conditions are not really strong, anything we can do to enhance sales is our job,\\" said Jerry Habeck, K Mart's vice president of advertising in Troy, Mich.   For all the popularity of promotional advertising, retailers and their agencies say they recognize the problems it can generate, like weakening a brand name's value and conditioning consumers to buy only when prices are marked down.   \\"It is inevitable that if you take the price message to its logical conclusion, you go out of business,\\" said Tom Hall, president and chief executive at Ogilvy Chicago. That is why, he added, the agency, in creating Sears's holiday campaign, \\"gave consumers both kinds of messages, the price-product message and reasons why to feel smart or good about shopping at the store.\\" THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Hard Times Call for the Hard Sell"},{"year":"1963","title":"Dem Cong leaders, after wkly White House conf, say bill will include same reforms but do not specify","excerpt":"Sears, Roebuck aide O'Connor protests Adm proposals on profit sharing, HR com CONGRESS CHIEFS BAR TAX CUT BILL WITHOUT REFORMS; Democratic Leaders Plan Elimination of Some of the Special Loopholes PARLEY WITH PRESIDENT Legislative Policy Is Stated After Kennedy Offered to Forgo Any Changes Some Reforms Likely Protests From Sears"},{"year":"1933","title":"Stock plan for employes and officers provides for cancellation of commitments if price falls below $25 EMPLOYES' STOCK PLAN.","excerpt":"Sears, Roebuck Allows Cancellation on Price Drop."},{"year":"1968","title":"work begun on Ohrbach's branch, Willowbrook Mall, Wayne, NJ","excerpt":"Sears, Roebuck also plans unit Ohrbach's Builds in Jersey"},{"year":"1933","title":"Adopts blanket code HUNDREDS AGREE TO PLAN.","excerpt":"Sears, Roebuck and A. & P.

Le Gray was a painter who took up photography in the late 1840's, less than a decade after the introduction of the new medium. During the 1850's he operated a portrait studio in Paris, and he photographed landscapes and historical monuments as well.

Prices for livestock and for most other farm produce have begun to slide and Mr. Nevin feared that he could not keep up payments on a loan.   For the first time since the great drought of 1988, an American farm crisis might be in the making. So far, the pain is not as traumatic as it was in the 1980's, when foreclosures and bankruptcy were commonplace. The hardship today is more subtle. Like so many other Americans, farmers are watching anxiously as their incomes begin to decline. And like Mr. Nevin, they are pulling back, expecting the hard times to persist.
