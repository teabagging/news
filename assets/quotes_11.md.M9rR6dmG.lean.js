Last year the group issued a gorgeous debut album -- aptly titled ''This Was the Pace of My Heartbeat'' (Rune Grammofon) -- which occasionally invokes the supple pointillism of the pianist Paul Bley and the drummer Paul Motian.

Leonard Slatkin appeared to be doing his best on the podium, but the orchestra palpably had no enthusiasm for the music.

And yet the grouping, and especially the pairing of Mr. Reich and Mr. Glass, continues, and not just by critics. It is perpetuated by the release schedules of record companies, which have poured new releases by all three men onto the market recently. One company, Nonesuch, has almost simultaneously come forth with recordings by Mr. Glass and Mr. Reich.   Actually, despite the wounded egos, the grouping continues to make sense. The three still share an overall meditative, repetitive esthetic, one that rewards concentrated attention to subtly shifting configurations of reduced materials. And their very differences, ever more overt over the past two decades, don't so much invalidate the grouping as cast fascinating new light on what they still share.   The most noteworthy of the new record releases from this trinity - albeit an unfortunately flawed album -is Mr. Glass's ''Satyagraha'' (CBS Masterworks I3M 39672, three LP's). The release is noteworthy because this, Mr. Glass's first opera for conventional forces (completed in 1980, following ''Einstein on the Beach'' for electric ensemble and untrained voices and preceding ''Akhnaten'') is one of his very finest works.

Then came the pictures of Dr. Bryant with a hibiscus behind his ear.   It was obvious that Dr. Bryant, a professor of English, had a tale to tell about his summer vacation. The professor had gone on a Melville mission, a trip to French Polynesia to retrace the fleeing steps of the great American author, Herman Melville.   \\"In 1842, Melville jumped ship,\\" Dr. Bryant said. \\"He had been on a whaling ship for 18 months and he wanted off.\\" Melville selected a tropical island called Nuku Hiva, which is a long canoe ride from Tahiti.   Nuku Hiva offered it all, including cannibals. \\"There was one tribe that didn't eat people and one that did,\\" Dr. Bryant said. Melville was hoping to reach the vegetarians.   But as he raced up the cliffs with everyone chasing behind, he took a wrong turn. \\"Melville wound up with the cannibals, on a remote section of the island,\\"Dr. Bryant said.    Years later Melville would write of his experience on Nuku Hiva, in \\"Typee.\\" A century later, Dr. Bryant would study it and other Melville novels, including \\"Moby Dick.\\"   The professor has become a prominent Melville scholar, or Melvillian, as he calls himself. As a member of the Melville Society -- \\"the largest single-author society in the world,\\" Dr. Bryant said -- he edits the society's journals.   For a Melville scholar an anniversary as important as the 150th of jumping ship could not go unchronicled. So when a Melville fan, Andre Revel of Paris, put together a trip to Nuku Hiva, he invited Dr. Bryant.   All expenses paid to Tahiti was not something a professor could pass up. Only Tahiti was just a brief stopover. \\"Tahiti seemed overdeveloped compared to Nuku Hiva,\\" Dr. Bryant said.   This was quite a tropical trip for Dr. Bryant, who may be the only New Yorker who has never been to Florida. \\"I've never been on any island, either,\\" he said, \\"except Long and Manhattan.\\"   His Polynesian was a bit primitive, too. \\"I learned some words,\\" he said \\"like kai kai. That means food.\\" And bathroom? \\"You don't really need to learn the word bathroom in Polynesia,\\" he said.   Accompanied by his wife, Virginia Blanford","excerpt":"Mr. Revel, and Mr. Revel's fiancee, Dr. Bryant retraced Melville's steps. But not all his steps. \\"I'm not crazy,\\" Dr. Bryant said. \\"He raced up and down sheer cliffs at 22 years of age with his adrenalin pumping. I'm 42.\\" So the professor took a four-wheel-drive vehicle and retraced just the beginning and end of Melville's trip. \\"We did it in between meals,\\" he said.   They did visit the cannibal village. \\"But they are no longer cannibals,\\" he said. \\"Although I did hear of someone being eaten as late as 1940.\\"   Besides his cannibalism expertise and a videotape of Melville's route, the professor has brought back remembrances of the Nuku Hiva diet. \\"It's basically pork and roots,\\" he said, \\"and some really bizarre looking shellfish.\\" His souvenirs also include a sandalwood lei and a cutting stone. No native dress. But the professor does have a fashion report from Polynesia. \\"Tattoos are coming back,\\" he said. TEACHERS WHO SHOP    They were lined up the other day, waiting to buy school supplies. Not students, but teachers. At L. L. Weans in Farmingdale, the average age of those buying pencils and posters is 35.   \\"I've spent $100 already,\\" said Adrienne Fernan of Merrick, who teaches in Port Washington. Ms. Fernan was making her second trip to L. L. Weans. The store, which opened on Route 110 this year, specializes in educational supplies for elementary school children. It was so jammed before Labor Day that passers-by thought a fire sale was going on.   \\"Probably 1,500 teachers shopped here in the last week,\\" said the owner, Allan Lepler of Dix Hills. \\"The schools don't give them everything they need, and teachers are conscientious. So they are willing to spend their own money.\\"   \\"I like to give extra little niceties,\\" said Mary Alice Sullivan, who was buying a weather chart for her second-grade class in Copiague. Miss Sullivan, a teacher for two years, was shopping with her mother, Loretta, a teacher's aide for 14 years. \\"Get a birthday chart,\\" Mrs. Sullivan advised her daughter. \\"They    love    birthday charts.\\"   Besides buying a book rack, Ms. Fernan was looking at Halloween decorations. \\"I want to make my classroom special for the children,\\" she said. Because she wants each class to feel special she buys new decorations and equipment every year.   With budget cutbacks, teachers are finding that their allotments for materials are not what they used to be. But teachers, especially elementary-school teachers, have always taken money out of their own pockets to buy supplies.   Teaching does not stop when the money is not there, said Rita Friedman of Merrick who teaches in New York City. Ms. Friedman is one of many teachers without a contract this year. But that has not slowed business at Weans. \\"I have one teacher who spent more than $1,000 for her classroom,\\" Mr. Lepler added.   \\"Our business used to rise and fall with the school budgets,\\" Mr. Lepler said. \\"But since we've gone retail that's changed.\\" Mr. Lepler was born into school supplies. His father, Louis Lepler, was the L. L. of L. L. Weans. His son is the \\"A.\\"   Weans stands for Louis Lepler's offspring, William, Elliot, Allan and Nancy. In 1983 Allan Lepler bought the business from his family. He has changed its direction from dealing directly with schools to dealing with the public.   And what a choice the public has. There are special bulletin-board paper that doesn't fade, clocks to teach time, note pads in the shape of dinosaurs, teaching games and books, special certificates and diplomas and pencils of every shape and hue. \\"This is our wall of stickers,\\" Mr. Lepler said. \\"It's probably the largest selection on Long Island.\\"   All those creative educational tools are almost too good to be true, said Anna Tepper of Massapequa, who teaches in Queens. \\"I'm a teacher and I work here for the summer,\\" she said. \\"I'm like a kid working in a candy store.\\" ISLANDERS' BLOOD DRIVE    The New York Islanders had a blood drive the other day. \\"Our fans give blood,\\" said Pat Calabria, an official of the hockey team. No players do.   \\"They have to keep their blood because they're in training,\\" another official, Greg Bouris, said. \\"It's a crucial period. They could lose a day in training if they gave blood. So we don't advise it.\\"   Of course once the season starts, hockey players' giving blood becomes almost a nightly occurrence on the ice. But one might wonder why the Islanders had a blood drive at a time when the players could not donate blood.   \\"It's a service for the Long Island Blood Services,\\" Mr. Bouris said. \\"We offer the venue, the Coliseum. We do publicity. We encourage our fans to come. Our major blood drive is in December, during the holiday time.\\" Oh, then the Islanders give blood? \\"No,\\" Mr. Bouris said, \\"they're in the middle of their season. They couldn't give blood then.\\"   A total of 450 pints was drawn from fans at the drive, he said. In return fans received two tickets to a preseason game and a chance to meet the newest team member, Vladimir Malakhov from Russia. Mr. Malakhov was the lone Islander at the blood drive.   \\"He's only been in the states two weeks,\\" Mr. Bouris said. \\"He doesn't speak English. We introduced him to the New York media at a luncheon one day and brought him to the blood drive the next. He was all excited with all the people asking for his autograph.\\" Even if they did seem a bit pale.

A nice smile, a sunny dispositon, a handsome haircut — really, Mr. Ritter has it all. He's adorable. And so is the first half of \\"Hero at Large,\\" a movie that's most successful when it concentrates on nothing weightier than Mr. Ritter's easygoing charm.After a while, \\"Hero at Large,\\" which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, develops a plot and a message, which are more than it can manage, and it takes a disastrous turn. But it begins sweetly, and long after the material has run out of steam, Mr. Ritter is still going strong.In a welcome departure from the smirking, dopey doubletakes of \\"Three's Company,\\" Mr. Ritter this time plays a different kind of fool. He's a struggling young actor, and the screenplay allots him a pretty neighbor, a nasty landlady, a job impersonating Captain Avenger and a fair share of funny dialogue.

He doesn't get the part.But meanwhile, back at home across the hallway, he gets the girl, wooing her away from a fellow named Milo. \\"I found a stray,\\" Miss Archer tells this soon-to-be-discarded steady, and indeed Mr. Ritter has a way of looking as if he'd fit right in at Bide-a-Wee. Surely this is not the stuff of which superheroes are made. But the plot calls for Mr. Ritter to foil a grocery-store robbery in his Avenger suit, and then become lionized by the press. Eventually, he becomes famous enough for Dr. Joyce Brothers to answer questions about him on a talk show. \\"New York is going Captain Avenger crazy,\\" says the host. \\"Is this a good thing or a bad thing?\\" \\"Well, your question isn't really as simple as it sounds,\\" Dr. Brothers replies.Success almost spoils him, but then it doesn't, and by then it's too late to care. \\"Hero at Large\\" has begun with a cornball conversation between a young couple, who are discussing her pregnancy — they turn out to be two actors rehearsing their lines.

In choosing an artist wrestling with a mental block as the theme of his new film, \\"La Belle Noiseuse,\\" which is translated in the subtitles as \\"The Beautiful Nut,\\" the director Jacques Rivette has clearly not dipped into autobiography.

This sounds like a truism, yet Mr. Robinson spends the rest of the book bringing to life an appealing and perversely believable pocket paradise.   Most utopian visions make boring reading. Despite some attempt (typically in the opening chapters) to disguise philosophy as fiction, authors with an ax to grind tend to scant storytelling in favor of polemics.

The 13-member band jams high, brittle notes into a piece, creating dissonances, and Mr. Roccisano splits up the players, with the brass and reed sections talking back to each other. He has the horns use mutes or change instruments mid-song to change texture.

The Chase Manhattan Bank, long associated with his family, has been swallowed up by Chemical Bank, forcing Mr. Rockefeller to expressions of gratitude that its name would be kept. Now Rockefeller Center is in financial ruins, up for grabs in a bidding war. In February, Mr. Rockefeller had the unpleasant experience of flying to Japan to plead with the people to whom he sold the world's most prestigious office complex not to declare bankruptcy. But before the meeting began, he fell on the sidewalk and broke his leg.   In financial terms, however, the Chase deal has strengthened the value of the substantial Rockefeller holdings in that bank, and the Rockefeller Center debacle has left the Rockefeller family with a huge financial return. The bankruptcy flowed, after all, from the fact that the Rockefellers managed to sell Rockefeller Center at an inflated price -- not once, but in effect twice. In 1985, the family mortgaged it for $1.3 billion, pocketing an estimated $300 million for themselves. A few years later it sold 80 percent of the property itself to Mitsubishi Estate in Tokyo for $1.4 billion. As a result, $1.7 billion was reaped from properties that are now said to be worth a fraction of that sum.

The trick for Mr. Hancock was to dress up the tunes in new clothes.

That boy is here again, the Pied Piper of the box offices, the eighth or ninth wonder of the world, the kid himself—in short, Mickey Rooney. With a capable assist by Judy Garland, Mr. Rooney strutted into the Capitol on Saturday at the head of \\"Strike Up the Band,\\" and it should surprise no one this morning to learn that the show is his from beginning to end. For a boy of his years he has accumulated quite a bag of tricks and he will show them off at the tap of a drummer's stick. He charges about like the short-handed cast of an old stock melodrama. Mr. Rooney is having himself a time in this one, and—being the frantic actor that he is—chances are that every one else will too.As they say in Hollywood, this show has everything—music, laughter, tears, etc., etc. As usual, everything is a little too much. Amusing as is the parody on the old ten-twent'-thirt', it becomes tiresome when shown in its entirety","excerpt":"Mr. Rooney is very funny in his moments of adolescent exhilaration, but when he blunders into all the furniture for the fifth or sixth time, no; and the soul-searching interludes between mother and son on the question of Mr. Rooeny's future career—they never would be missed. If the film is overlong, lay most of it to the story the scenarists have fabricated around Mr. Rooney's mishaps in getting his high school orchestra to a national contest.But in the sketches and musical numbers the film goes into high gear and Mr. Rooney et al. are at the top of their form. Call him cocky and brash, but he has the sort of exuberant talent that keeps your eyes on the screen, whether he's banging the trap-drums, prancing through a Conga, or hamming the old ham actors. The music is rollicking, especially \\"Strike Up the Band,\\" and \\"La Conga,\\" sung with a good deal of animal spirits by Miss Garland.With Busby Berkeley at the director's megaphone, the boys sitting behind the cameras must have had fun shooting the big numbers, because the lenses are constantly restless, moving from dancers' feet to upraised trombones or zooming down from the ceiling. And the sequences have been assembled as if the cutting-room assistants were rhythm-crazy.Under the circumstances, most of the cast has little to do, but June Preisser does take the stage long enough to turn a neat handspring or two, and Paul Whiteman makes a brief appearance before turning over his baton to Mr. Rooney. Despite the encumbrances of the story, most of the workmanship that went into the production is Hollywood at its smoothest. When they take the rugs off the floor and the youngsters begin moving, \\"Strike Up the Band\\" is spanking good entertainment.

Alexander Schneider has played that part in the lives of hundreds of young musicians, and his example as a leader and educator endears him even to those observers who receive his example as a musician with mixed feelings.   Mr. Schneider gave the second concert of his annual New York String Orchestra workshop Monday evening in Carnegie Hall, leading 50 young string players (and 12 players on other instruments) from all over the country. His musical approach is best understood, probably, in the context of Stravinsky's ''Pulcinella,'' which (in the form of the familiar concert suite) closed his Carnegie program. Mr. Schneider (who worked with Stravinsky and played his music brilliantly) seems drawn to Baroque and Classical music for its tense energy of line, and for the latent violence in its disciplined, ordered contrasts. Stravinsky's dancing arrangement of Italian Baroque music lets those qualities peek in","excerpt":"Mr. Schneider's conducting of Mozart, Haydn and Vivaldi goads them forward. In the ''Pulcinella Suite,'' the match was good.

Several of the masters died, and others, young and old, were artistically and financially exhausted, at a loss for new material as well as new capital. Even Federico Fellini reportedly was hard put to raise money. But film fortunes are known to change suddenly, and now, in the 80's, the Italian film industry and its creators have begun a comeback.

It is an animated photograph with the complete dialogue of the old playlet \\"How He Lied to Her Husband\\" and it is now on exhibition at the George M. Cohan. Its absence of cinematic action may be accounted for by the report that Mr. Shaw was at the director's elbow while the scenes were in the making. One can readily imagine that the presence of the playwright was scarcely conducive to any camera wizardry or to the changing of any part of the play. Cecil Lewis, the director, appears to have been content to let well enough alone. Considering this as an entering wedge to getting Mr. Shaw to dispose of the film rights to other plays, it was no time to discourage him with any suggestion of major changes.This little comedy, which was penned more than twenty-five years ago, makes for a jolly half an hour, even though one may be constantly aware of its limitations from the standpoint of motion picture work. It is not a film that has involved any great outlay of money, but it is one that will be welcomed by all those who enjoy Shaw's agile wit. In fact, failing any imaginative pictorial conception of his plays, it is better to have such carbon copies than none at all.This sketch has three characters—Mr. and Mrs. Bompas and Mr. Apjohn, who has been inspired by Mrs. Bompas's good looks to write a volume of poems about her. The verses in manuscript are inscribed \\"To Aurora.\\"The loss of the poems worries Mrs. Bompas and heated words fly back and forth between her and Apjohn. The woman excites the poet's anger by calling him Mr. Apjohn and she explains that she has now come to think of him as Mr. Apjohn and that it is therefore ridiculous to go on calling him Henry. He thinks of her as—he is not quite sure at first and then says—Aurora.Then enters the stout husband, who has found the poems. The male Bompas's fury bursts forth when Apjohn pretends that the poems were not inspired by Aurora Bompas, but by the Aurora Borealis. The move the poet protests the wilder Mr. Bompas gets, until there is a rough and tumble bout in which Apjohn complains bitterly of a bump on his head.The participants become calmer and wiser when Apjohn tells the truth. What great satisfaction it is to the husband to know that his wife is admired, that she inspired the poems! Bompas says that he may get the poems printed in the best style. He thinks that they are wonderful and that he would \\"like to show them about a bit.\\"Apjohn is past minding anything, he says. He consents to the publishing of the poems. It is then a question as to what the volume shall be called and Bompas suggests that it might bear the words \\"To Aurora,\\" as in the hand-written copy. Apjohn, now quite himself, declares that he would like to call the book \\"How He Lied to Her Husband.\\"Mrs. Bompas's gown suits the date of the writing of the playlet. Likewise the attire of the two men.Vera Lennox gives an intelligent performance as the wife. Edmund Gwenn is capital as the husband and Robert Harris does well with the rôle of the poet.On the same program is another comedy called \\"Compromised.\\" It may have better motion picture direction, but after having listened to Shaw's keen lines it is like London was to Lorelei Lee—\\"Really nothing.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Mr. Shaw's First Film.

Rats chew on rep ties and sensible pumps. The rubble of old health care plans and $600 toilet seats are strewn across Pennsylvania Avenue. The neo-classical buildings are shells. Wild bands of unemployed bureaucrats roam the streets, forcing innocent passers-by to fill out huge volumes of paperwork. A gang war has broken out between the G-6's and the G-7's. Besides bonfires, the only pools of light are in the Capitol and the White House, where the two sides in the budget standoff are hunkered down. How did a once-great nation sink into this dystopia? Follow me back, as I explain:         Nov. 15, 1995: Newt Gingrich admits that pique over how he was treated by the President on the trip to Israel provoked him into writing a tougher spending bill -- which Mr. Clinton vetoed, causing parts of the Government to close.

But ''the jazz tradition'' is a fluid concept these days, encompassing not only blues and bebop but also the jangly polyphony of Ornette Coleman, the enigmatic lyricism of Wayne Shorter and the folk idioms of far-flung locales. Loren Stillman, a saxophonist, and Scott DuBois, a guitarist, are two examples of younger artists with this broad-minded definition of the music, and each has begun to make waves. Last week, Mr. DuBois, above left, took part in the semifinals for the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition","excerpt":"Mr. Stillman, above right, was a semifinalist in 2002. They have several more things in common: exploratory yet melodic sensibilities, serious compositional ambitions and the tutelage of the saxophonist David Liebman. Naturally, the two musicians work together, in Mr. DuBois's longtime quintet; the other members are the saxophonist Jason Rigby, the bassist Thomas Morgan and the drummer Mark Ferber. ''Monsoon,'' an album released last year on the Soul Note label, weighs this ensemble's cohesive looseness against the complex subtleties of Mr. DuBois's compositions. Similar tensions inhabit the music of Mr. Stillman, whose fourth solo album, ''It Could Be Anything'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), will be available in late October. Two nights after playing with Mr. DuBois, Mr. Stillman will lead a quartet featuring the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Ted Poor, each a bandleader in his own right.

With thematic nods to Edgar Allan Poe and the Marquis de Sade, this feature-length phantasmagoria relates the Mad Hatter adventures of a young man, Jean Berlot (Pavel Liska), who, on meeting an aristocrat simply called the Marquis (Jan Triska), tumbles down a very strange rabbit hole. But before this happens, the filmmaker appears, talking into the camera and cautioning (or, rather, taunting) us that what we are about to see is not art, but a horror film, with all the ''degeneracy peculiar to that genre.''      Those seeking the usual charnel-house cheap thrills characteristic of so much modern horror will be disappointed","excerpt":"Mr. Svankmajer's provocations skew toward the intellectual and the shivery rather than the pop and the visceral, and at his best, he doesn't just get under your skin, but also deep in your head, too.

That worries some of the party faithful. It shouldn't. The primary season is never tidy and often exasperating. But the longer it goes, the more we learn. Democracy is served.   What was learned on Tuesday? Senator Bob Kerrey is virtually finished, Senator Tom Harkin nearly so. Jerry Brown did well enough in his native West to stay the course, at least through Super Tuesday. Meanwhile, Pat Buchanan now seems capable of getting one-third of the vote wherever he goes, a measure of Republican discontent and President Bush's oddly disjointed campaign.   The most striking finding, judging by exit polls, was how sharply the vote for Bill Clinton and Paul Tsongas divided along class and racial lines. Blacks and poorer whites voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Clinton, while high-income, better-educated whites favored Mr. Tsongas.    Mr. Clinton outpolled Mr. Tsongas among blacks by 5 to 1 in Georgia and 3 to 1 in Maryland. Eight of ten Georgia voters without a high school education voted for Mr. Clinton","excerpt":"Mr. Tsongas did far better among college graduates in Georgia and won decisively among graduates in Maryland and Colorado.   In Maryland, Mr. Clinton beat Mr. Tsongas by a 2-to-1 ratio among voters with incomes of less than $15,000. The figures were exactly reversed among voters making more than $75,000.   There are two cautionary notes for Mr. Tsongas here. Mr. Clinton's strong showing among blacks augurs well for him on Super Tuesday, when seven contests will be held in Southern and border states where blacks are a significant factor. And looking toward November, educated upper-income voters -- the quiche-and-Volvo crowd who turned out for Mr. Tsongas -- tend to exercise disproportionate influence in Democratic primaries; they loom less large in general elections.    A more important cautionary note applies to all candidates: States are different, not only in size and composition but in the rules and trappings of their primaries and caucuses. There's no guarantee that Mr. Clinton will be able to duplicate his Georgia showing in, say, Florida. Even if he does, Mr. Tsongas should do well in the Northeast and, barring an across-the-board disaster, is likely to be alive and kicking when the campaign moves to the big Midwestern battlegrounds of Michigan and Illinois on March 17.   On the Republican side, a harried Mr. Bush simply can't shake Mr. Buchanan, many of whose supporters said they hoped mainly to send a \\"message\\" to the President. Has he gotten it? He says he grieves for those wounded by the recession, yet so far offers no organized countermeasures.    Meanwhile he missed a fine opportunity in Georgia to repeat the healing themes of his State of the Union address -- his warnings against \\"scapegoating,\\" \\"finger-pointing\\" and \\"racism\\" -- and confront Mr. Buchanan's divisive appeals head on. Instead he apologized for his sound reversal on tax increases, which merely made him look insecure.    All this would have been impossible to predict even four months ago.

His major contribution as a composer has been an ever-evolving technique of electronic-music performance.   On Saturday night, Mr. Tudor introduced a new electronic system designed especially for him: the Neural Network Audio Synthesizer, a fearsomely complex apparatus that processes analog signals through something called a \\"neural network chip.\\" The composer had available a variety of pre-taped segments, which he modified by the flicking of cryptic switches.

This contribution was first sponsored by Pat Powers, a motion picture pioneer, and when he tired of Mr. von Stroheim's penchant for detail he succeeded in winning the support of Paramount-Famous-Lasky. This photoplay has since been a source of no little worry for something like two years to experts of that concern. The length of the presentation as it stands is close to fourteen reels. There are still something like twenty-six other reels and report has it that Paramount may decide to release at least part of the balance as a sequel to the current offering.In spite of its extravagances and its coarseness, it is a picture that holds the attention, but one that is never especially perturbing concerning its loves, its tears, its passions or its brutality. Because of what they are called upon to do and not because of the performances of the players the characters are not much more human than a troupe of Robots.As he did in several of his other productions, Mr. von Stroheim here uses hogs wallowing in their food as a symbol of the natures of one or two of his people. He also calls upon an individual who possesses all the gentility of a Bill Sykes type to register contempt by spitting. One is also confronted with the idea of scenes swinging from the lowly herd of swine to others of apple blossoms raining on a Prince, impersonated by Mr. von Stroheim himself, and a pretty girl.Mr. von Stroheim has a weakness for queer situations and exotic personalities, and the writer of the subtitles has lessened the importance of this film by lines that are more reminiscent of Broadway than Vienna. One is apt to watch the events with a curiosity as to what will be done next by this strange group of people. The Princess von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg, mother of Prince Nicki, is partial to soda water with her wine, and soon after breakfast she, to soothe her nerves, indulges in a cigar. Her husband, the \\"Captain of all the imperial guards,\\" is inspired to arrange matrimonial matters for his son while he is well saturated with wine. Although Prince Nicki appears to be infatuated with Mitzi Schrammell, he is not averse to the company of a bevy of shrieking, gay women.The only person who could lay claim to the laurels of a hero is Mitzi's father, Martin Schrammell. He is terrified of his wife, but when Schani Eberle, who, unfortunately, only spends a few days in prison, tries to embrace Mitzi, old Martin, who looks as if he tipped the scale at 325 pounds, asserts himself quite successfully.Another none-too-likable character is Fortunat Schweisser, a cornplaster king, who induces Prince von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg, to acquiesce to Prince Nicki marrying his lame daughter, Cecelia, the consideration being a million kronen.This director, who would like to be the Zola of the screen, does not hesitate to show crucifixes during inopportune moments. He has evidently taken great pains about a Corpus Christi procession, which incidentally is depicted in Technicolor none too effectively. Yet there is no doubt but that the hosts of people, the solemn-visaged priests, the meticulously clad soldiery and the Church scenes are unusually impressive.Mr. von Stroheim refers occasionally to the \\"Iron Man,\\" an image. Perhaps Prince Nicki is in a way this Iron Man, for it appears to be little concern of his that he should have to wed the limping daughter of the corn-plaster king. The marriage at least means that he will not have to worry about finances.The story, which was supplied also by von Stroheim, is concerned with the real love of Mitzi for Prince Nicki and his half-hearted affection for her. The corn-plaster king and the old Prince are successful in their cups in bringing about the more or less happy union. And, although Mitzi is in tears, one rather feels that she is no worse off in being the wife of the Viennese Bill Sykes—Schani Eberle—than she would be as the bride of the pleasure-loving and utterly unimaginative Prince Nicki. In one case she may be beaten and in the other she is certain to be deceived.Maude George acts the weird Princess von Wildeliebe-Rauffenburg with poise and cunning. George Fawcett's performance as the old Prince is also capable. Mr. von Stroheim succeeds in appearing pompous and militaristic. He also carries his monocle as if he had received one instead of a silver spoon when he was in the cradle. Fay Wray really gives the most sincere performance of the cast, but, as Mitzi, she loses sympathy by permitting her mother to beat her and for being beguiled by Prince Nicki Matthew Betz is not much more than a cardboard brute, for he seems to do little else than expectorate and tip his hat back and forth.

DeMille's ambitious pictorial transcription of the life of Jesus of Nazareth, the Man, that during its initial screening at the Gaiety Theatre last Monday evening, hardly a whispered word was uttered among the audience. This production is entitled, \\"The King of Kings,\\" and it is, in fact, the most impressive of all motion pictures. To anybody, whether familiar or not with the making of shadow stories, this long series of animated scenes, with its fine settings, adequate costumes and uniforms and its host of players, is an extraordinary and unprecedented film undertaking. Mr. DeMille has not satisfied himself with the mere action of the story, but he has endeavored in various ways to depict the characteristics of the Twelve Apostles and others, and in more than one instance he has set forth incidents in an inspired fashion. Mr. DeMille errs, however, in not leaving more to the imagination and in emphasizing far too vividly all the harrowing details of the Crucifixion.Even though the introduction of Christ is accomplished in a fashion so gentle that it is masterful, the presence of Jesus on the screen creates a feeling akin to resentment, largely because Mr. DeMille has insisted on having his camera too close to the player. Mr. DeMille might better have bowed to distance in many of his scenes, especially that in which the three crosses are shown.With admirable dignity and sympathy, H. B. Warner acts the part of Christ. Mr. Warner's countenance is not the general conception of that of Jesus","excerpt":"Mr. Warner's expression is a little severe, and his smile, despite his obvious earnestness and sincerity, is more mundane than spiritual; it is not a smile of sympathy or pity.The first appearance of the Saviour comes as though through the eyes of a little blind girl as she gradually recovers her sight. There are blurred circles on the screen and these become clearer and clearer until, through Jesus's miracle, the little one perceives Christ before her.The story opens in a startling and strange way. Instead of gazing upon something gentle, such as Christ delivering the Sermon on the Mount of Olives, one sees in prismatic colors the gilded abode of Mary Magdalene. On leaving this episode, Mr. DeMille takes the spectators to Jesus of Nazareth and soon afterward Christ is seen raising Lazarus from the tomb. A memorable sequence is that in which the boy Mark is made to walk.The question of paying tribute to Caesar is expertly photographed. Here Mr. DeMille takes full advantage of the incident with the wide scope of the camera. Peter is sent forth to catch a fish, in the mouth of which, as he was told, he finds the silver piece. Roman Centurions, who had been watching the disciple, immediately after Peter leaves, throw lines into the sea, and when they look into the mouths of the fish they catch their feelings are mingled with disappointment and wonder. During this chapter. Mr. DeMille avails himself of the opportunity to give an idea of the wisdom of Christ in answering Caiaphas, the High Priest.Not the least effective of the scenes is that in which Christ turns the money-lenders out of the Temple. Jesus is shown going from one money-lender's table to another, overturning them.In the second half of this production Jesus appears before Caiaphas and subsequently before Pontius Pilate. Up to the time the director reveals the scourging of Christ, this part is excellent. But in lieu of merely snowing a Roman wielding a thong, Mr. DeMille persists in stressing all the terrible pain. A centurion, who pricks his hand against a thorn, cuts down the twigs and makes the crown to be placed on Christ's head. Here again the agony is dilated upon.The scenes in which Pontius Pilate discourages further punishment of Christ and where he eventually washes his hands of the trial, after asking the multitude whether they chose Jesus or Barabbas shall be freed, are inspiringly pictured. And so is the incident dealing with Peter thrice denying Christ \\"before the cock crows.\\" Ernest Torrence figures as Peter, and, although he is just a trifle extravagant at times, the pathos of Peter's plight and mental anguish is skillfully portrayed.One of the most beautiful scenes in this production is that of the Last Supper. It is strikingly like the old paintings of this subject, but here the figures come to life. Christ is seen passing the water and the wine and eventually the anxious eleven Apostles question Him as to who is the one who \\"shall betray Him.\\"Those scenes dealing with the carrying of the Cross to Calvary are remarkable, but even they might have been no less effective by having the figures further away from the camera. The incident wherein Simon of Cyrene offers to bear Christ's cross is filmed with reverence, solemnity and sympathy.After the crucifixion there is a wonderful storm effect, with the \\"rending of rocks.\\" The cross on which is Christ stands, while everything else is blown away, and the throngs are filled with terror.The cast of this production is an imposing one, for a number of well-known actors have been content to appear in minor parts. Caiaphas is portrayed with marked ability by Rudolph Schildkraut, and his son, Joseph Schildkraut, impersonates Judas Iscariot. Robert Edeson is splendid as Matthew. Mary, the Mother, is impersonated by Dorothy Cumming. Jacqueline Logan appears as Mary Magdalene. Victor Varconi is excellent as Pontias Pilate. One could, in fact, go down the long list of players and commend one after the other.Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld's music score, with the introduction of many well known hymns, including \\"Lead, Kindly Light,\\" is a distinct asset to the production.

It's hard to say whether he's careless or disorganized or whether he's attempting to borrow the loose, associational structure of modern Western fiction. Whatever the case may be, it doesn't work.
