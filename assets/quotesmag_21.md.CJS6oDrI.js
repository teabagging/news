This stratagem creates a few moments of apprehension, the same disconcerted quality that the hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are experiencing on their journey. Their mission began in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; when Frodo was entrusted with the ring that gives its bearer enormous powers and, incidentally, could begin the end of life on Middle Earth. The warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) has been inflated into an even more assured, reflexive action hero. He helps a bewitched king (Bernard Hill) defend his castle.

Miss Taylor has big blue eyes and, being quite a clever actress, she is able to make them sparkle at the mere suggestion of precious stones. She has a trim little figure that is well set off by an array of frocks and gowns.Miss Taylor seems so sympathetic when she refers to those poor males who have not been educated up to the idea of giving a girl lasting presents instead of perishable stuff like champagne and orchids. Lorelei is not averse to a real gentleman kissing her hand, but she is prompted to remind him that while the kiss is sweet and all that sort of thing, a diamond bracelet abides forever.Poor Dorothy, the pert brunette who excels in \\"uneducational\\" utterances, is played by Alice White. She is also an excellent selection. It is Dorothy who refers to Sir Francis Beekman as a \\"passionate pilgrim\\" and who makes astoundingly good use of the colloquialism, \\"plenty.\\" She tells the deaf Mrs. Spoffard that orchids go well with the old lady's \\"tin ear.\\"This film is an infectious treat. Malcolm St. Clair has given to it just the right touch. The adaptation and the titles were furnished by Miss Loos, and the producers will be forced to admit for once that the cooperation of the author has been of immense assistance.Lorelei, that angel-faced schemer, reveals herself as an enemy of procrastination. When Spoffard, the would-be sociologist, is attacked with mal de mer, Lorelei makes the hours glitter after permitting her azure orbs to lighten up with interest at the sight of the ponderous form and monocled countenance of Sir Francis. And not until she has prevailed upon the parcimonious Sir Francis to part with ¬£2,000 with which she, Lorelei, buys Lady Beekman's tiara, does this blonde betray a coldness toward him. Lorelei is so eager to help Mr. Spoffard to save Paris from its wickedness that she naturally interests the half-hearted reformer.The personal pronoun slips off Lorelei's tongue most glibly and she is never too tired to improve her mind by decorating her forearm with bracelets and her neck with pearls, being well aware of the refining influence of such nice things. She is depressed when she realizes that the big transatlantic vessels scorn to encourage literary lassies by having jewelry shops aboard. It is this triumphant diamond hunter who tackles London and who sounds the doom of the British metropolis by declaring it to be \\"really nothing.\\"In the chapter where Lorelei and Dorothy are traveling (at Gus Eisman's expense) to Europe, this golden-haired daughter of Arkansas looks at Mr. Spoffard, who dreads seasickness and, probably in most mellifluous tones, says:\\"How blue the ocean is!\\" Later, when Mr. Spoffard is pale and distraught, to the accompaniment of a sparkle from her ultramarine optics, Lorelei hazards:\\"How rough the ocean is!\\"Miss Taylor has grasped to perfection Loreliei's calculating characteristics. Her (Lorelei's) disappointment in a man may not be observed by him, for she has a way of permitting only Dorothy and the audience to catch the flash of dissatisfaction caused by the conduct of one of her victims. It is only a fraction of a second afterward that Loreli employs an imploring expression, one which seems to imply that she is totally ignorant of her physical attraction.An episode, which takes place before Sir Francis has been cured of his parsimoniousness, aroused no little mirth at the initial presentation of this film. Sir Francis comes to the stateroom occupied by Lorelei and Dorothy. He at once fills his silver case with Lorelei's cigarettes, which action caused Dorothy to remark that it's a pity they can't let Sir Francis have the coupons that go with the smokes. Sir Francis is willing to accept champagne, but he dodges the signing of the check, so when he holds his glass aloft and announces that he gives a toast to the charming hostess, Dorothy calls attention to the man's amazing generosity.In the opening sequence, Lorelei's grandfather is perceived digging for gold and it is presumed that the granddaughter (who one day impetuously permitted a revolver to kill her employer while the weapon was in her hand) inherited her desire for gold and her taste for diamonds and pearls from this gray-haired, unsuccessful gold-digger.Mack Swain, the \\"Big Jim\\" Mackay of \\"The Gold Rush,\\" gives a fine portrayal of Sir Francis. Holmes Herbert delivers an adroit interpretation of Mr. Spoffard. Ford Sterling, who has forsaken exaggerated pantomimics, is excellent as Gus Eisman. It is the best character study Mr. Sterling has given to the screen and one that proves that he can act with restraint. Emily Fitzroy lends humor to the part of Lady Beekman.
