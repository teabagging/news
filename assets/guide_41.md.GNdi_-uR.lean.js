Barrie, Kenneth Grahame and A. A. Milne (Free Press, $24) briskly examines the authors of five classics of British children's literature and offers shrewd assessments of those profoundly eccentric men and their great works. Each of the writers, Ms. Wullschlger says, \\"needed a child as muse to trigger the adult imagination into creating an extraordinary fantasy. Once locked into this magical world, however, each drew on his own peculiarly strong affinity with childhood.\\" The key there is \\"peculiarly,\\" because, as she  discreetly puts it, \\"all shared a reluctance to engage in conventional behavior  and relationships.\\" The creation of those fantasy lands, she argues, was made possible by, and in turn reflected, \\"the confidence and prosperity of Britain between 1860 and 1914.\\" It was a confidence that \\"lasted until the First World War, when to die ceased to be the awfully big adventure that Peter Pan had expected.\\" Ms. Wullschlger, a literary critic and feature writer at The Financial Times in London, thinks that A. A. Milne's work from the 1920's belongs with the others because it was \\"a throwback\\" and \\"nostalgically desperate\\" for what had been lost. While she is insightful and clear about all five writers, she is particularly good on Edward Lear. She does not hesitate to  address Lear's homosexuality, but she insightfully notes that his relationships  with children \\"had none of the anguished, knowing intensity of Carroll's or Barrie's.\\" Lear, she says, \\"made child-friends and then let them go, as easily and carelessly as a child on holiday would.\\" \\"The Owl and the Pussycat,\\" that most beloved nonsense lyric about \\"two odd, sexless, cozy lovers,\\" was written shortly after Lear was talked out of making a proposal of marriage to a much younger woman, she observes, and it is a poem of \\"hopeful escape.\\"   Eden Ross Lipson Books in Brief: NONFICTION","excerpt":"Inner Children"},{"year":"1931","title":"Annual dinner REPORTERS SATIRIZE POLITICAL LEADERS","excerpt":"Inner Circle \\"Actors\\" in Light Vein Entertain Notables With Tuneful Topical Revue.

This innocuous tale of co-ed activities at a State university is so far from life that it should be viewed as a burlesque on college, but Alice White as Babs is so plaintively serious that it is difficult to categorize such a picture. It is a hectic collection of \\"smart\\" subtitles, moronic dialogue sequences and a series of situations clipped indiscriminately from all the college yarns since \\"Brown of Harvard.\\"If only some of those directors who depict the collegiate types could be coaxed to visit an institution of higher learning the screen might not suffer from such deplorable exaggerations.The story of \\"Hot Stuff\\" is about the blonde Babs, whose Aunt Katie receives $10,000 from an accident claim she had filed years before. This enables Aunt Katie to send her niece to college and to go along to insure the young girl the good time that the elderly woman had been deprived of in her youth. Louise Fazenda plays the part of Katie.Babs goes to college and attains the reputation of being the wildest on the campus. Mack Moran is the \\"fastest\\" male and his pursuit for the favors of Babs is as tasteful as the plot. The dénouement comes when each learns that the other was only putting up a front and that they both are just old-fashioned and home-loving. At this point the plot has attained such speed, what with the frenzied jazz parties, \\"necking\\" bouts and the rest, that it lifts itself by the bootstraps and flings itself over the cliff into the abyss of a \\"sweet\\" ending in which Miss White turns completely \\"cute.\\"Other Photoplays.The principal attraction at the Mark Strand is \\"The Singing Fool,\\" with Al Jolson.\\"Loves of Casanova,\\" with Ivan Mosjoukine, is now on view at the Little Carnegie Playhouse.At the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse the film feature is \\"Cyrano de Bergerac.\\"\\"The Pagan,\\" with Ramon Navarro, is being shown at the Capitol.\\"Cabiria,\\" an Italian film, is the screen attraction aa the Fifth Avenue Playhouse.\\"Close Harmony\\" is at the Rialto, \\"Bulldog Drummond\\" at the Apollo, \\"The Broadway Melody\\" at the Astor, \\"The Squall\\" at the Central, \\"Innocents of Paris\\" at the Criterion, \\"The Trial of Mary Dugan\\" at the Embassy, \\"Alibi\\" at the Forty-fourth Street, \\"Christina\\" at the Gaiety, \\"Mother's Boy\\" at the George M.

Krazy Kat was the subject of a 1922 jazz ballet by John Alden Carpenter and a 1988 novel by Jay Kantor. Willem de Kooning and Jack Kerouac were both Krazy Kat fans. Critics have enthused over the cartoon strip's playful, \\"Joycean\\" language, Beckett-like dialogue, and the bleak, surreal setting of Herriman's Coconino County, an existentialist's dreamland where mesas can suddenly turn into mushrooms and day abruptly into night. It is never even clear whether Krazy is male or female.   In the current issue of the journal Postmodern Culture, Elisabeth Crocker, a doctoral candidate in the Department of English at the University of Virginia, subjects Krazy Kat to the analytical scalpels of contemporary literary criticism, which attempts to deconstruct many of the beliefs and ideas Western culture takes for granted, showing them to be human inventions, not timeless truths. The meaning of sexuality, language, even of reality itself are all fair game. Perhaps it's only appropriate, then, that her essay, \\" 'To He, I Am For Evva True': Krazy Kat's Indeterminate Gender,\\" exists not only on paper but in the amorphous geography of cyberspace: It is available as a hypertext document in a layer of the Internet called the World Wide Web, which can be reached through many online services using a program called Mosaic.

Characters were obsessed with their hands: they stretched them out, spasmodically jerked them in the air, gazed at them in fascination, posed with them in imitation of ancient Egyptian wall paintings. The characters also never seemed to look at one another, let alone touch one another as they moved at glacial tempos across the stage. There was no kiss from Kundry to awaken Parsifal's guilt-ridden desire. There was no Eucharist with bread and wine. There was not even a Grail.   Frida Parmeggiani's costumes added to the peculiarities: Klingsor was attired in a distorted Mother Superior outfit, Parsifal was wearing a jump suit with the legs cut open, the knights wore what seemed to be gowns, and the squires were all attired in Pharaonic outfits. The only characters whose sex was clear from their clothing and makeup were Gurnemanz and Kundry.   But despite problems, this is a fascinating production of this grand and sickly work. The staging was originally planned in 1981 for the Kassel State Opera, but budget and technical problems delayed its premiere until the Hamburg State Opera presented it last spring as a collaboration with the Houston company. By all reports, Houston has now done it greater justice, giving the visual and conceptual elements an imposing musical foundation, aided by English surtitles.   Even though I have seen little of Mr. Wilson's work aside from \\"Einstein on the Beach,\\" the style was familiar: the attempt to create a different sense of space and time through slow transformations of expertly lightened stage images, the highly ritualized use of artificial gesture, the sense that particular meanings of words are less important than the work's mysterious power.   So instead of a naturalistic set, Mr. Wilson placed the opera in front of a white rectangle the size of a movie screen, with a tilted metallic hill leading up to it. By using lined scrims and carefully controlling lighting, the dominant effect was of an expanse of water, suited to the languid, rippling passions of the music. Klingsor's castle was a black monolith rising out of this liquid floor, with a door dropping open to reveal a fluorescent cubicle","excerpt":"inside, the monstrous villain, in mime makeup that distorted his eyes, gestured and posed as if he was King of the Night. The Temple of the Grail was represented by a white torus lowered from the sky, encircling an enormous crystal, a sort of New Age Church.   Curiously, all of this was less avant-garde than it seemed. Productions of \\"Parsifal\\" have been dominated by images from Bayreuth. (In fact, more than any other of Wagner's operas, \\"Parsifal\\" was inextricably linked to Wagner's stage temple; at first, performances were not permitted elsewhere and the Met could only offer its 1903 production because the United States did not then recognize international copyright restrictions). Bayreuth productions have tended toward abstraction, particularly after Wieland Wagner's 1951 staging, which set the whole opera on an illuminated disk, (the torus's ancestor). The opera, with its sense of slowly changing interior mental landscapes, practically forbids realism. Wagner himself wrote about \\"Parsifal,\\" in 1878: \\"After creating the invisible orchestra, I should like to invent the invisible theater as well.\\"   What, for example, should happen on stage when Kundry sings to Parsifal for 20 minutes about his mother? Mr. Wilson rejected the notion that there is anything naturalistic about this kind of communication. He decided that it should not be portrayed as a conversation, nor in a typically operatic manner, with the hands held out expressively (\\"Is it raining?\\" Toscanini used to ask), but with formal gestures choreographed to the music's phrasings.   The result was a schematic, languorous representation of the drama. Kundry's gestures mirrored and resisted Klingsor's; Parsifal's and Gurnemanz's movements created a subtle dance of imitation and recognition. The communication between characters happened only indirectly, without contact or gaze. The music provided the connections. But the artifice, rather than lessening the score's power, added to it.   The production was immeasurably aided by Christoph Eschenbach, the music director of the accompanying Houston Symphony, who held together the long, flowing lines without diminishing the intricate undercurrents and tensions that shift the music's allusions. Each phrase seemed thoroughly rehearsed, but never routine.   The cast also comprised first-rate singers. The baritone Richard Paul Fink gave Klingsor a mixture of obsession and strength. Monte Pederson's lines as Amfortas created an impressive combination of pain and authority. Harry Peeters was an authoritative Gurnemanz, commanding the stage in the framing acts. John Keyes's Parsifal seemed to undergo a musical evolution toward expressivity as his spiritual transformation proceeded.   Dunja Vejzovic, who has sung Kundry at Bayreuth, was a matronly figure here, her vocal lines suggestively weary and haunting; her second-act encounter with Parsifal was touching even as it turned bewildering under Mr. Wilson's direction. But through no fault of Miss Vejzovic's, the character of Kundry was the weakest part of this production: her motivations were unclear, her gestures with a long wand were too oddly distracting, her sexless threat too unconvincing.   Moreover, by having the \\"kiss\\" become some sort of metaphysical seduction, by having even the Flower Maidens never touch Parsifal, and by confusing the sexual appearance of nearly every character, this opera -- so founded upon notions of sexuality and renunciation -- became oddly inhuman in ways even Wagner could not have imagined.   But it is a measure of the strength of Mr. Wilson's imagination and the abstract power of Wagner's music that the work became seductive even in its detachment. While it was too self-consciously affected to provide the \\"invisible theater\\" Wagner envisioned, its visible aspects -- peculiarities and all -- remain in the mind and the ear like a troubling dream, somewhat like \\"Parsifal\\" itself .

Miss King's voice has dark, exotic overtones, sometimes bordering on baritone, which she uses judiciously for coloration rather than as a novelty. She has the range to go to an easy, unstrained and unusually warm pop-song level in a gorgeous delivery of \\"What Is There to Say,\\" an unduly neglected show tune of the 1930's. She introduces it as \\"a Vernon Duke song,\\" which is only half true: Duke composed its airy, memory-haunted melody, but its witty, ironic lyric (\\"I'm caught in a deadlock, I'd even face wedlock with you\\") is the work of E. Y. Harburg. His words are as important to the song -- and to Miss King's moving interpretation of it -- as Duke's music.   The rich texture of her voice, which is so effective in that song and others from the same musical era -- \\"Dancing in the Dark,\\" \\"How Long Has This Been Going On,\\" \\"I Only Miss Him When I Think of Him\\" -- is even more impressive in her quietly spoken introductions. But the spirit behind some of her singing is uncertain, and when her piano accompanist, Richard Rodney Bennett, plays an occasional solo chorus, his fresh, sparkling performance overshadows her voice.   When he joined her in singing the last song in her first show on Tuesday with a rough, husky delivery that more than made up in artistry what it lacked in musical quality, it became apparent that one or two more duets might have helped Miss King over the less secure spots in her program.
