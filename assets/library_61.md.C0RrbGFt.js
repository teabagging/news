Even in the most stellar productions of Shakespeare, the Elizabethan locutions tend to impede perfect comprehension.

The director's vision of the play revolves around the very believable concept of Romeo as a supersensitive adolescent who has just discovered the opposite sex and is in love with the idea of love as much as he is with Juliet herself. As portrayed by Robert Sean Leonard, who was so memorable in the role of an oppressed, suicidal adolescent in the film \\"Dead Poets Society,\\" Romeo becomes a gangling, starry-eyed youth given to self-dramatizing fits in which he sometimes seems about to choke on his own words.

England and the United States have a recent one: the rave, a psychedelic dance party for the video-game generation. Audiences wearing striped shirts, baggy jeans, stocking caps and backpacks arrive prepared to dance. The rave is a sojourn in an electronic wilderness of strobe lights, video abstractions, rainbow-striped spotlights and nonstop, computer-driven music with endless variations on a boom-chicka-boom beat.    From Saturday night into Sunday morning, the rave promoters Nocturnal Audio and Sensory Awakening took over the New York Coliseum for Maskarave 2, the New York stop of the See the Light tour, with four live groups and an all-star crew of disk jockeys. See the Light is the largest rave tour to date, carrying the rave experience beyond its established coastal enclaves. While its trappings are familiar to a New Yorker, they still have dizzying effects, and may seem more startling elsewhere.

The 20-year-old Lachaise encountered her on a spring day in 1902 walking along the banks of the Seine, and fell so deeply in love that he followed her across the Atlantic and bided his time until 1917, when she finally divorced her husband and married him. Lachaise gave up a promising career in Paris, then the indisputable center of the art world, for a life in the relative cultural backwater that was New York during the early years of this century. In turn, he gained for himself a subject on which to base some of the most original American sculptures of this century.

Singing in a reedy high voice, his pitch elastic when reaching toward high notes, he approximates gospel music's melismatic undulations.   Ultimately, however, Mr. Hucknall doesn't have so much to do with the tradition as detractors might imagine. At Simply Red's sold-out show at Summer Stage in Central Park on Wednesday night there was no fervor or ardency, no need to simulate the catharsis bred from thousands of Saturday night parties or Sunday morning services. Like most British fans of American music, Mr. Hucknall is ever a connoisseur, taking a certain easy sensuality from his sources and transforming it, adding a rock intensity and a simplicity to it. And he left out the singular aspect, where the performer recounts problems to the audience as he might to a friend. Mr. Hucknall was addressing instead the larger pop world.

For the new Davis Museum and Cultural Center on the Wellesley College campus, the first building outside Spain designed by Mr. Moneo, one of the world's most respected architects, is right next door to the Jewett Arts Center, the first major building erected anywhere by the eminent American, Mr. Rudolph. The Jewett, now 36 years old, is a building of no small importance to American architecture. And it is not easy to build in the shadow of.         I have always thought of the Jewett as the design in which Paul Rudolph managed to achieve what Eero Saarinen spent most of his career trying to do, which is to create a version of modernism that would be rich, textured, almost picturesque, and comfortable in its relationship to older buildings around it. Mr. Rudolph's art center sits beside the historic Gothic structures of Wellesley with comfort and ease: this building of red brick and stone trim with concrete grilles is secure enough to eschew the extremes of either imitation or defiance.

Give them a film about a woman—a good woman—suffering woefully because of a man's insensitivity and they'll eat it up, corn and all. That explains \\"The Mistress,\\" which opened yesterday at the Guild.This black-and-white Japanese picture, which was called in that country \\"Wild Geese\\" and was directed by Shiro Toyoda, a veteran of the Tokyo studios, puts a morally mawkish situation upon a tear-misted screen. It is downright ingenuous, by our standards: Yet we are told they loved it in Japan.It is the story of a beautiful young woman whose father is exceedingly poor and who, to help him, agrees to become the mistress of a not too attractive middle-aged man. She is led to believe he is a merchant and a marriageable widower, but she later discovers he is a money-lender, a low vocation, and he has a wife.In the meantime, our gentle young mistress has been seen and become attracted to a handsome student who makes a fine impression when he kills a snake that is about to enter her house (any resemblance to symbolism is studiously intended, we feel sure).She prettily yearns toward this young fellow and tries to get him to come calling on her, when her patron discovers the interest and gets livid with jealousy. He also lends the young fellow money wherewith he can arrange to get a job abroad, and this leads to—well, you can imagine. Heaven forbid it should have a happy end.There isn't much point to this fable of personal disappointment and chagrin, except that it offers the very soft-hearted an opportunity to take a mild emotional bath and dwell thoughtfully upon the custom that might bring a nice young woman to this end. Contributing to this inducement is Hideko Takamine in the leading role. She is a pretty and well-behaved young actress and you can readily have sympathy for her.Contributing, too, are some settings of pleasing architectural design and some costumes that cry for color but still conduce to a delicate mood.Eijiro Tono as the patron is appropriately offensive in obvious ways, and Hiroshi Akutagawa makes the student a depressingly diffident dope.The musical score is in an oddly European operatic style, which indicates someone was influenced by the passage of a \\"Madama Butterfly.\\" Indeed, there are points of resemblance between that opera and this melancholy film, set around 1900.The English subtitles are prim but clear.

(13% Germany, 9% France, 7% Netherlands, 5% Benelux), 13% U.S. Early megalithic and Iron Age peoples of Britain, primarily Celtic, developed tribal states that were conquered by Roman invaders in A.D. 43. After Roman legions withdrew from Britain in 410, invasions of Jutes, Angles, and Saxons conquered much of England, while Celtic peoples flourished in Wales, Scotland, and especially Ireland. Viking invaders established settlements in the eighth century. A united Saxon kingdom fell to the Norman invasion of William the Conquerer in 1066. An aristocratic rebellion against the royal absolutism of King John in 1215 led to the royal acceptance of the Magna Carta, guaranteeing legal rights and laying the foundations of parliamentary government. From the 12th to the 15th century, the Plantagenet dynasty ruled England and claimed overlordship over Ireland; Wales was conquered in 1283. The Plantagenets also controlled sizable territories in France. The Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) cost England its French possessions; the War of the Roses, (1455–85) ended the Plantagenet dynasty and brought Henry Tudor (Henry VII) to the throne. The Tudors gradually centralized royal control by bringing pressure against both the church and the nobility. Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534 and established the Church of England. Under Elizabeth I, the last of the Tudors, England defeated Spain at sea and laid the foundations of later worldwide English sea power. The English Renaissance began under Elizabeth I (1533–1603) with the works of Shakespeare and continued into the 17th century with Milton and Newton. The Stuart dynasty was founded by James I (1566–1625), uniting the crowns of England and Scotland in 1603. The English Civil War (1642–49) culminated in the execution of Charles I and the proclamation of the Commonwealth (later the Protectorate) under Oliver Cromwell. The monarchy was restored with Charles II in 1660. In the bloodless Glorious Revolution (1688), James II fled before a Protestant army under the Dutch William of Orange, who married and ruled jointly with James's daughter Mary II. The English Bill of Rights established the supremacy of Parliament and made the government a model of constitutional monarchy. In the last gasp of the Stuart claimants to the throne, Irish supporters of James II were defeated at the Battle of the Boyne (1690), which temporarily crushed Irish resistance to annexation by England. The United Kingdom was created when Scotland was joined with England in a common Parliament by the Act of Union in 1707. A Scottish uprising led by the Young Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart, was crushed at Culloden Moor in 1745. Ireland was made part of the United Kingdom in 1801. In the 1700's the United Kingdom became the greatest sea power in the world, controlling an empire that included much of North America and India. Agrarian “enclosures” of the 18th century ruined the peasantry but created an entrepreneurial revolution in agriculture that ultimately led to greatly increased agricultural productivity. The capital created in the process contributed to the success of the Industrial Revolution, which over the next century made England the wealthiest land on earth. Despite the loss of the 13 colonies after the American Revolution (1775–83), England consolidated its holdings in the Indian subcontinent, Australia and New Zealand, Malaya, Hong Kong, much of eastern Africa from “Cape to Cairo,” and elsewhere. Britain's prosperity and moral purpose were embodied in the person of Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland (1836–1901) and Empress of India (from 1836). The repeal of the protectionist Corn Laws in 1846 led to an agricultural depression and hastened the migration of labor from the countryside to the industrial cities. The rise of labor activism led in 1906 to laws granting privileged status to trade unions, which organized the Labour party to promote their interests. Britain's involvement in the Triple Entente with France and Russia ensured its participation in World War I (1914–18) against Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary. Victory came at the cost of an entire generation of British youth, but Britain emerged from the war with its empire at a high point, adding Tanganyika, Jordan, Palestine, and Iraq as part of the postwar division of spoils. Most of Ireland became independent in 1921, however, leaving only Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. Between the two world wars, Britain's navy and air force were the largest in the world, its army the third largest. Yet its industry was aging, the Great Depression hit especially hard in the British Isles, strikes and labor unrest weakened the social fabric, and colonial ties began to weaken in the 1930's. Economic retrenchment led to a failure to rearm in the face of the rising threat of Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. The Munich Pact of 1938 gave Hitler a license for war; his invasion of Poland in 1939 forced Britain into the conflict. When Winston Churchill became prime minister in 1940, Britain was under daily air attack and in danger of an invasion by sea, and the country was dependent on American friendship and lend-lease war materials. But 1941 brought alliance with the United States and the Soviet Union, and a slowly turning tide of war leading to victory in 1945. Still, postwar Britain dropped to the second rank of superpowers. The coalition between the Conservative and Labour parties that had governed Great Britain during the war seemed no longer necessary in 1945 as the war wound down. Labour won a landslide victory in the 1945 elections; Churchill was recalled in the midst of the Potsdam Conference, and Clement Atlee became prime minister. A brief Labour flirtation with the U.S.S.R. quickly ended in the postwar 1940's; England became a founding member of the United Nations and also, in 1949, of NATO. As the Cold War took shape, Britain developed its own nuclear arsenal. The Labour party nationalized the Bank of England along with railroads, public utilities, and heavy industry. A comprehensive welfare state apparatus was created, including a national health service, unemployment and retirement benefits, and free education at all levels. But Britain was in many respects too poor to afford such changes; in order to cut expenditures, the government hastened the process of withdrawal from colonies and military bases around the world. India was granted independence in 1947, and Palestine, Burma, and Ceylon in 1948–49. The elections of 1951 brought Churchill back to the prime ministership at the head of a Conservative majority that would last for 13 years. The Conservatives returned steel and trucking to the private sector but in general refrained from undoing the social policies of their Labour predecessors. Economic growth began in the 1950's and held steady at about 2.5 percent per year, a significantly lower rate than in continental Europe; obsolescence, excessive wage and benefit settlements, and a low savings rate all took their toll. The coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 added a much-needed element of national celebration. Churchill retired in 1955 and was succeeded by Anthony Eden. Eden's government fell in 1956 over the failed Anglo-French invasion of Suez. Eden's fall in 1957 brought to power Harold Macmillan, who pursued close relations with the United States. Most important, he presided over the transformation of an empire to a commonwealth; in the early 1960's, Ghana, Nigeria, Malaya, Singapore, and numerous other colonies were granted independence and Commonwealth status. Immigrants from the Commonwealth promptly flocked to England, straining housing, social services, and the labor market and creating problems of assimilation that remain unsolved. Britain under Macmillan was the moving force behind the European Free Trade Association in 1960. In 1961 Britain applied for membership in the EEC, but that application was humiliatingly vetoed by France's Charles de Gaulle in 1963. Macmillan's government fell with the Profumo Scandal of 1963, and Douglas Home became a caretaker prime minister pending new elections. The 1964 elections brought the Labour party to power under Harold Wilson, whose moderate positions made him unpopular with his own party, especially when he sponsored legislation to ban wildcat strikes. Strikes, wage inflation, the steady growth of the public sector (including renationalization of the steel industry), and the rise of turmoil in Northern Ireland in 1968–69 combined to make public support for Labour evaporate. The Conservative victory in the 1970 elections brought Edward Heath to the office of prime minister. Promising to cut expenditures and taxes, reward initiative, and curb union power, the Conservatives were able to accomplish none of those aims. Heath's government imposed ineffective wage controls in an attempt to slow inflation and passed the 1971 Industrial Relations Act to regulate unions. When unions defied that act, the government fell. Heath's major achievement was the United Kingdom's admission to the EC in 1973. Continued turmoil in Northern Ireland was met with the abolition of Ulster's Stormount Parliament in 1972 and the imposition of direct British rule—a policy that did nothing to stem the growing sectarian violence. Wilson returned to the prime ministership in 1974 and retired in 1976, passing on the office to James Callaghan, who governed until 1979 at the head of a Labour-Liberal coalition. The continued power of trade unions was seen in the repeal of the Industrial Relations Act and the extension of union privileges. The left wing of the Labour party brought increasing pressure against defense spending, membership in NATO, and also loudly criticized American involvement in Vietnam. The OPEC oil price rises of 1972–74 hurt Great Britain in the short run but also encouraged development of oil and gas fields in the North Sea, which made the nation a major petroleum exporter and helped revitalize its economy. Oil exploration in the North Sea also encouraged Scottish nationalism, with some damage to national unity, although in both Scotland and Wales, proposals in 1979 for separate parliaments were soundly defeated by plebiscites. The 1979 elections brought the Conservatives to power again, behind Margaret Thatcher, Great Britain's (and Europe's) first female prime minister. She proved to be the only British prime minister in modern times to lead her party successfully in three elections. Thatcher took office with an agenda that involved undoing much of the course of postwar British history. The first target was inflation, attacked through a freeze on expenditures and reduction of government borrowing. The policy was a success; inflation fell from 18 percent in 1980 to 3 percent in 1989. But the austerity program had a high cost in unemployment, which remained at 14 percent in the mid-1980's. In 1982 national attention turned abruptly to overseas concerns, as Argentina invaded the Falkland (“Malvinas”) Islands (only 300 miles east of Argentina), which it had long claimed as Argentine national territory, on Apr. 2. On May 21 British forces launched a counteroffensive, and the invading Argentine forces surrendered on June 14. The nation's success in mounting an amphibious operation 6,500 miles away provoked an upsurge of patriotism that swept Thatcher's party into a second term in 1983. After the election the government turned to denationalization of industry. Over $30 billion in state property—from industrial giants, such as Britoil and British Gas, to individual apartments in municipal housing projects—was sold to private interests. This program was followed in 1986 by tax cuts, in which the top income-tax rate dropped from 98 percent to 40 percent. In foreign affairs, Britain agreed in 1985 to return Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The 1987 elections pitted the Conservatives against a weak Labour party that opposed NATO missile deployment in Great Britain, advocating unilateral disarmament and calling for renationalization of industry and a return to higher taxes for the wealthy. The Conservatives easily won their third straight election. By 1989 the “Thatcher Revolution” had produced a decisive long-term economic recovery, but one that was unevenly distributed: the southern part of the country enjoyed an economic boom, while the older industrial cities of the north remained stagnant. In 1990 an economic slowdown and rising inflation led to a strong decline in support for Mrs. Thatcher and her government. She resigned in November 1990. Thatcher was replaced by Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, whose greatest challenge has been Britain's role in a united Europe, to which Britain now has a land link via the 31-mile Channel Tunnel (Chunnel), completed in 1994. In the April 1992 elections, the Conservatives, led by Major, won a comfortable 21-seat margin in Parliament despite a recession. Not since the Napoleonic Wars has a British political party been able to form four consecutive governments. Yet only 13 months later Major's ratings in the polls had fallen to 21 percent as the economy stalled and the Conservatives themselves split badly over some elements in the E.C.'s Maastricht Treaty. The Conservatives were further beset in 1994 with a series of tabloid scandals and allegations of political corruption concerning arms sales to Iraq and Malaysia. Conservative chances in parliamentary elections, due in the spring of 1997, were looking very slim, and they looked worse in March after the government clumsily handled the news that scientists had concluded that eating English beef could cause the fatal “mad-cow” disease. After insisting that there was no cause for alarm the government was forced to deal with an E.U. boycott. The parliamentary election of May 1997 ended 18 years of Tory government with Labour winning its largest majority since 1935, 419 seats to the Conservatives 165. The new Prime Minister Tony Blair appointed a cabinet of political moderates. In 1997 Hong Kong was returned to China without incident and in April 1998 the Blair government succeeded in negotiating a settlement in Northern Ireland although problems still remain. In May 1999 the first elections to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly were held. Labour won a plurality in both (over nationalist parties). The two bodies have authority over education, environment, health care, housing, and law enforcement. The Scottish Parliament also possesses authority to tax. In the 2001 elections Blair's Labour Party won a huge victory, taking 413 of 659 seats, the first time Labour had won two consecutive victories. Still, in local elections in May 2002 and 2003, the Conservatives trounced labor. The vote on invading Iraq carried overwhelmingly (412–143); yet in the aftermath of victory serious troubles arose for the Blair government over the intelligence accounts used to justify British participation.

Nominally part of the Chinese empire since the Song dynasty (960–1279), Taiwan was inhabited only by non-Chinese aboriginals before the 17th century. Around 1600 the Portuguese established a trading station on Taiwan; they named the island Ilha Formosa. In 1620 the Dutch built Fort Zeelandia near present-day Tainan, controlling the island until they were driven out by the Chinese pirate-patriot Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong). Remnants of the overthrown Ming dynasty (1368–1644) held out on the island until 1683, when it came under the sway of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Thereafter, substantial numbers of farmers from Fujian Province migrated to the fertile western lowlands of the island, driving the aboriginals into the central mountains. The Qing dynasty administered Taiwan as a semiautonomous subprovince of Fujian Province. Following China's defeat by Japan in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, Taiwan was ceded to Japan as a colony. The Japanese built roads and railroads to exploit Taiwan's resources of rice, timber, and minerals. In 1945, after Japan's defeat in World War II, Taiwan was returned to China. As the Chinese civil war turned against the Nationalist party of Chiang Kai-shek (see “China”), Nationalist troops began to prepare Taiwan as a base for a retreat from the mainland. In 1947 Nationalist agents executed several thousand students and others suspected of favoring Taiwan's independence from China. In 1949 approximately two million Nationalist soldiers, government officials, and civilian sympathizers retreated to Taiwan. The relocated Republic of China (ROC) continued to claim to be the legitimate government of all of China, now under Communist control. In addition to Taiwan proper, the Nationalists occupied the P'eng-hu Islands in the Taiwan Straits and the small islands of Quemoy and Matsu just off the coast of Fujian. Recovery of the mainland became a cornerstone of ROC policy, but no serious attempt was made to do so. U.S. policy in the Taiwan Straits was to defend Taiwan against Communist attack but also to keep the two rival governments of China separated. A successful program of land reform in the early 1950's led to the creation of surplus capital, which fueled the development of an industrial base on the island. Foreign investment from Japan and the United States, and American military and economic aid, also enhanced economic development. By the early 1970's, the island had developed an export-oriented economy, producing textiles, cement, plastics, assembled electronic appliances, and other manufactured goods. Chiang Kai-shek, president of the Republic of China since 1928, died in 1975 and was succeeded by his son, Chiang Ching-kuo. Under both father and son, the Nationalist party (Kuomintang, or KMT) controlled both the ROC and the Taiwan Provincial governments; mainland refugees and their descendants (15% of the population) dominated senior government posts and the military officer corps. Native Taiwanese played the leading role in agriculture, industry, and in local and county governments. In 1971 China's seat in the United Nations was taken away from the ROC and awarded to the People's Republic of China, leaving Taiwan in international diplomatic limbo. On Jan. 1, 1979, the United States withdrew its recognition of the ROC and inaugurated mutual diplomatic relations with the People's Republic. Under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, nominally nongovernmental relations were maintained between the U.S. and Taiwan through the American Institute in Taipei and Taiwan's Coordination Council for North American Affairs in Washington, D.C. Taiwan's economy has continued to be one of the world's most vigorous; Taiwan enjoys a substantial favorable balance of trade with the U.S. In 1986 Pres. Chiang Ching-kuo began a policy of liberalization; in 1987, he abolished martial law and allowed non-KMT political parties to function legally. Some barriers to travel and communication with the mainland by ROC citizens were eased, but Taiwan's government continued to rebuff all calls from the mainland for direct contacts and discussions of reunification. Chiang Ching-kuo died in Jan. 1988 and was succeeded by his vice president, Lee Teng-hui. In March 1990, Lee was overwhelmingly reelected by the National Assembly in the first election for the office. The ruling KMT maintained its hold on power in legislative elections on Dec. 19, 1992, but the opposition Democratic Progressive party scored a stunning success, tripling its number of legislative seats and bringing the issue of Taiwanese independence to the forefront. Factional rivalry deepened in the KMT, with Pres. Lee's Wisdom Coalition challenged by the New Kuomintang Alliance of Prime Minister (and former general) Hau Pei-tsun. Hau reluctantly resigned on Feb. 3, 1993, to take responsibility for the electoral fiasco, but his faction, with military backing, continued to pose a threat to Pres. Lee's power. During the campaign for Taiwan's presidential election in March, 1996, China held aggressive military exercises off the coast of Taiwan in an effort to influence the voting; the U.S. sent two aircraft carriers to the area. In a rebuke to Beijing, President Lee, who had campaigned for a more visible international role for Taiwan, was resoundingly re-elected; he was also re-elected as the head of the KMT in August, 1997. Since then, talks for cross-straits cooperation between Taiwan and the PRC have been inconclusive, and the ruling KMT saw its power eroded in local elections as voters protest against corruption and economic stagnation related to the Asia-wide economic crises of 1997–98. The KMT rebounded strongly in 1998 elections but tensions rose in 1999 with mainland China, when Pres. Lee's expressed interest in Taiwan's being included in a proposed anti-missile defense of its Asian allies (the “last straw” to Beijing). Later, Lee announced that Taiwan would conduct its relations with China on a “state-to-state” basis, meaning Taiwan was an independent state—to Beijing, an “extremely dangerous step”. In March 2000, the KMT was peacefully voted out of power after 50 years. Chen Shui-Bian of the Democratic-Progressive Party was elected president. In Aug. 2002 Chen said he would seek legislation to authorize a referendum on Taiwanese independence.

Mr. Capone called the glass tower ''crystal-like and faceted'' and said it would ''reflect the church dome and the neighboring buildings and the blue of the sky'' for an ''ever-changing'' appearance.   Robert Geddes, dean of the Princeton University ScHOOL OF Architecture and the consultant St. Bartholomew's has retained to advise it on the suitability of the project, has used similar words.  He has described the design as ''adding a crystalline object to the church'' and has written that a slender tower behind the church could be ''like a traditional campanile.''   These are seductive words indeed. So, too, are the lines I.M.

Indeed, the dancers and choreographers involved with them may be gifted. But their efforts are spoiled either by the inept ways in which their works are produced or by the dreariness of the theaters in which they are staged.    My heart sinks when a work starts late -- not just five minutes or so after the announced starting time (after all, most theater managements give latecomers a grace period) but 15 minutes, 20 minutes or even later. If dance-company directors aren't careful, performances may resemble poetry readings.

It was given to him by friends who had reached the limits of exasperation. He is astonished that in the month that he's had his answering machine, he has met, courted and parted from two women whom he never once saw and who did not think it odd that they never once saw him. So far, he has resisted subscribing to Call Waiting, feeling that in addition to the rudeness of interruption, the immediate and illusory feeling of power (which he calls the cosmic connection) would overwhelm and then depress him. He is of the opinion that this cosmic connection -- also provided by CNN and certain electronic bulletin boards -- is possessed of a powerful means of seduction whose pull he must resist.\\n\\nThe use of machines is, ideally and among other things, a means of better using time. But if that is so, my friend asks, why is it that it now takes four or five exchanges of information when previously it took only one or two?

Sloan Jr.'s credo for turning General Motors into the world's largest company was simple: \\"Growth,\\" he said, \\"is essential to the good health of an enterprise. Deliberately to stop growing is to suffocate.\\" But size can be stifling as well, and last week G.M. gave up hope of regaining the immense portion of the market it has lost. The auto maker plans to shut nine plants, leaving it with a record quarterly loss of $1.98 billion G.M. executives want a company at least as trim and fit as Ford became after closing plants and cutting costs proved his company's decision to change course. \\"Any rigidity by an automobile manufacturer, no matter how large or how well established, is severly penalized by the market,\\" he wrote. G.M. said its write-offs cover all foreseeable costs, but many analysts wonder whether G.M. will continue to shrivel. As James P. Womack, who studies the auto industry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, \\"The real question is whether four years from now we'll just be repeating the process.\\"    Ford and Chrysler, despite their efficiency campaigns, had a tough quarter too. The Ford Motor Company's third-quarter earnings fell 78.7 percent to $101.7 million on weak demand for cars and losses at its savings and loan subsidiary. The Chrysler Corporation blamed lower production of minivans and continuing sales incentives for a $214 million loss. Chrysler asked for special concessions from the United Automobile Workers, but the union said that a tentative contract settlement last week followed the pattern at Ford and G.M. Chrysler said on Friday that is has given up on arranging a European joint venture with the Fiat Group of Italy. The End Of the Clamshell Era  It was a landmark in the cluttered landscape of corporate images. The McDonald's plastic foam box completed an identity program that began with the arches and continued with proprietary names for variations on the hamburger. The package served several functions well, said Stewart Mosberg, senior director of the Walter Dorwin Teague Associates industrial design firm. \\"It retained heat, it was lightweight, and disposable,\\" he said. \\"It's ubiquitous. It's everywhere.\\" But the yellow clamshell boxes with the bold logos also became some of the nation's most visible refuse. Environmentalists faulted the company's plans for recycling packages that otherwise take decades to degrade. Last week, the company abruptly announced it would turn to paper and cellophane packaging instead. The technological challenge: using paper, not foam, to keep the lettuce and tomato cool and the hamburger separate and warm in wrapping a McDLT.   A Slide for Steel  Staying in the steel business has its costs. USX said last week that it plans to make its steel operations a wholly owned subsidiary -- easing the way for a sale of all or part of them, as Carl C. Icahn, the company's largest shareholder, demands. Lower steel earnings left the USX Corporation with a 6.8 percent drop, to $163 million, in third-quarter income, despite higher profits from energy. Bethlehem Steel, still relying almost entirely on its prime business, reported its quarterly profits fell 78 percent to $10.1 million. Even as the weaker dollar has helped American steelmakers fend off imports, overcapacity and a slack economy have tamped down their prices. Said Peter L. Anker, an analyst at First Boston, \\"This is the lowest-price market in the world today.\\"   A Probe at New York Telephone  Prosecutors who have found widespread corruption in the buildings department of New York Telephone may seek criminal indictments, the company's president said on Friday. Frederic V. Salerno said as many as 80 of his employees, and some at other companies, are under investigation. In Brief  R.H. Macy & Co. plans to sell as much as $150 million in equity to help repay its debts. Britain's two satellite television networks, British Satellite Broadcasting and Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television, plan to merge. Harold Evans, the editor in chief of Conde Nast's Traveler magazine, took over as publisher at Random House. Having resigned as editor of The Times of London eight years ago in a dispute with its owner, Mr. Murdoch, Mr. Evans is now responsible for publishing Mr. Murdoch's memoirs. Federal regulators announced plans on Friday to sell 18 large savings and loan associations, including Lincoln Savings, the industry's most costly failure. INTERNATIONAL   A Moscow Currency Sale  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev plies foreign companies with more blandishments, but too few to persuade them that his nation is truly open for business. Mr. Gorbachev has recently announced steps to help Western businesses take home their profits and manage their ventures without Soviet partners. Beginning in January, foreign businesses with ruble earnings will be able to bid at Government auctions of convertible currencies. Western companies doubt they will obtain enough hard currency to avoid the trouble of taking their profits in pickles, pianos and other local products. And these businesses might continue to depend on Soviet partners for office space and plant sites, since foreigners cannot own property and have difficulty renting it. Only a determined program to free prices and make the ruble convertible will allow liberalized business policies to succeed, said Michael Mandelbaum, director of the Project on East-West Relations at the Council on Foreign Relations. \\"The history of reform has been too little, too late,\\" he said. \\"You really need a big bang.\\"   The Value of a Dinar  It was becoming difficult to squeeze all the zeroes onto the currency. By the time Yugoslavia issued a million-dinar note, now worth less than $10, superscript exponents seemed like the next step. Instead, the Government of Prime Minister Ante Markovic has, in the last year, introduced a new, semi-convertible dinar, worth 10,000 of the old ones, and pegged its value to the German mark. Prices have been freed, import restrictions relaxed. Inflation fell from 2,500 percent last year to less than 1 percent in July and August before higher wages and energy prices caused a 7 percent jump in September. \\"It's a shock program,\\" said Keith Crane, a senior economist at Planecon, a Washington consulting firm, \\"similar to that of Mexico or Poland.\\" Yugoslavian industrial output fell by about 10 percent this year. But Mr. Markovic's popularity remains one of the few forces holding his fractious country together. THE ECONOMY   The Indicators Drop  A plunge in the leading economic indicators and continuing job losses left many economists debating only about the severity of a recession. The leading index fell eight-tenths of 1 percent in September, the second straight monthly decline. Nonagricultural employment shrank by 70,000 in October, the fourth monthly decline, according to a payroll survey. Although October unemployment remained at 5.7 percent, economists pointed to slow growth in the labor force rather than renewed hiring.  Gloom on Growth  Word that the gross national product grew at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the third quarter caused no cheer. Several economists said that higher oil prices began doing damage only recently. Alan C. Lerner, of Bankers Trust, foresees just a short, mild recession. But he added that continued Federal borrowing and burdensome corporate debt will retard growth \\"for years to come.\\" Reading the Fed's Signs  Was the Federal Reserve Board's reduction in interest rates last week just a beginning? Several observers say so. Neal M. Soss, chief economist at First Boston, predicts that, at its Nov. 13 meeting, the Fed will authorize another quarter-percent reduction in the short-term Federal funds rate -- \\"with more to come after the New Year.\\" The cut last Monday, to 7.75 percent, fulfilled the Fed's pledge to ease interest rates after Congress agreed to reduce the budget deficit. Then came a cascade of disappointing reports likely to turn the Fed's attention from fighting inflation to softening a recession. As William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter, said about the Federal Reserve's chairman, \\"I don't think Alan Greenspan wants to be the grinch that stole Christmas.\\"  More Grim News  Much of last week's other economic news was sobering: weekly unemployment claims up 33,000 for the week ending Oct. 20","excerpt":"September new-home sales falling to their lowest level since the 1982 recession; the fourth consecutive monthly drop in the purchasing managers' index of economic activity. Consumer spending did bounce up 1.1 percent in September, and personal income rose as well.

But the newlyweds have barely enough time to paint their house before their idyll is shattered.         Almost overnight, the powder keg of ethnic hostilities that had been held in  check by Communist rule begins to blow. In disbelief, the couple watch televised reports of angry demonstrations spreading across Yugoslavia. The hatreds rapidly mushroom into full-scale civil war. Toma soon finds himself drafted into the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army. Anna, who is pregnant, moves in with her parents after her neighborhood turns into a war zone. But there is no escape.
