In his use of a gospel choir and his own orchestra, Ellington tried to find common ground between the sacred and the secular, and there's an element of the revue to it, as if Louis Jordan had suddenly stepped in as librettist to make sure things didn't get too serious. But there are also passages of extraordinary beauty, where Ellington's scoring of the material -- one section harmonized two clarinets with an alto saxophone to create an eerie stillness -- is stunning in its vision.   David Berger's version of the \\"Sacred Concerts,\\" performed on Monday night at the Manhattan School of Music with the Institutional Radio Choir, Jon Hendricks, Wynton Marsalis, William Warfield and others, also showed how fluid the material can be. Mr. Berger modernized the music. Drawing on the three recorded versions, he cut some selections, added excerpts he'd found in the Smithsonian's Ellington archives, and clipped some of the less felicitous moments. He added a vocal chorus, featuring Jon Hendricks (who was meant to be the original singer for the work), and he let the soloists stretch.

Also, make certain it is bent up the way it should be to make firm contact with the bottom of the bulb by prying it up care fully to bend it to a more upright posi tion.

With the recession trickling down to the music industry, sales of recordings and concert tickets were off considerably, leaving a good many top names playing before embarrassingly empty halls and stadiums. MTV was clearly less impressed than George Bush with the Persian Gulf War, obviously preferring the \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" protesters.

Mr. Leguizamo is a star, no question -- he doesn't need a strobe to burn bright -- but he also announces himself from that moment as an actor of phenomenal range. And there's 100 minutes of his tour de force still to come.   \\"Spic-o-Rama,\\" which is at the Westside Theater, picks up where his previous survey of Hispanic New Yorkers, \\"Mambo Mouth,\\" left off.

Otherwise, things are pretty much the same, as the screenwriters Don Rhymer, Harald Zwart and Dylan Sellers do their best to duplicate the first film's blend of James Bondish adventure and adolescent anxieties. Young Cody is assigned by the director of the C.I.A. (Keith David) to track down the rogue agent Diaz (Keith Allen), who was once Cody's trainer at C.I.A. camp but has now joined the evil English aristocrat Lord Kenworth (James Faulkner) in a mad plot to rule the world by implanting mind-controlling microchips in the molars of world leaders.  Directed by the British filmmaker Kevin Allen (&quot;Twin Town,&quot; &quot;The Big Tease&quot;), &quot;Cody Banks 2&quot; is full of chase sequences and comic battles, but Mr. Allen's work is compromised by an apparent inability to match his shots in a spatially coherent fashion.  It's never easy to tell who is chasing whom and in which direction, a needless confusion that dampens many of the thrills and scuttles quite a few of the gags. — Dave Kehr 'Agent Cody Banks 2' -- 'Destination London'"},{"year":"1931","title":"Hurt in auto crash Jan 8 LAWYER, 71, IN TAXI CRASH.","excerpt":"Malcolm Jackson of Charlestown, W.

Is it reasonable to assign a human attribute to sperm? The logic that led to this conclusion is akin to arguing that since there are more poor people than rich people, societies are biased toward the poor, the poor have an advantage over the rich, and the rich are discriminated against. Biology doesn't have biases, but the people who study and interpret it do.   There is considerable evidence that more male than female fetuses are conceived and born. One could say, therefore, that sperm carrying the Y chromosome has an edge at step one of the reproductive process. This male \\"advantage,\\" however, ends there. Males are at a distinct disadvantage for survival.    Male fetuses are more likely to experience prenatal distress and die before birth than female fetuses. Males have more difficulties during birth and, as a result, more males are born with birth defects than are females. Young boys are more vulnerable to disease and developmental disabilities. And men die at a younger age. By late adulthood, there are more women than men.    Thus, at the beginning and end of the life cycle, males are physically more vulnerable than females. From conception on, males are at a physical disadvantage. The male advantage begins after birth and only as a result of external forces imposed by social and cultural gender dictates.    It is necessary to begin with more male fetuses if there are to be equal numbers of females and males by young adulthood. This may well be nature's strategy for efficient reproduction and child care to assure the perpetuation of the human species.   When you write, \\"Even from conception, males apparently enjoy an advantage over females,\\" and when Dr. Barry Bean, an associate professor of biology at Lehigh University, states, \\"There seems to be discrimination against women even before they're born,\\" this attributes a social relationship to genes and a parallel between social structures and genetic blueprints. The implication here is that gender inequality is rooted in genetics and is consequently defensible.

Researchers from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., presented in the journal Science the most persuasive evidence yet that sexual orientation is partly or largely innate, rather than being dictated by one's upbringing or a disregard of social norms.   Studying the family histories of 114 avowedly homosexual men, Dr. Dean Hamer and his colleagues discovered that many of the men's male relatives on the mother's side of the family were themselves homosexuals. The pattern pointed to a genetic link with the X chromosome, which in men is always inherited from the mother. Scrutinizing the X chromosomes of 40 pairs of gay brothers, the scientists found that in 33 cases the brothers shared a region at the bottom tip of the chromosome, a far greater proportion than would have been expected from chance alone.

Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., came into rather more than a billion dollars not so long ago, people talked as if there had been nothing like it since Jupiter presented himself to Danae in the guise of a shower of gold.   There was going to be no limit, they said, to what the Getty Museum could do, It could drain the seas. It could flatten the mountaintops. It could teach an armadillo to read Spinoza. And in its spare moments it could ruin the art market and make every other museum look ridiculous.   Some of those people were very jumpy indeed. When the Getty Museum paid the Marquess of Northampton nearly $3 million last year for a High Renaissance painting by the Ferrarese painter Dosso Dossi, there was an outcry in England.

As the film opens he has grown into a full-fledged gay man, though he is still living in the home of his parents, Maria (Ginette Reno) and Gino (Paul Sorvino). Angelo finally works up the courage to move out of his parents' home and into an apartment he shares with Nino (Peter Miller), a closeted Montreal cop. The problem for Angelo and Nino: how to keep their loving relationship a secret from their volatile parents, who are still eagerly fixing them up with &quot;nice Italian girls.&quot; Émile Gaudreault's direction is about as basic as you can get: his film consists almost entirely of close-ups, with a cut from one character to the next at the end of every line. The accents wobble from the Chico Marx delivery of Mr. Sorvino to the distinctly French-inflected line readings of some of the local actors. As Angelo, Mr. Kirby has a boyish charm, which is probably the best that can be said for this film as well. — Dave Kehr 'Mambo Italiano'"},{"year":"2004","title":"Article on theory postulated by Uganda-born political scientist and cultural anthropologist Mahmood Mamdani that terrorism does not necessarily have anything to with Islamic culture and that spread of terror as tactic is largely outgrowth of American cold war foreign policy","excerpt":"Mamdani, in new book Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War and the Roots of Terror, maintains that non-state violence during final stage of stand-off with Soviet Union was to blame; photos (M) When U.S. Aided Insurgents, Did It Breed Future Terrorists?"},{"year":"1979","title":"HELLO, DOLL! &#8220","excerpt":"Mame&#8221; back, and about time.

This shows how lamentably the press has fallen in with the merchandising philosophy that corrupts Presidential politics. In this view candidates are merely products being marketed to gullible masses, and how in the world are you going to sell the saps a New Miracle Crispy Chief Executive Packed With Crunchy Goodness if it goes around scowling on television? Humans scowl. Products simper and smile while barkers, nowadays always called \\"handlers,\\" promise twice as much of whatever you want. And for lower prices than ever before!         Many normally sensible political journalists have scolded Dole for his performance with Miss Couric. The burden of their sermon is that he cannot be elected unless he stops acting human and starts behaving like a product. This shocks me. Nothing could be more refreshing than a Presidential candidate behaving like a real live man. I regret not being glued to the TV set when Dole  did it. If he persists in refusing to behave like a product he might end by being irresistible to millions and carry 49 states.

Sports of The Times","excerpt":"Man in the Plus-Fours"},{"year":"1958","title":"IT is a weird form of comic embarrassment that is imposed upon Fernandel in the French film \\"the Man in the Raincoat\\" (\\"L'Homme a l'Imperméable\\"), which came to the Paris yesterday. Freshly murdered bodies are dropped sequentially into his arms, under circumstances that make it look quite likely that the murders have been committed by him. Naturally, these multiplied embarrassments considerably ruffle his aplomb.The first of these misadventures occurs when he diffidently pays a visit to the apartment of a young woman who apparently plies an ancient trade. Being a modest musician and also a comfortably married man, he approaches the situation with a good deal of clumsiness and dread. Imagine, then, his disturbance when the woman tumbles through the bathroom door and into his arms with a dagger planted expertly between her shoulder blades.This is the start of a series of problems for the frantic Fernandel, during which, in attempting to escape discovery, he only gets deeper into the soup. A bearded blackmailer turns up, played coyly by the comic Bernard Blier, and drags him into further complications in which the actual killer is tacitly involved. And because of these complications more bodies fall into Fernandel's arms and evoke from him various startled readings of his favorite expression, \\"Ooo, la, la!\\"The score totals up to seven before the clumsy clarinetist is cleared.As the butt of such grisly buffoonery, it would be hard to beat Fernandel. He's the boy who can act disconcerted with more tangling up of more parts of his body with more pieces of furniture than any comedian we know. When he is trying to get out of that dank apartment, and, at the same time, get a pet fish back into an upset bowl, it is painfully funny pantomiming. Terror pops from the eyes of Fernandel.He is funny, too, in other situations with the slyly conniving M. Blier, who embellishes a grotesque characterization as elaborately as does Fernandel. An atmosphere of absolute misgiving is developed between the two, so that the humor of comic conflict crackles whenever they delicately lock horns.But, sooner or later, the digressions of an increasingly complicated plot and the eventual sameness and monotony of bodies tumbling out of doors tax the capacity for diversion of even Fernandel. The fun in the basic situation is pretty soon squeezed dry. And Julien Duvivier, who directed and wrote the script with René Barjavel, isn't able, for all his pepped-up timing, to keep it sufficiently droll.Claude Sylvain is attractive as the killer, Judith Magre smolders as the first girl killed, and Jean Rigaux is ponderously amusing as the orchestra friend who puts the bug in Fernandel's ear. Jacques Duby is oily as a scoundrel and John McGiver, who was great as the cuck-olded husband in \\"Love in the Afternoon,\\" is something less than delightful as a somewhat similar evil character.As for the English subtitles, they keep you completely informed.Also on the bill at the Paris is a fetching short, called \\"City of Gold,\\" which reflects with a great deal of flavor and nostalgia on the famous town of Dawson City, which was the center of the great Yukon goldrush in 1897-98.
