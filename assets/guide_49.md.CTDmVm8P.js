In support of this theory, Howard Smith has constructed a paean to the most justifiably unheralded inventors in history, assembling crazy snippets and even crazier characters into a film guaranteed to make you smile.Not everything is quite so funny as the wet baby alarm, say, or the man who can play \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" on an air pump, or even the oft-repeated spectacle of someone in a homemade flying machine waving an ungainly pair of wings and going splat! But Mr. Smith, in this good-humored tribute to ingenuity gone wild, documents such a wide variety of weirdos that he's bound to offer something for everyone. Mr. Smith's interest, not strictly confined to inventors, is broad enough to embrace every species of harmless fanatic, from human flies to astronauts, just plain showoffs to real daredevils. Even the sheer scope of this enterprise is good for a chuckle or two.For \\"Gizmo!,\\" which opens today at the Manhattan I theater, Mr. Smith has combed numerous film archives and found footage of the following: A device that enables a German shepherd to power a washing machine. Goggles with windshield wipers. A whirling spaghetti fork that spatters food instead of spinning it, and a clock that says things such as \\"It's 10 o'clock, Mother — go to market!\\" when it ought to chime. A rubberized beard cover, to protect the wearer from the problem of wetness while he swims. A man who plays an instrument made out of a scraggly, hollowed-out tree branch and some bottle caps. A woman who, after careening along a high wire to which she's fastened by her teeth, announces \\"At last I've found a safe way to cross Times Square!\\"The film clips in \\"Gizmo!,\\" most of which seem to come from the 30's and 40's, often show particular inventors at their oddest as they explain whatever their pet projects happen to be. It goes without saying that a man who, for example, has gone to the trouble of learning to exhale through his left ear — he uses this talent to blow up balloons — is strange. Mr. Smith uses a number of clips that show inventors speaking in a supposedly casual manner that only exaggerates their nuttiness. One man's explanation of how he learned to play \\"The Trail of the Lonesome Pines\\" by squeezing his hands together is even funnier than the musical interlude that follows.\\"Adios!,\\" cries one adventurer to the camera, before embarking on a \\"rocket flight\\" that takes him 50 feet, instead of to the moon. \\"Where shall I drop you?\\" asks a pilot to two of his passengers, who are supposedly demonstrating commuting techniques of the future. \\"Mount Vernon!\\" they cry, and then one asks the other \\"Say, have you heard the one about the traveling salesman?\\" Before this authentic commuter talk can be continued, they are jettisoned by parachute out a trap door in the plane.Mr. Smith, a columnist for The Village Voice who also directed \\"Marjoe,\\" has assembled \\"Gizmo!\\" with a cheerful messiness and a certain amount of repetition that, in a 79-minute documentary, pose no problem at all. The bouncy musical accompaniment to a number of sequences, and the concluding footage of a skiier gloriously aloft on a glider rig, confirm that Mr. Smith's attitude toward his subject is essentially benign, even admiring, and certainly fond. His delight in the material steers him away from any cruelty, in a film with considerable potential for same, and lends the whole thing a feeling of friendly celebration.The Borodin Piano Trio, which immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union four years ago, will appear Sunday at 8 P.M. in Reisinger Auditorium of Sarah Lawrence College on Glen Washington Road in Bronxville, N.Y.

These qualities have made his music both popular and critically satisfying.

Mr. Lubovitch is equally eclectic as a choreographer.

OLD-TIME CHRISTMAS     The Butler-McCook Homestead in Hartford will be open from noon to 4 P.M. today, displaying all the accouterments of an old-fashioned Christmas while the Hartford Chorale serenades visitors with a repertoire of carols.    Replicating the traditions of the family that once lived there, a plain paper-covered wooden box contains the tree, just like the box used by the McCooks from 1875 to 1927 -- a formidable example of New England thrift. Under the box, a sheet is spread to protect the carpet, and the tree is decorated with well-worn ornaments that the family preserved for years.    The display has evolved from notations in 19th-century diaries and from early photographs and includes Christmas stockings in graduated sizes, filled and laid out in the dining room.    Admission is $2, $1 for children. The house, one of eight historic homes owned and maintained by the Antiquarian and Landmarks Society, is at 396 Main Street. The phone number is 247-8996. GUATEMALAN EXCURSION     When Dr. Nicholas Sullivan participated in an expedition to the Alta Verapaz section of Guatemala, sponsored by the National Geographic Society, he and his colleagues were surprised to learn that the Quiche Indians, who live on a remote limestone plateau, still practice ancient rituals in caves that resemble early Mayan temples.    As president of the Explorers Club and a former president of the National Speleological Society, Dr. Sullivan has explored caves all over the world. He will give a slide talk about his adventures and discoveries on Thursday at 8 P.M. at the Greenwich Arts Center, 299 Greenwich Avenue. Admission will be $4 at the door.    The program is sponsored by the Archeological Associates of Greenwich. For more information call 661-4654. NEW LIFE, OLD BARN     Lots of people talk about leaving the urban rat race and making a new life in an old country barn, and some of them have done it, including Skitch and Ruth Henderson. Their home -- the Silo at 44 Upland Road in New Milford, a 200-acre former farm, where they live and work producing art and craft shows, managing a cooking school, entertaining in style and maintaining Mr. Henderson's music studio -- is a special delight at Christmas time.    A 23-foot decorated tree and a selection of gifts and edibles are for sale, as well as a new cookbook called \\"Ruth and Skitch Henderson's Seasons in the Country,\\" which the proprietors wrote with with Judith Blahnik. It contains photographs by Lans Christensen and a foreword by one of the Silo's eminent cooking teachers, Jacques Pepin.    Mrs. Henderson will autograph copies of the book from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M. today, Saturday and next Sunday; from 5 to 9 P.M. on Tuesday; from 5 to 8 P.M. on Dec. 20 and 21, and from noon to 4 P.M. on Dec. 23.

SEPHARDIC TRADITION     The Voice of the Turtle is a music ensemble that specializes in works from the Sephardic tradition, performing on a wide array of instruments from the Near and Middle East and from Medieval and Renaissance Europe. They will give a concert on Thursday at 8 P.M. in the Charter Oak Cultural Center at 21 Charter Oak Avenue, Hartford.    The works are sung in original Judeo-Spanish and Hebrew and other linguistic variations that evolved among Spanish Jews who migrated to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Italy and Turkey. Tickets are $14, $7 for students. Call 249-1207 for reservations. WINTER SOLSTICE     Back in the 1890's, it was not unusual for holiday travelers who were stranded by snowstorms at New Haven's railroad station to keep their spirits up with singing, dancing and storytelling. That happy spirit is the basis for \\"Take Joy!,\\" a winter solstice revelry scheduled at 2 and 7 P.M. on Saturday and 5 P.M. next Sunday in Sprague Hall on the Yale Campus at College Street.    Among those participating in this interpretation of an impromptu turn-of-the-century entertainment are the New Haven Morris Dancers and Sword Team, the New Haven Country Dancers, the Elm City Vintage Dancers, a group of Sacred Harp singers, a troupe of mummers, and the Brass Ring Quintet.    Music by Stephen Foster, Charles Ives and other American composers will underscore the nostalgia, and the audience is expected to participate, as it does each year, in the dancing and singing. Tickets are $8, $5 for children and the elderly. Call 497-9052 for more information.

It begins with Lucía narrating; she is about to board a plane with her husband, Ramón, for a Brazilian vacation. He disappears with the tickets as the flight is being announced. After the initial shock of her husband's broad-daylight vanishing wears off, she's forced to recognize that her marriage hadn't been a particularly happy one for some time. Ms. Roth's radiance and understanding of Lucía's emotional life gives this movie a touch of necessary psychological accessibility. Movies of this subgenre, in which the protagonist has to come to an understanding of herself by measuring her own life against her previous somnolent bourgeoisie existence, can feel vapid. This is partially because the star has to awaken from her own passivity before our very eyes. Ms. Roth makes Lucía's state a willful ignorance instead, and her emerging recognition of her unhappiness, as new information comes to light, adds a dimension to the material. The film also has two able, love-struck neighbors who lend her a couple of hands: Félix (Carlos Alvarez Novoa) &#151; a battered and elderly former political firebrand who still has a bit of a fuse left &#151; and Adrián (Kuno Becker), a 20-ish musician determined to prove his seriousness by quoting dense philosophical precepts at the most inopportune moments. Mr. Serrano stages his wobbly adaptation of Rosa Montero's novel &quot;La Hija del Canibal&quot; with lively, fast-moving efficiency.  Ms. Roth uses an anticipatory jitteriness, too, and gets to take a deep breath at the end of &quot;Lucía, Lucía.&quot; She deserves it, because she's kept the picture going. &#151; Elvis Mitchell Her Husband Disappears, So She Must Find Herself"},{"year":"1976","title":"THE WOMEN The changing role of females in Cuban society from 1895 through the 1960's is the subject. of &#8220","excerpt":"Lucia&#8221; (1969), a Cubanmade feature that tonight at 6 o'clock begins a series of four Tuesday evening movie programs about women of Latin America.

Better late than never. The Freud exhibition now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is startling, moving and unforgettable, and it leaves no doubt that, at 71, Mr. Freud is the greatest living figure painter.    What has changed in six years? About Mr. Freud, nothing really, except that his work has become progressively bolder and more astonishing as he has undertaken a series of mural-size nudes whose fleshiness and strange humanity have no real parallel.

And set it down as entertainment of an extraordinarily captivating sort, as vivid and impressive to the eye as it is eloquent and moving to the ear.For the Italian company which produced it has spared neither talent nor expense in putting this monumental opera into the format and idiom of the screen. Excellent singers from La Scala and the Rome Opera, skilled designers of costumes and sets, some of Italy's best musical artists and screen performers have combined to give it style. And Director Clemente Fracassi has molded it all into a show that has real pictorial beauty and movement, synchronized to a rich, heroic score.Most conspicuous in this achievement—to the ordinary film patron, at least—is the clear and understandable visualization of Verdi's immense and tragic theme. At last, through articulate performance and the occasional use of a narrator's voice to foretell in simple English what you are about to behold, the noble tale of the love of two women for a handsome Egyptian warrior and the end of it all in a tragic climax is clearly and movingly revealed.With the drama thug articulated and emphasized with collateral battle scenes and all the mammoth ceremonials of the opera that are ordinarily confined within the area of a stage, the emotional content of Verdi's music has a new and exciting clarity. The optical and aural stimulations have equal magnitude.For instance, the opera's great high point of the hero's triumphal return from conquering the Ethiopians and capturing the father of Aida, the Ethiopian slave, is staged with tremendous regal splendor in a full-scale palatial set, with plenty of room for troops of soldiers to move around in and a stunning ballet to be performed. This, in color and to the soaring music of Verdi's marches, chorales and arias, whips up a sensuous excitement that is of uncommon nature in films.Likewise, Aida's sad outpouring of love for the hero, sung in the early stage of the opera, or her meeting on the banks of the Nile with her captive father, preceded by her haunting aria, \\"O, cieli azzuri\\" (\\"Oh, skies of tender blue\\"), are rendered both fluid and eloquent by her lonely movement through palace corridors and her naturalistic presence in a creditable river-bank grove.No bones are made by the producers about the fact that the roles are sung by voices other than those of the actors who perform them on the screen. This is not a deception or distraction. Sophia Loren, the handsome girl who plays the dark-skinned and regal Aida, might just as well be singing the glorious airs that actually come from the throat of Renata Tebaldi and have been synchronized to her lip movements in her scenes. The advantage is that a fine voice is set to a stunning form and face, which is most gratifying (and unusual) in the operatic realm.So, too, does Lois Maxwell perform the difficult dramatic role of Amneris, the Egyptian princess, while Ebe Stignani sings the role","excerpt":"Luciano della Marra performs the hero with Giuseppe Campora's voice, and Afro Poll plays Aida's father while Gino Bechi sings the role.Except for some minor distractions, such as the unevenness of Aida's dark stain, the film is a major achievement, and we are grateful to S. Hurok for presenting it here.

But whereas ''Keepers'' and its successor, ''The Slow Train to Milan,'' dealt with a young Englishwoman married to a Venezuelan (as the author once was), ''The Tiger'' partakes less of autobiography and more of the mysticism and legend that are popular symbols of South America. Its protagonist, a German family scion born in 1911 and known simply as Lucien, grows up under the tutelage of his grandmother, Misia Schmutter, a despot who rules her Venezuelan estate as if she were a spider who spins a web not so much for killing (although she does this too) but for the fascination of power. She molds Lucien to her will, and after dying becomes a supernatural presence clinging to his back like the predatory tiger the boy once killed. But while her creed seems vaguely fascist, it is transmuted by Lucien's somewhat gentler spirit into a kind of existential obsession with pure action.

The ladies had a good two-hour cry and they were delighted. And unless our prognostication goes unaccountably haywire the scene will be repeated over and over for many weeks to come. It is an old and established fact that a lady can lead a man into a movie house just as easily as she can drive him to drink and Paramount, for one, obviously has not lost sight of this truism. Olivia de Havilland, who is making her second screen appearance after a prolonged absence, may now take her exalted place alongside Helen Hayes, Ruth Chatterton and Bette Davis as a tragic heroine who loved unwisely and suffered terrible consequences with heroic fortitude.\\"To Each His Own\\" spins dangerously on the brink of bathos but it seldom spills over into that treacherous chasm for more than a fleeting scene or two, thanks to a screen play which artfully dodges complete morbidity. Mitchell Leisen has directed the cast skilfully and his fastidious eye for detail is evident in the carefully appointed sets which reflect the various moods and circumstances of the characters. Since the story starts in a small country town in 1918 and continues through a New Year's Eve in London, 1944, Miss de Havilland is permitted to run the customary emotional gamut, from a young girl bubbling with life to a forlorn middle-aged mother who worships her son from afar. Miss de Havilland ages gracefully and her performance is extraordinarily fine most of the time. However, she is painfully embarrassing when registering her anguished, unrequited mother love.Although Charles Brackett and Jacques Thery are not telling anything new in \\"To Each His Own,\\" which follows the broad pattern of countless tales about the grief of unwed mothers, they have worked in a few refreshing twists. Or, at least, the scheme Jody Norris cooks up to conceal her shame and regain possession of her baby without the town folks being any the wiser is poignant and it is dramatized with considerable dexterity. Nor have the authors overlooked the fact that a little sunshine and humor is bound to creep into even the most tragic of lives. So it is that you will find laughter occasionally dispelling the saccharine sentiment.The early scenes in the little town of Piersen Falls are delightfully quaint. John Lund, fresh from the stage, appears in a dual role, first as the World War I flying ace, who captivates Jody on a war bond tour, and later as her grown son, whom she meets while on leave in London. Mr. Lund handles both characters nicely, though he is somewhat overshadowed by Bill Goodwin and Phillip Terry. But Roland Culver in the role of a titled British Mr. Fixit who ultimately shows Miss Norris and her son the way to happiness is superb. Mr. Culver is new to Hollywood, though he has appeared in several English films.Featured in the Music Hall's stage revue, \\"Metropolis,\\" are Joe Jackson Jr., the clown","excerpt":"Lucile Cummings, contralto; Edward Reichert, tenor; the Glee Club and the Rockettes.

TV Review","excerpt":"Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz Offer Fun"},{"year":"1950","title":"A familiar, simple-minded little comedy from Columbia with Lucille Ball and Eddie Albert called \\"The Fuller Brush Girl\\" is the Palace's newcomer.Short on art it is, but the picture shouldn't stymie that aggressive army too noticeably, for it is just as long on slapstick, the door-die brand. And all the nervous giggling in yesterday's audience sounded like a saleslady's dream come true.Miss Ball's cosmetics peddler is a lady, too, make no mistake. All she wants is a modest suburban bungalow and marriage to her dim-witted boy-friend, Mr. Albert, and she has one heck of a time getting them. For in the course of briskly invading the American home, she nearly gets roasted alive by some demon children, is trailed by a jealous wife and some society matrons she has breezily rendered bald, and, finally, the cops themselves. Seems she's also wanted for not one, but two murders.The spirited Miss Ball scrambles bravely through this' foolishness, with Mr. Albert loping along whiningly and Gale Robbins, Jeff Donnell, Jerome Cowan and Lee Patrick grappling gamely with Frank Tashlin's tattered script and Lloyd Bacon's equally ragged direction:Only in one scene does the picture sparkle—when Miss Ball pursues the murderers to a burlesque theatre and rigs herself up as a performer. Basically a fine come-dienne, she does a truly hilarious take-off on one of these uninhibited artists, complete with swivel glide, gum churning and Theda Bara make-up.Otherwise, in \\"The Fuller Brush Girl\\" Columbia has slipped Miss Ball and her audiences a mickey.

How strangely on modern ears falls the notion that lust -- sexual desire that wells up in us as involuntarily as saliva -- in itself is wicked! With what nervous hilarity did we greet Jimmy Carter's famous confession: \\"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times.\\" Mr. Carter was running for President at the time; his opponent, the incumbent Gerald Ford, was a more typical post-Freudian man.
