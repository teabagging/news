It was, in effect, Not Mozart and Haydn Week at the Not Mostly Mozart Festival.   In that spirit, there were subtle connections to be made. Both works were composed -- indeed, both composers had died -- well before Haydn and Mozart were born. Both are steeped in the elegance of the French Baroque style (alloyed, in Purcell's case, with English traditions), which both Mozart and Haydn would have regarded as hopelessly archaic. And given the 18th century's preoccupation with new music, there is reason to suppose that both Mozart and Haydn went through their lives without hearing either work.

De Mille's latest effusion, his valedictory to the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, now on view at the Rivoli, is just as bizarre but far more entertaining than was \\"Triumph\\" or \\"Feet of Clay,\\" his preceding two photoplays. From the main title to the last fade-out it is typical of Mr. De Mille. The story saw the light of day in cold type from Wallace Irwin's pen as \\"Tomorrow's Bread,\\" but as a De Millean effort it emerges in shadow form as \\"The Golden Bed.\\" As adapted by Jean Macpherson and directed by Mr. De Mille, it is weird, rambling, ostentatious, jarring and sometimes absurdly symbolic. It carries little conviction and rather made us think of a Whistler painting, jazzed up and set in a diamond and platinum frame.There is tragedy with a light touch, if one can imagine such a thing—it is rather detached and unconvincing. You have the story of the candy worker's rise to fame and his subsequent failure and utter disgrace brought about by an attractive and greedy blonde. Subsequently the good little girl, who, like Peter Pan, never grows any older, comes into her own and weds the fickle candy king and ex-convict. It is an extravaganza, in settings, the way in which the story has been handled and in the stressed amorous scenes. Wonderful garden parties were the vogue apparently with royalty in the candy realm, and Admah Holtz in his last fling at joy or reckless abandon, is seen as a sort of Samson, pulling down the candy structure without harming a hair of his head. His Delilah, who had never shorn his hair but had taken his hard cash, refuses to give up a bracelet because it had been sealed on her wrist by a kiss from another man.One of the striking features of this picture is where Flora Lea Peake (Lillian Rich), attractive and bewigged, brings about the murder of her lover and the suicide of her husband in the Swiss Alps. This is accomplished in a strange way, for the husband is not content with killing the rival who has stolen his wife's attentions, but goes down to death in a glacier chasm with the man of noble birth who was loath to leave this world. In some of the scenes the snow appears to be quite effective, but in others it is rather sugary or salty.Such an incident ends Flora's first marital experience, and she returns to her native land a very attractive young widow, beaming on most men, but particularly on Admah Holtz, who through the courage and resourcefulness of Margaret Peake, had accomplished wonders in the candy world and made a fortune for himself. The fair face and figure of Flora, however, also works wonders and Admah—in spite of his name—is hynotized by the beauteous creature. He gives parties for her that are far beyond even his income, and to satisfy her Delilah-like desires he borrows a little money from the treasury of the company, and then comes the crash.The golden bed is a symbol which is not particularly effective. It is there, however, with its swan decoration, and Flora, sapped of her youth and faded in looks, actually kisses the bird's beak. But one could expect mad things from Flora, as she is much attached to a small monkey, which she lugs around with her. In the end she stops in front of the old homestead and notices a monkey on an organ grinder's box. Affection for the little animal blazes from her optics, which created a gurgling grin among the audience. Not long afterward she passes away in the ex-convict's arms on the golden bed. Admah then wanders around the corner and is forgiven by Margaret.This picture is so bizarre and obviously expensive that one can be entertained by the passing scenes without caring much what happens to the characters. Rod La Rocque gives a capable performance as Admah, and Vera Reynolds is vivacious and sympathetic as Margaret. Miss Rich's effort is excellent, and with her blonde wig, her clear eyes and well-chiseled features, she looks extraordinarily beautiful.

STORM OVER BROADWAY","excerpt":"Samuel Goldwyn's 'Hurricane' Sweeps Its Howling Course Out of the West"},{"year":"1951","title":"It is a pretty lugubrious story that Samuel Goldwyn has his people trying to tell in his latest film, \\"I Want You,\\" which came to the Criterion on Saturday.It is a story of average Americans resisting the necessity of facing up to another war and then finally standing still for it because that is the patriotic thing to do. And because it is plainly lugubrious and open to question by some skeptics here and there, Mr. Goldwyn and his people are trying to sell it on terms of sentiment and romance.First they scan a father's anguish when his son is called for the Korean War after the lad's boss, played by Dana Andrews, refuses to label him \\"indispensable.\\" Then they have Farley Granger fuming when he is snatched up by his draft board because he thinks he's being railroaded by the unfriendly father of his girl. And then they have Mr. Andrews, a big contractor and family man, volunteering to return to service because he wants to be able to face his children when they ask him, \\"What were you doing, Daddy, when the world was shaking?\\" (Those are his words, not ours.)In each of these cases Mr. Goldwyn and his script writer, Irwin Shaw, have worked out a little drama to show the despair or fortitude of the people involved. The father of the lad who goes to Korea—and gets killed—they have turned into an inconsolable lush. Mr. Granger finally is reconciled to service because his girl agrees to marry him anyhow. And the dissenting wife of Mr. Andrews, played by Dorothy McGuire, consents to let him go when she realizes that it is to defend his kiddies and his home.With all due regard for Mr. Goldwyn and the facile pen of Mr. Shaw, it must be said that the quality of their persuasion does not match the intensity of their concern. The home lives created for all these people are pretty mawkish and artificial affairs, looking more like the ones in the advertisements than in actual American homes. And the romance of Mr. Granger with a college girl, played by Peggy Dow, is so stilted and overstuffed with whimsey that it seems a caricature. Mark Robson, who directed the effort, might have been dressing a window for a department store.All in all the running crisis of the \\"cold war\\" has been absorbed in the cotton padding of sentiment. A straight recruiting poster would be more convincing and pack more dramatic appeal.
