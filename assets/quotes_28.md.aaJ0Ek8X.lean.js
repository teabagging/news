These new, unique bronzes continue in the vein of the open-form polychrome sculptures Miss Graves began showing in 1980, particularly a much-admired one called ''Trace,'' a very large tree whose trunk was made from ribbons of bronze with foliage of steel mesh. The current pieces differ, however, in that the artist casts directly in bronze parts of real plants and other objects - leaves, bean pods, blossoms, seed husks, Chinese fans, vegetables, tiny fish, palm fronds -as separate elements, then joins them in ways of her own choosing. The jungly grotesqueries that result are more than merely exotic new plant forms; they also refer to the classic work of other cultures. In a big floorpiece, ''Agni,'' for example, a huge arc composed of purplish leaf parts is supported by four long yellow bean pods and a central structure of floral and vegetable elements, which in turn sits on a ribbony tangle of black vines. The arced form and bean pod ''arms'' suggest nothing so much as the dancing Shiva of Indian sculpture.
