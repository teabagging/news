Readers were fascinated not only by a story of love and suicide, but also by the story of the story. For Werther, the thwarted lover, was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe himself. Lotte and Albert were his flesh-and-blood summer friends. Only the suicide was borrowed, although from neighboring if unrelated events.   Some communities banned the book as preaching self-destruction. Promotional forces disturbingly similar to today's cooked up a largely mythical wave of suicides said to have been committed by impressionable young readers across Europe. So strong were the images in this brief novel that Goethe could live deeply into old age without ever escaping his own personal identification with it. In Thomas Mann's \\"Lotte in Weimar,\\" we find the real-life Lotte in middle age, never quite sure where she ends and her fictional counterpart begins.

Unlike styles of dance music in which the art is in arranging samples over a steady beat, jungle and drum-and-bass (which evolved from the break-beat records that disk jockeys use as rhythmic additives to their mixes) make an art of cutting up, rearranging and accelerating drumbeats, usually over a deep, floor-shaking bass line.         Though jungle music has been on the pop charts in England for two years, it only recently made the charts here, as heard subtly in the background of Everything but the Girl's single \\"Wrong.\\" For those who want to pursue the music, many releases in the last month show the widening range of these styles.

The premiere of the new \\"Parsifal\\" on Thursday evening certainly did not signal a change in the Met's Wagnerian course. As a sensitive representation of the music, it was beyond cavil. James Levine's conducting, a model of concentrated rapture over the five-hour span, rightly placed emphasis on the orchestral score.

The deed she commits is hideous, the swiftness of the act frightening, but she does not have the aspect of a villain. In her insane urge to rescue her stepdaughter's reputation, to save Jenufa by murdering Jenufa's child, she somehow saves herself from unambiguous damnation. The forgiveness she receives is the linchpin of a matchless dramatic structure, one in which the most lurid deed is committed by a woman but the anterior crimes are committed by men.   Anja Silja, singing at the Metropolitan Opera for the first time in more than a decade, had mixed success as Kostelnicka in a cast change on Tuesday night. From her entrance in the middle of Act I, she seemed a bit off the mark. The character first enters almost unnoticed, marching across the stage and then off again with a single cold remark. Then, a few minutes later, she stops a scene of drunken merriment dead in its tracks with a fierce monologue of scorn. Ms. Silja caught the coldness very well, but her second entrance did not cast the proper shadow of overpowering authority. The role is something of a vocal nightmare, and Ms. Silja's lyric-dramatic soprano did not have enough fullness of tone in the upper register. The acting was finely shaded and intelligent, but a certain demonic spark was missing. These are intangible qualities, but \\"Jenufa\\" depends upon them to make its fullest impact.

But to make up for that, they spluttered and howled through reels of comedy provided by Eddie Quillan, Robert Armstrong, James Gleason and a certain anonymous dialogue writer. Mention should also be made at once of the exceptionally strong supporting bill, particularly an Eddie Buzzell comedy and a Knute Rockne illustrated football lecture.The narrative is divided neatly in two, the first half concerning itself with the farcical adventures of a crap-shooting messenger boy with $15,000 on his person, and the second half with a comparatively serious picture of the young man as a big-time gambler. The break in treatment is sharply marked because of the clever satire on gangsterism in the early sequences. But \\"Big Money\\" is too entertaining for such a structural weakness to make any great difference.Eddie, with the $15,000 he is supposed to deliver, runs into a crap game of underworld princes where \\"twenty grand\\" is not very much of a bet. A certain gambler named Ace (Robert Armstrong) takes the boy under his wing because of his phenomenal luck and he soon takes his place as a big-timer, assuming the appellation of \\"Lucky.\\" After that there is a murder for which he is held, but he is cleared in time to run away with the boss's daughter. James Gleason as a hanger-on around the underworld leaders was very funny in his few appearances. But everybody in \\"Big Money\\" from the director down merits equal credit for an unpretentious and thoroughly amusing film. \\"BIG MONEY\\" IS AMUSING.","excerpt":"New Talkie at Globe Also Has Strong Supporting Bill."},{"year":"1929","title":"Blues-singing, adolescent romance and Sue Carol compose the sound picture on the screen of the Hippodrome, where the musical comedy version of \\"Cradle Snatchers\\" is being shown under the nom de cinema of \\"Why Leave Home?\\"The basic idea is the same as that of the play and of the silent motion picture that was made some time ago. The interpretation, including the sumptuous night club setting, with its orchestra platform that spirals into the air and its banks of tables that pile concentrically upward in what resembles the interior of \\"le cirque,\\" is new and diverting.The story is about three husbands who have dates with three chorus girls but use duck hunting as an excuse to get away from home. Their wives, believing themselves neglected, engage three college boys to take them out. Much to everyone's surprise, except possibly the audience's, they all go to the same road house. All ensuing complications are happily resolved.Sue Carol and David Rollins, as a chorus girl and collegiate youth, easily run away with all honors. Miss Carol, a naïve youngster in appearance, manages to superimpose her own personality, a very charming one, upon the rôle. Mr. Rollins, as the backward youth who is earning $200 by being an escort for one of the wives, is what several women in the audience called \\"cute,\\" usually a deadly description, but in this instance an apt compliment.Miss Carol sings the theme songs of the film very winningly. Her girl friends execute gyrations labeled \\"Doing the Boom Boom,\\" and there are a lot of college boys that a casting director must have dug up out of a correspondence school, who are just dandy fellows. Most screen collegians seem prototypes of the Rover Boys (afloat), and those in \\"Why Leave Home?\\" are no exceptions.Walter Catlett, who was comedian of many stage musical pieces, is the comic husband. He is also credited with the dialogue, which is usually banal but not bad enough to spoil an amusing photoplay.Other Photoplays.What is described, as the motion picture of the future will be presented at the Gaiety Theatre tomorrow evening when the Grandeur version of the \\"Fox Movietone Follies\\" is projected from an extra-width film on an enlarged screen.

Not only does she cater to his every whim and submit to his eccentric acts, but when he runs off with another woman she comes back to him when he is very ill and nurses him back to health.Why a violinist should be a social outcast is a mystery, particularly in this instance, since he is portrayed by the intelligent and capable Basil Rathbone, who does not appear to be a blot on any escutcheon.Billie Dove is the courageous wife who bides her time. Although featured in this film and lending a decorative presence, her speeches pale beside a performance of one so expert as Mr. Rathbone. Kay Francis, too, as the scheming countess, puts Miss Dove somewhat in the shade.The story is an adaptation of \\"Fame,\\" a stage play, and offers no end of awkward witticisms and alleged epigrammatic dialogue that aristocracy is here reported to indulge in even when ordering tea. In the scene where the girl brings her husband home there is an outrageous display of bad manners. The rest of the photoplay runs along smoothly enough, with Mr. Rathbone corralling the majority of the performing honors.
