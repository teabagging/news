As Carel Blotkamp notes in MONDRIAN: The Art of Destruction (Abrams, $49.50), the artist believed that \\"the destruction of old forms was a condition for the creation of new, higher forms.\\" Mr. Blotkamp, who teaches modern art history at the Free University of Amsterdam, diligently traces Mondrian's growth from a traditional painter of landscapes to a significant innovator. Influenced by Cubism, Mondrian moved from his native Netherlands to Paris, where in 1917 he founded De Stijl, a group that advocated a future-oriented art Mondrian called Neo-Plasticism. Through a cogent explication of Mondrian's paintings and close readings of his dense and somewhat cryptic writings about art, Mr. Blotkamp shows how Mondrian continually refined his method, arriving at the colorful constructions of lines for which he is known today. Among the many pleasures of the book are its photographs of Mondrian's various studios (which look much like his paintings) and Mr. Blotkamp's commentary on them. Although the text is sometimes discursive, it is clear that Mr. Blotkamp knows and reveres his subject, and his enthusiasm is infectious.\\nROBIN LIPPINCOTT IN SHORT: NONFICTION","excerpt":"Reading Between the Lines"},{"year":"1966","title":"optimistic outlook reptd by Morgan Guaranty Trust and Eastman Dillon, Union Securities & Co Market Place:","excerpt":"Reading Between Those Indicators"},{"year":"1995","title":"My '96 campaign has begun.

I would go even further. There is not just a danger of a return to dictatorship. It is clear that the Soviet Union is moving away from democratic solutions as the basis of political authority.

But there is a real difference between seizing power and using it. It is not clear how successful Gorbachev will be in getting people to bend to his will. It's hard to imagine an implosion of the Soviet Union. But there is a real possibility that a state of neither peace nor war could persist for a long time.     You could have a stable situation in the Russian Republic and a few other regions, and at the same time a highly unstable situation in some of the peripheral republics. It might look like peace, but it would take large numbers of troops to sustain peace in the peripheral regions.

I think Shevardnadze resigned in protest against what is, in fact, already happening.

Jaruzelski thought of himself as a patriot restoring order and avoiding bloodshed. But objectively speaking, what he did was to repress the grass-roots reformist element represented in the Solidarity movement and to set democratization back a decade.   One would have expected that Gorbachev, as a pragmatic politician who unleashed glasnost and the reform impulse, would have found opportunities to work more boldly with reform-minded officials who received popular electoral mandates in the past year -- or at least to adopt the economic measures his own economists have been recommending.

Perhaps a bit too hard, in the view of some specialists who were surprised by Mr. Reagan's announcement that ''on balance, the Soviet Union does have a definite margin of superiority'' which has already exposed United States security to a ''window of vulnerability.'' Moscow's edge, he told an evening news conference, can ''absorb our retaliatory blow and hit us again.'' And he continued, ''A freeze would not only be disadvantageous - in fact, even dangerous.'' It would also let the Russians off the hook in forthcoming negotiations on intercontinental weapons (expected to begin this summer) because ''there would be no incentive for them'' to dramatically reduce nuclear stockpiles - Mr. Reagan's objective.

Yet they are hounded by zealous Sunni militants who reject any involvement in the political process and brand those politicians as traitors.   A1    The taking of an abandoned youth center by marines illustrated a new approach to taming the Anbar Province area, where the military has been conducting raids for months: first sweep a town, then immediately garrison it and begin reconstruction. Just as important, Iraqi forces are an integral component of the strategy.   A1    Ayad Allawi, at left, the former prime minister of Iraq, was attacked by a mob during a campaign visit to the Shiite holy city of Najaf.

A1    Hurricane Inspires Street Art  The hurricane that rocked New Orleans has inspired visual art everywhere: on canvas, T-shirts, refrigerators and tattooed arms and legs. By turns whimsical, angry, despairing and hopeful, the art explores such themes as loss, impermanence and rebirth as it seeks to find a kind of coherence from emotional and physical wreckage.

And the controversy was renewed last week when it was learned that Mr. Levine had quit his job with the city agency to go to work for the paper company. An investigation into possible conflict of interest was begun at the direction of Mayor Lindsay, who was said to have been stunned by the disclosure. In a statement, the Mayor said: &#8216;I believe that it was foolish and insensitive of him not to have submitted the matter to the Board of Ethics.&#8221; Mr. Levine's former colleagues, too, were surprised. &#8220;We thought he had more brains,&#8221; said one.

(And where else but in the shower?) To play the audience like an organ demands a killer sense of timing -- or, to switch metaphors, suspense is the art of killing time itself. With its razor-sharp montage and suffocating tensions, ''Psycho'' inflicts a sustained and subtle assault on the normal rhythms of life. As such, it screams to be slowed down, picked apart and scrutinized frame by frame.    Two of the most fascinating responses to the movie proceed in just this manner. In his posthumously published study ''A LONG HARD LOOK AT PSYCHO,'' the critic RAYMOND DURGNAT crawls through every square inch of the movie, ingeniously analyzing its ''tissue of implication and suggestion.'' The artist DOUGLAS GORDON has taken a simpler but more drastic approach, enabling everyone to look as hard as Durgnat. ''24 HOUR PSYCHO'' is just that: Hitchcock's 109-minute masterpiece projected at two frames per second rather than the standard 24, with a consequent run time of one full day.    Like Andy Warhol's eight-hour portrait of the Empire State Building, or the artist Paul Pfeiffer's extraordinary three-month study of a wasp nest, Mr. Gordon's 1993 video sounds like a flippant stunt until you set eyes on its gripping creep of light and shadow. Equal parts homage, invention and metacritical commentary, ''24 Hour Psycho'' is as hypnotic, in its slow-drip way, as the source material.    The video is habitually situated in the center of a room and projected on a translucent screen, encouraging reflection on both sides of the image, and of ''Psycho'' itself as a piece of sculpture. Thus does it greet visitors to ''DOUGLAS GORDON: TIMELINE,'' an elegantly installed retrospective of the artist's videos opening today at the Museum of Modern Art.    What Mr. Gordon has done to ''The Exorcist,'' Otto Preminger's ''Whirlpool'' and the spectacle of an enormous female elephant padding around the Gagosian Gallery (in his 2003 knockout ''Play Dead","excerpt":"Real Time'') can be investigated on the second and sixth floors of the Museum of Modern Art through Sept. 4. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400.

But isn't it telling the same story? Once again a bright but alienated recent college graduate mopes about, unable or unwilling to find a job or a reason to exist. A pretty, somewhat more directed young woman must choose between the alienated hero and a square go-getter.

So, every once in a while, someone is bound to revive the old argument about the value of ''live'' recordings, meaning performances taped at actual concerts or recitals in the presence of living, breathing (and, too often, coughing) audiences. The latest prophet of live recording is Alfred Brendel, whose complete set of the Beethoven piano concertos was taped at a series of Chicago Symphony concerts with James Levine as the conductor. These performances have been very favorably reviewed. Our man Bernard Holland contended in these pages recently that they are an improvement in many ways over Mr. Brendel's previous release of the Beethoven cycle, done in a studio with Bernard Haitink conducting. \\n\\nLike anyone who gives the subject a moment's thought, I am firmly of two minds about such records. On one hand I recognize the documentary importance of some live recordings and the heightened sense of occasion that they can provide compared to meticulously controlled studio products. But I find myself paying undue attention to small technical errors, especially during replays, and trying to repress irritation at applause and other audience noise.
