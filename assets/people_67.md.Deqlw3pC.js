Cohan, is a moderately exciting murder mystery in which Scotland Yard, a London music hall, a notorious gaming establishment and three cockney gangsters, known as Scottie, Toothpick Jeff, and Dancer Johnny, figure prominently. The evil-looking cockneys throw knives at the two detectives every time their backs are turned, but the genial emissaries of the Yard refrain from making arrests until the film has run some twenty minutes longer than is quite necessary.The story has several novel twists which are not fully realized because of unimaginative direction and poor photography. In one incident the detective, knowing that the gang plans to rob a titled woman as she is seated in her box at the theatre, gags one of the comedians and takes his place on the stage. By a system of wires he is wafted hither and yon. At the proper moments he leaps into the air and lands lightly in the Duchess's loge in time to frustrate the hold-up.At another point a drunken reveller is poisoned so craftily that he appears to have passed out from too much drink.The dark plot turns on the search for the gang leader, a mysterious individual, who dispatches his victims with an accurately flipped stiletto. Unfortunately, the identity of this fellow is kept so dark that his apprehension at the close of the film is not so much a revelation as a deepening of the mystery. The interest along the way is maintained by the rivalry of the two detectives, one of whom, Jameson Thomas, appears to be in league with the gangsters. Jack Raine plays the other detective. The cast is fairly competent.

Cohan. There is the murder and the wrongly condemned person and the amateur detective's search for the criminal, but between the finding of the body and the happy fade-out is much interesting material.Herbert Marshall as Sir John, the amateur detective, and Diana Baring, as Norah, the young actress who is guiltless of the crime for which she is condemned, head an English cast which is competent even down to the minor parts. Both the leading players act with intelligence and restraint.The story revolves about a traveling stock company. A young woman of the troupe is found dead from a blow on the skull in the lodgings of another actress, Norah, who is discovered sitting beside the body. Norah disclaims knowledge of the crime, and at her trial insists she recalls nothing of the evening's happenings. Sir John is on the jury, and, convinced she is telling the truth, holds steadfastly out for a \\"not guilty\\" verdict. But he is overwhelmed by his fellow-jurymen and the girl is sentenced to death. Sir John then investigates the crime on his own initiative, and brings the real murderer to justice.In a dramatic and well-handled scene near the close, Sir John traps the guilty man by offering him a part in his new play, a mythical work based on the sensational murder. The actor is then forced to reenact his crime and give himself away.

Only two new bond issues were marketed publicly for a total of $9,290,000, compared with seven issues totaling $35,663,000 last week and thirteen issues aggregating $314,161,000 for the corresponding week last year.

Sustained applause dispelled any doubts as to the success of the undertaking. This March of Time production, combining dramatic sequence with graphic narrative, provided within the space of fifteen minutes an insight into the operations of the Stock Exchange which even an extended tour of the institution might fail to achieve. In tracing the link between industrial production and trading in the securities representing that production, the film kept shifting to impressive scenes of the great steel mills and railroad yards. The manifold functions which make the Big Board operate as the nation's leading free market were treated in sequences remarkable for clarity and objectivity. Just how many persons will see the film is a matter still to be determined by Exchange officials but, on the basis of the initial response, they are sure it would be top entertainment for the millions interested in how money works in a great industrial economy.Buck PassingThe comments of Marriner S. Eccles, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that the ending of controls on prices, wages and production has largely shifted the responsibility for economic stability from Government to labor and management, was viewed in financial circles yesterday as a matter of rhetorical \\"buck passing.\\" Although fully aware of their obligations arising from the new developments, informed spokesmen downtown observed that it was unreasonable to imagine that Mr. Eccles' remarks indicated that the Government would cease to be a substantial factor in shaping financial and industrial events. Incidentally, trading in Government bonds during the day was largely unaffected, despite Mr. Eccles' further comments that there is no need now for the Government to issue additional long-term marketable securities since other investments are available.Freight RatesWith the filing yesterday of a 60,000-word brief with the Interstate Commerce Commission, the railroads have had their final say on their request for a 25-per cent increase in freight rates. To compensate them for a rise in wages, the railroads last April asked for the rate increase. Effective July 1, the ICC reinstated an increase of around 6 per cent granted in 1942 but suspended in May, 1943. In addition, it granted the Eastern railroads an additional 5 per cent freight rise. At the time of these adjustments, the commission announced that further consideration would be given to the request of the railroads, and hearings were held throughout the country. In view of the need for additional revenues, a decision on the 25-per cent increase is expected to be made soon. However, as a period of thirty days usually is allowed from the time of the decision to the effective date of any important rate adjustment, any increase that may be granted could not be made effective until Dec. 1 at the earliest. If the decision is delayed, it may be Jan. 1 before the railroads can expect any relief. By that time, the wage rise, which was retroactive to Jan. 1, 1946, will have been in effect one year.

They contain none of the additives found in conventional brands, like synthetic flavor enhancers, preservatives and other agents referred to as \\"burn accelerators.\\" Spirits do contain about 25 percent more tobacco than most other brands of the same size (85 millimeters, the standard length). Like all tobacco products, Spirits also contain tar and nicotine, substances considered highly addictive and harmful to health.\\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY: About a dozen Spirit smokers interviewed said they thought the cigarettes were healthier and less addictive because of the absence of additives. The higher tobacco content makes Spirits more satisfying, the smokers said, so they crave fewer cigarettes and inhale less deeply.\\nTHE PRICE OF PURITY: The average retail price is $3 a pack, which the company says reflects the quality of tobacco used. Most conventional brands cost $2.30. By the way, Marlboro, the best-selling brand, rang up sales of $12 billion in the domestic market last year.\\nTHE PACKAGING OF PURITY: Like all brands, these carry the Surgeon General's warnings. The Natural American Spirit logo depicts an American Indian smoking a peace pipe. The color of the background (turquoise for filtered, sand for nonfiltered), the thunderbird icon and the distinctive style of type on the packaging suggest a synthesis of Southwestern and Art Deco motifs. A political message? Not according to company literature. \\"Our package design was chosen because tobacco is a plant native to America and was introduced to 'Western civilization' by American Indians,\\" it says. \\"We feel tobacco is a powerful herb worthy of the respect it has been shown in American Indian tradition.\\"\\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF PURITY: Natural food stores account for 15 percent of Spirits' sales. \\"We're in select outlets like upscale wine stores, gourmet food shops, herb stores and new-age boutiques,\\" said Robin Sommers, the president of the company. Advertising has appeared in magazines like the Utne Reader, Vegetarian Times, Mother Earth News and Shaman's Drum.\\nTHE REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY: Dr. Leo Goldberger, a professor of psychology at New York University, had this to say about the popularity of Spirits: \\"There is a very basic psychological mechanism at work here -- denial. We are living in an age of denial: 'The environment is O.K.,' 'AIDS doesn't affect me,' 'Bosnia isn't so bad.'

There are four major gloss categories: flat, satin, semigloss and gloss. Either latex or oil-based (alkyd) paints can be used. Never paint unless the temperature is between 50 and 90 degrees and the surface is dry and clean. First scrape peeling areas, fill cracks and holes and replace damaged or rotten wood. Choose a paint that can be applied over the existing paint. (Latex paints do not do well over oil paints.) Use a primer if the wood is porous.  Latex vs. Oil-Based Paint   Latex paints are water soluble, and they spread easily and clean up with soap and water. But if the existing surface is chalky or has sloughed away with wear, an oil-based paint is a better choice, even though cleanup requires turpentine and takes longer.  Flat Latex Paint  $16 to $43 a gallon, depending on brand and color. For wood, aluminum, hardwood siding, plywood, stucco and all masonry.  Oil-Based Flat Paint  $20 to $28. Same uses as latex paint.  Satin Latex Paint  $18 to $25. Low-luster. Can be used on wood and metal.  Gloss and Semigloss Paint  $16 to $26. For moldings, windows, doors and all trim.

Officials at the United States Mint declined to disclose specifics about the design pending formal review and approval, but Mint Director Donna K. Pope confirmed early this month that the horseback motif was one of the alternatives being weighed - and barring a last-minute change, it appeared that this would be the version used.\\n\\nThe coin's reverse is expected to depict Mount Vernon, the famous Washington homestead in Virginia. Mrs. Pope acknowledged that such a design was under consideration, although she cautioned that several different proposals had been readied. The new half dollar, the first commemorative coin to be issued by the Mint in nearly three decades, was authorized by Congress to mark the 250th anniversary of President Washington's birth. The legislation specified that both sides must carry devices ''emblematic'' of the anniversary.\\n\\nDesigns for the coin were prepared by Elizabeth Jones, the Mint's new chief sculptor-engraver. In fact, Miss Jones completed preliminary sketches weeks ago. However, as with all proposed U.S.  coinage designs, these were subject to review by the Commission of Fine Arts, and that panel is said to have recommended a number of modifications - thus setting in motion a process which delayed the release of information on the coin.
