You confuse occupation and annexation. Certainly, countries occupy territory conquered by force of arms in wars that may be just. Israel, as you say, was fighting to repel Arab attackers when it occupied territory in the 1967 war. In the same manner, the United States occupations of Germany (1945-49) and Japan (1945-52) were justifiable on the ground that the wars fought against those countries had been just.   Saddam Hussein not only occupied Kuwait on Aug. 2, but in the days thereafter also annexed it to Iraq. The distinction is extremely important. Had he been content to set up a regime friendly to him in Kuwait and then withdraw his forces, ending his occupation, the problem would have been easier to solve.   Israel annexed East Jerusalem in the 1967 war, and Israeli leaders made statements at the time to the effect that Jerusalem had been reunited and they would never give up control of East Jerusalem. Even in other territories occupied by Israel in that war, it is not clear how long the occupation will last. Indefinitely?   Saddam Hussein states that Iraq's annexation of Kuwait is irrevocable. Annexations and the changes in borders they imply can only be dealt with through war or diplomacy. If we do not want war, we must resort to diplomacy. ARTHUR J.

These and another revival, of Rossini's ''Viaggio a Reims'' on Sept. 22, will carry the company through to its next new production, of Dukas's ''Ariane et Barbe-Bleu'' on Oct. 6. Continues today. New York State Theater.    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER The cellist David Finckel and the pianist Wu Han, a husband-and-wife team announced last year as music directors of the society, finally make their presence felt in performance, with the pianist Emanuel Ax, the percussionist Don Liuzzi and others. Thursday. Alice Tully Hall.    LOUISIANA PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA The only thing that seems clear is that the orchestra will not open its season on this, its scheduled date. Here's hoping that it can get up and running before the season is out. Thursday. Orpheum Theater, New Orleans, (504)523-6530. www.lpomusic.org    BACH CHORAL WORKSHOP Once again, Carnegie Hall jumps the gun on its official opening in the main auditorium with a professional training workshop, this one led by the Dutch Bach specialist Ton Koopman. A week's activities involving 24 singers and a chamber orchestra culminate in a concert of cantatas. Sept. 19. Zankel Hall.    METROPOLITAN OPERA The big drama at the Met this season promises to take place behind the scenes. The plot has Joseph Volpe, the imperious and irascible general manager, grooming his successor, the ambitious and often testy Peter Gelb, recently of Sony Classical records -- and this at a time when finances and audiences are slumping. If the two get through it alive, Mr. Gelb will undoubtedly be as thrilled as Mr. Volpe when the season ends with a Volpe farewell gala, on May 20. Here, meanwhile, is the season-opening gala, with Isabel Bayrakdarian, Susan Graham and Bryn Terfel in Act I of Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro,'' Angela Gheorghiu and Mr. Terfel in Act II of Puccini's ''Tosca'' and Denyce Graves and Plácido Domingo in Act III of Saint-Saëns's ''Samson et Dalila.'' James Levine, not yet in complete thrall to the Boston Symphony, conducts. Sept. 19. Metropolitan Opera House.    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Whatever surprises or challenges the orchestra's season may hold (like a timid ''focus'' on Elliott Carter, consisting of four works) are not apparent in the first week, which presents two programs conducted by Lorin Maazel, both built on the same model. On opening night, Evgeny Kissin plays Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto, and Mr. Maazel conducts Strauss's ''Don Juan'' and a ''Rosenkavalier'' Suite. In the subscription concerts that follow, Lang Lang plays Chopin's First Piano Concerto, and Mr. Maazel conducts Mahler's First Symphony. Sept. 21-24, 27. Avery Fisher Hall.    ST. LOUIS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA It has been a long courtship -- long enough that the orchestra got into a scrape with management last year, in a bitter lockout (or strike or whatever), and that its new music director, David Robertson, has been bruited for positions in Chicago and elsewhere even before officially taking over this orchestra. It finally happens, in a bracing program including Claude Vivier's ''Lonely Child'' and John Adams's ''Harmonielehre.'' Sept. 23-25. Powell Symphony Hall, (314)534-1700. www.slso.org    GYORGY LIGETI A composer portrait. Sept. 28, 30","excerpt":"Oct. 1, 29; Nov. 12 . Miller Theater. A related article is on Page 87.    LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA From his new perch at Carnegie Hall, the orchestra's former manager Clive Gillinson watches as his onetime charges make their annual visit to Lincoln Center. The orchestra has in recent years provided, perhaps too readily, a forum for its venerable music director, Colin Davis, to indulge old specialties anew, but the results are often compelling. The golden oldies here are Verdi's Requiem, Sibelius's ''Pohjola's Daughter'' and ''Kullervo,'' and Vaughan Williams's Sixth Symphony and Walton's First. Look not so much for blazing revelations as for the comforts of accumulated wisdom and the mellowness of age and familiarity. Sept 28, 30; Oct. 2. Avery Fisher Hall.    NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Neeme Jarvi begins his tenure as the orchestra's music director with a surprise er, ''Surprise'': Haydn's Symphony No. 94. But any hint of real adventure -- and there are a few this season -- will have to await future programs, as Saint-Saëns's Piano Concerto No.2 (with the excellent Marc-André Hamelin as soloist) and Rachmaninoff's ''Symphonic Dances'' fill out the program. Sept. 29-30; Oct. 2. Halls in New Brunswick, Trenton and Newark, (800)255-3476. www.njsymphony.org    ST. PETERSBURG PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Yuri Temirkanov and the orchestra generally come to New York bearing big Russian masterworks, and the first concert, opening the Carnegie Hall season, runs true to form with Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto (played by Yefim Bronfman) and Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony. But the other two programs are surprisingly cosmopolitan, with works by Weber, Brahms, Dvorak and Sibelius. No matter, there is plenty of scope for Mr. Temirkanov to display his inimitable command of the long line. Sept. 29-Oct. 1. Carnegie Hall.    NEW YORK COLLEGIUM The ensemble opens its eighth season sonorously and antiphonally, with music of Giovanni Gabrieli from Venice at the turn of the 17th century. The program, conducted by Andrew Parrott, includes motets, canzonas, sonatas and a 17-voice Magnificat. Sept. 30. St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212)717-9246. www.nycollegium.org    ARVO PÄRT If you need a reason to rejoice on Sept. 11, it is Mr. Pärt's 70th birthday. The record labels have already begun to celebrate -- if you can call a recording named ''Lamentate'' (the Hilliard Ensemble, from ECM New Series) a celebration. Harmonia Mundi France has released a tribute album, with performances led by Paul Hillier. And now comes a DVD, ''24 Preludes for a Fugue,'' a documentary about Mr. Pärt and his music. It should be fascinating to see how far the filmmakers could burrow into his hermetic existence. September. Naxos/Idéale Audience.    October    'DOCTOR ATOMIC' A new opera, composed by John Adams and directed by Peter Sellars. Opens Oct. 1. San Francisco Opera, War Memorial Opera House, (415)864-3330. www.sfopera.com. A related article is on Page 89.    'ORION' In assembling this big work, commissioned for the Athens Olympics in 2004, Philip Glass seems to have been as much impresario as composer, bringing together longtime collaborators from around the world. This performance includes Mark Atkins on didgeridoo, Wu Man on pipa, Ashley MacIsaac on fiddle and others. ''We Are the World'' with a punch, perhaps, and a powerful one, according to some who have experienced it. Oct. 4, 6-8. Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, (718)636-4100. www.bam.org    'ORPHEUS AND EURIDICE' As part of the New Visions series at Lincoln Center, a new song cycle by the versatile Ricky Ian Gordon is presented in a staging by Doug Varone. The soprano Elizabeth Futral is joined by the clarinetist Todd Palmer. Oct. 5, 7-8. Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212)721-6500. www.lincolncenter.org    'ARIANE ET BARBE-BLEU' Leon Botstein is more widely valued as a champion of obscure repertory than as a conductor per se. And in fact, he presented this little-known opera by Paul Dukas in concert with the American Symphony Orchestra in 1999. So it is fitting that he makes his conducting debut at the New York City Opera with it. Carol Vaness was to have made a triumphant return to the company in the demanding title role but canceled because of an injury. Renate Behle replaces her. Opens Oct. 6. New York State Theater.    VIRGIL FOX LEGACY With a variety of organists on hand, performances and discussions honor the memory of the ultimate switched-on master of the instrument on the 25th anniversary of his death. Don't expect the obsequies to be subdued. Oct. 7-10. Various churches in Manhattan, (212)799-9300; (800)486-6628. www.LegacyConcerts.com    'TROUBLE IN TAHITI' Caramoor, the home of a popular summer music festival, is expanding its activities during the concert season. Here Michael Barrett conducts members of Caramoor's Bel Canto Soloist program in Bernstein's witty little opera. (Bernstein later wrote a less witty companion piece, ''A Quiet Place,'' whose absence is no great loss.) Oct. 8. Caramoor, Katonah, N.Y., (914)232-1492. www.caramoor.org    BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA You can almost see the fun that James Levine is having, planning entire orchestral seasons. At the Metropolitan Opera, it is, say, ''Don Giovanni'' or ''Fidelio,'' ''Don Carlo'' or ''Tristan und Isolde,'' ''Wozzeck'' or ''Moses und Aron.'' Those are wonderful choices, but they are limiting, night after night, year after year. This well-stuffed program is a prime example of a fertile imagination at play: Elliott Carter's ''Three Illusions,'' in its New York premiere; Lukas Foss's masterwork ''Time Cycle,'' with Dawn Upshaw as vocalist; Ives's ''Three Places in New England''; and Gershwin's Piano Concerto in F, with Jean-Yves Thibaudet as soloist. Oct. 10. Carnegie Hall.    JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA The Juilliard School celebrates its centenary with special events throughout the season, but this is the official anniversary concert. Dennis Russell Davies conducts Webern's Six Pieces (Op. 6) and Schubert's Ninth Symphony as well as a work commissioned for the occasion, Einojuhani Rautavaara's ''Manhattan Trilogy.'' Oct. 11. Carnegie Hall.    MARIN ALSOP Ms. Alsop was already drawing wide attention before her recent fracas with the players of the Baltimore Symphony over her appointment as music director in 2007. And surprisingly, given that her reputation has been as a champion of unfamiliar repertory, that attention was for a recording of Brahms's First Symphony with the London Philharmonic Orchestra on Naxos, the first in a complete CD cycle of the Brahms symphonies. Here she conducts that First at the New York Philharmonic, along with works by Prokofiev and James MacMillan. Oct. 14-15, 18. Avery Fisher Hall.    BEAUX-ARTS TRIO The group has just turned 50, at least in the person of its founding pianist, Menahem Pressler. It is in its scond of three seasons surveying all the piano trios, violin sonatas and cello sonatas of Beethoven. Oct. 14; Dec. 2; April 21. Metropolitan Museum.    APRILE MILLO This soprano, who went from quick stardom at the Metropolitan Opera and elsewhere to lower-profile engagements and cult status, is evidently making a new bid for stardom. She was acclaimed as Tosca at the Met last season, and now she makes her recital debut at Carnegie Hall, with the pianist Ken Noda. The repertory will range from Puccini, Verdi and Donizetti to Brahms and Mahler. Oct. 14. Carnegie Hall. In addition, Ms. Millo will sing the title role in Leoncavallo's ''Zazà'' in a concert performance by Teatro Grattacielo. Nov. 12. Alice Tully Hall.    CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA An adversarial press is hardly new to the conductor Franz Welser-Möst, after his rude baptism at the London Philharmonic a decade and more ago. Now he finds himself embattled in Cleveland with Donald Rosenberg, the chief critic of The Plain Dealer. The root complaint seems to be that Mr. Welser-Möst is no Christoph von Dohnanyi, his predecessor. Granted. Mr. Welser-Möst is his own man. And some of us -- having heard at least as many brilliant moments as lesser ones from him, especially in Brahms -- would like to know that man better. Here, at any rate, is more Brahms, the First Symphony and the ''Academic Festival Overture,'' as well as the New York premiere of Chen Yi's ''Four Seasons.'' Oct. 17. Carnegie Hall.    CECILIA BARTOLI The program this adventuresome musical sleuth sings here -- as yet unidentified music by Alessandro Scarlatti, Caldara and Handel -- presumably duplicates in large part her new Decca recording, ''Opera Proibita.'' In the first decade of the 18th century, when opera and other theatrical works were banned in Rome by the pope, composers wrote underground, for private performances, or resorted to subterfuge, writing operatic works masquerading as oratorios and the like. For obvious reasons, much of this music has been slow to come to light, and Ms. Bartoli's album is said to include premiere recordings. If anyone can turn these pieces into instant classics, it is Ms. Bartoli. Oct. 19. Carnegie Hall.    NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG The festival opens its 18th season with ''Since the 70's: A Generation of Song,'' featuring works by the likes of William Bolcom, John Musto, John Corigliano and Ricky Ian Gordon. Oct. 19. Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330. www.nyfos.org    CHRISTOPHER MALTMAN He ''may have the world's most perfect baritone voice at the moment,'' The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote after Mr. Maltman performed in Brahms's ''German Requiem'' with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Although you try to maintain a certain critical skepticism, claims like that catch your attention, especially when they are seconded by reports from trusted acquaintances. Here is a chance to judge for yourself, as Mr. Maltman performs a wildly varied song recital, with Malcolm Martineau as pianist. Oct. 20. Zankel Hall.    BARD MUSIC FESTIVAL After two hectic festival weekends in August, there is, evidently, still something to say about Copland and his world. Just ask Leon Botstein. (No, you won't even have to ask.) Oct. 21-23. Fisher Center, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845)758-7900. www.bard.edu/bmf    'PIANO FORTE' The Met Museum has been presenting ever more impressive series of piano recitals in recent years, paying particular attention to young competition winners. This new season-long series presents some of those but also includes established veterans. The organization is based on juxtapositions of repertory. Sergey Schepkin leads off here with a program of Bach and Brahms. Fazil Say and Frederic Chiu chime in later with more Bach and Brahms. Antti Siirala, Stephen Kovacevich, John O'Conor and Martin Kasik play Beethoven and Schubert. Marc Laforêt and Alexei Grynyuk play Chopin and Rachmaninoff. Begins Oct. 22. Metropolitan Museum.    ROYAL STOCKHOLM PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA It is undoubtedly a fine orchestra, but much of the attention here will be focused on its music director, Alan Gilbert, a youngish American of whom big things are expected. The first program is unusual: an extended set of Scandinavian vocal works, sung by Anne Sofie von Otter, followed by Mahler's Fifth Symphony. The second, apart from the New York premiere of Anders Hillborg's ''Exquisite Corpse,'' is more standard: Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto, played by Lars Vogt, and Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony. Oct. 22-23. Carnegie Hall.    'THE MINES OF SULPHUR' There are works that you know exist, for one reason or another, yet never get a chance to hear (unless the conductor Leon Botstein lives in your neighborhood). And then there are works that seem to come out of nowhere, like this 40-year-old opera by Richard Rodney Bennett. The production comes from the Glimmerglass Opera, where it was the surprise hit of last summer, and Glimmerglass forces have already recorded the work for Chandos. David Schweizer directs, and George Manahan conducts. Opens Oct 23. New York State Theater.    ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S A new Telarc recording of Mozart's Requiem, conducted by Donald Runnicles, has been acclaimed as much for Robert Levin's inspired completion of that unfinished work as for the typically splendid work of the Atlanta Symphony Chamber Chorus. Here Mr. Runnicles imports that choir to steal a march on the Mozart year, with the stirring Requiem and the ineffable ''Ave Verum Corpus.'' Oct. 27. Carnegie Hall.    SHOSTAKOVICH CENTENNIAL In any major Shostakovich celebration, you can trust that the symphonies and the string quartets will be tended to, as they are this season by Great Performers at Lincoln Center. But there are still vast tracts of repertory lying fallow. Here the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center cultivates one of those tracts, the chamber repertory, but studiously leaves the string quartets to others. Good forethought. Oct. 28, 30; Nov. 1. Alice Tully Hall.    BACH CHOIR OF NEW YORK The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, having found a new conductorless playmate, performs for the first time with chorus. The estimable Kent Tritle, the innovative and tireless music director at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue, is the choir's artistic and music director. It joins Orpheus in Bach's Magnificat as part of the band's Carnegie Hall concert on Dec. 3. But the groups also combine in two full programs of Bach cantatas in the Met's Medieval Sculpture Hall. Oct. 31; March 13. Metropolitan Museum.    'MESSIAH' If you're going to have yet another recording of Handel's perennial, it may as well be one to provoke thought or visceral reaction. And the more standard the work, the more you can count on Nikolaus Harnoncourt to tee you off at some point. It should be revealing to see how Mr. Harnoncourt's views on the work may have changed since he recorded it 20 years ago, given his various adventures inside and outside the early-music world since. A strong vocal cast (Christine Schäfer, Anna Larson, Michael Schade and Gerald Finley) joins the Arnold Schoenberg Choir and the Concentus Musicus Wien. October. Deutsche Harmonia Mundi.    November    CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA In his last season as the orchestra's music director, Daniel Barenboim comes calling to New York with three programs centering on big symphonies: Bruckner's Fifth, Schubert's Ninth and Mahler's Fifth. The rest is Schoenberg, Elliott Carter and the inevitable (this season) Mozart. Nov. 3-5. Carnegie Hall.    GIDON KREMER Mr. Kremer is a violinist of consummate refinement and technique. If you have any doubt, watch for his new recording of Bach's unaccompanied sonatas and partitas, to be released by ECM New Series next month. (Having heard Mr. Kremer perform the works in concert three years ago, I will recommend the recording, sound unheard.) But Mr. Kremer's service to music has gone far beyond his brilliant fiddling, particularly in spreading the good word about a number of East European composers. Alfred Schnittke was one of his early causes and continues to be a favorite. Here Mr. Kremer presents the New York Philharmonic premiere of Schnittke's Concerto Grosso No. 5. Mikko Franck conducts, and Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony fills out the program. Nov. 3-5. Avery Fisher Hall.    ANGELA HEWITT Ms. Hewitt is an admirable Bach pianist, deft, graceful and outgoing, though she is not always entirely riveting. Here she plays the first book of ''The Well-Tempered Clavier,'' and it will be fascinating to see how well she conveys the interiority, intensity and concentration of these pieces. Nov. 5. Miller Theater.    McDUFFIE DUTTON KIRSHBAUM TRIO The literature for string trio is not so rich that there are many permanent ensembles. But this ad hoc group of solo-caliber players -- the violinist Robert McDuffie; the violist Lawrence Dutton, of the Emerson String Quartet; and the cellist Ralph Kirshbaum -- should do just fine in works by Mozart, Beethoven and Dohnanyi. Nov. 5. 92nd Street Y.    'CHANT WARS' We tend to think that what has come down to us as Gregorian chant is a simple, monolithic and changeless body of music. Nothing of the kind. The men's contingents of two respected early-music groups, Sequentia and Dialogos, square off to dramatize the formative ninth-century conflict between the cantors of Charlemagne and those of the pope. It is a program the groups have been honing for several years, and a recording of it is to be released by Deutsche Harmonia Mundi in October. I'm not sure who plays whom, but my money is on Sequentia (maybe only because I haven't heard Dialogos). Nov. 6. Metropolitan Museum.    'THE LITTLE PRINCE' At the New York City Opera, Rachel Portman's opera about well, you know. The production is by Francesca Zambello, with sets and costumes by Maria Bjornson. Opens Nov 12. New York State Theater.    ENGLISH CONCERT This once pioneering period-instrument group has been re-energized by the firebrand violinist Andrew Manze, as it shows once again in its new recording of Heinrich Biber's Missa Christi Resurgentis on Harmonia Mundi France. Biber seems to be a particular passion of Mr. Manze, who in this concert sandwiches Biber works between his own reconstructions of ''original'' versions of two of Bach's orchestral suites. Nov. 14. Zankel Hall.    'ROMÉO ET JULIETTE' Two years ago, as she was emerging from a vexing period of vocal troubles, Natalie Dessay spoke tentatively about expanding her repertory to include this Gounod opera, pending her successful return to the Met as Zerbinetta in Strauss's ''Ariadne aux Naxos.'' The deal must already have been in the works for this new production, and fortunately, Ms. Dessay's intervening fortunes have done nothing to scotch it. Ramón Vargas is a practiced Roméo, and Guy Joosten directs. Opens Nov. 14. Metropolitan Opera House.    PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA So, in the wake of the Marin Alsop flap at the Baltimore Symphony, how much does it matter if an orchestra and its music director do not madly love each other? Philadelphia appears to be a test case at the moment. Several players were vocal in their opposition to the hiring of Christoph Eschenbach four years ago, and many a discouraging word is still heard. In any case, the Eschenbach-Philadelphia chemistry has not set the world on fire -- or even the American Northeast, preoccupied as it is with James Levine and the Boston Symphony. Mahler's gloomy and portentous Sixth Symphony, which Mr. Eschenbach conducts here, in the orchestra's first New York appearance this season, may strike close to home. Nov. 15. Carnegie Hall.    BRADLEY BROOKSHIRE Approaching the seventh annual concert of his eight-part survey of Bach's complete works for his instrument, Mr. Brookshire remains perhaps the most skilled and inventive Bach harpsichordist in New York. (No backhanded compliment intended, but that's another story.) Here Mr. Brookshire plays the ''French Overture,'' the ''Italian Concerto'' and the three- and six-part ricercares from ''A Musical Offering,'' along with a wild card: the premiere of Charles Wuorinen's ''Harpsichord Divisions.'' Nov. 16. St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212)378-0248. www.stbarts.org    'A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM' Britten's, that is, presented by the Juilliard Opera Center, directed by Eve Shapiro and conducted by David Atherton. (For that matter, Shakespeare's, too, presented by the Juilliard Drama Division during the same period -- a rare opportunity.) Nov. 16, 18, 20. Juilliard Theater.    'SHELTER' The Bang on a Can composers -- Michael Gordon, David Lang and Julia Wolfe -- return to BAM with another large-scale multimedia work, performed by the unlikely combination of the hard-charging musikFabrik and the ethereal Trio Mediaeval. The theme of the work, as described in BAM's brochure, takes on added resonance soon after a horrendous hurricane: '''Shelter' mines the myriad connotations of the work's title -- physical structures, intimate personal exchanges, a metaphoric home for our beliefs -- ultimately questioning whether what we build can protect us against the destructive power of the world around us.'' Nov. 16-19. BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100. www.bam.org    DAVID ROBERTSON ''Seeing Debussy, Hearing Monet'': this is not what people have in mind when they talk about orchestras turning into museums. (By the way, how did ''museum'' come to be a pejorative? There are daring museums and stodgy ones, contemporary museums and classical ones. We might do better if some of our orchestras were more like certain museums. But that's for another day.) This concert, exploring the parallels between Debussy and Monet, is the first of four with the St. Louis Symphony in Mr. Robertson's Perspectives series at Carnegie. In two others, in the spring, they will perform Michael Jarrell's melodrama ''Cassandre'' and John Adams's Sept. 11 piece, ''On the Transmigration of Souls.'' Nov. 18. Carnegie Hall.    ANNE-SOPHIE MUTTER It's a little hard to get around the cheesecake in the press kit (well, not all that painful), but the idea of Ms. Mutter's Mozart Project seems to be that she is recording (again, at least in large part) all of Mozart's major works for violin. The chamber works are still to come. Here, on two CD's, are the five concertos and the glorious Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola, with Yuri Bashmet. Ms. Mutter conducts the London Philharmonic Orchestra from the fiddle. November. Deutsche Grammophon.    'LA TRAVIATA' If you missed Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón in Verdi's opera at the Salzburg Festival this summer, you may want this recording. If you heard them, you may want it even more. November. Decca.    December    'AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY' Having gotten back into the commissioning of operas a quarter-century ago, the Metropolitan Opera has carried on fitfully. John Harbison's ''Great Gatsby'' was the last to appear, in 1999. Tobias Picker's ''American Tragedy,'' based on the Dreiser novel, will be directed by Francesca Zambello and conducted (whatever the reason for James Levine's reticence) by James Conlon. To its credit, the Met is throwing a lot of vocal star power at the work: Patricia Racette, Susan Graham, Jennifer Larmore, William Burden, Nathan Gunn and others. Opens Dec. 2. Metropolitan Opera House.    TRIO MEDIAEVAL It seemed almost too convenient, a couple of years ago, when this gifted female vocal trio appeared on the scene just as Anonymous IV was about to leave it. But subsequent concerts and recordings have only solidified the credentials of the trio, which is based in Oslo. A new recording, ''Stella Maris,'' is due out this month on ECM New Series. The trio's Christmas program here, laced with Norwegian traditional songs, is sure to be a delight. Dec. 10. Weill Recital Hall.    ST. THOMAS CHOIR For years, when Gerre Hancock directed this choir, it presented the ''Messiah'' of choice in the New York holiday season. I have yet to hear how that ''Messiah'' may have changed under St. Thomas's new director of music, John Scott, but I have no reason to suspect anything less here. (I did hear Mr. Scott conduct the choir in Bach's ''St. John Passion'' in March, and you won't want to miss his reprise of that masterwork on April 4.) Dec. 13, 15. St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212)664-9360. www.saintthomaschurch.org    January    MEREDITH MONK A workshop, ''Monk on Monk.'' Jan. 9-15. Carnegie Hall and Zankel Hall. A related article is on Page 88.    BALTIMORE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The management's decision to hire Marin Alsop as the orchestra's next music director met with sharp resistance from the players when it was announced in July. Although the rancor was aimed mainly at management, for what was called a hasty hiring process, Ms. Alsop, who is to take over in 2007, also came in for direct criticism. Pleasantries were quickly re-established, but the first real test of the altered relationship comes here, as Ms. Alsop visits with music by Mozart, Dvorak and Christopher Rouse. Jan. 12-13. Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, (410)783-8000. www.baltimoresymphony.org    JONATHAN NOTT This British conductor made a considerable impression in the spring, when he visited New York with both the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra and the Ensemble Intercontemporain. And that impression was only enhanced by the release of several of his Bamberg recordings by Tudor. He has set himself a difficult task in his New York Philharmonic program, with Strauss's ''Alpine Symphony,'' a big, lumbering work that doesn't get a lot of respect. (I, for one, would take it any day over, say, the ''Sinfonia Domestica.'') To fill out the program, the violinist Joshua Bell will play John Corigliano's ''Red Violin'' Concerto. Jan. 12, 14. Avery Fisher Hall.    'THE MANY FACES OF MOZART' Last season, before he was installed as music director of the New Jersey Symphony, Neeme Jarvi took over its annual winter festival and steered it toward one of his passions, Nordic music. Now that he is in place, he stands aside and lets others (Gilbert Varga, Bernard Labadie and Vladimir Feltsman) tend to the winter festivities kicking off Mozart's 250th-birthday year. (How come? Does Mr. Jarvi see where all this Mozart mania is heading?) Jan. 12-29. Halls in Newark, New Brunswick, Trenton and Princeton, (800)255-3476. www.njsymphony.org    'SCENES FROM GOETHE'S ''FAUST''' Schumann's work performed by the Cleveland Orchestra. Jan. 12, 14.

'THE ESSENCE OF LIGETI' The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center picks up where the Miller Theater left off in its season-opening celebration of Gyorgy Ligeti. In the middle program, the coruscating pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard plays several of the thorny études. Jan. 13, 15, 17. Alice Tully Hall.    THOMAS HAMPSON The American baritone makes a stop in ''Song of America,'' a 12-city tour presented in part by the Library of Congress, which provides a touring exhibition of rare musical manuscripts. Wolfram Rieger is the pianist. EMI Classics is to supply a companion CD in November, just before the start of the tour, in Kansas City, Mo. Jan. 19. Carnegie Hall.    MISSA SOLEMNIS Beethoven's sacred masterpiece is always an event, but the vocal soloists (to say nothing of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus) should lift this one to a lofty plane. They are Deborah Voigt, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson (if she is healthy and singing again in what is supposed to be a busy season for her), Ben Heppner and René Pape. Some team! Jan. 19-21. Symphony Hall, Boston, (617)266-1492. www.bso.org    ORCHESTRE RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE If you feel compelled to program Mozart (as everyone does this season), you could hardly do better than John Eliot Gardiner and his forces. Here they offer a program of the last three symphonies (Nos. 39, 40, 41), soon to become a cliché, as it happens. And with the Monteverdi Choir, they perform the Mass in C minor alongside the Requiem. Jan. 22. Avery Fisher Hall. Jan. 23. Alice Tully Hall.    'THE PASSION OF OSVALDO GOLIJOV' Great Performers at Lincoln Center throws its considerable resources into a major, monthlong celebration of the Argentine-American composer, including two of his recent big works, the opera ''Ainadamar'' and the ''Pasión Según San Marcos.'' Jan. 22-Feb. 22. Various Lincoln Center theaters.    BERLIN PHILHARMONIC Talk about dodging a bullet. Just a few years ago Carnegie Hall was contemplating a boneheaded merger with the New York Philharmonic -- in effect, closing in on New York. Now Carnegie is opening to the world, developing special relationships with far-flung orchestras. Its first is with the Berlin Philharmonic, which will present an eight-day residency involving community activities as well as concerts in 2007. In the meantime, Simon Rattle and the orchestra are visiting with four concerts, more than any other foreign orchestra this season. The repertory is rich and varied, ranging from Haydn and Mozart to Strauss and Mahler, from Schoenberg's Variations (Op. 31) and Ravel's ''Ma Mère l'Oye'' to the New York premieres of Thomas Adès's ''Asyla'' and Hanspeter Kyburz's ''Noesis.'' Both Carnegie and the Berlin Philharmonic seem, after a bit of foot-dragging, to be embracing the 21st century while other institutions slouch toward oblivion. Jan. 25-28. Carnegie Hall.    'THE MAGIC OF MOZART' It promises to be a hectic year for Mozart pilgrims. With the New Jersey Symphony winding down its multiweek festival and with John Eliot Gardiner and his forces having hit and run at Lincoln Center earlier in the week, the New York Philharmonic presents yet another wave of Mozart, with Lorin Maazel conducting the ''Coronation'' Mass, the ''Vesperae Solennes de Confessore'' and five mostly familiar symphonies, and Jeffrey Kahane playing and conducting two familiar piano concertos. Alas, it's that old Mozart magic that we know so well. Jan. 26-Feb. 14. Avery Fisher Hall.    FOCUS! 2006 The Juilliard School's contemporary-music festival, in its 22nd season, is up to the minute. Subtitled ''New and Now,'' it features in each program a work commissioned by the school as part of its centennial celebration. The press material even lists a work by Paul Schoenfeld composed in 2006. Let's hear it for procrastination. Jan. 27, 30-31; Feb. 1-3. Juilliard Theater.    HILLIARD ENSEMBLE This superb male vocal quartet spoiled us last season by appearing in a mixed conformation with the captivating soprano Joanne Lunn. But we should not hold it against the men for returning to their roots in music of Guillaume Dufay, Josquin Desprez and Nicolas Gombert. This is a typically compelling presentation of the treasurable series Music Before 1800. Jan. 29. Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212)666-9266. www.mb1800.org    February    STEVEN ISSERLIS It hardly seems possible that this brilliant and well established English cellist has yet to make his New York recital debut, but so says the Y. He does so in his usual thoughtful fashion, with music by a series of composers each of whom mentored the next: Mendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms, Dvorak, Suk and Martinu. Feb. 7. 92nd Street Y.    STAATSKAPELLE BERLIN Already, the orchestra's two Mozart programs begin to feel like piling on. Daniel Barenboim conducts the last three symphonies (Nos. 39-41) over two programs rather than one, as John Eliot Gardiner will already have done and as Lorin Maazel will be doing at the same time a few blocks uptown. Even before you hear it, it all begins to sound the same. Feb. 11-12. Carnegie Hall.    ROYAL CONCERTGEBOUW ORCHESTRA Obviously Carnegie Hall is less vigilant about the duplication of major works in a season than it used to be. Or maybe it just doesn't shove the big guys around. Here, a mere three weeks after Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic let Richard Strauss blow his own horn in ''Ein Heldenleben,'' Mariss Jansons and his Amsterdam orchestra, in their second program, re-examine the life of our self-proclaimed hero. (Fortunately, this musical autobiography was written long before Strauss's involvement with the Nazis.) But in the first program comes an even more grandiose statement, this one less about Shostakovich himself than about his world in cataclysm: his mighty ''Leningrad'' Symphony, which Mr. Jansons should project to a noisy fare-thee-well. Feb. 14-15. Carnegie Hall.    JAMES LEVINE Here are a couple of weeks that should tell much about the status of Mr. Levine's honeymoon with Boston Symphony audiences. The first week's program consists of three works by Schoenberg: the Five Pieces and the Variations for orchestra, and ''Pelleas und Melisande.'' The second week's sole offering is Schoenberg's ''Gurrelieder,'' a work steeped in Romanticism (but to know that, you have to be able to get past dread of the composer's name). In fact, Schoenberg even carries into a third week, with his Chamber Symphony No. 1, but all will be forgiven when Beethoven's Ninth Symphony follows. If Mr. Levine can pull off this kind of programming, he really has something going in Boston. Feb. 16-18, 21; Feb 23-25. Symphony Hall, (617)266-1492. www.bso.org    KIROV OPERA Valery Gergiev and his hard-working company from St. Petersburg pay their annual visit to Washington, this time with Puccini's ''Turandot,'' Wagner's ''Parsifal'' and Verdi's Requiem. The quality of the performances may depend on just how hard the company has been working lately. The Kirov is now in its fourth year of a 10-year residency at the Kennedy Center, which, press materials say, was ''made possible by Alberto Vilar.'' So he paid in advance? Feb. 19-26. Kennedy Center, (202)467-4600; (800)444-1324. www.kennedy-center.org    CAPPELLA ANDREA BARCA Well, you have to admit, it isn't as obvious as, say, Kremerata Baltica. Even when I saw that the pianist Andras Schiff was playing and conducting, it didn't occur to me: Andrea Barca is Mr. Schiff's name in Italian. (Don't you hate having to admit your ignorance to a publicist?) The cappella is Mr. Schiff's hand-picked chamber orchestra, made up of notables including the entire Panocha Quartet. Here is still more Mozart, though it's likely to surpass most of what has come before. Over three concerts, Mr. Schiff will play six piano concertos and lead three other choice works, including the Sinfonia Concertante for Violin and Viola. Feb. 21, 23, 25. Carnegie Hall.    March    VIENNA PHILHARMONIC Among the more laughable aspects of the fracas between Riccardo Muti and the Teatro Alla Scala in Milan last season (and there were many) were dire reports in the European press that Mr. Muti, tyrant that he obviously was, had burned his bridges and might never find gainful employ again. Conductors of Mr. Muti's stature are in short supply, and he is now, as he was before, in constant demand in the highest international circles. And a good thing for New York, which not only got to hear him in April in evident harmony with the New York Philharmonic but gets to hear him again here in one of his prime collaborations, with the proud (not to say haughty) Vienna Philharmonic, which is nobody's punching bag. The three concerts include the expected Germanic fare (Mozart, Schubert, Richard Strauss and Hindemith) as well as works by Bartok and Falla. It's the next best thing to having been at La Scala last May, when Mr. Muti returned with the Vienna Philharmonic in tow. March 3-5. Carnegie Hall.    AUDRA McDONALD The Houston Grand Opera has commissioned a new opera for the Broadway star, to be presented as part of a one-woman double bill with Poulenc's ''Voix Humaine.'' In the new work, said to be a lighter foil to Poulenc's gloomy opus, Ms. McDonald will be surrounded by frequent collaborators: the composer Michael John LaChiusa, the director Lonny Price and the conductor Ted Sperling. Opens March 4. Wortham Theater Center, (713)228-6737; (800)626-7372. www.houstongrandopera.org    RUSSIAN NATIONAL ORCHESTRA It's a bit perverse of Great Performers at Lincoln Center to attach the title ''Winter Dreams'' to the orchestra's Tchaikovsky minifestival, which does not include the wonderful ''Winter Dreams'' Symphony (No.1), too seldom heard. Instead, the first program offers the bombast of ''Manfred'' and the predictability of the First Piano Concerto (with Yefim Bronfman as soloist). The other programs, more constructively, explore Shakespeare through the lens of Tchaikovsky and Tchaikovsky through the lens of Stravinsky. The fast-rising young Russian maestro Vladimir Jurowski makes his New York orchestral debut. March 5, 6, 8. Avery Fisher Hall.    'MAZEPPA' No one has contributed more to the Russification of Western music over the last decade or two than Valery Gergiev, through visits by the Kirov Opera and Orchestra of the Maryinsky Theater in St. Petersburg and through his own activities with Western ensembles. Mr. Gergiev's proselytizing continues apace at the Met, with a presentation of Tchaikovsky's Pushkin-based ''Mazeppa,'' produced in collaboration with the Maryinsky Theater. Yuri Alexandrov is the director. Opens March 6. Metropolitan Opera House.    IAN BOSTRIDGE The peerless English tenor begins his Carnegie Hall Perspectives series with a program of Britten (''Winter Words'' and ''Canticles''), sharing the stage with the countertenor Bejun Mehta, the baritone Nathan Gunn, the pianist Julius Drake and others. A Bostridge recording of Britten orchestral song cycles with Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic should already be out in November. Mr. Bostridge's later Perspectives concerts involve the Belcea Quartet, the pianist Leif Ove Andsnes and the soprano Dorothea Röschmann. March 8. Zankel Hall.    'TREEMONISHA' It is surprising that so little attention has been paid to this rousing opera during recent decades despite the sustained popularity of its creator, Scott Joplin. The Collegiate Chorale performs it here in a semistaged version -- a nice gesture, since Robert Shaw, the chorale's founder, presented the first modern performance of the work in 1971 (with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus). March 9. Alice Tully Hall.    ATLANTA SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Having heard the crack Atlanta Symphony Chamber Chorus in Mozart's Requiem with the Orchestra of St. Luke's in October, you can now hear the full Atlanta Symphony Chorus in Verdi's Requiem. Robert Spano, fresh from his first encounter with Wagner's ''Ring'' in Seattle last month, tackles this most operatic of liturgical works. March 11. Carnegie Hall.    KIROV ORCHESTRA Shostakovich hardly needs a festival to make his way these days, any more than Mozart does. But it happens to be his centenary year, and attention is being paid -- perhaps nowhere more stylishly than at Lincoln Center. The Great Performers series is presenting all 15 string quartets, played by the Emerson String Quartet, and (over two seasons) all 15 symphonies, conducted by Valery Gergiev and divided between the two orchestras he directs, the Kirov and the Rotterdam Philharmonic. Mr. Gergiev kicks things off with the Symphonies Nos. 1, 2, 7, 9 and 10. March 12-13. Avery Fisher Hall.    ALEXANDER LONQUICH This pianist, in his New York debut, may be someone to keep a close eye on. Reliable word out of Europe suggests that he is superb. The repertory, though extending from C.P.E. Bach to Wolfgang Rihm, is mostly basic: Mozart, Schumann and Chopin. March 15. 92nd Street Y.    JORDI SAVALL Suffice it to say that Mr. Savall's performances at the Met Museum in April -- alone on his viola da gamba, with family members and with his ensembles -- were perhaps the early-music highlight of the last season. Mr. Savall will be active around the city, at Weill Recital Hall on March 2 and at the Miller Theater on March 4. Here he takes part in a gamba master class, a conversation and a concert by Hespèrion XXI. March 15-16. Metropolitan Museum.    THOMAS QUASTHOFF The Carnegie calendar so far says only that the bass-baritone Mr. Quasthoff is singing works of Mahler and Schubert. That's good enough for me. Justus Zeyen is the pianist. March 18. Carnegie Hall.    'WALL TO WALL STRAVINSKY' The annual free 12-hour composer marathons at Symphony Space are among the more popular events in any New York concert season. But the immersion treatment should prove particularly apt and revealing with Stravinsky, who worked in so many radically different forms and styles over his career. The producers promise a little of everything, and it should be enough to make any compleatist's head spin. March 18. Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212)864-5400. www.symphonyspace.org    LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Kurt Masur is loyal to his friends, and his appearance here, as music director of the orchestra, begins the way his tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic ended in 2002, with the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter playing Beethoven's Violin Concerto. The other music in these two programs is also vintage Masur, including Dvorak's Eighth Symphony and Mahler's First. March 20, 26. Avery Fisher Hall.    'LYSISTRATA' ''Or the Nude Goddess,'' goes the subtitle of this opera by Mark Adamo, presented at the New York City Opera. The New York Times report from the premiere in Houston in March pointed out that only a statue was nude. But it also implied that the work, with ''almost too many ideas for its own good,'' had room for improvement. Might some of those ideas have gone by the boards? Opens March 21. New York State Theater.    VERDI'S REQUIEM It is distressing that the New York Philharmonic seems to be spending so much of the season lagging behind the curve. This performance, conducted by Lorin Maazel, follows not only Robert Spano's with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus at Carnegie Hall (by less than three weeks) but also Colin Davis's with the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in September, in the same hall. Great Performances at Lincoln Center also anticipates the Philharmonic with a Mozart festival in Avery Fisher Hall -- John Eliot Gardner conducts Mozart's Symphonies Nos. 39-41 less than three weeks before Mr. Maazel does the same -- and with Tchaikovsky's Suite No. 3 and Shostakovich's Symphony No. 10. Well, at least the Philharmonic beats Lincoln Center to the punch with Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5. Don't these people talk to one another? March 29, 30; April 1, 4. Avery Fisher Hall.    'DON PASQUALE' James Levine, during his three decades at the Metropolitan Opera, has generally conducted new productions. But Donizetti's music here is so squarely focused on the voice and so heedless of the orchestra that it comes as a bit of a surprise to see the heavily burdened Mr. Levine busy himself with it. Certainly, those lustrous vocal parts should be well conveyed by Anna Netrebko and Juan Diego Flórez. Otto Schenk, as director, will have to stray far from his Germanic predilections to achieve the requisite light touch. Opens March 31. Metropolitan Opera House.    April    YOUNG CONCERT ARTISTS This organization's track record is good enough that when it presents its annual program of concertos, you can be pretty sure you'll hear at least one extraordinary performance -- and maybe three. My money here is on the double-bassist DaXun Zhang, who did a sensational stint with the Silk Road Project last year. But there is probably no reason to expect less of Lise de la Salle, a pianist, or Jose Franch-Ballester, a clarinetist. Keith Lockhart conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's. April 5. Rose Theater.    YO-YO MA Our reigning cellist has spoiled us by presenting all six Bach cello suites in a single evening. Still, only a miserable ingrate (who, me?) could feel shortchanged by a concert of three of these great works, the Suites Nos. 3, 5 and 6, in what promise to be brilliant and knowing performances. And think of the possibilities for encores. April 5. Carnegie Hall.    NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Leonard Slatkin conducts a typical mix of new and old, American and European -- typical, at least, since a former regime at Carnegie discouraged some of his more adventurous programming. Works by Barber, Corigliano and Melinda Wagner sit alongside music by Beethoven, Rachmaninoff and Elgar. Emanuel Ax is the pianist in Beethoven's Third Concerto and Ms. Wagner's ''Extremity of Sky.'' April 6-7. Carnegie Hall.    ROTTERDAM PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Valery Gergiev picks up his two-season survey of the Shostakovich symphonies with Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 15. April 9-10. Avery Fisher Hall.    'SOLOMON' Americans are likelier to know the early-music conductor René Jacobs from recordings than from live performances. And if you don't know his recordings, you should definitely remedy that in October, when his version of Handel's oratorio ''Saul'' comes out from Harmonia Mundi France; to judge from an advance copy, it is vivid and exciting in its search behind the letter for the spirit of the score. Whatever familiarity you do have with Mr. Jacobs's recent work is likely to make you run, not walk, to hear his performance of ''Solomon,'' another great Handel oratorio, with the English Voices and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. The countertenor Lawrence Zazzo, splendid as David in ''Saul,'' sings Solomon. Lisa Milne is his queen and Marie Arnet the Queen of Sheba. April 16. Alice Tully Hall.    MSTISLAV ROSTROPOVICH If it's a Shostakovich year, can the composer's great friend be far behind? Mr. Rostropovich conducts the New York Philharmonic in Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1, with Maxim Vengerov as soloist, and the Symphony No. 10. Though Mr. Rostropovich is looking frail (by his standards) these days, expect vigor and passion. April 19-22. Avery Fisher Hall.    SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Michael Tilson Thomas, who is recording all the Mahler symphonies with the orchestra, keeps it in fighting trim with the Adagio from the Symphony No. 10 in the first program, the Rückert Lieder (sung by Celena Schafer) in the second. April 19-20. Carnegie Hall.    'POCKET CONCERTOS' The Miller Theater, in its relentless pursuit of the new, institutes a three-year project of commissions for concertos with small chamber orchestra. The composers here are Julia Wolfe, John Musto, Ichizo Okashiro and Benedict Mason. And the solo instruments are as eccentric as tuba, double bass and accordion. April 22. Miller Theater.    EMERSON STRING QUARTET As its part of Lincoln Center's Shostakovich centenary tribute, this esteemed group plays all 15 of the string quartets, as it did in 2000. Again, it will hew closely to chronological order, with only a couple of transpositions within programs to make for more effective sequences. (The deeply introspective and claustrophobic Eighth Quartet, in particular, almost has to come last to work its full power.) April 27, 30; May 4, 11, 14. Alice Tully Hall.    VLADIMIR ASHKENAZY This veteran pianist is many things, but you don't necessarily think of him as a Bachian. So his recording of both books of ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'' should tell a lot. Is he just keeping up with the Barenboims, or is he doing them one better? April. Decca.    May    'RODELINDA' Renée Fleming is far from my notion of the ideal Handelian, but if her star power is what it takes to get the thing on the boards, so be it. This was the sleeper hit at the Met last season, and the addition of the splendid German countertenor Andreas Scholl can't hurt. Opens May 2. Metropolitan Opera House.    'PAULUS' Kent Tritle is so busy away from his church job that you tend to forget just how much he continues to accomplish there, especially with his invaluable series Sacred Music in a Sacred Space. Here he closes the season (begun on Oct. 20 with Haydn's ''Creation'') with a lovable oratorio by Mendelssohn, a more youthful, less grandiose sibling to ''Elijah.'' Mr. Tritle's chorus and orchestra are sure to put it across stylishly. May 4. Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212)288-2520. www.saintignatiusloyola.org    MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE Milton Babbitt spent many years as the ultimate insider in contemporary American classical composition. Minimalism, the New Romanticism and other trends have since radically altered the scene, leaving Mr. Babbitt somewhat on the outside, looking in. But it is touching to see his longtime champions stand by him: specifically, in a program celebrating his 90th birthday, the conductor James Levine and the pianist Robert Taub. May 10. Weill Recital Hall.    'PARSIFAL' With admirable magnanimity, James Levine stepped aside in 2003 and deeded one of his favorite operas, which only he had conducted at the Met in a quarter-century, to Valery Gergiev. But good will runs only so far in the world of Wagnerian Realpolitik, and Mr. Levine has reclaimed his podium. The starry cast includes Ben Heppner, Waltraud Meier, Thomas Hampson and René Pape. Opens May 12. Metropolitan Opera House.    VERIZON HALL ORGAN FESTIVAL Great pipe organs are coming back into the concert hall, whether reinstalled, as at Severance Hall in Cleveland; rebuilt, as at Symphony Hall in Boston; or newly built, as at Walt Disney Hall in Los Angeles. The Kimmel Center in Philadelphia, the home of the Philadelphia Orchestra, is also installing a new one, among the largest in the United States, built by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders in Lake City, Iowa. And the center will celebrate the installation with a two-week festival, beginning with concerts of the Philadelphia Orchestra. May 11-25. Kimmel Center, (215)893-1955. www.kimmelcenter.org    EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK Before there was Richard Strauss, before there was Hector Berlioz, there was a great orchestrator: Jean-Philippe Rameau. Frederick Renz leads his period-instrument band in suites from Rameau's operas and ballets. The season brochure lists no specific repertory. It hardly matters; whatever it is, it is sure to sparkle. May 20. St. James's Church, Madison Avenue at 71st Street, (212)280-0330. www.EarlyMusicNY.org    PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The orchestra enters a brave new music-director-less world this season, with Andrew Davis acting merely as music adviser. So it is evidently improvising a bit on tours, traveling this time in regal style, with Christoph von Dohnanyi in a program including Bartok's deeply involving Divertimento along with works of Haydn and Tchaikovsky. May 23. Carnegie Hall.    'GRENDEL' Elliot Goldenthal is the composer, but Julie Taymor, as co-librettist, director and puppet co-designer, may be the prime selling point of this new work, a riff on ''Beowulf.'' Eric Owens sings Grendel; Denyce Graves, the Dragon. The production will travel from Los Angeles to the Lincoln Center Festival, which was a partner in the commission. Opens May 27. Los Angeles Opera, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, (213)972-8001. www.laopera.com    June    'FALSTAFF' The Falstaff of choice these days is Bryn Terfel, whom you can hear sprawling through Verdi's bawdy comedy beginning on Sept. 23 at the Met. Thomas Quasthoff may never be a rival onstage, because of his physical limitations, but his earthy voice and outsize personality should make a powerful and affecting impact in concert performances. The ones here, with the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Franz Welser-Möst, end the orchestra's season with the usual bang. June 8, 11. Severance Hall, (216)231-1111. www.clevelandorch.com    YURI TEMIRKANOV For his first concert as music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, in January 2000, Mr. Temirkanov led a towering performance of Mahler's ''Resurrection'' Symphony. Now, with a nice symmetry, he offers the same work in his last concert as music director (and with the same vocal soloists, Janice Chandler-Eteme and Nancy Maultsby). For those with long memories, these performances should tell much about how the orchestra has fared under Mr. Temirkanov's watch. Reports in the interim have mostly been positive, and if the performance matches or in any way surpasses that of 2000, it will indeed be memorable. June 8-9, 11. Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, (410)783-8000. www.baltimoresymphony.org. June 10. Music Center at Strathmore, (800)276-1444. www.bsoatstrathmore.org    AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The recent Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center made much of Mozart's travels and even his nontravels -- to, for example, Russia, which he never visited. Leon Botstein, the American Symphony's music director, offers another take on the Russian connection, posthumous as it is, and a refreshingly offbeat approach to the Mozart year with concert performances of two small operas: Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Mozart and Salieri'' and Dargomizhsky's ''Stone Guest,'' which takes its cue, via Pushkin, from the vengeful statue of the Commendatore in ''Don Giovanni.'' June 11. Avery Fisher Hall.    DANIEL BARENBOIM It seems just yesterday that the players of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra were complaining about their new music director, Daniel Barenboim. But Mr. Barenboim has survived for 17 years. (So is there hope for Christoph Eschenbach in Philadelphia after all?) Now the orchestra bids Mr. Barenboim farewell in grand fashion, with three concerts, each including a valedictory ninth symphony: Mahler's, in the first program, with Elliott Carter's ''Soundings''; Bruckner's, with Pierre Boulez's ''Notations I-VII''; and Beethoven's, with his ''Choral'' Fantasy. June 15-17. Symphony Center, (800)223-7114. www.cso.org       Compiled with the assistance of Ben Sisario.

One of the few genuine insights provided by Mr. Yaguchi is that these days Jim Jarmusch must be the most eagerly imitated film maker in the world.

Whittaker, was brutally attacked by three masked men in his dormitory room and left on the floor, bleeding profusely while tied to his bed. Whittaker, a 21-year-old black man, accused three of his more racist fellow students. West Point adminstrators chose to believe their explanation that Whittaker had staged the attack himself because he was afraid of failing a philosophy course. Whittaker was found guilty in a court-martial and dismissed from West Point.   The story is reconstructed in \\"Assault at West Point,\\" having its premiere Sunday on Showtime. An older Whittaker (Al Freeman Jr.), now battling bigots who don't want him and his family living in a white Oklahoma City neighborhood, tells his story to a local journalist. The flashback begins as Whittaker's lawyers, the white Daniel Chamberlain (Sam Waterston) and the black Richard Greener (Samuel L. Jackson), prepare their case for the aggrieved cadet (Seth Gilliam).

Technically this is a superior French production, for it has been beautifully photographed and the cameraman, Armand Thirard, has captured the majestic beauty of the snow-covered Savoy Mountains in exciting patterns of light and shadow. However, the same clear-cut artistry is not evinced in Christian Jacques' direction and there are many muddled passages when the development of the story is obscure and confusing.\\"Who Killed Santa Claus?\\" is described on the program as a \\"mystery comedy-melodrama,\\" a description that is perhaps as good as any. This is the story of a village preparing to celebrate Christmas, of the fear that rises when the Baron returns to his castle after a ten-year absence and word gets around that he has leprosy","excerpt":"of a mysterious attempt to steal from the village church the valuable diamond ring of St. Nicholas; of a girl's longing for romance in terms of a knight in shining armor; of the children's excitement over the pending visit of Father Christmas and of the despair and confusion that confronts the villagers when Father Christmas is found dead from an assassin's bullet.The picture is fundamentally a character study of an imaginative old man, keeper of a curio shop, who paints terrestrial globes and intrigues the children with fabulous tales of personal adventures in China and other far away places though he himself has never left the village. His harmless diversion brings joy to all except his own daughter, Catherine, who lives in a dream world, and the Baron, who, excited by the old man's tales, went away to seek excitement and, having spent a fortune, returns disillusioned and blames Cornusse for his despair.From the way the story is happily resolved it would appear that it was intended as a reaffirmation of faith, yet there is a satirical quality about the work that suggests derision of simple beliefs. Indeed, a sharply derisive note is struck when some choir boys steal from the church during midnight mass and join their Free Thinker school teacher and his group in a noisy parade outside which shatters the spiritual quality of the night.Harry Baur plays the role of Father Christmas with the skill of a virtuoso. He is benign, flustered and monstrously enraged, developing each characteristic with easy skill, but somehow all his show of emotion is surface and empty. Renee Faure is frail, pathetic and disturbing as his daughter; Robert le Vigan is excellent as the school teacher, and Raymond Rouleau gives a sympathetic and compelling performance as the lonely and frustrated Baron who eventually finds happiness with Catherine. In fact, the cast has been well chosen down to the smallest bit part.It is too bad all this talent had to be invested in a murky screen play, but it may perhaps be indicative of the confusion that existed in France at the time when \\"Who Killed Santa Claus?\\" was produced.

No one tripped on Wednesday night, when the festival opened with a production of Mozart's \\"Nozze di Figaro,\\" but the ha-ha seems to have reproduced.

Among the illustrations to Esmond Wright's new biography are a pair of pictures, based on Fragonard, paying homage to ''le docteur Franklin'' in the best classical manner - one shows him being crowned by Liberty, the other takes its title from the sonorous tribute in which the French statesman Turgot summed up his achievements as scientist and American patriot: ''Eripuit caelo fulmen sceptrumque tyrannis'' (''He seized the lightning from the sky and the scepter from tyrants'').

A few have succeeded—\\"Cimarron\\" notably—because the producers managed to subordinate the sideplot of romance to the essentially dramatic story of the immigrant train and its cumbersome march to empire.\\"Wagon Wheels\\" falls to join this honored list through its neglect of that principle. Too much is made of the romance between Clint Belmet (Randolph Scott) and Nancy Wellington (Gail Patrick). The film loses dignity, too, through the stock introduction of the renegade fur trader who incites the Indians to attack the train in an attempt to preserve, for a few more years, the trapping country. In its emphasis upon these phases the picture lapses into pure horse opera.The film does possess much that is interesting and entertaining. The regrets are mostly for what it might have been.

And the inspired, often utopian innovations of the 1920's -- many influenced by Schinkel -- are often, even in their postwar, reconstructed versions, still exciting and surprising. Schinkel's buildings, many of which are in the center of the city, are almost unavoidable, but the best examples of Weimar-era architecture are -- to my mind -- the great housing developments known as public-housing estates, or Gross-Siedlung. They are all in the outer districts of town, but easily reached by subway.    The first to be constructed -- and, at the time, the most famous -- was the \\"horseshoe,\\" or Hufeisen, estate, one section of the Gross-Siedlung Britz, in the working-class borough of Neukolln, southeast of the city center. The Horseshoe Estate, built between 1925 and 1927, is so called because the focal point of its thousand or so dwellings is a horseshoe-shaped three-story apartment building. Three streets of one-family houses surround the horseshoe, and the boundaries of the estate are bordered, for the most part, by three-story apartment houses. Bruno Taut, Weimar Berlin's most productive architect, designed much of the project, including the horseshoe itself, but credit is also given to Martin Wagner, who designed the apartments on the estate's northern boundary. Wagner, as a member of the building society that financed the construction and, later, as Berlin's chief city planner, was the driving force behind the city's 1920's housing revolution.

It is \\"The Titan—Story of Michelangelo\\"—and a more imaginative or expressive cinema effort has not been seen hereabouts in a long time.For this is not a conventional \\"screen biography,\\" in which the life of a celebrated person is represented in re-enacted episodes, with an actor playing the subject and other actors playing subordinate roles. This is a comprehension of the life, the spirit and the times of Michelangelo revealed in a synthesis of images created out of moving camera studies of the artist's works","excerpt":"of beautiful, sweeping vistas of Italian country; of noble landmarks in Florence and Rome, and in dynamic animations of static objects to express supreme events.Accompanying this synthesis of images and intrinsically complementing it are an explanatory narration, which outlines the artist's life and times, and a sound-track that is brilliantly constructed to place appropriate music or sounds to images. It is notable that an actual person is never once to be seen in the whole film.But let us be more specific. The film begins with the narrator's voice reciting the credo of the artist, while shadows play upon a marble expanse. Then shots of the village of Caprese, where Michelangelo was born, convey a visual comprehension of the spirit of the place of his youth. Shadows of a moving ox-cart and human voices suggest the boy's transfer to Florence, with the architectural beauties of that city pictorialized to sense the flooding Renaissance.The surging vitality and drama of the great Pazzi-Medici feud, which flamed soon after Michelangelo came under the patronage of Lorenzo de Medici, is vividly caught in camera movement, in racing shadows, in sounds and suggestive images, such as that of a rope suddenly stiffening to convey the termination of the feud. The influence of Savonarola is comprehended in striking pictures of the monk, in flames, in graphic shots of the piazza, in music and the narrator's words. And so it goes through the picture, as momentous political events are dramatically integrated with the pattern of the artist's works.But it is in the visualization of the latter—in the use of the mobile photograph—that a real comprehension of the artist, of his power and his grandeur—is revealed. For not only is the camera used to search and analyze the details of the glorious masterpieces of the artist—the Bacchus, the Battle of the Centaurs, the statuary of the Medici Chapel, the Sistine murals, St. Peter's marvelous dome—but the vitality of his creation is actually conveyed in imagistic terms. The mystery surrounding the sculpturing of his David, from a huge block of marble containing a flaw; or the assemblage of the Sistine murals—these are thrillingly dramatized.Credit for this extraordinary effort in the uses of pure cinema must be shared by those who have revised it from an originally created European film. The idea and assemblage of the picture came from Curt Oertel, whose treatment (with a much different sound-track) was picked up in Germany after the war. The present un-propagandized version has been engineered by Robert Flaherty, who deserves the major credit for obtaining its assemblage here.To all others on the production credit is due, however—to Alois Melichar for the music, to Norman Borisoff for the commentary and to Fredric March, who narrates it in an invaluably eloquent voice. Except for a few unfortunate passages in which the voice of Michelangelo is supposed to speak—a device of extreme banality and one that shatters the illusion painfully—the track on the picture is in every way an accomplishment in cinematic art quite comparable to the stunning images, the mobile illustrations, on the screen.

Isn't it a fact that children are always feeling deeply humiliated in their relations with grown-ups and each other? . . . Our whole education is just one long humiliation, and it was even more so when I was a child. One of the wounds I've found hardest to bear in my adult life has been the fear of humiliation, and the sense of being humiliated. Every time I read a review, for instance - whether laudatory or not - this feeling awakes. . . . To humiliate and be humiliated, I think, is a crucial element in our whole social structure. It's not only the artist I'm sorry for. It's just that I know exactly where he feels most humiliated. Our bureaucracy, for instance. I regard it as in high degree built up on humiliation, one of the nastiest and most dangerous of all poisons.

Madison Avenue has traditionally categorized the buying public into such amorphous groups as housewives (18 to 54 years of age), upscale working women (18 to 34), or urban men (34 to 55). But such divisions give advertisers little insight into people's life styles, personal values or goals -all of which affect the way they decide to spend their money.   Now, however, a newly developed research approach enables marketers to view consumers as something other than vague statistics. After years of in-depth interviews with consumers, the Stanford Research Institute created VALS - for Values and Life Styles -to provide Madison Avenue with an economic, social and emotional profile of American society. What a client gets is a series of reports based on extensive interviews with Americans, conducted by the Stanford institute. Clients can commission specific studies or they can get parts of a regular series of reports that can cover everything from religious views to attitudes about a hypothetical economic disaster.

To my knowledge, the idea was first seriously proposed in the early 1950's by New York City's commerce commissioner.    While I was a graduate student working in the Office of the Mayor in 1969 under Deputy Mayor Timothy Costello, I wrote a lengthy and complex analysis of a no-fare transit system that considered direct and indirect benefits to people, businesses and industries, along with the question of subsidies to other transportation modes, capital and expense budgets and fund sources that were tied to the measure of one's share in the city's economy.    The conclusion was that no-fare transit would greatly benefit all economic interests at less overall cost than now incurred.   The paper was shelved as being too controversial for an election year. But for anyone who can use its support, despite its outdated statistics, I suppose it is still available in the municipal archives somewhere and that mine is not the only extant copy. STEPHEN G.

After contemplating their expressionless faces, the camera returns to the drama, but detachedly, as though the director has decided to observe the world and its butchery through uncomprehending bovine eyes.    Wielded by a lesser film maker, this conceit, which alludes to the eye-slashing opening sequence in \\"Un Chien Andalou,\\" the seminal 1929 Surreal collaboration between Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali, might seem pretentious. But \\"Cows\\" is a film so overflowing with what can only be called life-force energy that these digressions lend it an extra depth and poignancy. At these turning points, the viewer is momentarily prodded to see the film's larger-than-life characters as tragic, mortal creatures in a landscape that will outlast them and their joys and torments no matter how intensely they live.

The dialogue is pungent and not flattering to the men in the play. They are bystanders, either passive or uncaring, and they deserve the implied criticism.   The play begins as an engaging luncheon discussion between best friends, Mia Dillon as a pregnant wife and Deirdre O'Connell as a woman who is single, 38 and desperate to have a child of her own. The biological clock is only one of several ticking urgencies. In the case of both women, a world of hopes is passing by, and fortysomething is approaching.

Mr. Dix's facial expressions are pleasing and natural, but at times he does not seem to know what to do with his hands, unless it is a fighting scene, and then he is never in doubt.The story is entertaining, with some implausible stretches and a few forced directorial notions. Mr. Dix plays the part of Richard Gaylor Jr., a modern Lothario who has so many sweethearts that his father does not know what to do with him. It is explained that Richard takes to business with the same fervor a baby takes castor oil. Money is apparently demanded of Gaylord Sr. for the breaches of promise made by his son. He is told by a trusted employe that in the Basque country of France Richard will be safe, as the women there only accept attentions from their own people.Gaylord and Simmons, the favored old manager, therefore travel to the Basque country to search for a certain metal ore. One sees them arriving in a small village at the hour of the siesta. There are amusing scenes of the different men and women, boys and girls and even dogs, enjoying their noonday nap. You can't order anything, you can't accost anybody, and therefore Simmons and Richard also fall into a doze. The doze becomes sound slumber, and when the inhabitants are aroused and are going about their afternoon duties the two Americans are in the arms of Morpheus. Just as Richard opens his eyes he finds them suddenly focussed on a beautiful girl, who is none other than Yvonne Hurja, the inamorita of the captain of the guard, Julio. Yvonne (Frances Howard) does not reciprocate the affection showered on her by Julio, and, observing a good-looking, clean, young American, she at once becomes interested in a quiet, ladylike fashion.William Powell is excellent as Julio. It is a part which fits him like the proverbial glove. He is jealous, cowardly, vengeful, affectionate in a perfectly natural way. Richard is a clever chap, and when Julio would have the American dispatched with a knife Richard pulls out a sheet of paper and pretends to be an artist interested only for art's sake in Yvonne's face. This assuages the Captain's wrath, but he is convinced later that, artist or no artist. Richard is extremely bold with the fair lady.Richard invades Yvonne's veranda and sits with her, one hand on the rail. Below there is somebody playing music. It is a serenader","excerpt":"of course the pompous Julio. Richard, without knowing that it is his avowed enemy, the Captain, tosses a rose over the rail. The blossom falls to the feet of the guitar player. He presses it to his lips and continues playing. Later he ventures up a ladder and fervently imprints kisses on a hand which he believes to be that of Yvonne, but which is Richard's. No wonder Julio is furious!Simmons is convinced at one point that Richard has had his lesson and that he will in future pay no attention to Basque girls. However, Richard is in love, and he is willing to risk everything.Miss Howard is likeable as Yvonne, although she is a lethargic young woman. Joe Burke does very well as Simmons, and Frank Currier is capable as Gaylord Sr.\\"Too Many Kisses,\\" in spite of its queer title, is a constantly amusing light entertainment, just the thing to make one forget the cold wind and changeable weather.

Rupert Hughes as author and Reginald Barker as director, with the aid of an evenly excellent cast, have made a mother-love picture that is sentimental without being sloppy. They have dealt in the old-home stuff as if they really respected it, with the result that their production seems genuine. It's marked \\"sterling\\" in every scene. Its name is \\"The Old Nest,\\" and it opened at the Astor Theatre last night. Go to see it, especially if you have been made cynical by the theatrical desecration of its theme in the past.Rupert Hughes's story was published some years ago, and was no doubt resurrected to meet what is supposed to be the present popular demand for \\"home-spun drama,\\" but those who have dug it up have unearthed pure gold, while most of the other prospectors have simply displayed shining yellow metal. In this picture mother is happy and busy with a house full of children, six in all, and as the years pass they grow up and go away. Some turn out better than others, one is particularly bad, while another becomes Attorney General of the United States. But the mother loves them all, and the father, too, in his way, and when they all leave the old nest, mother is lonely and tired and sad. Father's skin is thicker, but he feels, too, and does his best for mother, which isn't much. Then all the children flock home on a visit, and that's a happy place to end the story.Simple, obvious, even literal? That's the charm of it. It's natural and human, as it pretends to be. It doesn't feel that it has to become theatrical and exaggerated to reach the ordinary public. The children don't beat their mother up in order to pet her afterward. They are not inhumanly ungrateful in order to gush gratitude later. Mother isn't made to suffer all the punishments of the damned for five reels so that she may enjoy the happiness of the blessed in the sixth. Her children simply grow up, marry, go away, become occupied with their own affairs—and are normally forgetful. Then they remember and come home—when one of them has something to boast about and feels like taking a week off. Mother's tragedies are such as countless mothers endure, and her joys are as many.And she's a human being. She loves her children passionately, and spoils them outrageously. She sees their faults but doesn't let them know it. They lie to her about forgetting her birthday and she knows it, but thinks they are \\"awfully good\\" to make up the story. And on occasion she is a perfectly gorgeous liar herself. She quite exasperates father sometimes, of course. She may be a bit sentimentalized, but not much. Not offensively, at all.The story has been done with restraint. Its sentimentality is not smeared on, and its humor is not megaphoned. The picture never seems to stop while it orders you to laugh or to cry. In this it seems to be chiefly Mr. Hughes's work. Whatever he does or does not do, Mr. Hughes seems to respect himself and his work too much to become mushy and melodramatic. His titles in the present picture are straightforwardly written, often with an objectively humorous turn, and not so frequent as to make the pictures mere illustrations. The pictures tell the story.And in the pictures is principally Mary Alden as the mother. Her performance is the best thing of its kind seen here. Dwight Crittenden, as the father, a country doctor, is a true figure, and also the children, in their various ages, played by Johnny Jones, Richard Tucker, Marshall Ricksen, Buddy Messenger, Cullen Landis, Lucille Ricksen, Louise Lovely, Robert Devilbiss, J. Park Jones, Marie Moorehouse, Billy Cotton and Helene Chadwick. Nick Cogley as an old negro, Fanny Stockbridge as the old-fashioned family cook and a number of others enrich the story.Some people","excerpt":"of course, don't care for any production of \\"The Old Nest\\" kind, and certainly it does not represent the highest art of the theatre, but one likes it, now and then, for it is good, wholesome food for theatre-fed folk if it's genuine. And \\"The Old Nest\\" is genuine. It's what it is. You can take it or leave it—but whatever you do it won't make you mad or bore you. The only serious objection to it is that it's a bit long drawn out. THE SCREEN"},{"year":"2002","title":"Book titled Spooï Making the 100 Best List","excerpt":"Of Course, It's Debatable"},{"year":"1931","title":"DESPITE the terrifying reports of economic crises and the popping of the Banks on every side, German life goes its normal way. The restaurants are well filled and even the film theatres are not much worse attended than is usual at this time of year—especially when we take into consideration the tropical heat which has been upon us. And just to prove that they are not worried the German film producers brought out three new pictures last week—every one of which could have shown itself without blushing during the height of the Winter season.At the Atrium there was a film of Edgar Wallace's stage play, \\"At the Sign of the Leopard\\" (Der Zinker). The English film versions of his pieces, which were often made under the author's supervision, were usually peculiarly inept and smelled too strongly of the footlights. But here, under the direction of Carl Lamac and Mac Fric, we got some of the thrill that Mr. Wallace gives his readers in novel form. Then, too, the film was done with real picture technique. There were no long-drawn-out dialogue passages but the whole was made up of short scenes, often with only one or two words spoken in them, and was skillfully cut to give speed and suspense.I do not mean to suggest, however, that \\"Der Zinker\\" was a masterpiece. There was a good deal of poor acting in it, particularly from the female division, and Paul Hörbiger in the effective rôle of a casual reporter was a distinct disappointment. But the film is a satisfactory hour and a half for those who prefer not to be bothered by logic when the midnight automatic barks.Another Ufa Operetta.And then the Ufa also threw its sturdiest star, Lilian Harvey, into the Summer balance. This time she is separated from her usual co-star, Willi Fritsch, and teamed with Harry Liedtke and Felix Bressart. Under Anatol Litwak's direction we have another one of those Ufa operetta pictures which began with \\"The Love Waltz\\" and continued successfully through \\"Three From the Tanking Station\\" and \\"Burglars.\\" This time it is called \\"Nie wieder Liebe\\" (No More Love), and follows old-fashioned methods.The stage play \\"Dover-Calais,\\" by Julius Berstl, on which the scenario is founded, seemed to me to be eminently adaptable to the screen. Here an old crank who has been unfortunate in his relationships with women has been sailing on a yacht for the last ten years without putting into shore or allowing the crew to do so. Of course, no female is ever permitted to board the vessel. While cruising in the English Channel he picks up a young girl whose strength has given out trying to swim from Dover to Calais. When she gets on board we discover that she is really a reporter who has used this ruse to try to get an interview from the elderly woman-hater. He immediately begins to be interested in her and finally offers to marry her. But the girl turns him down and leaps overboard again, followed by the young mate, who has shown unmistakable signs of being enamored by her.The adapters have left out most of the originality of the play. The old crank has become a young millionaire, who has made a million-dollar bet to keep away from women for five years. The girl is now a detective hired by the man who is at the other end of the wager. In order to protect his master and get him rid of the girl, the millionaire's personal valet breaks into his master's desk and arranges the evidence so that it will look as if the girl were the thief. And then the adapters ran completely out of ideas and ended up with the carnival at Nice and an automobile chase along the Riviera. Of course, the girl saved the hero from losing his bet but allowed him to marry her—which will probably cost him considerably more.Lilian Harvey.Despite the triteness and spreadiness of the script there was a very fair honest quota of amusement in the firm. Lilian Harvey is her usual airy self. Harry Liedtke is a trifle colorless, but he still seems to appeal to Germany's womanhood as it flows to the box office, and Felix Bressart has some moments as the millionaire's eccentric valet—though he would have been considerably funnier had he been allowed to play the rôle more as a character part. And the director, Anatol Litwak, has caught many moments where melody and action could be combined to the rhythms of Mischa Spoliansky's skillful music. The song hit, \\"Leben ohne Liebe kannst Du nicht\\" (You can't live without love), sticks in the brain when hammered home for a full evening, and maybe the dance orchestras and the radios can anchor it in the general consciousness—which will be nice for the picture's future.Considerably more conventional in theme and treatment is \\"Opernredoute\\" (Opera ball), which came out at the Capitol. But this did not hinder it from being unquestionably the most pleasing of the three premières. The director, Max Neufeld, has done nothing which we have not seen a hundred times before, but the film nevertheless has atmosphere and a certain personal charm. It is true that a good deal of this must be credited to the actor, Georg Alexander, who impersonates an engaging Viennese Don Juan. Alexander is in his way a somewhat more grotesque edition of Adolphe Menjou, set over into the German. A light flick of Viennese dialect helps to keep his dialogue effervescent and his real talent as a comedian fills every scene with life and variety. Only the rotund Otto Wallburg with his spluttering bellicosity has a chance beside him. Liane Haidt and Ivan Petrovich in the straightforward leading rôles are pale beside him, although they fulfill satisfactorily the requirements of external beauty which their rôles demand.And the story? It is about members of the Viennese diplomatic corps and charming Viennese wives who attend masked balls and Viennese waltzes and all the rest of it. Without realizing it Alexander almost has an affair with the wife of his best friend, but at the crucial moment her lady's maid is substituted.

Practically no German versions are to be made in Hollywood next season as, despite the artistic success of a few of them, no American-made German versions have been financially successful in the Reich.Fox and Warner Brothers were both planning to make German pictures here in conjunction with Tobis, the German sound-patent holders. But these plans have been completely dropped. Fox is not bringing out a single feature here next year and is only concentrating on its news service. And Warner Brothers will only release four or five American pictures with German titles.The only people who are living up to their schedule are Paramount, who are releasing twenty-five pictures for the German market next season. Of these at least half will be 100 per cent German dialogue pictures made in the Paramount studios in Paris.

What I find most curious about it is that it is startlingly funny for precisely so long as it clings stubbornly and passionately to the record, inventing almost nothing.   Sister Mary Ignatius runs a rigorously informative fifth grade at a parochial school called Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow. The school proves to be well named, and yes, Mr. Durang manages eventually to get a laugh out of that.

He was slight in stature, almost scrawny, and his hairline was just about nonexistent. Yet Fred Astaire became the epitome of movie elegance, seemingly willing himself to be debonair.

The latest compilation of evidence can be found in \\"The Fred Astaire Songbook,\\" being broadcast tomorrow night at 8 on Channel 13. The producers are Joan Kramer and David Heeley. Back in 1980 Mr. Heeley directed two hourlong documentaries about Astaire: \\"Puttin' on His Top Hat\\" and \\"Change Partners and Dance.\\" They focused on Astaire the dancer, unhesitatingly described then by Rudolf Nureyev as \\"the greatest dancer in American history.\\" The new program deals primarily with Astaire the singer and his ability to use what may have seemed an ordinary voice to extraordinary effect.

There is no \\"better role\\" for the munitions makers to hide in.With a frankness that in more pious years, and particularly in those before the Nye committee went to work, would have met with shocked disbelief, the film and its voice accuse the munitions makers of most of the major crimes and all of the minor ones. It names, names and presents flat accusations. Among the interests cited are Vickers-Armstrongs, Krupp, Schneider-Creusot, Skoda, du Pont, Remington, Colt, the de Wendels (or von Wendels), Fritz Thyssen, Sir Basil Zaharoff. Here are specimens of its narration:\\"Is there a war in the Far East? Vickers fills millions of dollars' worth of orders. Does South America want a revolution? Vickers supplies its share of the death-dealing implements. Its relations with the British army, the navy and the peerage are more than cordial. . . . Krupp, under the Treaty of Versailles, was forbidden to make armaments. Supposedly engaging in the manufacture of nothing but peaceful industrial products, this German firm is rearming Germany to the tune of 100 millions annually. . . . But the most alert munitions boys of them all are Schneider-Creusot. Forty per cent of its goods are exported. Into every corner of Europe the armament octopus spreads its tentacles. Genuine brothers-in-arms they are, an international fraternity enmeshed in interlocking directorates and working with common capital.\\"The narrator recounts the matter of the reciprocal agreement during the war whereby the German-operated mines at Briey escaped bombardment in return for similar immunity for the French ore deposits at Dombasle","excerpt":"of French shipment of raw materials to Switzerland, whence they were obligingly rerouted to Germany to return, eventually, into French territory in the form of exploding shells; of the Krupp suit over the Vickers' use of German grenade fuses.The nature of much of this material is not photographic. To illustrate the accusations, the picture can resort only to glimpses of the munitions factories, arms conferences, animated maps and pictures of some of the war areas; it scarcely could he expected to contain actual photographs of the munitions salesmen plying their trade. It is, in this regard, merely an illustrated lecture. But the implications go far beyond the screen and the narrator's voice. No one who has read the testimony presented before the Senate committee can fail to feel that \\"Dealers in Death\\" is an authentic, if incomplete, record of an important chapter in world history, a chapter that still is being written.

Musically, they make an odd couple, Haydn with his self-effacing grace and wry wit, Liszt with his preening grandiosity and ponderous proclamatory tone. But the pianist Alfred Brendel is fond of both composers, and on Friday evening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art he split his recital between them.   Mr. Brendel speaks Haydn like a native tongue, with exquisite timing and sense of scale. Here he gave the E-flat Sonata (H. XVI:49) a robust reading, toying deliciously with the delayed recapitulation in the first movement. After a refined account of the Andante With Variations in F minor (H. XVII:6), the pianist eased into the C-major Sonata (H. XVI:50) enticingly. He fairly reveled in the \\"wrong\\" harmonies in that work's finale, and ended with clever understatement.

He was given six weeks in which to find a job in films. Halfway through the last week, when practically resigned to a career as an aeronautical engineer, he met Michael Balcon, then production chief of Gainsborough Films, who gave him a job making synopses of new novels at $10 a week.

It is possible that their castles will figure in the film and that the Scottish Light Horse will take part. The Battle of Flodden is probably the first occasion on which a smoke-screen was used in war. The Scots fired the gorse, so that the smoke would conceal their movements, and this will be depicted.Arthur Finn, an American actor who has directed more than two hundred short films in his time, has returned to acting and will be seen in two new British films, produced by Herbert Wilcox.

Mr. Ray, whose grasp of the cinema medium was uncertain in \\"Pather Panchali,\\" his first film, demonstrates in \\"The World of Apu\\" that he is master of a complex craft and style.Here he is telling us what happens to Apu, the lad of his previous films, when he has completed his skimpy education and gone out into the cold and challenging world. It is helpful to know about Apu, his broken family and his boyhood trials from the previous films. But it isn't essential or even vital, for this is a complete and rounded drama in itself.It is the drama of a young man, shy and lonely, who is drawn into marriage with a ???, whom he doesn't know, ??? of regard for friendship ??? for a Hindu custom that ??? patently absurd","excerpt":"of his ??? realization of love for ??? and their blissful happiness together for one year, until she dies in childbirth and he is left desolate, the stricken father of an unwanted child.Through all of this tender experience, Mr. Ray pursues the story and constructs the film with an attention to the finer spiritual values that is extraordinarily sensitive and rare. Being a man who won't be hurried—or, at least, will not allow the tempo of a placid, pensive people to be stepped up to suit the custom of the screen—he follows the life stream of his hero with elaborate serenity, observing his world with close attention and delicately molding the beauties along the way.Life is an everlasting poem in the canon observed by Mr. Ray. It is a slow flow of sensuous experience, surrounded by esthetic qualities. A man comes home in disappointment after having failed to get a job; he pensively shuts the windows, lies on his bed and plays a flute. A bride adorned in all her finery dares nothing more than a soft smile and whatever delight shows in her large eyes to express her gratitude at being wed. A woman goes home to have a baby; a message comes that she is dead.Mr. Ray conveys in simple symbols the inexorable swing of life and death.But the climax and triumph of his picture is its final phase in which the hero, the husband of the dead wife, the father of the unwanted child, goes into a period of several years of wandering and seeking for peace, finally to return to pick up his youngster and start another cycle of Apu.Mr. Ray's command of the telling image and of tempo is superior in this film, and he seems to have elicited from his actors as fine performances as he has ever had. In the role of Apu, Soumitra Chatterjee is timid, tender, sad, serene, superb. He is the perfect extension of Apu as a man. Sharmila Tagore is an idol—an animated idol—as his bride, and Swapan Mukherji is striking as his modern, educated, practical friend. An incredibly slight and sad-eyed youngster named Alok Chakravarty is heartbreaking as the child.A lovely musical score by Ravi Shankar complements the imagery of Mr. Ray. English subtitles apparently give us the gist of the conglomerate dialogue.On the program is a short film, entitled \\"Children of the Sun,\\" a rather stylized animation calling attention to the United Nations Children's Fund. The music for it is played by Pablo Casals and the Budapest String Quartet.

The endorsement raises critical questions on the safety of our dairy products and on procedures for technology assessment.   I am one of the few independent scientists who have investigated the veterinary and potential public health hazards of the biosynthetic hormones, which differ chemically from their natural versions, and who actively participated in the N.I.H. conference, which was heavily dominated by the dairy industry and its indentured academics. I charge that the panel's unqualified endorsement of the hormones is a naive whitewash.    The conclusion of the panel was based almost exclusively on published claims by the industry and its academic consultants and contractees, though the more critical of these claims are generally controverted by their underlying data. Analysis of these data show that claims for the effectiveness of the manufactured hormones in increasing milk production are exaggerated.   More serious, the industry data, despite manipulation, also show that cows hyperstimulated by repeated hormone injections undergo serious stress, as evidenced by a high incidence of reproductive failure and chronic mastitis. Evidence of such adverse effects was confirmed and extended in confidential Monsanto files submitted in 1987 to the Food and Drug Administration, which were anonymously leaked in November 1989. These files also showed evidence of organ toxicity and widespread pathological lesions","excerpt":"of increased hormone levels in milk, and of extensive use of illegal and unapproved antibiotics and drugs to control infectious disease in the hormone-treated cows, with resulting risks of milk contamination.    On the basis of such information, the House Committee on Government Operations charged last May 8 \\"that Monsanto and the F.D.A. have chosen to suppress and manipulate animal health test data -- in efforts to approve commercial use\\" of the hormones. The committee requested the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services to begin an immediate investigation.   Last August, at the early planning stages of the N.I.H. conference, I warned of these serious concerns on the unreliability of published claims on the safety of the hormones by the industry and its academics, and  asked that the N.I.H. request the industry to provide the panel with unexpurgated toxicology files. Unsuccessful in this effort, I provided the N.I.H. with the executive summary of the 1987 Monsanto files and asked that copies be sent to the panel.   At the conference, I asked the panel chairman how he could reconcile the published industry claims on safety with the unpublished Monsanto files, to which he replied that he was unaware of them. After I had provided him with a copy of the executive summary, he informed me that the panel could not consider them as they were marked \\"confidential.\\" However, in an address to the conference, I quoted from these files and warned of the suppression of critical data by the industry and the need for independent scientific review of the raw data base. Yet the panel ignored these data.   The panel's conclusions and report are marred by other major defects. For instance, the report reassuringly states that \\"milk is the most monitored food in the American food supply,\\" despite warnings during the conference on recent evidence of widespread contamination of milk with antibiotic residues and F.D.A. acknowledgment that \\"the illegal use of veterinary drugs can be an even greater threat to the public health than the illegal use of human drugs.\\"   Furthermore, a report last November by the General Accounting Office, which is investigating F.D.A. review of the milk hormones for alleged improprieties, further documents the contamination of milk and the gross inadequacies of F.D.A. monitoring. More surprising is the contrast between the panel's unqualified endorsement of the safety of the new hormones and its recommendations for further research on a wide range of health and safety concerns.   The N.I.H. and its panel do not appear to have recognized that the usefulness of technology assessment depends on the availability of a valid data base, as opposed to derived publications, which may too easily reflect suppression, manipulation and self-interest.

For the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the  last 16 appeals by Casimer Urban Jr. were the final blow. In all these cases, a  three-judge panel observed in an opinion, ''The court is unable to hazard even the most elementary guess as to the relief Mr. Urban seeks, at a loss to decipher the nature of the claims pursued and unable to discern a plausible nexus between the complaint and the named defendants.'' His list includes the United Nations, U.S.A. Judicial Branch, U.S. Congress, U.S.A. and so on.         In the first three months of 1985, the same court had received 28 other appeals and more than 50 motions from Mr. Urban, who identifies himself for jurisdictional purposes only as a resident of ''the Milkyway Galaxy.'' Predicting that, at this rate, he would filed more than 100 appeals next year, the court handed down an injunction earlier this month, barring him from filing  any suit in any Federal court ''without first obtaining leave of that court'' through a special application.

Mondrian's painted grids, of course, fit almost too neatly into the city with the 90-degree soul. And for an architecture critic, the show casts a revealing light on the city itself. It may be entirely coincidental that Mondrian's grids recall the street plan of Manhattan. Even so, the paintings and the city both stand at the intersection of material reality and metaphysical thought.         At the Modern, wall plaques help viewers grasp the idea that Mondrian's abstract forms are not simply a matter of composition or design. For Mondrian, and for those susceptible to the creative process he pursued with such passion,  the departure from representation holds a spiritual dimension. Perhaps the show  itself can help us perceive the transcendent city outside from a similar point of view. The engineers who designed New York's grid did more than carve out identical plots of land from a bumpy little island.

But last week he pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy and possession of counterfeit $100 bills, and now it seems doubtful that the Foundation will accept him into its shrine.   The Foundation has set up a standard of morality and success as a criterion for induction.

THEATER","excerpt":"Of Old South Violence Only Yesterday"},{"year":"1956","title":"IF there are any misconceptions about the universality of Shakespeare, then a trip to the Cameo, the new and refurbished home of Soviet films on Eighth Avenue, where \\"Twelfth Night\\" was unveiled Saturday, should erase most doubts on that score.Although they have sliced the Bard's comedy to fit it into an hour-and-a-half runing time. Leningrad's filmmakers have done it judiciously. Above all, to judge by the English subtitles, they do not appear to have done injury to the poetry and songs that have lived for 350 years.Credit the producers with a studious approach to their subject. The plot-filled comedy of errors does not tower among Shakespeare's greatest works and they have carefully pruned it to the needs of the screen. His sonorous dialogue naturally is declaimed directly to the audience on occasion, which may appear stilted and archaic to a moviegoer. But the majority of his lines are welded to action.Viola and her twin brother, Sebastian, move about the \\"Illyrian\\" landscape with a will as they become involved in the romantic affair of the lovesick Orsino. The same is true of that noble","excerpt":"of Olivia, the beauteous object of his affections; of Malvolio, her stuffed-shirt steward, and, notably, of the heavyweight gourmand. Sir Toby Belch; Sir Andrew Aguecheek, the prissy butt of his gags, and the lively, brazen maid, Maria.Count as one of the comedy's assets the fact that part of the proceedings, such as the comic duels between Viola and Sir Andrew and Antonio and the soldiers, have been moved outdoors to sweeping settings that are enhanced by the pastel shades of Sovcolor. The interiors, by the way, are opulent enough to please a Renaissance Duke.Although Y. Fried, who adapted and directed, has permitted some shallow characterizations, most of his principals seem to temper fervor with an appreciation of Shakespeare's snarled romances. Katya Luchko contributes an excellent portrayal in the dual roles of the shipwrecked twins, Viola and Sebastian. Although her love for Orsino must be wrapped in her page's guise, she projects that ardor simply but strikingly. The part of Sebastian is less effective since it is largely muscular, but she does sit a horse well and is asked to duel only briefly.As Olivia, the Countess who falls for her but later discovers her error. Anna Larionova is a slightly buxom but pretty blonde who matches her beauty by a professional ability to make her maidenly romantic problems appear real. V. Merkuriev's characterization of Malvolio is both flat and unconvincing. He comes across merely as an old man playacting at being a love-harried swain. V. Medvediev's delineation of Duke Orsino is a standard effort. He is a handsome, nobleman, whose part is overshadowed by the other principals.M. Yanshin, of course, has the fattest, if we may be forgiven a pun, role. A veritable tun of a man, he makes Sir Toby a rambunctious, wine-swilling, devil-may-care mischief maker. As his partners in funny skulduggery, A. Lisyanskava, as the capricious Maria, and G. Vipin, as the weak-kneed, doltish suitor, Sir Andrew, give him noble assists. As the clown, B. Freindlich adds a couple of songs and a comic touch or two.Although they are Russians and their language gives \\"Twelfth Night\\" an exotic flavor, they play the broad comedy in the romantic and lusty spirit of the Bard.

The film is rolling, but the screen remains a restful dark gray.Gradually, gradations of tone, like those that characterize Ad Reinhardt's later paintings, and ripples and other minor imperfections in the screen itself become noticeable, although it may only be eyestrain.Whatever it is, it is a good deal less tiresome than the pastiche of naïve and ignorant theorizing that follows about political events in West Germany in the past quarter century as seen from the point of view of the violent left. The heroes of the film are the Baader-Meinhof gang of terrorists.There are several recurrent, seemingly unconnected, scenes and images. A woman, Annette Michelson, who obviously is no actress, talks endlessly and without making much sense, with someone, apparently her psychoanalyst, who keeps changing identity.There are many shots of the stone circle at Stonehenge","excerpt":"of open country, apparently in West Germany, and cityscapes and street scenes of West Berlin, in washed-out color; views from train windows, and lingering shots of photographs and bric-a-brac on a shelf in an apartment.Over some of these scenes, voices are heard.

A young woman, speaking too rapidly, expresses her banal opinions about life and politics in an inexpressive whine.\\"Journeys\\" is the work of Yvonne Rainer, whose credentials as a maker of \\"independent films,\\" for which \\"cinema obscura\\" might be a better term, are impeccable.

To look at these 21 paintings of the 17th century Dutch artist, even in the midst of a crowd, is to be drawn into a private realm. A woman in blue is silently absorbed in reading a letter by the window. Another woman, her head reverentially draped in white cloth, delicately  holds a miniature balance by the tip of her fingers and is poised in reflection. A third gazes into a mirror, frozen in dreamy repose, as she admires her pearl necklace. A viewer is almost embarrassed, as if intruding on some intimacy, disrupting a slender instant of time captured by an act of painterly photography.         Vermeer's uncanny creation of a domestic reality has inspired numerous attempts to explain his methods, which is one reason why an entire room of the Vermeer exhibition is devoted to the scientific principles he may have applied.  In Vermeer's day, painters, like scientists, were obsessed with perspective, optics and the nature of perception. And the ambition of most painters was to mirror nature precisely, recreating it down to the most exquisite detail. Indeed, any instrument or technique that furthered that goal was important.

The major problem with ill-prepared drug education is that it often supports a peer culture already prone to drug use. Every youngster told about tragedies of drug use knows dozens of youngsters who have used the drug and not suffered the tragedies: the message as heard by the student is, ''It didn't happen to my friends and it won't happen to me.'' The message, in short, backfires. Years ago, during the height of the marijuana scares that parallel our current concern over crack, Margaret Mead applied her version of cultural self-fulfilling prophecies to the subject: If we tell youngsters that their entire age group is about to be taken over by drugs, it will become so. Drug use will become an ''in thing,'' and few youths will wish to be ''left out.''

Yet such is the nature of the subject and of the times in which we live that it is fitting to have the authority and integrity of our government behind this film. \\"The World at War,\\" which opened for a pre-release run at the Rialto Theatre last night, is a staggering and dander-raising survey, culled from newsreel and captured Nazi films, of the colossal destruction which Germany, Italy and Japan have wrecked in their partnership of aggression. And it is a compelling demonstration of the nature of our enemies.This, the first factual war film under the new imprimatur of the Bureau of Motion Pictures of the Office of War Information, is the sort of complacency-shattering picture we should have had six months ago. For Sam Spewack, the former Hollywood writer, who produced and edited it for the government, has pulled no punches and minced no words in slamming home the \\"terrible, tangible facts\\" of this war. As clearly as has been accomplished in any picture so far is here manifest the brutal philosophy of Axis Blitzkrieg. Here, in one hour of motion pictures, is visualized the force we have to break.Mr. Spewack has opened with awesome shots of Pearl Harbor after the attack and of President Roosevelt requesting a state of war. Then he has cut back chronologically to show scenes of pre-war dissension in this country—of Fritz Kuhn addressing the German-American Bund in Madison Square Garden (at which a heckler was brutally beaten by Bundists and police)","excerpt":"of Senators Nye and Wheeler preaching isolation, of labor disorders on which the Nazis confidently banked. And then—with the narrator's comment, \\"America was at war. It had been at war, although few Americans realized it, for more than ten years, ever since Sept. 18, 1931, when Japan clawed Manchuria out of the body of China\\"—he picks up the graphic survey of a decade of deliberate doom.There are infuriating shots of Japan's depredations upon China and the futile sessions of a protesting League of Nations, of Italy's unprovoked war on Ethiopia, of Hitler's grab of Austria, of the fascist needling of the Spanish civil war, of Munich, the rape of Czechoslovakia and then the invasion of Poland and the outbreak of bloody war. Most of the footage from here on has been taken from confiscated Nazi films—two of which, \\"Feldzug in Polen\\" and \\"Sieg im Westen,\\" have been seen in this country. Too brutal almost for realization are the pictures here of cities destroyed, of fortresses reduced, of refugees scattered along the highways, of populations herded into slavery—in Poland, Norway, France and Belgium—and of Nazis gloating in triumph. The conclusion soberly visualizes the growing strength of the United Nations.The distinction of this documentary survey is the vigor and sweep of its presentation. Mr. Spewack and his associates have made it with the determination of outraged men. The editing from a mass of material was a job of expert perception and the cutting was masterfully done for maximum effects. The musical score by Gail Kubik is eloquent of fearful events and Paul Stewart speaks Mr. Spewack's trenchant commentary with conviction unaffected by bombast.Two versions of this film will be released free of charge to theatres throughout the land by the film industry's War Activities Committee. The present—sixty-six minutes in length—will be for single-feature presentation and a four-reel version will go to double-features theatres.

Be that as it may, José Bohr, the Argentine actor and director, with the able assistance of Claudio Arrau, the talented Chilean pianist, has produced something worth while in \\"Sueño de Amor\\" (Dream of Love), the current attraction at the Teatro Campoamor.While it is possible to point out a few technical flaws in this highly entertaining work, they count for little against the excellent acting and playing","excerpt":"of Señor Arrau and the generally competent support he enjoys in the persons of the charming Consuelo Frank and Julieta Palavicini, representing the two most prominent of the numerous women whose love formed part of the tribute paid by Europe to its most remarkable virtuoso of the keyboard.From the musical side the high spots are the playing of \\"Liebestraeume,\\" \\"La Chasse\\" and the \\"Second Hungarian Rhapsody,\\" the last by an orchestra, Despite the \\"studio\\" set-up, the atmosphere of the Europe of the middle of the last century is fairly realistic. An especially striking scene shows the reception given to Liszt by a band of gypsies when he visits his birthplace after a lapse of many years. It must be admitted that a few more dramatic incidents might have made this offering more popular with the run-of-mine cinema patron, but that is a matter of taste. At the Teatro Campoamor."},{"year":"1931","title":"It is just another gangster film at the Strand, weaker than most in its story, stronger than most in its acting, and like most maintaining a certain level of interest through the last burst of machine-gun fire. That was not the intention of the Warners, whose laudable motive it was to have \\"The Public Enemy\\" say the very last word on the subject of gang pictures. There is a prologue apprising the audience that the hoodlums and terrorists of the underworld must be exposed and the glamour ripped from them. There is an epilogue pointing the moral that civilization is on her knees and inquiring loudly as to what is to be done. And before the prologue there is a brief stage tableau, with sinuous green lighting, which shows a puppet gangster shooting another puppet gangster in the back.\\"The Public Enemy\\" does not, as its title so eloquently suggests, present a picture of the war between the underworld and the upperworld. Instead the war is one of gangsters among themselves","excerpt":"of sensational and sometimes sensationally incoherent murders. The motivation is lost in the general slaughter at the end, when Matt and Tom, the hoodlums with whose career of outlawry the picture is concerned, die violently.Edward Woods and James Cagney, as Matt and Tom respectively, give remarkably lifelike portraits of young hoodlums. The story follows their careers from boyhood, through the war period and into the early days of prohibition, when the public thirst made their peculiar talents profitable. Slugging disloyal bartenders, shooting down rival beermen, slapping their women crudely across the face, strutting with a vast self-satisfaction through their little world, they contribute a hard and true picture of the unheroic gangster.The audiences yesterday laughed frequently and with gusto as the swaggering Matt and Tom went through their paces, and this rather took the edge off the brutal picture the producers appeared to be trying to serve up. The laughter was loudest and most deserved when the two put a horse \\"on the spot,\\" the reason being that the animal had had the temerity to throw Nails Nathan, the gang leader.There is a reminder of newspaper headlines toward the close when Tom, lying wounded in a hospital, is kidnapped and murdered. The acting throughout is interesting, with the exception of Jean Harlow, who essays the rôle of a gangster's mistress. Beryl Mercer as Tom's mother, Robert Emmett O'Connor as a gang chief, and Donald Cook as Tom's brother, do splendidly.

As we do at the start of most science-fiction films and before the opening credits of every movie released by Universal Pictures, we sail serenely into a dark, make-believe heaven brilliantly lighted by tiny electric lights. This voyage into the cosmos will also become, as the narrator reminds us, a journey toward the inner self.Like the dopey student in \\"National Lampoon's Animal House,\\" who, as he smokes marijuana for the first time, is suddenly aware of the universes contained within the atoms of his own little finger, Mr. Syberberg is not one who quickly dismisses his own insights, whether good, bad, indifferent or second-hand. As Mr. Syberberg is a film maker who shoots on what's called a one-to-one basis — that is, who uses every bit of footage he shoots — he seems to be a poet who's never tossed out a bit of scrap paper on which he's scribbled a rotten line.\\"Our Hitler\\" is a movie that demands to be described in terms that cancel themselves out. It is both too much and too little, too obvious and too muddled, too heavy and too frivolous. The 42-year-old West German director, who appears to have poured his heart and soul into this film, is clearly a passionate man, but he is also woefully undiscriminating when it comes to evaluating his own work.Having seen the 102-minute excerpt from his five-hour television documentary, \\"The Confessions of Winifred Wagner,\\" which was shown at the Film Forum two years ago, I suspect that Mr. Syberberg is a reporter of sensitivity and intelligence as well as of unusual journalistic skills. He is not, however, an especially interesting poet or polemicist. He has an unfortunate gift for seizing on the paradox that doesn't quite balance, for images that say far less than someone else's words he's quoting and for comparisons that are almost comically inopportune.At one point in \\"Our Hitler,\\" he doesn't hesitate to draw a parallel between M-G-M's butchery of Erich Von Stroheim's original 42-reel version of \\"Greed\\" and the Nazi program to exterminate the Jews. To see such a parallel is not only to misuse history, but also to get it slightly wrong. After Mr. Von Stroheim's battles with M-G-M about \\"Greed,\\" the M-G-M butchers hired him back to direct his classic screen version of \\"The Merry Widow.\\"The theme of \\"Our Hitler\\" is not so much the guilt of our parents, but the need for and the dream of Hitler that, he says, continues to live on in all of us. The principal setting of the film is a movie studio, and the film's not-so-impressive secondary theme is the power and meaning of Film itself. Like the very young Jean-Luc Godard, who once said — before he became interested in videotape — \\"Truth is 32 frames a second,\\" Mr. Syberberg has a mystical feeling about Film that I associate with the ravenous interest in the possibilities of movies expressed by Mr. Godard and others in the late 50's and early 60's.In many of its aspects, \\"Our Hitler\\" looks like something out of the early 60's. It seeks to discover new film modes, though it is completely incapable of getting rid of the old, often substituting style for content, though, unlike Mr. Godard, Mr. Syberberg has no spontaneous feeling for style.\\"Our Hitler\\" is a collage film divided into four impressively titled sections — \\"The Grail,\\" \\"A German Dream,\\" \\"The End of a Winter's Tale\\" and \\"We Children of Hell.\\" It is made up of cabaret turns in which actors satirize Hitler, Goebbels, Himmler, Göring and others","excerpt":"of still photographs and newsreel clips, of old radio broadcasts, of songs and dances, of excerpts from \\"Mein Kampf\\" and from the testimony of people who knew Hitler and from concentration-camp victims.This is more or less tied together by Mr. Syberberg's sweepingly generalized vision that has as its ultimate point that Hitler is immortal as long as the earth survives and that, indeed, his programs and policies live on in the Soviet Union, the United States, China, in East and West Germany and in the third world. Using Mr. Syberberg's methods, an equally serious (or unserious) argument can be made to blame Lincoln for the bombing of Cambodia.When one spreads responsibility so broadly, responsibility ceases to exist and becomes, instead, a pardon.\\"Life is a circus,\\" Mr. Syberberg tells us in the first of the several dozen cabaret turns that stud the film, through which a pretty, pensive little girl, Democracy (played by the director's daughter), wanders worriedly, cuddling a toy dog that has a Hitler face, her head draped in long, loose pieces of film stock. Life is also film, he tells us, and makes a case for it as far as Hitler is concerned, suggesting that once World War II got under way, it became an unending newsreel movie for Hitler to watch nightly in his bunker.The set decorations in the studio sometimes evoke Hell, sometimes (with the help of excellent slide projections) Hitler's Chancellory, Berchtesgaden, the streets of Berlin, where the actors do their bits, their feet often obscured in fancily lighted fumes of dry ice. We see Hitler wearing a toga, rising from the tomb of Richard Wagner. We listen to him in the shape of a dummy arguing with his ventriloquist about his successes and failures. This Hitler is no madman. He is the devil in everyone.Several of these turns are as suprising and as stunningly effective as Mr. Syberberg means them to be, especially one in which Heinz Schubert, a veteran of the Berliner Ensemble, appears as Himmler, talking to his masseur about the great weight he carries as the Reich police chief and the awful burden of committing atrocities. Peter Kern also has a fine, spectacular sequence in which he plays Ellerkamp, Hitler's personal projectionist, who went on after the war to become a film distributor.It says something about the form of the movie, though, and about Mr. Syberberg's mastery of it, that the most riveting sequences are those that recall the texts of \\"Mein Kampf\\" and the memoirs of real people, like Hitler's valet, who reveals, among other things, that Hitler's breakfast consisted of two cups of warm milk, eight biscuits and the broken-up pieces of a bar of bitter chocolate. Hitler wore short underpants, no undershirt and, at night, a plain linen nightshirt. Fuzzy abstractions are no match for specific details.Fact keeps overwhelming Mr. Syberberg's poetic insights. They also trivialize his many film references to such things as Mélies, \\"M,\\" \\"Citizen Kane\\" and Eisenstein. A \\"quote\\" from \\"The Great Dictator,\\" with an actor imitating Charlie Chaplin imitating Hitler, distances us from reality too far to serve even a Brechtian point. It simply focuses our attention on the director and on what appears to be his limited imagination. The bits and pieces of verbatim concentration-camp stories we hear have the effect of making everything that has come before and after seem less substantial than the dry-ice fumes.More revealing of the film are the extended passages in which Mr. Syberberg has an actor read very, very long passages from the research material gathered for the film. I can't be sure if the trouble is in the original text or in the subtitles, but what we hear is a string of platitudes that eventually cover the movie with verbal sludge.\\"Our Hitler,\\" which was given its New York premiere at Lincoln Center on Sunday, will receive three showings at Hunter College, Saturday and Jan. 26 and 27, all at 2:30 P.M.While watching the film Sunday night, it occurred to me that it really may not be fair to insist on looking at it in one long sitting, with only a 90-minute intermission. The film was meant to be seen in segments on television. Yet I suspect this marathon viewing probably helps it more than hurts it, making it seem more monumental than it might if caught in shorter takes. \\"Our Hitler\\" is an ambitious undertaking, but it slides recklessly over the surface of matters of profound importance.
