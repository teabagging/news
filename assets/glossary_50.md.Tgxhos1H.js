No such breathless excitement as marked that historic occasion may have been perceptible last evening in the Rivoli Theatre, where Mr. Heifetz made his screen debut, by courtesy of Samuel Goldwyn, in \\"They Shall Have Music.\\" It was a hot night (for everybody), and Mr. Heifetz is past being \\"discovered.\\" But the occasion had its historic aspects and was the source of considerable delight.When Mr. Goldwyn announced two years ago that he had obtained the consent of the great violinist to appear in a motion picture, the obvious question asked by every one was \\"What will Heifetz do?\\" That problem was likewise of some apparent annoyance to Mr. Goldwyn, too, for he was more than a year finding a story to suit the talents of his renowned artist. The question was answered last evening: Mr. Heifetz plays the violin, that's all. He plays it rapturously, and with surpassing brilliance—such a quality and abundance of magnificent fiddling as has never before been heard from a screen.Perhaps a critic of music might better remark upon its excellence. Suffice it for a journeyman of the films to comment enthusiastically that the crystal purity of Mr. Heifetz's playing, the eloquent flow of melody from his violin and the dramatic presentation of the artist commanding his instrument—close-ups of his graceful fingers upon the strings, of the majestic sweep of his bowing arm and brilliant angle-shots of the man before an orchestra—create an effect of transce dent beauty which is close to unique in this medium.The story? It is sufficient to support the ethereal grace of the music and little more. It is a sentimental tale of an underprivileged boy who falls in love with music, is driven from his squalid home because of it, lands in a modest musical foundation where a lovable old maestro enkindles the souls of youngsters with the magic of melody and eventually saves the school from evil creditors by persuading Heifetz to come there and give a concert. It is the sort of story which is known as a \\"tear-jerker\\"—a direct assault upon the soft spots in all doting parents and elder folk. It is made more so by music, and will probably be very popular.A good cast of actors supports Mr. Heifetz, who is woefully deficient in the few brief excursions he makes in that department. (Just enough to keep the story together.) Gene Reynolds, as the boy who makes good, carries the heaviest role commendably, if one excuses the tearful moments. And especial mention must be made of the Peter Mememblum California Junior Symphony Orchestra, which accompanies Mr. Heifetz in one number. It is the grandest appeal for musical education in the picture. It—and, of course, Mr. Heifetz.

Recordings in Review","excerpt":"JAZZ"},{"year":"1994","title":"On a Winding Trail With a Young Jazzman  Iridium   The saxophonist Ravi Coltrane, who is performing at Iridium (44 West 63d Street, Manhattan) through Sunday, has been circling jazz's center stage as a sideman for several years now, working with Elvin Jones, Steve Coleman, David Murray, Rashid Ali and occasionally his own groups. It's easy to hear why he's so popular. At 28, Mr. Coltrane is rapidly acquiring a distinctive voice, with a thoughtfulness that sometimes eludes more experienced musicians.   His set on Tuesday night showed him to be an improviser who, in his reticence, forces a listener to follow him. At first he sounded almost timid. But after a few minutes it became clear his improvisations were loaded with turnbacks, repetitions, asides and afterthoughts, as if he were having a conversation with himself. He broke his solos into fragments, short bursts that were always self-referential and oddly balanced. Where jazz instrumentalists often seek a linear flow, Mr. Coltrane's solos were occasionally still, as if he were building a static monument out of ideas, repeated, examined, turned over, turned sideways and then added to a pile of previously used motifs.   He can burn, too. Backed by Billy Childs on piano, Calvin Jones on bass and Cindy Blackman on drums, Mr. Coltrane, on up-tempo tunes, draped harmony over harmony, compressing dense phrases into small spaces. He has the gift of ease and even ideas that should have been unmanageably dissonant, or pitches that sailed way off the mark, floated back into his schema. Mr. Coltrane hasn't yet figured out how to use dynamics, or articulate all his ideas. And he doesn't have a group conception, at least on the evidence of this one set. But he has promise, intelligence and individuality, which is more than half the battle.

Friday's triple bill began with the fierce, forthright hard bop of the trumpeter Jerry Gonzalez and the Fort Apache Band. The sextet looked back to mid-1960's Freddie Hubbard and Miles Davis, playing pensive ballads or aggressive modal jazz, featuring Larry Willis on piano and Joe Ford's melodic, incisive alto and soprano saxophone solos.

In a final blues, Mr. Redman played down-home phrases as Ms. Allen stayed restless and abstract.

And it is a small segment of that glory that is crystallized in \\"Jericho,\\" the Gallic importation which began a stand at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse on Saturday. For the film drama, reportedly based on a true but apparently unpublicized incident in the war, speaks simply yet eloquently, tonelessly yet with passion, of why men are willing to die and why barbarism, be it Nazi or any other variety, is not now part of our civilization.According to a spokesman for the distributor, the unidentified scene of \\"Jericho\\" is Amiens. It is there, in June 1944, that the jittery German garrison, sensing the imminent Allied landings, is being harassed by the Maquis in collaboration with the RAF. To protect a trainload of precious gasoline, the commandant orders the imprisonment of fifty hostages. Maqui leaders, wrestling with the problem, decide, nevertheless, to bomb the vital fuel train, but also inform the British of the impending doom of the innocent hostages. The RAF answers the call with \\"Operation Jericho,\\" a mission calling for bombers to breach the walls of the Jail before the execution of the prisoners. The bombing and subsequent escape, despite its story-book trappings, is as realistic as the sincere and imbued characterizations of the cast.Among these count Pierre Brasseur's superb delineation of a whining collaborationist, imprisoned with the others, who exhorts them to capitulate to their captors","excerpt":"Jean Brochard, as a sensitive and intelligent doctor, who confesses shamefully to a priest, while awaiting execution, his terrible hatred of and wish for revenge on the Nazis; a crippled beggar, played by Larquey, happy in the knowledge that he has found real friends among his doomed and steadfast companions; the mayor and his council, who submit themselves as hostages; the printer, who very soberly states he is not afraid to die because he knows what he is dying for, and the many unidentified actors, who might very easily pass for the tired, industrious, happy or sad citizens of beleaguered Amiens.While the editing and pace of Henri Calef's direction are a bit uneven, the scenario by Claude Heymann and Charles Spaak (the latter wrote such noted French scripts as \\"Grand Illusion\\" and \\"Carnival in Flanders\\") affords the players the pithy dialogue of life itself. And despite its extravagant climax and its generally grim quality, \\"Jericho\\" is exultant drama in the truly fine, French tradition.

Review/Film","excerpt":"Jean Gabin In 'Les Miz,' In French"},{"year":"1960","title":"Rue de Paris Screen: 'Rue de Paris'","excerpt":"Jean Gabin Stars in Film at 2 Houses"},{"year":"1959","title":"A FEW skeletons in the closets of a fictional \\"first family of France\\" are given a perfunctory rattling in \\"The Possessors,\\" a dignified French film, directed by Denys De La Patelliere, which came to the Paris on Monday.Like the characters with whom it is dealing, it is impressively rich—rich in settings, décor, the women's wardrobes and particularly rich in its cast. It has Jean Gabin in the main role as the head of a powerful family, which he runs with the tight-lipped assurance of a Commander of the Legion of Honor and a vice president of the World Bank.As his fat and licentious nephew, it has bearded Pierre Brasseur, and as his canny and loyal lieutenant, there is bald Bernard Blier. His weak, simpering son is Jean Desailly and Françoise Christophe is the latter's stylish wife. There are numerous other ladies and gentlemen in rich and comfortable roles.But, unfortunately, the script by Michel Audiard and M. De La Patelliere, based on the old Goncourt Prize novel (1948). \\"Les Grandes Familles,\\" by Maurice Druon, is not nearly well-heeled and substantial as the characters appear to be. It is a rather anemic presentation of the thesis that it's hellish to be rich.Dynast Gabin has his troubles. That nephew is a cool, conniving rogue who wants to steal as much of the fortune of the family as he possibly can. There's a niece who has got herself pregnant and has to be married to a convenient man. And then that son, he's a bumbler and an idiot who just won't cast himself in the image of his dad.But even with these annoying problems, the script compels M. Cabin to plow his way through with conversation and maintain a dignified deadpan. There are three or four scenes that have some tension—when papa coldly chides his peevish son and when he elegantly gives that nasty nephew the back of his stiff financial hand. However, the only graphic action is in some heavy trading on the Paris Bourse and, at the end, when everybody runs to son's room, from which they have heard a shot.It's a somewhat static set of complications and this is probably how a family would behave with all sorts of too-much-money problems, but that's the trouble—too static. Also too much French dialogue.To augment these problems at the Paris, there is a twenty-eight-minute animated cartoon on the bill that is so completely esoteric that it will probably leave everyone dazed. It is called \\"The Little Island\\" and it somehow has to do with three characters who consider themselves symbols of Truth, Beauty and Good. The fact that Richard Williams of England spent an evident lot of money on it and a lot of brilliant animation leaves you hope that he, at least, understood.

For whatever emotional impact this tortured psychological drama may have possessed before the public's guardians had at it has been manifestly impaired by the most tantalizing interruptions, cuts of critical scenes and a consequent series of blank transitions which leave one groping desperately for the thread.Mind you, we don't know what this film was before its expurgation, but now it is little more than a vague and passionless suggestion of the conflicts a husband and wife go through when their marriage has been frustrated by a tragic accident. Scenes which obviously should have emphasized the intensity of these conflicts have been sheared away in chunks, and that which is left does little more than state the situation by innuendo. Furthermore, the style of the film is extremely \\"arty\\"—many shots of whirling waters, trick dissolves and odd reflections—which is, under the circumstances, just pretentious.And under the circumstances, too, it is difficult to judge the performances. Jeanne Boitel appears to be a sincere and devoted wife of an extraordinarily passionate disposition","excerpt":"Jean Galland is a grim and pathetic husband.

Later, when he is practically forced into a responsible post by a manufacturer of farm implements (Giovanni Barella) whose lost portfolio he has returned, he vainly tries to sabotage the job, but, of course, the whole thing results in his being converted to the gospel of useful work.Maria Denis, as the business-like daughter of the manufacturer, is as easy on the eyes as ever, and the other girls in the cast—Silvana Jachino, Clara Padoa and Celia Matania—are attractive.

Birdie his sister, is in love with Eddie Lesser, a struggling song writer much to the distress of Morris, who continually tries to improve his family to the level of the wealthy Kahns whose daughter he wishes to marry.Birdie disregards her brother's admonitions and marries Eddie, who is at the same time apprehended for his part in a jewel robbery. The resultant notoriety dampens the prestige of Morris and he sends his sister from his home as punishment. Pining for his daughter, Goldfish leaves his son's roof after he had been called a servant in the presence of the Kahns. A family reconciliation is effected and Pa Goldfish dies happily after learning that he is a grandfather.The film, which has a sound accompaniment, also has several dialogue sequences which did not add to the story. In several of the talking scenes there were long, unnecessary pauses between the word passages.Lina Basquette is engaging in the part of Birdie, the \\"un-social\\" sister whose impudence so distresses Ricardo Cortez, the successful son. Hersholt is genuine enough despite the fact that his accent in the talking scenes is of the German stage comedian rather than the Yiddish patois.Other Photoplays.\\"Noah's Ark,\\" a Warner Brothers' Vitaphone production, with Dolores Costello, opens at the Winter Garden tomorrow night. \\"The Singing Fool,\\" with Al Jolson, will be moved from that theatre to the Sam H.

Perhaps Mr. Wright who is the ill-fated hero of this screen transcription, which began a stand at the Criterion on Saturday, is less of an actor than he is a novelist and playwright.Obviously, his cast does not, by and large, attain the stature of his glowing words and thoughts. For their speeches merely relate this story of a sensitive Negro's revolt against social maladjustment and bigotry without depth and true feeling. And its murder melodramatics are muscular and only occasionally professional.Since Mr. Wright fashioned mightily once, it is not odious to compare this present version of \\"Native Son\\" with those that preceded it. He is following the general blueprint laid down in the novel and the play. His Bigger Thomas is a man with dreams but these are dreams that are anchored to Chicago's \\"black belt,\\" an area where one does the kind of \\"work that is marked out for him.\\"Psychologically he is a man in revolt against the brutal exploitation of the white man, but that psychological basis for his subsequent actions is never made explicit by deed or nuance. It is simply told. He attempts to engineer a stick-up and desists because he is afraid. Bigger and his cohorts let the viewer know this in a sentence and some amateurish play acting.Although he eventually finds a tragic surcease in man-made death, his bewilderment and the motivations for his crimes are never made completely lucid. He is still a frightened youth who accidentally smothers his employer's comely daughter and then, in his panic, tries to cover up the horrible deed because \\"all my life I heard of black men being killed because of white girls.\\"The patsy he chooses in his terror is the boy friend of the deceased girl, a man who in the book was definitely leftist but now is vaguely referred to as a labor leader. But in all fairness it must be said that Mr. Wright is not confused about him. He is no bigot and a man who honestly wants to help the Negroes. As in the book, Bigger attempts to collect ransom for the supposedly missing heiress and later, when the murder is revealed by reporters—the long arm of coincidence is stretched considerably here—he flees into hiding with his singer-girl friend. And he kills her too, under the mistaken suspicion that she has led the police to his sanctuary.Pierre Chenal, who has directed some noteworthy films in France and has worked in South America, has turned in a lackluster effort despite the fact that the offering was shot in such unusual locales as Buenos Aires and Chicago. Although the physical face of the Argentine city is not visible, the \\"city of the big shoulders\\" shows a few seamy views of itself in South Side slum areas. Mr. Chenal's direction is, with one or two exceptions, pedestrian. He has gotten some life into the climactic chase for the harried Bigger over tenement roofs, and, in the scene where Bigger's mother prays in church for her errant son, there is a glimmer of genuine anguish.Bigger Thomas is a man freighted by fears, hates and ignorance. But Richard Wright's portrayal is a surface one. He is a frightened fugitive finally forced to fight for his life but little else. As his girl friend, Gloria Madison, a newcomer, does a song, \\"The Dreaming Kind,\\" which does not make her performance memorable. But she does have a moment or two of fervent emotion in pleading with her lover against the course he has taken.Jean Wallace is simply blonde and beautiful in the brief role of the victim","excerpt":"Jean Michael is perfunctory as the labor leader; Don Dean, who plays Bigger's lawyer, is never clearly revealed in court as the liberal he was in the book and play. The rest of the cast, including Nicholas Joy and Ruth Roberts, as the parents of the heiress, illustrate the opinion of one of the reporters, who in referring to the crime says, \\"it's the work of amateurs.\\" The stature of \\"Native Son' has been reduced with this exposure of film.

Mr. Lelouch has re-imagined Hugo's Jean Valjean as an illiterate French boxer named Fortin, enlisting Jean-Paul Belmondo to give this  conceit something more than mere literary cachet. Fortin is meant to come gradually to an understanding of Hugo's masterwork, which he enjoys having read to him. \\"Tell me about Jean Valjean,\\" he says on several occasions. \\"People always say I'm like him.\\"         Indeed they do, throughout this personal and sometimes highly arbitrary meditation on the essence of Hugo's story. Parallels between Fortin, whose acts  of heroism occur during World War II in occupied France, and the bravery of Jean Valjean are remarked upon often, just as many of this film's other characters are equated with their counterparts in Hugo's novel. Eventually someone even asks: \\"Why do you compare everything to 'Les Miserables?' It's weird.\\" Not even  by stating that explicitly does Mr. Lelouch dispel the idea that the questioner  has a point.

He was that little boy on the train. And when he decided to adapt Victor Hugo's great novel of the 19th century to a modern era, he could still hear his mother, Eugenie, telling him that his father, Simon, was Jean Valjean, she was Fantine and he was Cosette. At the time, he recalled, it seemed like a game. But he also got it: the new \\"miserables\\" were the Jews.

The Lion of Flanders looks like the tamest, friendliest jungle beast this side of Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey. If it weren't for his nose, which meanders, you would take him for a stonecutter specializing in religious statuary rather than a professional fist fighter who glories in the title of heavyweight champion of Belgium, and the fact is he is both. As a stonecutter he lives and works in the Flemish town of Izegem with his wife, Eliane, their son, Joel, and daughters, Josephine and Eveline. As a prize fighter he is here to earn about $100,000 by impersonating a challenger for Muhammad Ali's world championship. He assumes that role tomorrow night when Ali makes his 14th defense of the title he has won twice. Not that the title needs defending here and now, but it is a way for Ali to pick up another million dollars and help CBS sell some shaving cream.

Review/Theater","excerpt":"Jeanette and Nelson, Together Again"},{"year":"1957","title":"DIRECTOR Claude Autant-Lara and his scenarists, Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost, obviously men of many artistic moods, exhibit several of these in tough serio-comic style in \\"Four Bags Full,\\" the French feature which opened at the Fifty-second Street Trans-Lux yesterday.The import, a melodrama dealing with the furtive journey of a couple of black-market messengers across occupied Paris, also manages to dissect human frailties while garnering a few laughs en route. Although the trip, the script and the principals become a mite confused occasionally, it is, nevertheless, a spellbinding junket most of the way.Our film-making team, known here chiefly for their sensitive treatment of aspects of amour in that fine Gallic drama \\"Devil in the Flesh,\\" are neither delicate nor oblique in their approach to their current subject. They are treating in harsh, often black-and-white fashion, of people caught in a world they never made, who are struggling in it as best they can. M. Autant-Lara and his associates have as their heroes a simple ex-cab driver, who is involved in the black market because he has to exist, and a cynical but successful artist, who is accidentally caught up in the sordid business and follows through out of curiosity.Their assignment, as has been indicated, is to lug four valises filled with the carcass of a newly butchered hog from one black marketeer to another. M. Autant-Lara is, as we were saying, not merely concerned with adventure here.During the journey, the artist has occasion to lash out at black marketeers and berate the meanness of a bourgeois bistro owner, who is ready to turn them over to the police. In so doing, he appears to be castigating all those Frenchmen who engaged in unsavory practices while France chaffed under the heel of the Nazi oppressor.The ex-cabbie, on the other hand, is not concerned with the subtleties of life. He is, one gathers, involved in this hazardous calling because he not only must live but also is in love with his wife and is doing all this mainly because of her. Although he appears to be a woebegone and terrified little man, he maintains his dignity. At the climax, when the war is over and the cabbie, now a porter in a Paris railroad station, is recognized by the artist, he is resigned to his job but still a dignified gent. \\"I'm still carrying other people's suitcases,\\" he says.As the ex-cabbie, Bourvil turns in a superb job of a little man caught in a web of circumstances far beyond his ken. It is a sharply-drawn portrait in which shrugs and grimaces as well as a neatly delivered dialogue add up to a truly terrified and confused citizen. M. Bourvil appears to deserve the acting award he won for this performance at last year's Venice Film Festival.Jean Gabin's characterization of the artist is no less professional. As the dilettante embroiled in a strange adventure, he seems to be enjoying every minute of it as he cajoles his companion, badgers the black marketeers or softsoaps a Nazi commandant. Louis de Funes adds a humorous contribution as an explosive black marketeer","excerpt":"Jeanette Batti is appealing as Bourvil's wife, and a score of other players pitch in authentic bits as various Parisian types.Although M. Autant-Lara's theme sometimes is as murky as the blacked-out capital, he has, nevertheless, kept his cast and story moving at a fast clip. More important, he also has taken the trouble to look into the hearts and minds of his principals to make \\"Four Bags Full\\" unusual and interesting.

But she inspired trust -- just grab a few pinfeathers and go along for the ride. An analogous faith was necessary to enter the fraught worlds of several mysterious women in a program of Ms. Durning's choreography five years earlier. And her 1996 ''Solo With Armour'' had a similarly enticing inscrutability. Ms. Durning's new multimedia ''out of the kennel into a home'' (above) -- with music by Jules Maxwell, text by Keith Reddin and video by Jason Akira Somma -- sounds like her latest exploration of unchartable provinces of the mind and heart. This evening-long piece, inspired by the memoirs of escape artists and prisoners, burrows into the nature of mental and physical confinement. It takes the theme literally enough to push off the stage and into the street and a truck that is parked there. One of the great pleasures of Ms. Durning's dances is her own faith in the power of unassuming emotionally (and physically) propulsive movement to express quite complex notions. She has performed with David Dorfman and Lance Gries, two modern-dance choreographers who understand how powerfully eloquent pure movement can be. Ms. Durning adds a distinctively female lack of adornment to the mix, in dances that have grown steadily more authoritative and thought-provoking over the 15 years she has been at it. The latest dance looks like quite a departure from the past, but it is hard to imagine that her distinctive, if quiet, voice will not come through. (Ms. Durning and her dancers will perform Wednesday through Oct. 1 at 7:30 p.m. at Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077.)

MUSIC NOTES"},{"year":"1959","title":"IN direct contrast to the forthright, head-on brilliance of \\"Rififi\\" is another French gangster film called \\"Grisbi,\\" starring Jean Gabin. Saturday's import, at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse, was made first and reportedly was a huge success in the home country five years ago. On this side of the water, it's going to be every customer for himself.For here is an odd number indeed—odd, even exasperating, yet curiously fascinating to watch, with an impact all its own. Quite the most beguiling aspect of this United Motion Pictures release, whose idiomatic label means \\"loot,\\" is a distinctly conveyed suggestion, especially during the first half, that customers who don't like it can jolly well get up and go home.Those who want \\"in\\" from the beginning are hereby warned: You'll have to sit tight for nearly thirty minutes wondering what the devil the picture is all about, or getting at.It's about two gangster factions, one headed by M. Gabin, stealthily moving toward a showdown over a hidden \\"grisbi,\\" some 50,000,000 francs worth. As adapted by director Jacques Becker, Maurice Griffe and Albert Simonin from a novel by M. Simonin. Robert Dorfman's production deceptively seems to be taking its time. With clinical detachment, M. Becker introduces the rival underworldlings, their various paramours and hangers-on, all of them ambling around casually in a sordid night-club orbit.As the plot begins to move crabwise toward—well, something—the impatient spectator is in for even more bafflement. In a curious kind of verbal shorthand, the characters are making a lot of fragmentary references to past incidents and each other. Furthermore, their cryptic jargon is translated in a set of English titles that can only be called bubble-gum Americanese. We'll forgive the teasing but not the titles. (\\"Hop in your buggy and come over here,\\" is one pearl. M. Gabin yells at the most crucial moment of all, \\"Gimme a hand, darn it . . . the dough!\\" Fooey—and that's ours.)It becomes just as obvious that M. Becker's hand is firmly on the throttle, and has been all along, when the action slips into high gear—and we mean high—for the climax. In this scene, part Wild West chase and part St. Valentine's Day Massacre, three cars of thugs careen over the countryside in a bloody mop-up as thrilling as it is absurd. A few scenes later the entire picture has clicked into place.The acting is consistently good. M. Gabin is, of course, an old hand at bland toughness. Rene Dary and Paul Frankeur, as two colleagues","excerpt":"Jeanne Moreau and Dora Doll, as two unlucky ladies, and Lino Ventura and Denise Clair, among others, are sordidly convincing. Needless to say, the theme is less than exalted; in scope and human interest, \\"Rififi\\" is way ahead of it.\\"Grisbi\\" may be an oddball from, overseas. But anyone who meets it halfway, shouldn't feel cheated.

But director Mauro Bolognini, who takes us on this underprivileged natives' tour of the Eternal City, has transformed it into a poignant and memorable journey. He is deeply concerned with Rome's rootless, inexperienced youth and he transmits their plight with understanding, clarity and compassion. And, the attention he appears to be receiving as one of Italy's highly regarded young film craftsmen is justified, judging by this sensitive work.Signor Bolognini, is not, of course, solely responsible for this realistic, if, occasionally, introspective achievement. Working with producer Paul Graetz (\\"Devil in the Flesh,\\" \\"God Needs Men,\\" etc.), author Alberto Moravia (\\"Two Women\\") and an obviously responsive cast, he has come up with a harsh but striking study that seems closer to truth than fiction.The scenarists, who used two stories by Signor Moravia and originally titled their script, \\"Una Giornata Balorda\\" (\\"A Strange Day\\"), and Signor Bolognini, filming in a teeming tenement courtyard in Rome's Via Tiburtina, as well as other actual Roman locales, have given their drama not only vivid backgrounds but also the sharp impact of realism. Essentially, \\"Roman Balcony\\" is the story of a 20-year-old youth's one-day search for a job that would spell security and decency for himself, the teenager he has not been able to marry and their three-week-old son.Essentials, however, are not the simple goals Signor Bolognini and his associates are seeking. As a stylist, the director and Aldo Scavarda, his camera man, have captured with telling effect, the cacophonous, sleazy atmosphere of a Roman tenement festooned with clotheslines, its hawkers and its hundreds of inmates, both old and young, caged together in desperate co-existence. They have caught also glimpses of privileged gentry on the beach and in a sumptuous villa, the verdant countryside and the throbbing, dispassionate life of commercial Rome as counterpoint to drabness.One might wonder if our jobless, hapless hero's day is not filled with an overabundance of amour, unusual even for a young, virile but impecunious Roman. But these amorous jousts are in context with the film's theme. In the course of the youngster's striving he is exposed to degradation, as well as temptation and he struggles against the former but accepts love with equanimity, which seems to be in keeping with the drives of a basically well-meaning young man.His disillusionments are illustrated by an uncle operating on the wrong side of respectability, who sends him to a lawyer whose connections are eqally dubious. He encounters a former Ifame, who is en route to this conselor's apartment for the oldest of reasons. The youngsters rekindle the flame for a moment and embarrass the lawyer into arranging a job for the boy. Here, again, he is given little hope. The rich are just as cynical as the hardened poor. Both the wealthy employer, who makes his money from adulterated olive oil, and his wealthy mistress, who finds some moments of love with our youth, offer little permanency. It is only by stealing a ring from a dead man's finger that—in a final irony—he is able to look forward to the promise of stability and happiness.Jean Sorel is a sturdy, believable youngster confused and buffeted by circumstances against which he cannot quite compete. His restrained performance strongly illustrates the problem of the willing but untrained youth to find a place in society. Lea Massari, as the mistress","excerpt":"Jeanne Valerie, as M. Sorel's sullied, erstwhile girl friend; Valerie Ciangottini, as the loving, patient girl he wants to marry; Marcella Valeri, as her roughhewn mother; Isabella Corey, as a put-upon, weary prostitute and Paolo Stoppa, as the conniving lawyer, add to the distinction of this clear, cynical but understanding observation of unfashionable Rome. And, the English subtitles catch a good deal, if not all, of the pungency and bite of its colloquialisms.

Couples, the sort who have all supposedly fled New York, are swinging their attache cases, holding hands and debating at what point a yacht becomes vulgar. Teen-agers are searching their souls, as they do when they get near a body of water at that age. Skaters are out for one last roll.   No one is looking over his shoulder.   New York City, that old hypochondriac, may be dying again, but the angels are not descending quite yet. Here, night or day, the salt in the air induces a euphoria that makes a New Yorker want to toast the future.   There are enough bars in and near Battery Park City to keep a pub crawler going from noon to midnight. Each comes into its own at a different hour. Each offers a different perspective on the Hudson River and New York Harbor.   And each quickly reminds the reluctant New Yorker that he or she, like New York, will more than likely still be here next year. Edward Moran Bar And Grill      4 World Financial Center, Street Level, 250 Vesey Street, (212) 945-2255.     Edward Moran Bar and Grill comes to a rolling boil at 6 or 7 P.M. on Friday. No directions are needed. Follow the roar.   At this hour, Moran's, where families eat hamburgers on Sunday afternoons, turns into Fort Lauderdale at spring break. The baby bankers of Wall Street are here for one last rally. Coy hair flips, and posing -- the process known as the perpetuation of the species -- will keep the place going until long after dark.   \\"I'm supposed to meet a guy who's medium height, dark hair, in his 20's,\\" a panicked woman with very pink nails and a drink to match was heard telling a security guard.   \\"He's probably here.\\"   He probably is. Peter Higgins, the owner and manager of the restaurant, says several thousand people show up on a typical Friday, a majority of them medium-height, dark-haired men in their 20's, in limp button-down shirts with collars unfastened.   For the sake of mood, the security guards wear polo shirts, and the bartenders act as if they have worked as traders on the commodities exchange.   \\"Come on! Talk to me!\\"   One has to be fast to close a deal here. The bulls order beer, and lots of it. The bears seem partial to something red called a Cape Codder.   As evening deepens, the crowd becomes louder. The sun sets on Moran's in the most flattering way, throwing golden light on everybody until, speech slurred and steps unsure, they weave their way under the palm trees in the Winter Garden and catch subway trains back to their studio apartments.

Many New Yorkers are disinclined to visit the Hors d'Oeuvrerie, the 107th-floor bar adjoining Windows on the World, for fear of mingling with tourists. They should get over it.   \\"The elevator will be here in four minutes,\\" announced the maitre d'hotel in the lobby. Pass the oxygen masks.   The Hors d'Oeuvrerie and Windows on the World are decorated in a style that had its moment at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair.   It has now come full circle from high Futurism to even higher camp. The only really suitable attire here (no sneakers, jeans or shorts allowed) would be early Cardin or Courreges.   Because every bar needs a few asteroids, there is a hall of mirrors lined with huge mineral specimens. There are also amoeboid leather-lined niches, molded chairs that defy gravity, and a palette out of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon.   Eventually one stops gaping at the decor and actually looks out the window, with amazement. The Hors d'Oeuvrerie has a view to the south and east, with that unique Dr. Caligari perspective.   The waiters collect a $3.50 cover charge and let patrons have even one long, slow drink in peace.   For that, one also gets the Judd Woldin Trio -- its motto is \\"Dance, glance and listen\\" -- playing standards beneath a mural of an Italian Line ship that hasn't visited New York in decades. Pipeline      2 World Financial Center, Street Level, 225 Liberty Street, (212) 945-2755.     The staff members at Pipeline, students of the downtown scowl and the occasional shave, perpetually seem to be getting over a long, hard night. Don't get in their way.   But for a deconstructed beer, this is the place to go, preferably in spandex and on roller blades. The designer Sam Lopata's decor for this bar and restaurant is Early Refinery: pipes, more pipes and lots of safety yellow paint. The music is loud, and the concrete and metal surfaces make it louder.   The terrace is much quieter, with a view of the Hudson, the sunset and the yachts that lounge in the North Cove marina. Do not be put off by the uncomfortable-looking metal chairs. They may be the most comfortable chairs in any restaurant in the neighborhood.   Do expect to be asked frequently to order the next round. And do visit the restroom, which is unisex. Men and women share the chiquest slop sinks in Manhattan. The Hudson River Club      4 World Financial Center, Bridge Level, 250 Vesey Street, (212) 786-1500.     At most restaurants, the bar is at the front, a catchall for diners awaiting tables. At the Hudson River Club, it is at the back, a catchall for people lucky enough to know it is there.   It is there, all snug and woody and green, all sailing prints and ship models, and one could easily convince oneself that this is Newport Beach, Calif.   There is a second-floor view across the yachts in North Cove -- Impetuous, Precious Moments, catamarans that look like huge mosquitoes -- all the way downriver to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.   Fresh potato chips from the kitchen and other snacks were provided by the bartender, who let patrons linger over a single glass. A pianist kept the mood fizzy.   The perpetual candlelight here is a pleasant way to extend a late-night stroll on the Esplanade. Do not, however, arrive dressed too casually","excerpt":"jeans, even worn with an Armani jacket, do not please this maitre d'hotel. Le Pactole      2 World Financial Center, Bridge Level, 225 Liberty Street, (212) 945-9444.     So much for the America's Cup crowd. At Le Pactole, the waiters wear black tie, and the windows seem to wear Oscar de la Renta. Le Pactole is grand, so grand that one may feel silly unless what one has to say lives up to the setting.   The bar is oval, with superb people-viewing possibilities; the huge windows overlooking the Hudson are lined with deep, slouchy tub chairs that Josef Hoffman might have designed, and the windows wear evening dresses made of gauzy white fabric.   But those draperies, usually lowered against the western sun and the glare off the river, do cast an attractive glow over everyone and everything. Indeed, the best time at Le Pactole is sunset, when an orange fireball drops behind the Colgate clock in Jersey City, making it the most romantic tube of toothpaste in the world. Steamers Landing      On the Esplanade, between Liberty and Albany Streets, (212) 432-1451.     Late on weekend afternoons, a procession of cruise ships glides down the Hudson. One cannot get much closer than Steamers Landing: two small sheltered patios attached to a bar and restaurant, the only one on the Esplanade proper. Here one can raise a glass of Champagne to all those bound for Bermuda. One can also watch the crowd go by without being part of it.   On a recent Saturday afternoon, couples were here poring over floor plans for condominiums in Battery Park City. One supposes they were engaged in that rite of spring: wondering where the breakfront might go if they exchanged that Tudor in Bergen County for a crackerbox on the Hudson.   Time a visit to Steamers to coincide with a sailing of the Queen Elizabeth 2, especially one at night. Even the most jaded New Yorkers hurry to the Esplanade railing to watch nearly 1,000 feet of ship glide downriver in the long, long wake of the Mauretania, the Normandie and the Queen Mary. Amazon Village      Pier 25, West Side Highway at North Moore Street; (212) 227-2900.     The palm trees swaying on Pier 25 -- a 10-minute walk north of Battery Park City, just south of the prison barge -- belong to a new bar and restaurant called Amazon Village. They will sway there only until Oct. 15, when they will be dug up, potted and sent to hotel lobbies for the winter.   Club Med, meet Hawaii Kai. Amazon Village includes a bar called Python, a volleyball court, a beach, a lifeguard, a cage filled with parrots and valet parking.   \\"We didn't need so much sand,\\" said a modest Shimon Bokovza, the restaurateur who opened the club last weekend with his brother, Koby, and Michael Buchsbaum. Shimon Bokovza has experience with sand. He has another Amazon Village in Philadelphia, which is closed this summer while he nearly doubles its size.   This Amazon Village, which he called much more \\"conceptually developed,\\" is a tribute to the rain forest, which he called \\"the last frontier, the last place left as God created it.\\"   So there is a Rain Forest Bar. There is a rain forest mural. Pennies pitched into the fountain are to be donated to the Rainforest Alliance.   Mr. Bokovza has never been to Brazil. That concept is still being developed.

East title. The last four Super Bowl losers finished the next season below .500, but that will not happen to Philadelphia. The Cowboys and the Giants should be improved, but unless Terrell Owens misbehaves himself into a season-ending suspension, the Eagles will be difficult to dethrone.    1 Philadelphia (13-3)  STRENGTHS -- Even if they do not like each other, Donovan McNabb and Owens remain an explosive passing combination. Safety Brian Dawkins leads an outstanding secondary, and the cornerbacks' ability to cover one on one enables the Eagles to blitz with abandon. Coach Andy Reid has established a standard of excellence. Anything less than a Super Bowl victory would be disappointing.  WEAKNESSES -- The contract disputes of Owens and running back Brian Westbrook, and the team's decision to allow defensive tackle Corey Simon to get away, threaten team unity like never before. McNabb lost one of his favorite targets, Todd Pinkston, to a season-ending injury (torn Achilles' tendon). The Eagles lack a power runner to pick up tough yardage inside. Their two-minute offense sometimes looks disorganized.  OUTLOOK -- This team remains the conference favorite and should win at least 10 games almost by simply showing up. The offense, defense and special teams are solid, and the Eagles have enough depth to cover for almost any injury -- except to McNabb or Owens. The N.F.C.'s road to the Super Bowl goes through Philadelphia.    2 Dallas (6-10)  STRENGTHS -- Running back Julius Jones could have a breakout season as the featured back in Coach Bill Parcells's run-based offense. Tight end Jason Witten is a reliable target for quarterback Drew Bledsoe, and strong safety Roy Williams is a fierce tackler who can intimidate receivers. When the Cowboys stay in games until the fourth quarter, Parcells has proven he is still a master at conjuring a victory.  WEAKNESSES -- This team had a weak pass rush last year and yielded 405 points, uncharacteristic for a Parcells team. There will be many new starters on defense, but if the pass rush does not improve, a suspect secondary could be exposed, bringing a scowl to Parcells's face.  OUTLOOK -- The Cowboys will be better, but how much? Bledsoe has a great arm but the mobility of an oak tree. He will excel only if given time to throw. The switch to a 3-4 defense should suit their roster. The Cowboys play three of their first four games on the road, followed by a home game against the Eagles. If they start no worse than 2-3, they should make the playoffs.    3 Giants (6-10)  STRENGTHS -- Tiki Barber is a superb all-purpose back, and defensive end Michael Strahan appears determined to prove he remains an impact player. Tight end Jeremy Shockey has the kind of downfield speed not often seen at his position. Amani Toomer and Plaxico Burress make an intriguing combination at wide receiver. The Giants also have a solid secondary.  WEAKNESSES -- The offense must improve. The Giants scored fewer than 20 points in 9 of 16 games last season, and the offensive line yielded 52 sacks. Quarterback Eli Manning will not improve much if he spends a lot of time on his back. The defense also needs to force more turnovers.  OUTLOOK -- The Giants will go as Manning goes. If he becomes a consistent quarterback, a .500 season is possible. If he struggles, the Giants do not have enough talent to carry him. Though Tom Coughlin is in only his second season as coach, he needs to prove that this franchise is on the upswing.    4 Washington  (6-10)  STRENGTHS -- Clinton Portis is a consistent 1,000-yard back. LaVar Arrington is a difference-maker at linebacker when healthy, and Cornelius Griffin is a superb defensive tackle. Santana Moss is a dangerous punt returner and deep threat at receiver. The offensive line should be solid, featuring Chris Samuels and Casey Rabach.  WEAKNESSES -- Offensively, this team does not have enough playmakers. A quarterback controversy could be in the making, featuring Patrick Ramsey, Mark Brunell and Jason Campbell. The Redskins lost a lot of talent to free agency, including linebacker Antonio Pierce and cornerback Fred Smoot.  OUTLOOK -- Joe Gibbs got more of a challenge than he bargained for when he returned to coaching, and this season presents another challenge. Some expect the Redskins to bounce back, but there are too many question marks, like Arrington's health and Ramsey's suitability as a No. 1 quarterback. Look for another year under .500.    WEST    KEY TO WINNING DIVISION -- Seattle needed only nine victories to win this division last season, but Arizona looks improved, and St. Louis owned the Seahawks last season, beating them three times. The Seahawks have the most talent and must be considered the favorite. But none of these teams boast a reliable defense, meaning nobody from this division is going to the Super Bowl.    1 Seattle  (9-7)  STRENGTHS -- Matt Hasselbeck is a solid quarterback, hitting his prime as he nears 30. Looking for a bigger contract and running behind a good offensive line, Shaun Alexander will be motivated for another standout season. Strong safety Michael Boulware is by far the team's best defensive player. Place-kicker Josh Brown is reliable.    WEAKNESSES -- The defense is susceptible to big plays. The wide receivers drop too many passes. After a 3-0 start last season, the Seahawks went 6-7 the rest of the way, making them the worst team to make the playoffs. They can score points, but their defense also surrenders them.  OUTLOOK -- This team is capable of looking very good, or not so good. The talent of Hasselbeck and Alexander should be enough to lead the way to another division title. But if the Seahawks miss the playoffs or sustain another first-round knockout, Coach Mike Holmgren may have to pack his bags.    2 St. Louis (8-8)  STRENGTHS -- Running back Steven Jackson has blossomed as a starter and, at 22, could become a star. Marc Bulger is a good quarterback who is improving. Torry Holt is often overlooked when the best receivers are discussed, but he is an excellent player. The free-agent linebacker Dexter Coakley should help the defense.  WEAKNESSES -- Not enough upgrades were made to a defense that had problems. The Rams had nine games last season in which they surrendered at least 28 points, including their playoff loss to Atlanta. Stars like Marshall Faulk and Isaac Bruce are showing their age. Special teams have been a continuing problem.  OUTLOOK -- This team is in a slow decline. The core players are aging, and most of the younger players are unproven. If Bulger has a huge year, the Rams may have one division title left in them. But it is more likely that they will miss the playoffs and realize that the time has come to rebuild.    3 Arizona  (6-10)  STRENGTHS -- Anquan Boldin and Larry Fitzgerald have the potential to become a top wide-receiver duo. Quarterback Kurt Warner has something to prove and remains an accurate passer when given time. The second-year coach Dennis Green has worked hard to change the losing culture in Arizona. The rookie back J.J. Arrington should help the ground game.  WEAKNESSES -- The defense, with a young secondary that could yield too many big plays, will not scare anyone. If the offensive line does not protect Warner, he will struggle and turn over the ball. This team will have many new faces in vital positions, and it could take time to jell.  OUTLOOK -- Arizona has had six consecutive losing seasons, and this team is likely to make it No. 7. Green is slowly upgrading the talent and cutting players who accept losing too easily. This is a weak division, so the Cardinals could finish close to .500. But they appear to be at least a year away from making a significant leap.    4 San Francisco (2-14)  STRENGTHS -- Julian Peterson is a mobile linebacker who is talented enough to anchor the 3-4 defense favored by Mike Nolan, the new coach. Ahmed Plummer's return from injury will strengthen the secondary. Defensive end Bryant Young is a veteran leader who remembers when the 49ers were good.  WEAKNESSES -- This was the worst team in the N.F.L. last season, and numerous holes remain. Alex Smith figures to struggle as a rookie quarterback, even if he displaces Tim Rattay as the starter. None of the running backs can keep defenses honest. The receiving corps is largely unproven, and the defense will bend and break.  OUTLOOK -- A rebuilding job has begun, with a new front office, a new coach and a new quarterback. The death of offensive lineman Thomas Herrion made it a sobering preseason. Considering they won just two games last season, the 49ers have an excellent chance to improve. But they should cherish each victory, because there may not be many of them.    NORTH    KEY TO WINNING DIVISION -- This one looks wide open. The Packers are older. The Lions have offensive talent. Nobody knows how the Vikings will fare without Randy Moss. And even the lowly Bears have a solid defense. Brett Favre's magic always makes the Packers dangerous, but another star quarterback, Daunte Culpepper, gives Minnesota the best chance to win this division.    1 Minnesota (8-8)  STRENGTHS -- After a brilliant year, Culpepper can take full leadership of the offense, now that Moss has been traded to Oakland. Nate Burleson and the rookie Troy Williamson are speedy targets for Culpepper. The defense should be improved, with the addition of the free agents Fred Smoot and Darren Sharper to the secondary. Kevin Williams is a standout defensive tackle.  WEAKNESSES -- The defense could still struggle against the run, especially if the linebackers remain mediocre. There is no consistent running game to take pressure off Culpepper. The Vikings will not miss Moss's mouth, but they will miss his big-play ability. Without a dominant defense, the Vikings could be exciting but inconsistent.  OUTLOOK -- There will be fewer distractions with Moss gone, and the Vikings still have more talent than any team in the division. Coach Mike Tice probably needs another playoff year to keep his job, and the team is motivated to prove it is better off without Moss. A 9- or 10-victory season seems likely.    2 Detroit (6-10)  STRENGTHS -- Roy Williams, Charles Rogers and Mike Williams will stretch the field as a dangerous receiving threesome. Kevin Jones, who rushed for 1,133 yards last season, is a potential star.  WEAKNESSES -- If Joey Harrington falters at quarterback, the backup will be the untested rookie Dan Orlovsky","excerpt":"Jeff Garcia, who is familiar with Coach Steve Mariucci's system, could miss the regular season after breaking his left leg in Friday's preseason finale against Buffalo. The defense remains unproven but must improve. Averaging four victories over the past four seasons, the Lions are used to losing, and that mentality can be difficult to overcome. The talent has been upgraded, but the roster is still short of depth.  OUTLOOK -- This is a make-or-break year for Harrington, who has been given enough offensive weapons to succeed. People forget that Detroit started 4-2 last year before a five-game losing streak ruined the season. The Lions are headed in the right direction, but they remain at least a year away from the playoffs.    3 Green Bay (10-6)  STRENGTHS -- Everything begins with Favre, who looks lean and hungry after a strenuous off-season workout program. He will lead a potent offense, throwing to Javon Walker and Donald Driver, or handing off to Ahman Green. This is an experienced team that does not panic. Favre gives it a chance to defeat anyone.  WEAKNESSES -- The Packers had a poor defense last season, and it does not appear to have been significantly upgraded. This is a team that could give up big plays while forcing few turnovers -- a bad combination. Coach Mike Sherman got the contract extension he was looking for, but what he really needs is a few stars on defense.  OUTLOOK -- Green Bay looks ripe for a fall, with aging offensive stars and a potentially porous defense. Favre is the primary reason the Packers won 10 games last season, but he may be asked to carry an even bigger load, and that is asking a lot. Another playoff year in Green Bay is unlikely.    4 Chicago  (5-11)  STRENGTHS -- The defense will keep the Bears in some games, especially when the weather turns ugly. Linebacker Brian Urlacher seems to have recovered from injuries -- bad news for quarterbacks. Defensive ends Alex Brown and Adewale Ogunleye are strong pass rushers. Wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad, acquired through free agency, gives Chicago a big-play target.  WEAKNESSES -- Quarterback Rex Grossman broke his ankle in preseason, leaving Kyle Orton, the rookie from Purdue, as the starter. The offensive line does not look impressive. Moving the football could be a serious problem, and Muhammad will probably see more double coverage than Shaquille O'Neal.  OUTLOOK -- You have heard of the Bad News Bears; these are the Bad Luck Bears. Grossman sustained a serious injury for the second consecutive season. They drafted a running back, Cedric Benson, with the No. 4 overall pick, but he held out longer than any first-round pick. It will be another dreary Chicago winter.    SOUTH    KEY TO WINNING DIVISION -- This could be the most competitive division in the league. Atlanta reached the N.F.C. championship game, the Saints and the Panthers just missed the playoffs, and Tampa Bay looks much improved. All of these teams think they can make the playoffs, and how they fare against one another will probably determine the division winner.    1 Tampa Bay (5-11)  STRENGTHS -- The defense looks formidable, led by linebacker Derrick Brooks, defensive end Simeon Rice and two of the game's best cornerbacks, Ronde Barber and Brian Kelly. Michael Clayton is a budding star at wide receiver, and the first-round draft pick Carnell Williams is a versatile threat at running back. Quarterback Brian Griese is coming off his best year.  WEAKNESSES -- This team has underachieved for two seasons. Perhaps some players have tuned out Coach Jon Gruden. Nobody has filled the leadership void left when John Lynch and Warren Sapp departed. Tampa Bay does not have a big-play offense and has been a poor come-from-behind team.  OUTLOOK -- In this age of parity and free agency, at least one N.F.L. team always has a huge turnaround. Tampa Bay could be that team. Much will hinge on the play of Griese, who must avoid interceptions. The Buccaneers have enough talent to double last year's victory total and make a surprise entry into the playoffs.    2 Carolina  (7-9)  STRENGTHS -- The defensive line of Julius Peppers, Kris Jenkins, Brentson Buckner and Mike Rucker could be the N.F.L.'s best. Jake Delhomme is not a flashy quarterback, but he is effective. John Fox is an excellent coach, able to keep his team motivated last season despite a 1-7 start and numerous injuries. Few teams play harder as consistently.  WEAKNESSES -- There are questions at running back, with the injury-prone Stephen Davis, DeShaun Foster and Nick Goings splitting time. Muhsin Muhammad will be missed, putting more pressure on Steve Smith, the team's top receiver, who is coming off a broken leg. If the running game is inconsistent, the Panthers may lose some close low-scoring games.  OUTLOOK -- The Panthers could win this division, or even reach the Super Bowl. Or they could miss the playoffs. They figure to have better luck with injuries than they did last season, so expect them to have a winning season. Fox's teams usually play their best in the second half of the season.    3New Orleans  (8-8)  STRENGTHS -- Joe Horn is a dangerous receiver who gets open consistently and runs well after the catch. The rookie Jammal Brown will bolster the offensive line. Deuce McAllister is a back with the power to run inside and the speed to break long runs. Ending 2004 with a four-game winning streak has this team entering the season with optimism.  WEAKNESSES -- Aaron Brooks puts up big numbers at quarterback, but he throws too many interceptions. Teams can run on the Saints and keep their potent offense off the field.  OUTLOOK -- The wild card is how the team deals with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. No other team comes close to having the same handicap. As usual, the Saints will probably look better on paper than on the field. They were 4-8 after 12 games last season, and only their late-season rally saved Coach Jim Haslett's job. If Brooks plays with more consistency, the Saints could be playoff bound. If not, Haslett will most likely be looking for a job and the Saints may look to rebuild.    4 Atlanta  (11-5)  STRENGTHS -- Michael Vick is the N.F.L.'s most electrifying player, able to turn any play into a touchdown. Alge Crumpler gives the Falcons a pass-catching threat at tight end, and defensive tackle Rod Coleman anchors a strong front. The Falcons are a physical team, with sure tacklers, hard hitters and defensive speed.  WEAKNESSES -- The reliance on Vick is so heavy that the Falcons will plummet if he misses significant time or if he plays inconsistently. Peerless Price was a bust, and the Falcons still do not have a big-play receiver. Atlanta has a difficult schedule, with five of its first seven games against teams that made the playoffs last season.  OUTLOOK -- Everything points to this team taking a fall.
