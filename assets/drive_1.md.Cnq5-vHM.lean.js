Four friends wish to fly to Paris and return from Nice or the other way around. Could you advise how to find the lowest air fares and car rentals? - M.H., Glen Cove, N.Y. Answer:Finding the lowest air fare these days takes diligent research and just plain luck. And with Sir Freddie Laker out of the trans-Atlantic market at this time, Icelandair stands alone with a record of consistently lower-priced fares. If you fly from New York to Paris and return from Nice, the round-trip fare on Icelandair will be $573 if you depart before May 14","excerpt":"it increases to $644 on that date. In either direction the flight includes stops in Reykjavik and Luxembourg. Fare restrictions include a minimum stay of seven days and a maximum of 90; tickets must be purchased 14 days in advance of departure.   However, the trans-Atlantic market is very competitive and the airlines in that market are likely to be offering promotional fares that may change day by day, even hour by hour, as the peak season draws closer. Watch the advertising and take the best deal that suits your schedule, taking care that you can live with the restrictions that always accompany such fares. Among other airlines serving the New York/Paris route are Air France, Pan American, Pakistan International and Trans World Airlines.

In these times, the posture of royalty no longer has such decisive influence. Nor, in most cases, does a unanimity of Protestant spirit hold sway, as George Bernard Shaw once speculated. So the object of our veneration must be none other than Handel himself, the composer who stirs our souls from across the centuries.

Its stylish New York milieu provided the setting for a scrupulous, subtle examination of an adulterous pair - appealing characters of literate energy and reflectiveness, each existing as fully in the real world of family and profession as in the urgent temporary universe of the love affair. ''Adjacent Lives'' asked hard questions about love, death and the death of love","excerpt":"it introduced Miss Schwamm as a writer of ripe sensibility and intelligence.   ''How He Saved Her'' has much in common with the earlier work, but it considers the end of a marriage, a woman's passage from the safety of her own chic and her husband's money to a life of curious selfrealization instigated by her lover. It is a somewhat longer and considerably more ambitious novel than ''Adjacent Lives,'' if not an entirely likeable one.

The opening proclamations began with almost cliched arpeggiations and exclamations, but they faded, under Mr. Sherman's exquisitely calculated touch, into long sighs, as if the composer were gradually resigning himself to sorrow and introverted reflection. There was not a moment of superfluous gesture here: the warm sound focused attention on each note's place in the composition.   That spirit of introspection characterized nearly the entire recital. Debussy's remarkable second collection of Preludes, for example, was not an assemblage of impressionistic sound-paintings creating atmospheric images of leaves, moonlight and Moorish architecture. Mr. Sherman is not a colorist. Instead, these works became finely etched meditations. Mr. Sherman revealed how, in the midst of swirls and cascades and exotic harmonies, Debussy is really a contrapuntalist, his figurations creating voices and interpenetrating lines.

THE NATION"},{"year":"2005","title":"Most music is best heard standing alone, free from history and political context. But JEAN SIBELIUS's ''KULLERVO'' is inseparable from its circumstances. Sibelius's music has faded in and out of prominence since his death in 1957, but COLIN DAVIS is an active fan, and he will be doing us a favor next Friday night when he and the LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA bring ''Kullervo'' to LINCOLN CENTER.    ''Kullervo'' is not just a 70-minute symphonic poem for soprano, baritone and male chorus","excerpt":"it is a cry for a country. In 1892, when Sibelius wrote it, Finland was under the political control of czarist Russia and the cultural domination of Sweden. ''Kullervo'' draws from Finnish mythology and it dares to be rough and raw -- qualities that Sibelius kept refining during the productive years of his life.    Such a sudden, epic history with music to match brought Finnish nationalism to a high heat. Sibelius was 26 when he conducted the first performance under near-hostile conditions. News of the event penetrated all of Europe, and his reputation was secured at an early age.    With ''Kullervo'' on Friday will be more Sibelius in the same vein: the symphonic fantasy ''POHJOLA'S DAUGHTER,'' which again draws on ancient stories, here told with unashamed naïveté and simplicity. ''Pohjola's Daughter'' appeared 14 years after ''Kullervo.'' The music is notable for its sweeping cello solo at the beginning.    The London Symphony is, of course, one of our world-class orchestras and notable for its ability to do well in any style. Its association with Sir Colin is long and deep. The male chorus is the orchestra's own; he soloists for ''Kullervo'' will be MONICA GROOP, mezzo-soprano, and RAIMO LAUKKA, baritone. Friday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212)875-5030; $35 to $75.

Decade after decade, composers have fought for a personal, lasting voice amid the whirlwind of technical possibilities. In certain places, at certain times, they have faced a simpler and more desperate struggle to keep writing at all in the face of implacable cultural and political hostility. Twentieth-century music cannot be seen whole","excerpt":"it is a damaged thing, whose wishes and dreams count as much as its tangible accomplishments.   No period of recent history illustrates these contingencies more starkly and painfully than the era between the world wars. Music exploded in all possible directions: atonal modernism, tonal nostalgia, futurism, populism and satiric eclecticism. Soon the possibilities hardened into orthodoxies, whether of the Serialist, Neo-Classicist or socialist-realist kind. In the inferno of World War II, some younger composers had their confusion solved by death; most who survived spoke in distinctly less colorful tones. Greater waves of experimentation followed in the 1950's and 60's, but no era would again feel such unbounded freedom.

Chabrol is the gloomiest and most despairing of the new creative men. His attitude is ridden with a sense of defeat and ruin. And if his cinema reporting is as reliable as it is clear-eyed, candid and cruel, then others, as well as he, have good reason to be concerned about the youth of France.For his evident conviction, as reflected most forcefully in \\"The Cousins,\\" is that a foul contamination has infected the nation's intellectual youth. It is more than a restlessness and frenzy","excerpt":"it is a deep cyncism that is expressed in absolute hedonism and a maudlin wish for death.This is indicated with shocking candor in the most powerful part of this film, which represents a veritable orgy in the swanky apartment of a student of law. This fellow has given a room to his country cousin who is an innocent and optimistic youth, still tied to the apron-strings of his mother and extremely naive about girls.Whether to educate this bumpkin, or simply because it is their customary behavior, the older cousin and one of his decadent playmates throw this Saturday night brawl, which for drinking and general carousing puts most Greenwich Village blow-outs in the shade. And at the height of the orgiastic doings, the host puts a Wagner record on the hi-fi, turns out the lights and appears among his guests carrying a candelabra, wearing a Nazi officer's cap and reciting a German poem.Done as it is in a vivid fashion, this scene and the idea hit hard. The concept of the youth of the nation corrupted by the Nazi image is profound. And the progress of the film, from this point on, while not so forceful, conveys the hopeless thought that this cousin, who is obviously a leader among the students, is an inevitable influence for ruin. For he befouls a likely romance for his young cousin by himself taking over the girl, and he succeeeds in destroying the morale of the youngster by cynically bluffing his way through his law exams.M. Chabrol has more skill with the camera than he has with the pen, and his picture is more credible to the eye than it is to the skeptical mind. But it is not the less overwhelming, and it is beautifully played by much the same cast that performed for him in \\"Le Beau Serge.\\"Jean-Claude Brialy is cold and brilliant, elegant and epicene, as the older cousin, Gerard Blain is soft and touching as the youth and Juliette Mayniel is thoroughly provoking as the girl who is diverted from a pure romance.

One gets actually excited during the ring encounter, even though the outcome is fairly clear, and one is not annoyed when the girl of the prizefighter's dreams urges him on to defeat his opponent.The success of this offering is partly due to the occasional flashes of old-timers — pugilists, wrestlers, jockeys, baseball players, gate-crashers and others, impersonated by such persons as Jack Johnson, Tom Sharkey, Tod Sloan, Mike Donlin, Billy Papke, Stanislaus Zbyszko, Tom Kennedy, Spike Robinson and the irrepressible Tammany Young, who looks upon, every Broadway sign as a cordial invitation to a show.

A.Not all potatoes are chemically treated, since newly harvested potatoes can be kept in cold storage two or three months before they begin to sprout. But potatoes that must be held for long periods before marketing are often chemically treated. Two chemicals are chiefly used, called maleic hydrazide and chloroisopropyl carbonate, or CIPC. Of these, according to Herman Timm, a potato specialist at the University of California at Davis, maleic hydrazide is the less used, in part because it must be sprayed on the living plants in the field and the right dose is hard to get without reducing yields.

His latest bit of terminology, Sound Grammar, builds on the Harmolodic theory that he introduced in the early 1970s","excerpt":"it is a holistic ideal of improvised group communication that is easier to recognize than define. Mr. Coleman, above, has been enacting these principles lately with an excellent ensemble including two bassists (Tony Falanga and Greg Cohen) and a drummer (Denardo Coleman, his son). The quartet had its premiere at Carnegie Hall at the 2003 JVC Jazz Festival, with an uninterrupted concert-length whorl; returning to the same setting one year later, the band took the opposite tack, with discrete compositions as skeletal and scintillating as Zen haiku. Both concerts hinted at the way in which Mr. Coleman's aesthetic had gradually, and sometimes grudgingly, been absorbed by jazz's mainstream in recent years: Jazz at Lincoln Center has paid homage, and the Bad Plus, a puckishly unconventional piano trio (Ethan Iverson, pianist; Reid Anderson, bassist; and David King, drummer), has been earning standing ovations with an explosive rendition of Mr. Coleman's ''Street Woman.'' The Bad Plus took part in a three-day tribute to Mr. Coleman at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis this spring, and Mr. Coleman later praised their efforts -- so it is possible that tomorrow's concert in Newark will include an intergenerational collaboration. Even if it doesn't, one suspects that, as is usually the case when Mr. Coleman performs, bridges will be crossed.

With its formal structure, the piece is the nearest he has come to creating a play for actors. But before one rushes to an unjustified conclusion, it must be said that the work is definably Wilson. It is a stream of impressions, with no story line, character development or single incontrovertible explication. Present, in cameo form, are the artist's signatures - the stop-time pace, the repetition, the sudden, seemingly contradictory alteration of images.   In contrast to his operatic chronicles elaborating on the life and historical times of such figures as Einstein, Stalin and Freud, this is a small-scale, personalized dream play, in which intrepid theatergoers are invited to share the author's associative memory. Unlike Tadeusz Kantor's equally dreamlike ''Let the Artists Die,'' ''The Golden Windows'' is apolitical.

Zacharias Kunuk's adaptation of an ancient folk-tale, which won the Camera d'Or for best first feature at last year's Cannes International Film Festival, is much more than an ethnographic curiosity. It is, by any standard, an extraordinary film, a work of narrative sweep and visual beauty that honors the history of the art form even as it extends its perspective. The story about a vendetta that threatens the happiness of the hero and the stability of his nomadic, seal-hunting clan, takes a while to establish itself, but it has the clarity and the power common to epics from the sagas of ancient Scandinavia to the westerns of the old Hollywood. Austere and violent, the movie is also touched by humor and sensuality, and full of unforgettable images of the blinding Arctic landscape. Mr. Kunuk and his cast have accomplished the remarkable feat of endowing his archetypal characters from with complicated psychological motives and responses.

In this moderately diverting affair, which was adapted from Roi Cooper Megrue's translation of Carl Sloboda's play, Lew Cody, Aileen Pringle and Owen Moore provide the none too keen fun","excerpt":"it is a mechanical sort of humor wherein it is so obvious that the incidents are engineered by the man behind the camera and never spontaneous. However, this piece of work is a farce-comedy and for that reason a great deal must be excused. It is another of those pictures, which, when describing, prompts one to refer to the intermittent laughter of the audience.\\"Tea for Three\\" was directed by Robert Z. Leonard, producer of \\"Adam and Evil,\\" in which Mr. Cody and Miss Pringle were also featured. Mr. Leonard's current offering is not so good as his previous bit of fun, which is partly because the story, such as it is, is continually forced and because Mr. Leonard has so evidently gunned for laughter. Here again there is an instance where a character enters a room, walks around, picks up statues and books, opens chests and all that sort of thing without perceiving that under the glare of the electric light is one Philip Collamore, holding in his fingers a cigarette, the smoke of which might attract an ordinary mortal.Collamore decides to cure Carter Langford's jealous nature. Mrs. Langford rather likes Collamore, who was her husband's best man at his wedding, the date of which matters to nobody. She fibs without being imaginative and without leaving herself an opening. She tells her husband that she has been out with Ethel, whereas not only her husband but the audience at the Capitol, know that Doris Langford could not have been with Ethel as the latter has just sent a telegram proving that she is not in New York. The audience knows what Langford does not: that Doris has been lunching with the persuasive Mr. Collamore and that they both have eaten salame. Doris returns home that evening and gently refuses to permit her husband to kiss her because she has been eating garlic. Imagine then Langford's mental process when in comes the irrepressible Collamore, who mentions off-hand that he had garlic at luncheon. Needless to say, the jealous Langford is able to put two and two together.The lighter side of suicide is introduced in another chapter of this tale, and the man who draws the low card is expected to see that he ends his life by a certain hour. It happens that Collamore draws the deuce of clubs, but only a handful of spectators in the audience believed that he had any intention of shuffling off this terrestrial globe.Mr. Cody is only so-so in this none too important subject. Miss Pringle does no better than Mr. Cody, and neither does Mr. Moore.Prior to the pictorial feature there are numbers with Vincent Lopez and his orchestra, Grace La Rue, and James Barton, who is very amusing.

Topics of The Times"},{"year":"1920","title":"\\"The Penalty,\\" an altogether incredible melodrama that, by its excesses, mocks even the friendliest spectator's love of life as it is often fictitiously created on the screen, is at the Capitol this week. It is from a story by Gouverneur Morris, which, if it is anything like its motion picture version, must have taxed the author's rampant imagination, and also sent him, now and then, when original ideas failed, to the reserve cabinet of familiar devices from which a novelist may render first aid to a plot in difficulty.If its plot, then, were everything in \\"The Penalty,\\" its adherents would probably be few. As it is, however, it will undoubtedly win the active interest, and even the regard, of many—because of Lon Chaney in the principal rôle, and the direction of Wallace Worsley. In the midst of a purely mechanistic arrangement of incidents, and surrounded chiefly by puppets. Chaney creates a character. The repellant \\"Frog\\" of \\"The Miracle Man,\\" the villainous Ricardo of \\"Victory,\\" and the likable hero of \\"Nomads of the North,\\" has another vivid impersonation to his credit.When they saw \\"The Miracle Man\\" some were struck at first by Chaney's ability to make himself seem a hopeless cripple, but before the picture was finished they forgot his stunt as such and their interest was all in the person he seemed to be. Likewise, when Chaney appears in \\"The Penalty\\" with both of his legs apparently sawed off above the knees, some will exclaim, \\"How in the world can be do that?\\", but after they have followed his acting a while, and felt the force of his presence on the screen, they will take it as just a part of his rôle that his legs are missing. And, as a matter of fact, his physical appearance is one of the least persuasive things about his performance, because, in several side views, the outline of his legs strapped up behind him is evident. But in all that he does, the man he is supposed to be is present.This man is Blizzard, a ruler of San Francisco's underworld, who uses his extraordinary mind and personality in entirely evil pursuits. He exercises autocratic power in his sphere and builds a gigantic plan to loot the city, and, incidentally, to take revenge against the surgeon who had needlessly amputated his legs years before. He is also obsessed with the idea of obtaining a pair of new legs by grafting, and it is when he submits to an anesthetic for this operation that the doctor, who knows that he has suffered an injury to his brain, operates on his head instead and restores his mental balance. Upon recovering, his reformation is complete, but this turn in the story is saved from utter banality when Blizzard pays the penalty for his past life, dying by the hand of one of his former followers.It is through all of this unreality that Mr. Chaney takes a real character, largely by his own efforts, but aided by the director, and even by the story itself at times, as, for example, in the scenes in which he plays the piano and is momentarily transformed by its music. One forgets the nature of the melodrama when the vicious Blizzard cannot kill a girl whom he knows to be a government spy because she works so well the pedals his stumps of legs cannot reach.Director Worsley has set his production effectively, and the cast without being able to do anything distinctive, is nevertheless adequate for the story.Also on the Capitol program is a Hy Mayer Travelaugh, \\"In the Land of Fancy.\\"The version of \\"Kismet,\\" at the Strand this week, is not the \\"Kismet\\" of the stage. The sound and color that made the latter are missing. Not even as much of it has been reproduced as might have been brought to the screen by the magic of lighting, setting and costuming which some directors have at their command. Although Louis J. Gasnier has staged his production lavishly, he has not succeeded in putting into the film the tones and shades and variety that \\"Kismet\\" ought to have. Much more colorful pictures, much less pretentiously advanced, have been seen on Broadway. Many of the scenes of the photoplay at the Strand, despite the richness they probably had in the studio, are flat.The presence of Otis Skinner in his stage part, however, does much to redeem the production. Mr. Skinner ??? same tempestuous character he made him on the stage, and although his voice is not heard, his appearance and manner carry him far. His performance is worth seeing. Also some of the others in the cast add life to the picture, and in several scenes the illusion of Bagdad one thousand years ago is attained.Taken in comparison with the average program photoplay. \\"Kismet\\" has value. It is different its story is pleasantly fantastic, in spite of its murders","excerpt":"it is a relief from the regular run of unreality parading itself as true to life. But when one considers what might have been done with this spectacle, even without the aid of natural colors on the screen, he is bound to be disappointed. And, incidentally, \\"Kismet\\" is a photoplay that cries for the perfection of color photography.George Fitzmaurice's latest production, \\"Idols of Clay,\\" with Mae Murray and David Powell in the ??? come to the Criterion, while \\"Conrad in Quest of His Youth,\\" with Thomas Meighan, has moved from the Rialto to the Rivoli, and \\"Always Audacious,\\" with Wallace Reid, from the Rivoli to the Rialto.

Can they do it again together?   The answer is yes, but not without a lot of qualifiers. So dominant is the design originated by I.B.M., which is based on a microprocessor from Intel and operating system software from Microsoft, that no new platform is likely to supplant it. But if they move quickly, and with few missteps, Apple and I.B.M -- two of the three largest PC makers -- can create a viable alternative.   Last week, Apple, I.B.M. and Motorola announced that they would jointly develop a hardware blueprint for computers based on the PowerPC microprocessor they have jointly produced. The new machine would be a computing chameleon, able to run operating systems like I.B.M.'s OS/2, Apple's Mac OS, and versions of Unix from I.B.M. and Sun Microsystems. As does Apple's Power Macintosh, the new machine could run Microsoft Windows, but only under \\"emulation\\" -- a \\"let's pretend\\" software technique that has never been totally satisfying.   Critics were quick to cry \\"too little, too late,\\" saying that the companies should have reached this agreement three years ago when they began work on the PowerPC chip. And there was the loud sound of just one shoe falling: where was an agreement by Apple to license Mac OS to I.B.M.? Trade publications have reported that Apple will disclose licensing plans tomorrow at the Comdex computer convention in Las Vegas, but the company has declined to comment.   The projected delivery date of the hardware design, sometime in 1996, also seemed too far away to matter, leaving Microsoft and Intel to carve up the market in the meantime.   \\"If this lands in mid-1996, who cares?\\" asked Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest. \\"Why would anyone invest in this merged platform unless Apple licenses the operating system?\\"   But corporate buyers were more receptive to the proposed machine than were the pundits. They like the idea of a single computer that could run all the multiple operating systems they live with today on multiple computers, which would reduce confusion and lower technical support costs. Just knowing such a machine is coming makes buying a Power Macintosh a safer choice today, because there is a migration path.   Also, the oft-projected decline and fall of the Macintosh line of computers -- usually based on the argument that it has attained only a 10 percent share of the market -- would seem a false prophecy. During the third quarter, for example, Apple's United States shipments of 640,000 Macintosh's made it the leading personal computer for that period, ahead of Compaq at 600,000 and I.B.M. at 500,000, according to the International Data Corporation, a market research organization based in Framingham, Mass.   Personal computers based on Intel or Intel-compatible microprocessors and Microsoft's Windows operating systems (the kind that used to be called I.B.M.-compatible) are going through a transition of their own -- from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95. This is more than a simple software upgrade","excerpt":"it is a shift from a 16-bit operating system to one that processes data in 32-bit chunks. That potentially rocky road to Wellville could create an opportunity for alternatives, like a new platform from I.B.M. and Apple.   \\"The market power of these two companies is greater than the sum of their market shares,\\" said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research in Phoenix. \\"Most people who have criticized this venture have focused on today. This is not about today,\\" he continued. \\"This is about the 32-bit environment, which will grow and come to dominate the market by the end of the decade.\\"   For many years already, Apple's Macintosh has been a 32-bit machine running a 32-bit operating system. I.B.M.'s recently introduced OS/2 Warp is a 32-bit operating system. But Microsoft is still making the transition to a 32-bit operating system with Windows 95, which will not ship until some time next year. Windows NT, Microsoft's more advanced operating system introduced last year, is a 32-bit system. But so far it has achieved only modest market penetration, and only as a \\"server\\" system on large networks, not on individual desktops.   Microsoft has sought to smooth the journey to Windows 95 and 32-bit computing by seeing to it that all existing 16-bit software will run on the new system, but it's not likely to be a totally painless trip. The installed base of Windows applications insures that Windows 95 will have strong sales, but it presents the possibility of compatibility problems.   A version of Windows 95 for the PowerPC chip is not likely to materialize, unless I.B.M., Apple and others achieve unexpected sales volume. Windows is written in software code that ties it closely to the internal workings of the Intel chip, and to convert it would be a major undertaking. Windows NT, however, can run on many chips, and a version for the PowerPC is in the works.   One ace up I.B.M.'s sleeve is development of a much publicized but never officially confirmed version of the PowerPC microprocessor that incorporates emulation into the chip itself. In theory, this hardware emulation would allow machines using the chip to run Windows applications at speeds so close to their \\"native\\" performance on Intel boxes that the difference would be moot. With the added benefit of running Macintosh, OS/2, Unix and Windows NT applications, such a machine would appeal to shops using a mix of hardware.   But the performance of this mystery chip or of the coming joint Apple-I.B.M. computer design had better be good. \\"The real challenge they face is having compatibility real enough and fast enough, because the installed base is everything,\\" said a PC buyer for a Big Six accounting firm, who spoke on the condition he not to be identified. \\"It better be double the performance\\" of competing machines, \\"because it's not like PC makers or Microsoft are gouging on price,\\" he said.   Others say outperforming Microsoft and Intel at their own game is a long shot. They see the new machine as a Mac clone. Apple has said it will license its operating system when the hardware specification is complete; in any case one could purchase Mac OS separately and run it on the new machine. In addition to I.B.M., Apple and Motorola, companies developing or producing PowerPC-based machines include: Bull Systems, Canon, FirePower, Hitachi, Power Computing, 3DO, the Taiwan New PC Consortium and Toshiba. Many are likely to seek Mac OS licenses when Apple makes them available.   \\"Where I.B.M. and Apple would have a real advantage is if they would combine their operating systems,\\" said John McKenna, president of Entex Information Systems in Ryebrook, N.Y., which claims to be the largest reseller of PC's to corporate customers. \\"Suppose I.B.M. were to throw all its weight behind integrating the Mac operating system.\\"   It would be no large task for I.B.M. to add its own extensions to the Macintosh that would make it an ideal \\"client\\" in networked computer systems using I.B.M.'s mainframes and minicomputers. But for I.B.M. to fully embrace the Macintosh operating system would seem a step back from its commitment to the OS/2 operating system, on which it has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars. Similarly, for Apple, the prospect of licensing Mac OS to the company it once equated with George Orwell's Big Brother must cause at least a mild shudder.   \\"The real question,\\" said Seymour Merrin, a consultant to the PC industry who is based in Mountain View, Calif., \\"is whether any product can be developed by I.B.M. and Apple when their own businesses are the biggest obstacle to anything getting done,\\" The Executive Computer; Can Apple and I.B.M.

The workshop's concerts used to be on Tuesday nights","excerpt":"it is a sign of the series' success, as well as Mr. Johnson's own appeal, that he is giving four performances there - the first on Monday, the second last night and two more this coming Monday and Tuesday at 8 P.M.     Mr. Johnson, who came here 10 years ago after studying at the University of Wisconsin, would seem to owe his audience in part to the fact that he has collaborated with any number of even better-established downtown musicians, performance artists and dancers, from Laurie Anderson to Rhys Chatham to Theodora Skipitaris to Karole Armitage.   But a more telling reason for his success is that, like several other composers, he very deliberately combines classical avant-garde concerns with rock instrumentation: on Monday, for the two largest pieces, that meant a quintet of himself on electric guitar and another electric guitarist, an electric bass and two percussionists plus three winds (the so-called Borneo Horns, who will also appear in the workshop's music series Jan. 28 and 29).

The real surprise is just how common this corporate about-face is becoming. Many companies, such as Beatrice, are trimming down operations rather than fattening them up.

Old arguments over broadcasting rules and regulations usually smell musty; this argument stays fresh and new. In part, this is because political postures change and opponents and proponents, loosely speaking, change positions. In the 1970's, liberal Democrats seemed ready to discard the Fairness Doctrine; political vagaries now make them its defenders. Over the years, meanwhile, the doctrine has been used, and abused, by all sides. At the moment, the Federal Comunications Commission, whose child the doctrine is, wants to disown it. Radio and television broadcasters may applaud, but it is not a good idea.   The Fairness Doctrine is a code of broadcast behavior, distilled from 50 years of legislation, court decisions and F.C.C. practice, and defined not so much by what it is as by what it does. When the F.C.C. said last month that it wanted to abandon the doctrine, it called it the ''two-pronged obligation'' that requires broadcasters ''to provide coverage of vitally important controversial issues in the community...and provide a reasonable opportunity for the presentation of contrasting viewpoints on such issues.''

Vecsey named the devil he saw -- sexual power -- saying that what happened was a sign that men feel a certain way about women. What he didn't say but what one infers is that men feel women are sexual objects over which men want power.   The nightmare is that even a decent man like George Vecsey doesn't get it. Sexual harassment has nothing to do with sex. The purely sexual advance is not a big deal to turn off. Sexual harassment is not about sex","excerpt":"it is about power. And is practiced most often by people who feel powerless, who feel the need to assert control over a world in which they feel a loser. A woman in the locker room of a losing, fumbling, caricature of a football team is a dead cert to be a target for men who feel powerless.    The nightmare is that wherever we play win-lose competitive games, the losers will continue to take it out on others they perceive as weaker than themselves.

An excerpt from his memoir \\"Wolf Willow\\" is included in \\"The Best of the West: An Anthology of Classic Writing From the American West,\\" edited by Tony Hillerman (HarperCollins).   TXT> One who has lived the dream, the temporary fulfillment and the disappointment has had the full course. He may lack a thousand things that the rest of the world takes for granted, and because his experience is belated he may feel like an anachronism all his life. But he will know one thing about what it means to be an American, because he has known the raw continent, and not as tourist but as denizen. Some of the beauty, the innocence and the callousness must stick to him, and some of the regret. The vein of melancholy in the North American mind may be owing to many causes, but it is surely not weakened by the perception that the fulfillment of the American Dream means inevitably the death of the noble savagery and freedom of the wild. Fighting to Break the Chain       Sojourner Truth, an ex-slave, an influential abolitionist and an early advocate of equality for women, had a frank and forceful style of speaking, as this excerpt from an 1867 speech on women's rights demonstrates. It's included in \\"The Female Experience: An American Documentary,\\" edited by Gerda Lerner (Oxford University, paper).   I am above 80 years old","excerpt":"it is about time for me to be going. I have been 40 years a slave and 40 years free, and would be here 40 years more to have equal rights for all. I suppose I am kept here because something remains for me to do; I suppose I am yet to help to break the chain. I have done a great deal of work; as much as a man, but did not get so much pay. I used to work in the field and bind grain, keeping up with the cradler; but men doing no more, got twice as much pay. . . . We do as much, we eat as much, we want as much. I suppose I am about the only colored woman that goes about to speak for the rights of the colored women. I want to keep the thing stirring, now that the ice is cracked. . . . I am glad to see that men are getting their rights, but I want women to get theirs, and while the water is stirring I will step into the pool. Living in Photographs     Startled by an ad for a new photographic product that asserted that without it one would be missing out on life, the novelist and poet Michael Anania went on to reflect on the way in which we depend on photos to validate our lives. This is from \\"In Plain Sight: Obsessions, Morals & Domestic Laughter\\" (Asphodel/Moyer Bell).   It is not merely that we are missing a photo-mechanical novelty, but that something crucial is missing from the rich, full life we all deserve. By itself, the remark would be bizarre, even outrageous. . . . In contemporary American culture, though, the need for images of ourselves has become so great that this sales pitch hardly seems extraordinary. We use photographs to record our existence, in some ways to verify it. We take more pictures of ourselves than of the things around us, and each of us carries through life albums or shoe boxes full of pictures that validate family, friends, childhood, marriage and nativity. . . . In a life sustained by images, cameras and other recording devices take on a primary, active role, investing events with reality. The Reluctant Author     Franz Kafka was deeply ambivalent about the publication of his work, as this tongue-in-cheek confession to a young admirer indicates. It is included in \\"Kurt Wolff: A Portrait in Essays and Letters,\\" edited by Michael Ermarth (University of Chicago).   Max Brod, Felix Weltsch, all my friends always manage to get their hands on something I've written and then confront me with a contract already drawn up. I don't want to cause them any difficulties, and so things end up being published that are actually only very private notes or trifles to amuse myself. Personal documents of my human failings are published and even sold, because my friends, with Max Brod in the forefront, insist on turning them into literature, and I don't have the strength to destroy these products of my solitude.   What I say here is naturally just an exaggeration and a bit of spitefulness toward my friends. The truth is that I am so corrupted and shameless that I participate myself in getting these things published. Then to excuse my weakness I make the forces working on me out to be stronger than they are. This is fraud, of course. I am a lawyer, you see -- that is why I can't keep away from wrongdoing. The Community of the Ear     We go through our days largely unaware of one of the most remarkable (and common) elements of our environment: the complex recital of bird     song. This is from \\"The Pleasures of Watching Birds\\" by Lola Oberman (Walker).   Often I have the feeling of being the sole witness to a significant happening. It comes to me in the fall when no one else at the shopping center is remotely aware of the steady stream of bluejays overhead; and in the spring, when blackpoll warblers, bringing up the rear of the migration in a massive overnight invasion, sing their songs unnoticed along every tree-lined street. Hidden by late spring foliage, they are heard more than seen, but on foot or in the car I can count their numbers by their voices, and I marvel at the number of people who pass by, unaware that something tremendous is happening. . . .   It is as if we are members of a great secret society, picking up signals that are invisible and inaudible to the average human.

Mahler's First Symphony, in a touching, beautifully calculated performance led by Seiji Ozawa, showed itself a very human activity. Its bird calls are long and leisurely, syntheses of the human voice. Indeed, the piece is less about nature than about a man's response to it. It also speaks of a Romantic era in which people were still custodians of creation and its principal spokesmen.   Written in 1955, Messiaen's \\"Oiseaux Exotiques\\" came before the Mahler symphony on Friday's program but postdates it by 50 years. It is a creature of a different world. These are nature pictures that man merely observes. The orchestration is for piano, winds and percussion. There are no strings to purvey the peculiar human sensibility.

It is different but does not depend upon mere difference for its attraction. The eye looks upon it and finds it good.Consistently fantastic, making no effort at literalism in investiture, the picture appeals at once as a work of free imagination. Natacha Rambova, who designed the settings and costumes after the Aubrey Beardsley drawings in the first edition of the Wilde play, has used only black, white, silver and gold in her materials and has sought her effects in the masses and lines for which the camera is always crying. And in every instance, it would seem, she has made the pictorial point desired, with, of course, the appreciative co-operation of Charles Bryant, the Director of the production, and his photographer. It is true that some may take exception to this or that detail of setting of costuming—to Mme. Nazimova's head dress of bouncing white balls, perhaps—but most of those who accept the fanciful treatment of the production as a whole probably will not be disturbed by any particular feature of it.But, in addition to this pictorial treatment, there is the story, the story of Oscar Wilde's \\"Salome,\\" and its treatment as a dramatic narrative. And this is another matter, in which questions and objections arise. It can be reported that the acting is excellent, as a rule","excerpt":"it is admitted that at different points in the action there is true dramatic intensity; and Mme. Nazimova's representation of Salome as young and innocent and yearning may even be accepted by those willing to get altogether away from logic and reality; but after this is said there remains the story itself, and it is disappointing. It runs out in an anti-climax. And the reason is evident.Mme. Nazimova's Salome is satisfactory to the censors. She takes pride, it is reported, in the fact that she was able to make a screen version of the famous story that would win official sanction—which, it must be granted, is an accomplishment. But can an approvad Salome De interesting, can she be a genuinely dramatic figure? Take the dance, for instance. This is the climax of the drama. The way is prepared for it by words and action that unmistakably indicate its character. The spectators know what to expect as well as Herod himself. And when it comes it has the approval of the cenors! The moral monitors of New York permit the dance that Herod thinks is worth half a kingdom! Can you imagine it? You cannot. Nor do you see the dance. You see an exceedingly tame and not remarkably graceful performance that Herod wouldn't have given standing room in his kingdom for. Yet on the faces of Herod and the other onlookers you see expressions intended to indicate that such a dance as you have been led to imagine is being performed. It shows you part of it and in what you see there is nothing to account for the gross eagerness in the faces of the men. So the whole scene collapses—and it is supposed to be the high climax of the story.But some one may reply that the real dance wouldn't be allowed, and that if it were decent people wouldn't want to look at it. Exactly. The real \\"Salome\\" is impossible on both counts. \\"Why, then, does any one attempt it at all? And isn't it overrated as a drama, anybow?

He elicits laughter unexpectedly without the aid of a caption, and implausible as such mythical kingdom tales are, Mr. Buchowetzhi succeeds in sustaining suspense and in unfolding the love story with charming simplicity.The first half of this picture is more diverting than those chapters which follow the plot of the villainous Prince Gabriel. However, certain sacrifices had to be made, as the romance could not be permitted to run too smoothly, or at least, not without the introduction of a blackguard's schemes. It looks as if Mr. Buchowetzki felt that this stage of the narrative had to be included and that therefore he decided to do it as well as he could.Eugene O'Brien figures as Greenfall Lorry, and Miss Talmadge impersonates the lovely Princess Yetiva. The initial sequence in this production shows Lorry pencilling on the menu aboard a dining car what he wants for luncheon. In the next scene the Princess's fingers are shown holding a pencil with which she also marks on the menu a sketchy repast. The two trains, bound in opposite directions, have stopped at the same station. Lorry looks up from the menu, and is instantly struck by the pretty girl in the ??? car of the other train. The Princess looks up and is not displeased by a glimpse of Lorry. She is too demure to flirt, but any man can appreciate that she is interested. She chances to look upon the well-polished sugar bowl, and therein observes Lorry's reflection, and then the suspicion of a smile lightens her countenance. She dare not look out of the window again, but she can look in the sugar bowl. She bends over and gazes upon the sugar bowl again, only to discover that in it is mirrored the black face of the waiter.Lorry, who apparently has no worries or cares, impulsively springs from his train, runs to the observation car of the Princess's train, followed by a porter. He succeeds in boarding the Princess's train, but he nearly loses all his precious golf clubs, as the porter has difficulty in putting the baggage on the coach. Lorry loses no time in seeking the Princess, and he takes the seat opposite her, only to be turned out of it by Count Halfont, the Princess's uncle. Little does Lorry suspect that he has fallen in love with the heir-apparent to the throne of Graustark. He asks the charming girl her name and is not shocked when he is told that it is Yetiva Guggenslocker.The young American is not disposed to permit such a pretty girl to elude him, and he brings her roses to her hotel. Just before he arives one day, the Princess is portrayed writing a letter, in which she declares that she is forced to sail unexpectedly for Europe. She waits until her uncle and aunt become impatient. She waits on the dock until it is time to draw in the gangplank, and then as the vessel is slowly moving toward the middle of the river, one sees the Princess looking sorrowfully in the direction of the dock and the gloomy Lorry standing at the foot of the pier, one among a crowd.As this story was unfurled yesterday the spectators manifested their appreciation, and there was sound applause when the villain was defeated, and laughter that started at two ends of the great theatre seemed to meet in the centre like waves of delight.How the gallery gods appreciated the consternation of Lorry, when he saw that the Princess Yetiva was none other than Miss Guggenslocker: They were glad with him, and for that matter so were most of the other persons in the great theatre.Miss Talmadge gives an extraordinarily fine performance, always restrained and always effective. As there are relatively few subtitles in this film, the expressions of the players are informing. Miss Talmadge is delightfully sincere in the love scenes, which are pictured in a sane manner. Mr. Buchowetzki obviously objects to the violent kissing scenes and he tells the old, old story with delicacy. Lorry kisses the Princess's hand and she kisses his forehead. In another scene they are shown gazing into each other's eyes. They have kissed—or are going to do so as soon as the picture fades away.Mr. O'Brien is capital in most of the stretches, especially in the beginning. There is however, one scene which it would be better to exclude, as there is no sympathy with the expression one usually detects on the face of a lovesick man","excerpt":"it is all right with a woman, but it is apt to be too closely to comedy with a male character. He is much safer in burying his head in his hands.This is a production which is thoroughly enjoyable, and granted that Princesses don't often run around as Miss Guggenslockers, it nevertheless will appeal to most persons and also to others who may not care afterward to confess how diverting they found \\"Graustark.\\" THE SCREEN; A Modern \\"Graustark.\\""},{"year":"1983","title":"Every Penny Counts   N ow that the American Presidential campaign has expanded from a one-year cycle to a two-year cycle, the spending limits Congress imposed on White House aspirants 10 years ago may turn out to be confining.

It is incumbent on them to look good while responding to questions, a requirement that impinges on and shapes their answers. How a candidate appears to answer a question is at least as important as the content of his answer, and the trick is to appear to be giving an answer even when there is no answer to give. Consequently, candidates do not always answer the questions they are asked; they answer instead the questions they wish they had been asked. Examples abound.     During the recent televised debate in Iowa among the eight Democratic Presidential contenders, for instance, Senator Gary Hart asked Walter F. Mondale if he could name any major domestic issue on which he had ''disagreed with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. or organized labor?'' This was a hardball question, calculated to embarrass Mr. Mondale.

And the few elements that are not inherently silly clash utterly with everything else about this huge office building. It all adds up to a strange mix of the inappropriate and the garish.   The central feature of the redesigned lobby, which is the work of Warren Platner & Associates, is a set of huge half-circle forms covered in gold leaf, looking vaguely Egyptian and vaguely like setting suns.

Mr. Carter's purpose was to clarify that choice. \\"Only unconditional surrender following a total military victory can remove the need for negotiated settlements.\\" But as Zbigniew Brzezinski points out, total victory would be anything but total.

It's an entertainingly gruesome book, and Palahniuk (it is pronounced POL-a-nick) has come up with some entertainingly gruesome ways to promote it. His well-choreographed readings will not remind you of Cynthia Ozick's. At bookstore appearances, Palahniuk likes to read a section of ''Haunted'' about people who are boiled to death in natural hot springs -- but not before he has handed out teriyaki-scented air fresheners that make the local Barnes & Noble smell like the world's nastiest steakhouse. After that, he said in a telephone interview, ''I bring the energy level back up by lobbing fake bloody, severed appendages into the crowd.'' (The fake-appendage plan went awry on his last tour when some of his bookstore visits nearly overlapped with those by Aron Ralston, the climber who wrote a memoir about how he amputated his own arm after it was pinned by a boulder. ''He had a real sense of humor about it,'' Palahniuk said. ''He said he wants them for his paperback tour.'') Palahniuk ends his events by handing out, to those who ask him questions, rugs that resemble pieces of meat. His best-known novel is, of course, ''Fight Club.'' There are always a few people who hang around after his readings to ask him how to find a fight club, or to invite him to the ones they've started. ''I always say, 'No, thank you,' '' Palahniuk said.

Italicized portions show where emphasis was added in the original.    Guiding Principles      Twenty-five years ago, this Court commented that the will of the people, not a hyper-technical reliance upon statutory provisions, should be our guiding principle in election cases:    ''The real parties in interest here, not in the legal sense but in realistic terms, are the voters. They are possessed of the ultimate interest and it is they whom we must give primary consideration. The contestants have direct interests certainly, but the office they seek is one of high public service and of upmost importance to the people, thus subordinating their interest to that of the people. Ours is a government of, by and for the people. Our federal and state constitutions guarantee the right of the people to take an active part in the process of that government, which for most of our citizens means participation via the election process. The right to vote is the right to participate","excerpt":"it is also the right to speak, but more importantly the right to be heard. We must tread carefully on that right or we risk the unnecessary and unjustified muting of the public voice. By refusing to recognize an otherwise valid exercise of the right of a citizen to vote for the sake of sacred, unyielding adherence to statutory scripture, we would in effect nullify that right.''     We consistently have adhered to the principle that the will of the people is the paramount consideration. 9 Our goal today remains the same as it was a quarter of a century ago, i. e., to reach the result that reflects the will of the voters, whatever that might be. This fundamental principle, and our traditional rules of statutory construction, guide our decision today.    Issues      The questions before this Court include the following: Under what circumstances may a Board authorize a countywide manual recount pursuant to section 102.166( 5); must the Secretary and Commission accept such recounts when the returns are certified and submitted by the Board after the seven day deadline set forth in sections 102.111 and 102.112?    Legal Opinion  of the Division of Election     The first issue this Court must resolve is whether a County Board may conduct a countywide manual recount where it determines there is an error in vote tabulation that could affect the outcome of the election. Here, the Division issued opinion DE 00-13, which construed the language ''error in vote tabulation'' to exclude the situation where a discrepancy between the original machine return and sample manual recount is due to the manner in which a ballot has been marked or punched.    Florida courts generally will defer to an agency's interpretation of statutes and rules the agency is charged with implementing and enforcing. Florida courts, however, will not defer to an agency's opinion that is contrary to law. We conclude that the Division's advisory opinion regarding vote tabulation is contrary to law because it contravenes the plain meaning of section 102.166(5). Pursuant to section 102.166(4)(a), a candidate who appears on a ballot, a political committee that supports or opposes an issue that appears on a ballot, or a political party whose candidate's name appeared on the ballot may file a written request with the County Board for a manual recount. This request must be filed with the Board before the Board certifies the election results or within seventy-two hours after the election, whichever occurs later.  Upon filing the written request for a manual recount, the canvassing board may authorize a manual recount. The decision whether to conduct a manual recount is vested in the sound discretion of the Board. If the canvassing board decides to authorize the manual recount, the recount must include at least three precincts and at least one percent of the total votes cast for each candidate or issue, with the person who requested the recount choosing the precincts to be recounted. If the manual recount indicates an ''error in the vote tabulation which could affect the outcome of the election,'' the county canvassing board ''shall'':    (a) Correct the error and recount the remaining precincts with the vote tabulation system;     (b) Request the Department of State to verify the tabulation software; or    (c) Manually recount all ballots.    The issue in dispute here is the meaning of the phrase ''error in the vote tabulation'' found in section 102.166(5). The Division opines that an ''error in the vote tabulation'' onlymeans a counting error resulting from incorrect election parameters or an error in the vote tabulating software. We disagree.   n The plain language of section 102.166(5) refers to an error in the vote tabulation rather than the vote tabulation system. On its face, the statute does not include any words of limitation; rather, it provides a remedy for any type of mistake made in tabulating ballots. The Legislature has utilized the phrase ''vote tabulation system'' and ''automatic tabulating equipment'' in section 102.166 when it intended to refer to the voting system rather than the vote count. Equating ''vote tabulation'' with ''vote tabulation system'' obliterates the distinction created in section 102.166 by the Legislature.    Sections 101.5614(5) and (6) also support the proposition that the ''error in vote tabulation'' encompasses more than a mere determination of whether the vote tabulation system is functioning. Section 101.5614( 5) provides that ''no vote shall be declared invalid or void if there is a clear indication of the intent of the voter as determined by the canvassing board.'' Conversely, section 101.5614( 6) provides that any vote in which the Board cannot discern the intent of the voter must be discarded. Taken together, these sections suggest that ''error in the vote tabulation'' includes errors in the failure of the voting machinery to read a ballot and not simply errors resulting from the voting machinery.    Moreover, section 102.141(4), which outlines the Board's responsibility in the event of a recount, states that the Board ''shall examine the counters on the machines or the tabulation of the ballots cast in each precinct in which the office or issue appeared on the ballot and determine whether the returns correctly reflect the votes cast.'' Therefore, an ''error in the vote tabulation'' includes a discrepancy between the number of votes determined by a voter tabulation system and the number of voters determined by a manual count of a sampling of precincts pursuant to section 102.166(4).    The Applicable Law      The abiding principle governing all election law in Florida is set forth in article I, section 1, Florida Constitution: SECTION 1. Political power. All political power is inherent in the people. The enunciation herein of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or impair others retained by the people.     The constitution further provides that elections shall be regulated by law:    SECTION 1. Regulation of elections. All elections by the people shall be by direct and secret vote. General elections shall be determined by a plurality of votes cast. Registration and elections shall, and political party functions may, be regulated by law; however, the requirements for a candidate with no party affiliation or for a candidate of a minor party for placement of the candidate's name on the ballot shall be no greater than the requirements for a candidate of the party having the largest number of registered voters.     The Florida Election Code (''Code''), contained in chapters 97 106, Florida Statutes (2000), sets forth specific criteria regulating elections. The Florida Secretary of State is the chief election officer of the state and is charged with general oversight of the election system. The Supervisor of Elections (''Supervisor'') in each county is an elected official and is charged with appointing two Election Boards for each precinct within the county prior to an election. Each Election Board is composed of inspectors and clerks, all of whom must be residents of the county,  and is charged with conducting the voting in the election, counting the votes, and certifying the results to the Supervisor by noon of the day following the election. The County Canvassing Board (''Canvassing Board'' or ''Board''), which is composed of the Supervisor, a county court judge, and the chair of the board of county commissioners, then canvasses the returns countywide, reviews the certificates, and transmits the returns for state and federal officers to the Florida Department of State (' Department') by 5:00 p.m. of the seventh day following the election. No deadline is set for filing corrected, amended, or supplemental returns.    The Elections Canvassing Commission (''Canvassing Commission'' or ''Commission''), which is composed of the Governor, the Secretary of State, and the Director of the Division of Elections, canvasses the returns statewide, determines and declares who has been elected for each office, and issues a certificate of election for each office as soon as the results are compiled. If any returns appear to be irregular or false and the Commission is unable to determine the true vote for a particular office, the Commission certifies that fact and does not include those returns in its canvass. In determining the true vote, the Commission has no authority to look beyond the county's returns. A candidate or elector can ''protest'' the returns of an election as being erroneous by filing a protest with the appropriate County Canvassing Board. And finally, a candidate, elector, or taxpayer can ''contest'' the certification of election results by filing a post- certification action in circuit court within certain time limits and setting forth specific grounds.    Statutory Ambiguity      The provisions of the Code are ambiguous in two significant areas. First, the time frame for conducting a manual recount under section 102.166(4) is in conflict with the time frame for submitting county returns under sections 102.111 and 102.112. Second, the mandatory language in section 102.111 conflicts with the permissive language in 102.112.    A. The Recount Conflict     Section 102.166( 1) states that 'any candidate for nomination or election, or any elector qualified to vote in the election related to such candidacy shall have the right to protest the returns of the election as being erroneous by filing with the appropriate canvassing board a sworn written protest.'' The time period for filing a protest is ''prior to the time the canvassing board certifies the results for the office being protested or within 5 days after midnight of the date the election is held, whichever is later.    Section 102.166(4)(a), the operative subsection in this case, further provides that, in addition to any protest, ''any candidate whose name appeared on the ballot . . . or any political party whose candidates'' names appeared on the ballot may file a written request with the county canvassing board for a manual recount accompanied by the ''reason that the manual recount is being requested.'' Section 102.166(4)(b) further provides that the written request may be made prior to the time the Board certifies the returns or within seventy-two hours after the election, whichever occurs later:    (4)( a) Any candidate whose name appeared on the ballot, any political committee that supports or opposes an issue which appeared on the ballot, or any political party whose candidates' names appeared on the ballot may file a written request with the county canvassing board for a manual recount. The written request shall contain a statement of the reason the manual recount is being requested.    (b) Such request must be filed with the canvassing board prior to the time the canvassing board certifies the results for the office being protested or within 72 hours after midnight of the date the election was held, whichever occurs later. -- 102.166, Fla. Stat. (2000) (emphasis added).    A Board ''may'' authorize a manual recount and such a recount must include at least three precincts and at least one percent of the total votes cast for the candidate. The following procedure then applies:    (5) If the manual recount indicates an error in the vote tabulation which could affect the outcome of the election, the county canvassing board shall:    (a) Correct the error and recount the remaining precincts with the vote tabulation system;    (b) Request the Department of State to verify the tabulation software; or    (c) Manually recount all ballots.    (6) Any manual recount shall be open to the public.    (7) Procedures for a manual recount are as follows:    (a) The county canvassing board shall appoint as many counting teams of at least two electors as is necessary to manually recount the ballots. A counting team must have, when possible, members of at least two political parties. A candidate involved in the race shall not be a member of the counting team.    (b) If a counting team is unable to determine a voter's intent in casting a ballot, the ballot shall be presented to the county canvassing board for it to determine the voter's intent.     Under this scheme, a candidate can request a manual recount at any point prior to certification by the Board and such action can lead to a full recount of all the votes in the county. Although the Code sets no specific deadline by which a manual recount must be completed, logic dictates that the period of time required to complete a full manual recount may be substantial, particularly in a populous county, and may require several days. The protest provision thus conflicts with section 102.111 and 102.112, which state that the Boards 'must' submit their returns to the Elections Canvassing Commission by 5: 00 p. m. of the seventh day following the election or face penalties. For instance, if a party files a pre-certification protest on the sixth day following the election and requests a manual recount and the initial manual recount indicates that a full countywide recount is necessary, the recount procedure in most cases could not be completed by the deadline in sections 102.111 and 102.112, i. e., by 5: 00 p. m. of the seventh day following the election.    B. The 'Shall' and 'May' Conflict     In addition to the conflict in the above statutes, sections 102.111 and 102.112 contain a dichotomy. Section 102.111, which sets forth general criteria governing the State Canvassing Commission, was enacted in 1951 as part of the Code and provides as follows:    102.111 Elections Canvassing Commission.    (1) Immediately after certification of any election by the county canvassing board, the results shall be forwarded to the Department of State concerning the election of any federal or state officer. The Governor, the Secretary of State, and the Director of the Division of Elections shall be the Elections Canvassing Commission. The Elections Canvassing Commission shall, as soon as the official results are compiled from all counties, certify the returns of the election and determine and declare who has been elected for each office. In the event that any member of the Elections Canvassing Commission is unavailable to certify the returns of any election, such member shall be replaced by a substitute member of the Cabinet as determined by the Director of the Division of Elections. If the county returns are not received by the Department of State by 5 p.m. of the seventh day following an election, all missing counties shall be ignored, and the results shown by the returns on file shall be certified.    -- 102.111, Fla. Stat. (2000) (emphasis added).    The Legislature in 1989 revised chapter 102 to include section 102.112, which provides that returns not received after a certain date ''may'' be ignored and that members of the County Board ''shall'' be fined:     102.112 Deadline for submission of county returns to the Department of State; penalties:    (1) The county canvassing board or a majority thereof shall file the county returns for the election of a federal or state officer with the Department of State immediately after the certification of the election results. Returns must be filed by 5 p. m. on the 7th day following the first primary and general election and by 3 p. m. on the 3rd day following the second primary. If the returns are not received by the department by the time specified, such returns may be ignored and the results on file at that time may be certified by the department.    (2) The department shall fine each board member $200 for each day such returns are late, the fine to be paid only from the board member's personal funds. Such fines shall be deposited into the Election Campaign Financing Trust fund, created by s. 106.32. (3) Members of the county canvassing board may appeal such fines to the Florida Elections Commission, which shall adopt rules for such appeals.     -- 102.112, Fla. Stat. (2000) (emphasis added).     The above statutes conflict. Whereas section 102.111 is mandatory, section 102.112 is permissive. While it is clear that the boards must submit returns by 5 p. m. of the seventh day following the election or face penalties, the circumstances under which penalties may be assessed are unclear.    Legislative Intent       Legislative intent -- as always -- is the polestar that guides a court's inquiry into the provisions of the Florida Election Code. Where the language of the code is clear and amenable to a reasonable and logical interpretation, courts are without power to diverge from the intent of the Legislature as expressed in the plain language of the code. As noted above, however, Chapter 102 is unclear concerning both the time limits for submitting the results of a manual recount and the penalties that may be assessed by the secretary. In light of this ambiguity, the court must resort to traditional rules of statutory construction in an effort to determine legislative intent.    First, it is well-settled that where two statutory provisions are in conflict, the specific statute controls the general statute. In the present case, whereas Section 102.111 in its title and text addresses the general makeup and duties of the Elections Canvassing Commission, the statute only tangentially addresses the penalty for returns filed after the statutory date, noting that such returns ''shall'' be ignored by the Department. Section 102.112, on the other hand, directly addresses in its title and text both the ''deadline'' for submitting returns and the ''penalties'' for submitting returns after a certain date; the statute expressly states that such returns ''may'' be ignored and that dilatory board members ''shall'' be fined. Based on the precision of the title and text, Section 102.112 constitutes a specific penalty statute that defines both the deadline for filing returns and the penalties for filing returns thereafter, and Section 102.111 constitutes a nonspecific statute in this regard. The specific statute controls the nonspecific statute.    Second, it also is well-settled that when two statutes are in conflict, the more recently enacted statute controls the older statute. In the present case, the provision in Section 102.111 stating that the department ''shall'' ignore returns was enacted in 1951 as part of the code. On the other hand, the penalty provision in Section 102.112 stating that the Department ''may'' ignore returns was enacted in 1989 as a revision to Chapter 102. The more recently enacted provision may be viewed as the clearest and most recent expression of legislative intent.     Third, a statutory provision will not be construed in such a way that it renders meaningless or absurd any other statutory provision. In the present case, Section 102.112 contains a detailed provision authorizing the assessment of fines against members of a dilatory County Canvassing Board. The fines are personal and substantial, i. e., $200 for each day the returns are not received. If, as the secretary asserts, the department were required to ignore all returns received after the statutory date, the fine provision would be meaningless. For example, if a board simply completed its count late and if the returns were going to be ignored in any event, what would be the point in submitting the returns? The board would simply file no returns and avoid the fines. But, on the other hand, if the returns submitted after the statutory date would not be ignored, the board would have good reason to submit the returns and accept the fines. The fines thus serve as an alternative penalty and are applicable only if the department may count the returns.    Fourth, related statutory provisions must be read as a cohesive whole. As stated in Forsythe v. Longboat Key Beach Erosion Control Dist., ''all parts of a statute must be read together in order to achieve a consistent whole. Where possible, courts must give effect to all statutory provisions and construe related statutory provisions in harmony with another.'' In this regard we consider the provisions of Section 102.166 and 102.168. Section 102.166 states that a candidate, political committee, or political party may request a manual recount any time before the County Canvassing Board certifies the results to the department and, if the initial manual recount indicates a significant error, the board ''shall'' conduct a countywide manual recount in certain cases. Thus, if a protest is filed on the sixth day following an election and a full manual recount is required, the board, through no fault of its own, will be unable to submit its returns to the department by 5: 00 p. m. on the seventh day following the election. In such a case, if the mandatory provision in Section 102.111 were given effect, the votes of the county would be ignored for the simple reason that the board was following the dictates of a different section of the code. The legislature could not have intended to penalize County Canvassing Boards for following the dictates of the code.    And finally, when the Legislature enacted the Code in 1951, it envisioned that all votes cast during a particular election, including absentee ballots, would be submitted to the department at one time and would be treated in a uniform fashion. Section 97.012 (1) states that it is the secretary's responsibility to ''[o] btain and maintain uniformity in the application, operation, and interpretation of the election laws.'' Chapter 101 provides that all votes, including absentee ballots, must be received by the supervisor no later than 7 p. m. on the day of the election. Section 101.68 (2)(d) expressly states that ''[t]he votes on absentee ballots shall be included in the total vote of the county.'' Chapter 102 requires that the board submit the returns by 5 p.m. on the seventh day following the election.     The legislature thus envisioned that when returns are submitted to the department, the returns ''shall'' embrace all the votes in the county, including absentee ballots. This, of course, is not possible because our state  statutory scheme has been superseded by federal law governing overseas voters; overseas ballots must be counted if received no later than 10 days following the election (i.e., the ballots do not have to be received by 7 p.m. of the day of the election, as provided by state law). In light of the fact that overseas ballots cannot be counted until after the seven day deadline has expired, the mandatory language in section 102.111 has been supplanted by the permissive language of section 102.112.    Further, although county returns must be received by 5 p. m. on the seventh day following an election, the ''official results'' that are to be compiled in order to certify the returns and declare who has been elected must be construed in pari materia with section 101.5614 (8), which specifies that \\"write-in, absentee and manually counted results shall constitute the official return of the election.\\"     Under this statutory scheme, the County Canvassing Boards are required to submit their returns to the Department by 5 p. m. of the seventh day following the election. The statutes make no provision for exceptions following a manual recount. If a Board fails to meet the deadline, the Secretary is not required to ignore the county's returns but rather is permitted to ignore the returns within the parameters of this statutory scheme. To determine the circumstances under which the Secretary may lawfully ignore returns filed pursuant to the provisions of section 102.166 for a manual recount , it is necessary to examine the interplay between our statutory and constitutional law at both the state and federal levels.    THE RIGHT TO VOTE 29       The text of our Florida Constitution begins with a Declaration of Rights, a series of rights so basic that the founders accorded them a place of special privilege. The Court long ago noted the venerable role the Declaration plays in our tripartite system of government in Florida:    ''It is significant that our Constitution thus commences by specifying those things which the state government must not do, before specifying certain things that it may do. These Declarations of Rights . . . have cost much, and breathe the spirit of that sturdy and self-reliant philosophy of individualism which underlies and supports our entire system of government. No race of hothouse plants could ever have produced and compelled the recognition of such a stalwart set of basic principles, and no such race can preserve them. They say to arbitrary and autocratic power, from whatever official quarter it may advance to invade these vital rights of personal liberty and private property, ''Thus far shalt thou come, but no farther.''    Courts must attend with special vigilance whenever the Declaration of Rights is in issue.     The right of suffrage is the preeminent right contained in the Declaration of Rights, for without this basic freedom all others would be diminished. The importance of this right was acknowledged by the authors of the Constitution, who placed it first in the Declaration. The very first words in the body of the constitution are as follows:    SECTION 1. Political power.- All political power is inherent in the people. The enunciation herein of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or impair others retained by the people.     The framers thus began the constitution with a declaration that all political power inheres in the people and only they, the people, may decide how and when that power may be given up.     To the extent that the Legislature may enact laws regulating the electoral process, those laws are valid only if they impose no ''unreasonable or unnecessary'' restraints on the right of suffrage: The declaration of rights expressly states that \\"all political power is inherent in the people.\\" Article I, Section 1, Florida Constitution. The right of the people to select their own officers is their sovereign right, and the rule is against imposing unnecessary and unreasonable [restraints on that right]. . . . Unreasonable or unnecessary restraints on the elective process are prohibited.     Because election laws are intended to facilitate the right of suffrage, such laws must be construed liberally in favor of the citizens right to vote:    ''Generally, the courts, in construing statutes relating to elections, hold that the same should receive a liberal construction in favor of the citizen whose right to vote they tend to restrict and in so doing to prevent disfranchisement of legal voters and the intention of the voters should prevail when counting ballots . . . It is the intention of the law to obtain an honest expression of the will or desire of the voter.''     Courts must not lose sight of the fundamental purpose of election laws: The laws are intended to facilitate and safeguard the right of each voter to express his or her will in the context of our representative democracy. Technical statutory requirements must not be exalted over the substance of this right. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the authority of the Florida Secretary of State to ignore amended returns submitted by a County Canvassing Board may be lawfully exercised only under limited circumstances as we set forth in this opinion. The clear import of the penalty provision of section 102.112 is to deter Boards from engaging in dilatory conduct contrary to statutory authority that results in the late certification of a county's returns. This deterrent purpose is achieved by the fines in section 102.112, which are substantial and personal and are levied on each member of a Board. The alternative penalty, i. e., ignoring the county's returns, punishes not the Board members themselves but rather the county's electors, for it in effect disenfranchises them.    Ignoring the county's returns is a drastic measure and is appropriate only if the returns are submitted to the Department so late that their inclusion will compromise the integrity of the electoral process in either of two ways: (1) by precluding a candidate, elector, or taxpayer from contesting the certification of an election pursuant to section 102.168; or (2) by precluding Florida voters from participating fully in the federal electoral process. 55 In either case, the Secretary must explain to the Board her reason for ignoring the returns and her action must be adequately supported by the law. To disenfranchise electors in an effort to deter Board members, as the Secretary in the present case proposes, is unreasonable, unnecessary, and violates longstanding law.    Allowing the manual recounts to proceed in an expeditious manner, rather than imposing an arbitrary seven-day deadline, is consistent not only with the statutory scheme but with prior United States Supreme Court pronouncements:    ''Indiana has found, along with many other States, that one procedure necessary to guard against irregularity and error in the tabulation of votes is the availability of a recount. Despite the fact that a certificate of election may be issued to the leading candidate within 30 days after the election, the results are not final if a candidate's option to compel a recount is exercised. A recount is an integral part of the Indiana electoral process and is within the ambit of the broad powers delegated to the States by Art. I, s 4.''     In addition, an accurate vote count is one of the essential foundations of our democracy. The words of the Supreme Court of Illinois are particularly apt in this case:    ''The purpose of our election laws is to obtain a correct expression of the intent of the voters. Our courts have repeatedly held that, where the intention of the voter can be ascertained with reasonable certainty from his ballot, that intention will be given effect even though the ballot is not strictly in conformity with the law. . . . The legislature authorized the use of electronic tabulating equipment to expedite the tabulating process and to eliminate the possibility of human error in the counting process, not to create a technical obstruction which defeats the rights of qualified voters. This court should not, under the appearance of enforcing the election laws, defeat the very object which those law are intended to achieve. To invalidate a ballot which clearly reflects the voter's intent, simply because a machine cannot read it, would subordinate substance to form and promote the means at the expense of the    end.   The voters here did everything which the Election Code requires when they punched the appropriate chad with the stylus. These voters should not be disfranchised where their intent may be ascertained with reasonable certainty, simply because the chad they punched did not completely dislodge from the ballot. Such a failure may be attributable to the fault of the election authorities, for failing to provide properly perforated paper, or it may be the result of the voter's disability or inadvertence. Whatever the reason, where the intention of the voter can be fairly and satisfactorily ascertained, that intention should be given effect.''    THE PRESENT CASE      The trial court below properly concluded that the County Canvassing Boards are required to submit their returns to the Department by 5: 00 p.m. of the seventh day following the election and that the Department is not required to ignore the amended returns but rather may count them. The court, however, erred in holding that the Secretary acted within her discretion in prematurely rejecting any amended returns that would be the result of ongoing manual recounts. The Secretary's rationale for rejecting the Board's returns was as follows:    ''The Board has not alleged any facts or circumstances that suggest the existence of voter fraud. The Board has not alleged any facts or circumstances that suggest that there has been substantial noncompliance with the state's statutory election procedures, coupled with reasonable doubt as to whether the certified results expressed the will of the voters. The Board has not alleged any facts or circumstances that suggest that Palm Beach County has been unable to comply with its election duties due to an act of God, or other extenuating circumstances that are beyond its control. The Board has alleged the possibility that the results of the manual recount could affect the outcome of the election if certain results obtain.'' . . .     We conclude that, consistent with the Florida election scheme, the Secretary may reject a Board's amended returns only if the returns are submitted so late that their inclusion will preclude a candidate from contesting the certification or preclude Florida's voters from participating fully in the federal electoral process. The Secretary in the present case has made no claim that either of these conditions apply at this point in time. The above analysis is consistent with State ex rel. Chappell v. Martinez, wherein the Court addressed a comparable recount issue. There, the total votes cast for each of two candidates for a seat in the United State House of Representatives were separated by less than one-half of one percent; the county conducted a mandatory recount; the Board's certification of results was not received by the Department until two days after the deadline, although the Board had telephoned the results to the Department prior to the deadline; and the unsuccessful candidate sued to prevent the Department from counting the late votes. The Court concluded that the will of the electors supersedes any technical statutory requirements:    ''[T]he electorate's effecting its will through its balloting, not the hypertechnical compliance with statutes, is the object of holding an election. \\"There is no magic in the statutory requirements. If they are complied with to the extent that the duly responsible election officials can ascertain that the electors whose votes are being canvassed are qualified and registered to vote, and that they do so in a proper manner, then who can be heard to complain the statute has not been literally and absolutely complied with?''    CONCLUSION      According to the legislative intent evinced in the Florida Election Code, the permissive language of section 102.112 supersedes the mandatory language of section 102.111. The statutory fines set forth in section 102.112 offer strong incentive to County Canvassing Boards to submit their returns in a timely fashion. However, when a Board certifies its returns after the seven-day period because the Board is acting in conformity with other provisions of the Code or with administrative rules or for other good cause, the Secretary may impose no fines. It is unlikely that the Legislature would have intended to punish a Board for complying with the dictates of the Code or some other law.    Because the right to vote is the pre-eminent right in the Declaration of Rights of the Florida Constitution, the circumstances under which the Secretary may exercise her authority to ignore a county's returns filed after the initial statutory date are limited. The Secretary may ignore such returns only if their inclusion will compromise the integrity of the electoral process in either of two ways: (1) by precluding a candidate, elector, or taxpayer from contesting the certification of election pursuant to section 102.168; or (2) by precluding Florida voters    from participating fully in the federal electoral process. In either such case, this drastic penalty must be both reasonable and necessary. But to allow the Secretary to summarily disenfranchise innocent electors in an effort to punish dilatory Board members, as she proposes in the present case, misses the constitutional mark. The constitution eschews punishment by proxy.    As explained above, the Florida Election Code must be construed as a whole. Section 102.166 governs manual recounts and appears to conflict with sections 102.111 and 102.112, which set a seven day deadline by which County Boards must submit their returns. Further, section 102.111, which provides that the Secretary \\"shall\\" ignore late returns, conflicts with section 102.112, which provides that the Secretary \\"may\\" ignore late returns. In the present case, we have used traditional rules of statutory construction to resolve these ambiguities to the extent necessary to address the issues presented here. We decline to rule more expansively, for to do so would result in this Court substantially rewriting the Code. We leave that matter to the sound discretion of the body best equipped to address it -- the Legislature.    Because of the unique circumstances and extraordinary importance of the present case, wherein the Florida Attorney General and the Florida Secretary of State have issued conflicting advisory opinions concerning the propriety of conducting manual recounts, and because of our reluctance to rewrite the Florida Election Code, we conclude that we must invoke the equitable powers of this Court to fashion a remedy that will allow a fair and expeditious resolution of the questions presented here.    Accordingly, in order to allow maximum time for contests pursuant to section 102.168, amended certifications must be filed with the Elections Canvassing Commission by 5 p. m. on Sunday, Nov. 26, 2000 and the Secretary of State and the Elections Canvassing Commission shall accept any such amended certifications received by 5 p. m. on Sunday, Nov.r 26, 2000, provided that the office of the Secretary of State, Division of Elections is open in order to allow receipt thereof. If the office is not open for this special purpose on Sunday, Nov. 26, 2000, then any amended certifications shall be accepted until 9 a. m. on Monday, Nov. 27, 2000. The stay order entered on November 17, 2000, by this Court shall remain in effect until the expiration of the time for accepting amended certifications set forth in this opinion. The certificates made and signed by the Elections Canvassing Commission pursuant to section 102.121 shall include the amended returns accepted through the dates set forth in this opinion.    It is so ordered. No motion for rehearing will be allowed.

Munich, finally, was our choice because, although we had not been there for about seven years, we knew it well enough to fit a representative sampling of its pleasures into only four days.   What we had not realized was that Thanksgiving coincided with the first weekend of Advent (as it does again this year), the date for the opening of the Christkindlmarkt -- literally, the Christ Child market -- the colorful and enticing outdoor Christmas fair held throughout Germany and Austria during the four weeks preceding Christmas. (Like so many other German Christmas customs, the Christkindlmarkt is, perhaps, the forerunner of our own holiday shopping spree, launched at precisely the same time of year.)

Marcia Gay Harden, as Dave's wife, Celeste, and Laura Linney, as her cousin Annabeth, who is married to Jimmy, expand the film's emotional compass, allowing us to see how grief ripples through families and communities.

Finally, the camera pans across a rubble-strewn city lot, followed by a grim-looking shot of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo (the producers say the photographs were all taken in New York over the last week). SCRIPT -- \\"This is Mario Cuomo's New York. Cuomo coddles criminals. Day and night, we are in danger -- on the street, at work, in school, even in our homes. Cuomo imposes crippling taxes. Business withers, jobs disappear, families suffer, dreams die. Cuomo plays politics. Working men and women pay the bills. Twelve years of Mario Cuomo. Can you afford four more? Dump Cuomo.

But this dark portrait is not meant as history","excerpt":"it is an emotional summation of the three themes that may defeat Mr. Cuomo: crime, jobs and taxes.

There has been bad blood between the two men: in 1986, Mr. Cuomo knocked Mr. Hirschfeld off the ballot when he tried to run for lieutenant governor and last year, Mr. Cuomo successfully opposed Mr. Hirschfeld's attempts to buy the New York Post. Though he says it is not revenge, Mr. Hirschfeld says he is spending from $250,000 to $1 million to broadcast this ad, first in New York City and Albany, then perhaps across the state. Mr. Hirschfeld said he supports the Republican candidate, State Senator George E. Pataki (who is not mentioned in the ad), but that his primary reason for the ad was \\"to help my fellow man\\" by presenting his vision of New York State under Mr. Cuomo.

During the seven years that we have had the data to make this comparison, the gap has exceeded current levels only in June, July, August and September of 1987.

They flatten their vowels, stretch their diphthongs and end up affecting a kind of mid-Atlantic drawl. If they are called upon to do urban speech, it invariably comes out dese-and-dose, regardless of the city or the period.   Some of the very best English actors have fallen victim to this syndrome, including no less an artist than Laurence Olivier. For example, Diana Quick, who was striking on ''Brideshead Revisited'' on television, was at the National Theater in London this season in David Hare's ''A Map of the World,'' play-acting an American journalist and sounding like a bad imitation of Jane Fonda.   The problem is deepened by the fact that American musicals and plays, especially those from the recent past, have become increasingly popular on the London stage - works by, among others, Arthur Miller, Eugene O'Neill, and Kaufman and Hart. In the replacement cast of ''Guys and Dolls,'' a long-running revival at the National Theater, many of the accents are out of kilter, especially that of the actor playing Sky Masterson, that archetypal urban sharpie.

Bruce Beresford's film, about a French Jesuit missionary in 17th-century Canada, is filled with the kind of action and intensity found in old westerns. As a young priest named Laforgue makes his way from Quebec to a distant Huron Indian mission, he is aided by friendly Algonquins, abducted and tortured by Iroquois, mocked by a dwarf shaman with bright yellow paint on his face and lost in a visually magnificent and deadly cold forest.    But because this is a 1990's film, the Frenchman comes to question the righteousness of his own culture, and that is where the true, unusual power of \\"Black Robe\\" lies. Adapted by Brian Moore from his novel, the film evenhandedly depicts the integrity of the Indians and the sincerity of the Jesuits. In an era of Columbus bashing, it criticizes cultural imperialism without creating villains","excerpt":"it is as politically correct as \\"Dances With Wolves,\\" but its hero does not experience a simple-minded conversion to Indian ways, as if he had been bumped on the head. There is much wrongheaded behavior in \\"Black Robe,\\" but no evil intentions, which makes the cultural tug of war it depicts sadder and more lucid than it usually is on screen.

Mr.  Roche, who is also the architect of the United Nations Plaza Hotel and the Metropolitan Museum additions in New York, is particularly noted for his work with glass and metal, and it is generally along the lines of what has come to be known as Late Modernism - an architecture that uses the sleek, smooth surfaces of Modernism to produce forms that are less purely rational and more picturesque than the cool, austere boxes that are the most common legacy of modern architecture.

Suares, offer both famous and anonymous photographs of dogs and cats. Each animal's face mirrors or mocks the mannerisms -- irritation, hamming, nonchalance, zeal -- that we humans reveal when having our picture taken. For example, in Dennis Mosner's shots, his unusual focal point is the animals' gaze. Meeting the lens, his subjects stare directly at us","excerpt":"it is as though he has enabled their expressions to flow across the distance between our species. Even when a cat or dog remains oblivious to the camera, the animal seems to stand in for us, offering a sense of ourselves. Cats are poseurs by nature: a camera insinuating itself -- much like an owner's commanding voice -- hardly diverts a cat from its natural inclinations. Dogs are more often caught amid their doggy doings, and even in midair, as in Jacques-Henri Lartigue's 1912 photo of a dog catapulting from its owner's arms. These photographs are true companion pieces -- whether they include notables like Franklin D. Roosevelt, Eva Gabor, Mark Twain and Alfred Hitchcock, or anonymous children. Though renowned photographers including Mary Ellen Mark, Edward Steichen and Robert Mapplethorpe occupy these pages, the real archive, as Mr. Suares, a writer, illustrator and book designer, points out, is contained in our own homes: 5 percent of the 16 billion pictures we take each year are of animals.

In this collection, which won the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction, the first story is about a girl's first lover, and the last is about final, perfect ''communion between man and woman.'' In between are selected milestones in a life. Sandra Thompson has written about them in a terse, flat style, as if the material were too strong to bear expanding upon. Fragments are offered up without comment, juxtaposed to make a covert point the author does not wish to state outright. Thus defloration takes place in ''Horror Story'' side by side with the ghoulish tricks of a younger brother emulating movie monsters. Elsewhere, a Mother's Day dinner is paired with rape scenes. And finally, the perfect communion seems to occur more between the narrator and a Florida hotel than between the narrator and her lover. The malaise is familiar","excerpt":"it is assumed men let women down, overlook women's feelings, use too much or not enough force and in general just do not care. These stories are really about resentment, which the author hopes to make us share by piling up small, sharp details. Unfortunately, the details are more often prosaic - designer jeans and weekend traffic - than evocative. The ambiance that results makes it difficult for convincing characters to emerge.

We are still feeling the scars of a tong, confused period in the modern history of literary criticism in which this issue has been fought over, and perhaps fought out. Poetry is still the supremely inclusive speech which escapes, as if unaware of them, the strictures and reductions of the systematic logical understanding. Publicly or tacitly, we probably all have some sort of theology, and its teachings are quite capable of entering into a poem, perhaps without losing any of their compulsion. It is difficult to write the proper poem nowadays because after many ages of hard prose we have come far from the primitive and natural speech of poetry. But it is still being handsomely done. In a true poem it is as if the religious dogma or the moral maxim had been dropped into the pot as soon as the act of composition began; sinking down out of sight and consciousness, it is as if it became a fluid and was transfused into the bloodstream of the poet now, and would be communicated to the bloodstream of his auditors eventually.

SARAH SLOBIN    WORLD WAR I    SPEAKING AT SILENT MOVIES  In 1917 an army of 75,000 volunteers called the Four-Minute Men, like those at left, were recruited by George Creel, a journalist and advertising man. They made patriotic war speeches to audiences before the start of (silent) movies.    ''Matters lying outside our own life as a nation and over which we had no control, but which, despite our wish to keep free of them, have drawn us more and more irresistibly into their own current and influence. It has been impossible to avoid them.''  --President Woodrow Wilson    WORLD WAR II    MOVIE REELS AND MOVIE STARS  President Roosevelt touted Hollywood as an essential war industry. Movie stars and entertainers like the Andrews Sisters, right, collaborated on newsreels. Support was easy to generate as Pearl Harbor came on the heels of the Depression, and war brought with it not only hope for an economic bounce but clear-cut enemies to despise.    ''Today we seek a moral basis for peace. . . . It cannot be a lasting peace if the fruit of it is oppression, or starvation, cruelty, or human life dominated by armed camps. It cannot be a sound peace if small nations must live in fear of powerful neighbors. It cannot be a moral peace if freedom from invasion is sold for tribute.''  --President Franklin D. Roosevelt    THE KOREAN WAR    PSYCHOLOGY AND PUBLIC RELATIONS    The propaganda machine was in full swing, but its focus shifted toward the Korean people and American soldiers. Psychological warfare leaflets, like those being packed into a shell at left, were dropped in the hopes of inducing the North Koreans to surrender. General Douglas MacArthur, who censored news reports from the front lines, disagreed with the Truman administration's war policy and was later dismissed.    ''It must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.''  --President Harry S. Truman    COLD WAR    NIXON IN THE KITCHEN    At a model of an American kitchen, an exhibit in Moscow to showcase capitalism, Vice President Richard M. Nixon and the Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev, fell into a much-publicized and heated debate.    ''The cold war isn't thawing","excerpt":"it is burning with a deadly heat. Communism isn't sleeping; it is, as always, plotting, scheming, working, fighting.''  --President Richard M. Nixon    VIETNAM WAR    SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL    While fear of spreading communism initially generated support for intervention in Vietnam, it was not enough to sustain it. The government had counted on television to promote its cause. Reporters were invited in to cover battle events. But when the television images began to include body bags and terrified children fleeing napalm attacks, popular support for the war eroded, and the media grew critical.    ''Just like the Alamo, somebody damn well needed to go to their aid. Well, by God, I'm going to Vietnam's aid!''  --President Lyndon B. Johnson    GULF WAR    A 24-HOUR OPERATION  The lessons of Vietnam brought tight restraints on the release of information even as cable news speeded the rhythm of war news on display. General Colin L. Powell presented remote airwar targeting techniques, while the voice of soldiers was delivered via the White House.    ''Listen to Master Sergeant J . P. Kendall of the 82nd Airborne: 'We're here for more than just the price of a gallon of gas. What we're doing is going to chart the future of the world for the next 100 years. It's better to deal with this guy now than 5 years from now.'''  --President George Bush    WAR AGAINST TERROR    SHAPING OPINION  Pictures of patriotism, like the photo backdrop, below, that President Bush spoke in front of on Thursday, are designed by recruits from media and advertising.

Kennedy was elected President because of television","excerpt":"it is certain that once in office he used    the medium with instinctive understanding. Style and   substance were inextricable, mutually reinforcing and   often confused, and if Mr. Kennedy's television persona does not make up our whole recollection about him, it certainly makes up a very large part. He was our first television President, and it is altogether fitting that television is marking his death, 20 years ago this month, with a number of programs about his life.   Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, his margin over Richard M. Nixon only 118,550 votes. At the start of the campaign, Mr. Nixon was far better known, the beneficiary, hard as it may be to credit now, of eight years of favorable coverage of his Vice Presidency. The press was predominantly print, not electronic, and its criticisms were confined mostly to the editorial pages. Television was young and altogether uncritical. Broadcasters read wire service stories; small images danced on small screens. White House reports showed President Eisenhower standing at a podium or greeting foreign visitors on the porch. Campaign coverage, meanwhile, was virtually unknown. TV WILL RECALL THE KENNEDY YEARS"},{"year":"1981","title":"IT may come as a surprise, but all charity benefits are not equal.  There are worthy causes and there are fashionable worthy causes. That a hospital is fashionable (would you believe it?) does not mean that it is more worthwhile than others, and a fashionable cultural event is not automatically better than others. The term simply indicates that the people who have taken them up are well known, social or rich, and that they then get their equally well-known, social or rich friends to contribute large sums and appear at their fund-raising parties.   There are also fashionable countries, but the standards are somewhat different. Countries with royalty, pretenders or titles of any kind are usually high on the list because these presences might be induced to attend fashionable events and are considered to add a certain tone.

William Powell is every inch Father, from his carrot patch dome to the tip of his button-up shoes. Even his voice, always so distinctive, has taken on a new quality, so completely has Mr. Powell managed to submerge his own personality. His Father is not merely a performance","excerpt":"it is character delineation of a high order and he so utterly dominates the picture that even when he is not on hand his presence is still felt.The Warner Brothers have kept faith with both the letter and the spirit of the play fashioned by Howard Lindsay and Russel Grouse from the late Clarence Day's memoirs of his father. Most of the action still takes place in the living room of the Day residence, 420 Madison Avenue. The atmosphere of the period, 1883, is recaptured with all the rich flavor of a Currier & Ives print, even though Father's \\"damns\\" have been excised. But his thunderous \\"oh, gads!\\" and explosive \\"what in tar-nations\\" are carefully preserved in the screen play written by Donald Ogden Stewart. However, while the camera provides a scope and fluidity of action which necessarily was missing on the stage, the benefits thus derived are more of a pictorial than a dramatic nature, for the pace of the story always accelerates when the camera is simply reproducing scenes as done on the stage.It sounds a bit absurd to be saying after all these years—eight to be exact—that \\"Life With Father\\" is the perfect family entertainment and that in it most everyone will notice a resemblance to something in his own family life. But that's the way it is, and perhaps there are some late comers who would like to know just a little about this domestic classic. Actually, \\"Life With Father\\" is not so much a story as it is a reflection of little incidents, which agitate a short tempered, despotic parent They are the kind of crises peculiar to family life, where a prudent husband and father of four sons attempts to run his home on a business-like basis. While Father goes into a towering rage at the slightest provocation, stamping his feet at the breakfast table when the coffee isn't right, he is at heart a very kind, tolerant and sympathetic old man (and we use that term most affectionately).For all his bluff and independence, Father would be lost without his patient, understanding wife, and one feels genuinely sorry for him in his hour of anxiety when mother lies ill upstairs and the doctors give him small comfort. It is almost unpardonable not to have mentioned Irene Dunne before this because she interprets Vinnie Day with charm, wit and an exactness that perfectly complement Mr. Powell's Father. The way she finally cajoles her rebellious husband into making the journey up to Audubon Park to submit to the baptismal rites which his parents had somehow overlooked is handled by Miss Dunne with great charm and feminine wile.The four Day boys—all redheads, naturally—are pleasingly played by Jimmy Lydon, the eldest, who has a crush on the visiting Mary Skinner; Martin Milner as John, the inventor; Johnny Calkins as Whitney, who would rather play baseball than study his catechism, and Derek Scott as little Harlan, who worries about meeting his un-baptized father in heaven. Elizabeth Taylor is very appealing as Mary Skinner, and other fine performances are contributed by Edmund Gwenn as the Rev. Dr. Lloyd; ZaSu Pitts as Cousin Cora and a string of maids too numerous to mention here.\\"Life With Father\\" has been expertly staged by the resourceful Michael Curtiz, who has made certain that none of the essential comedy is overdrawn. The Warner Brothers can be proud of a job well done and the rest of us thankful that a classical slice of Americana has been preserved intact.

By Jane Adams. (New American Library, $14.95.) Jane Adams's second novel is full of good intentions, including a powerful concept - parents and child rummaging through and sorting out post-di-vorce debris to decide what's worth saving and what should be tossed away. Yet while the conflicts beneath the surface - within and among the three characters -are potentially complex, they are usually glossed over. Anne Manning, who has been a single parent in the 12 years since Don Manning left her, is having trouble with their 14-year-old son. Her last resort is to send him to live with his father. The parents themselves lean so heavily to stereotype that at first the reader hopes they will be parodies. Don is the drifting macho stud on the decline who has spent his life bedding every woman in sight, even during his marriage. Anne fluctuates between being a helpless, left-all-alone woman and an attorney in search of independence. Her excuse for her son's troubles is that she ''has loved him too much'' (not to mention that the marijuana he smokes is taken from her drawer and the diet pills he sells are from her medi-cine cabinet). The only problems the author successfully deals with are the son's","excerpt":"it is clear why he has problems.

We finally have an adequate record of one of the most vital, idiosyncratic interpreters of the 20th century.   Among other things, Horenstein was the greatest Mahler conductor of his generation, perhaps of any generation.

The choice of that version is probably wise. For Paris, Rossini expanded the ensembles and eliminated some of the more florid arias from the 1818 Naples original, and singers who can really handle such ornamentation have always been rare.

For that rising young company's latest and so far, we believe, brightest offering, now at the Globe Theatre, is a most implausible, a most insubstantial and a most charming picture, full of delightful Gilbert and Sullivan people, and called, for no discernible reason, \\"The Girl Said No.\\" Its plot, admittedly, is a cheap thing, involving a chiseling taxi dance hall \\"hostess\\" and a spiteful bookmaker, yet its total effect persists, through a haze of contradictory impressions, as one of the better entertainment investments of the season.Most of the credit for this minor miracle rightfully belongs to the Savoyards: to William Danforth, Vera Ross, Frank Moulan, Vivian Hart, whose names appear in smaller type in the official cast of characters, and who bring to their roles, besides their traditionary tonal and lingual dexterity and sprightliness, a fine and touching quality of archaism. Yet even the principals should be allowed a little of the praise: the attractive Irene Hervey as the hard, calculating, sentimental, loyal and (through the author's fault, rather than Miss Hervey's) extremely unconvincing taxi dancer, and Robert Armstrong as the bookie who becomes a producer on less than a shoestring in order to get even with Irene for the beautiful shakedown she gave him one ardent evening.The picture has numerous flaws of structure and characterization, if you want to be captious","excerpt":"it is guilty of telegraphing its punches at night-letter length; it demands of the conscientious Miss Hervey too many lightning reversals of her moral field, and it reaches new heights of the absurd when the metropolitan critics are so deeply moved at the première that they delegate a spokesman to rise and publicly pledge their columns to the show. Otherwise (and upon re-reading all this it seems amazing even to usthat \\"The Girl Said No\\" succeeds as prettily as it does) there is something about the picture, we protest.When Mr. Danforth, as the Mikado, bravely snaps open his fan beneath the noses of an unfriendly world, when Mr. Moulan, twirling his samurai blade, comes tripping out as the Lord High Executioner, into an essentially hostile age, and when he and Mr. Danforth and Miss Hart hurl themselves into the polysyllabic prosody of W. S. Gilbert (in the Patter Song from \\"Ruddigore\\"), while, you feel, the gallery sardonically snickers, the film takes on a nostalgic and indefinable pathos. It is hard to foresee what professional Savoyards may think—possibly they will resent the patronage of such a trashy, colloquial upstart as the motion picture. Undeniably, it is all very ephemeral and unimportant.

And if the narrative is not always consistent, it does offer a moral, which might be summed up as \\"There's no fool like an old fool,\\" or that men with frosted hair ought to keep to their wives and avoid the primrose path. The basic thought of the picture is one which in the hands of an O. Henry might have been turned into a far more intriguing tale.Frank Morgan, with powdered hair and mustache, acts Mr. Yates, a capitalist who has amassed wealth by keeping his nose to the grindstone. At 49, when the story opens, it suddenly occurs to him that he ought to take life more easily. He wants to study music, but that notion fails, and Elinor, his wife, who is far from being a grouch, is, however, too keen on her social functions to abandon them abruptly, as her husband wishes.Mrs. Yates gives one of her lavish parties, for which she engages a theatrical company to perform in a play. Her husband becomes intensely bored by the small talk and wanders out into the garden, where the butler, eventually, brings him his black coffee. Yates takes the tray from the servant and as he is carrying it to a more secluded point he encounters Blossom Bailey (Elissa Landi), who is studying her part for that night's dramatic effort. She thinks that Yates is the butler and asks him to listen to her speak her lines. He is glad to do so and even has the audacity to embrace her at the time set forth in the manuscript.Miss Bailey learns the following day that the man who kissed her was not the butler but the great John Hunter Yates. It leads to a rapid love affair and to Yates and Miss Bailey going to Europe, where he spends money without considering the exchange. Now and again the producers depict Mr. Yates as a tired man, who puffs and pants as he climbs several flights of stairs. The irony of it is that Zukowski, a musician, who is a good deal younger than Yates, dwells in an attic in Paris. He and Miss Bailey dart upstairs leaving poor Yates trying to recover his breath, and, of course, notwithstanding all that the millionaire does, Miss Bailey and Zukowski fall in love.It is another of those pictures with splendid performances. The characterizations also are nicely restrained. Doris Lloyd is excellent as Elinor Yates. Miss Landi is graceful and charming as Miss Bailey, and although Mr. Morgan never impresses one as being even elderly, certainly not aged, he gives a most ingratiating portrayal. Joseph Schildkraut acts his part with his usual savoir faire.There is on the same program a new Walt Disney \\"Silly Symphony\\" with two fresh characters—Donald Duck and Peter Pig. The feature is called \\"The Wise Little Hen\\" and it has much of the charm and imagination of the other colored works.For the stage offering Russell Markert contributes \\"Gay Divertissement,\\" with Sunny Fuller, Henrietta Schumann, Roy Barnes, Jack Lenny, the Rockettes and the ballet corps.

Ow-ow-ow-ow! Whoo!\\" Little Richard's first words to his audience on Tuesday night were barely words at all. Opening his first New York club engagement in 25 years, they were the sound of the wild-eyed, edge-of-anarchy exuberance that Richard Penniman brought to rock-and-roll in 1955, and that he can still summon at the age of 60 (his trumpeter brought him a birthday cake midset). Neither his audience nor his band could be sure what he would do next, whether he would banter, lead a sing-along, play a country song or tear into one of his hits.   \\"The beautiful Little Richard,\\" as he introduced himself, was a spectacle. He wore a rhinestone-ornamented fuchsia jacket that matched his boots, with his curly hair ready for shaking and his face a mask of makeup he soon sweated through. Behind the glitter was a hard-pumping boogie-woogie piano player and a singer who can bend notes into bluesy, sultry curves and whoop in a full-tilt falsetto.   His band isn't old-fashioned","excerpt":"it is heavier on the bass (with two bassists) and closer to guitar power chords than the backup on his mid-1950's hits. Once Little Richard's piano was raised to its rightful place in the mix, the music had a joyful kick, modernized but not denatured.   While Little Richard's songs may have seemed more startling in the button-down mid-1950's, they haven't lost their disruptive power. They are celebrations of and incitements to uninhibited pleasure, to \\"rip it up,\\" to \\"have some fun tonight,\\" hinting at sexual and other delights so great that mere language can't contain them; the only equivalent is speaking in tongues, with nonsense rhymes and with the holler that broke through \\"Long Tall Sally\\" and \\"Good Golly Miss Molly.\\" There's anger, too, behind the rasp of \\"Rip It Up\\" or \\"Keep a-Knockin'.\\"   Even as Little Richard's songs embrace chaos, there's no mistaking his control. On the piano his left hand is rock steady, his right a jackhammer of triplets and tremolos. His singing is precise; in a cornball country ballad, \\"No Place Like Home\\" (dedicated to his mother), his inflections shifted from blues to country, while the lonely \\"Send Me Some Lovin' \\" ached with loneliness. Bluesy phrases that sounded improvisatory would return in identical shape in the next verse; every whoop was placed in the rolling rhythm like a demolition team's sticks of TNT.    Little Richard never pretends to be anything but a legend. On Tuesday night, he brought Lloyd Price (who got Little Richard's hit-making career started) on stage to sing \\"Lawdy Miss Clawdy.\\" He also tossed off truncated versions of \\"Tutti Frutti\\" (tossing rhinestone pins to the crowd) and \\"Rip It Up,\\" and he took time for shtick, offering one-liners like \\"I have never been conceited: I'm convinced.\\" But his legend is earned, and he reclaimed it whenever he tore into a song.

Thus it is hardly surprising that the advent of relatively safe surgical and anesthetic techniques in the mid-20th century brought with it a great increase in the rate of hysterectomy -surgical removal of the uterus, or womb, usually after a woman has completed childbearing.   Based on the current rate, more than half the women in this country will undergo a hysterectomy by age 65.  In the 1970's hysterectomy, as the most common operation performed in the United States, nearly always by male surgeons, became a cause celebre among feminists, health-care economists and consumer groups, who viewed much of the surgery as a means of lining the doctor's pocket rather than protecting the patient's health.

Equipped with a Leica and  \\"an oval-shaped miniature 8-mm. camera whose name I have forgotten,\\" the anthropologist, feeling ambivalent about the use of photography in such a setting, nonetheless created a rare visual record of archery contests, funeral rites, face painting and other traditional customs, some of which have long since been abandoned. The photographs of the Nambikwara, the Bororo and the Caduveo form the centerpiece of Mr. Levi-Strauss's SAUDADES DO BRASIL: A Photographic Memoir (University of Washington, $39.95), skillfully translated from the French by Sylvia Modelski. There are also images of Sao Paulo in the 1930's when it was a frontier city of \\"singular beauty\\" and not yet one of the industrial capitals in the world, and of pristine Brazilian landscapes that now, in large or small part, bear the scars of mining and logging as well as other ravages of modernization. The reader might be surprised at the remarkable, if rueful, candor with which the renowned anthropologist introduces the volume: \\"The photographs leave me with the impression of a void, a lack of something the lens is inherently unable to capture.\\" Although Mr. Levi-Strauss, a chief architect of structural anthropology, declares that he is not a photographer, \\"not even an amateur,\\" the images here are skillful and compelling. But it is not the quality of the photographs he is apologizing for","excerpt":"it is history.

For Information About Fertility"},{"year":"1926","title":"MAGNIFICENTLY pictured detail overshadows the chronicle of \\"Upstage,\\" Monta Bell's latest photoplay which was at the Capitol last week. The glimpses back-stage and in the wings help to atone for the implausible situations and the weak story. The colorful incidents in the lives of the band of vaudeville troupers cause one to reflect that up to the present no such imagination has been shown in the fashioning of a circus story.This stage tale, through, its realistic background of incidents, stirs up thoughts of the different actors and performers one has seen on the road, the call of their profession, their enthusiasm each season during the first week or so, and then the eventual tediousness of going from one town to another, often dreading the new place. There are the women who look so attractive behind the footlights who, when they leave the stage-door of the theatre of one of the many one-night stands, are carelessly or, at least, loudly dressed. There is the bother they have with their baggage and Mr. Bell even gives an idea of the poor woman whose lot in life is to appear as a snake charmer, trying to pack her unwieldy pet in the railroad station. Then, also, there is, as in the play \\"Broadway,\\" a splendid idea of the limbering up of the players—those who have chosen to gain their livelihood by entertaining others. You observe the look of boredom on the faces of these people, an expression that changes to a business smile once they dart through the wings onto the centre of the stage.It is questionable whether Norma Shearer was a wise choice for the part of Dolly Haven in \\"Upstage,\\" for this character is supposed to be beautiful but virtually brainless. At least that is the idea in the chapters after the girl has undertaken to be Johnny Storm's dancing partner. Miss Shearer may be a fine screen actress and there is no doubt about her charm and prepossessing appearance","excerpt":"it is however just as obvious that she has by no means an unintelligent face and, so far, she has been unable to make herself look stupid on the screen. Therefore when she is called upon to play the rôle of a girl who is not supposed to be overburdened with gray matter it cannot be said that she fits the part. It would have been impressive to the audience had some of the many fuzzy-haired blondes of Hollywood been cast as Dolly Haven, or an actress who appeared to have the weight of the world on her mind if her hair was not properly curled, a girl obviously garrulous and skittish.Dolly Haven is first seen as a graduate of a business college in a small town arriving at the Pennsylvania Station. Instead of going to one of the many institutions that provide rooms for such girls, Dolly, without any deliberation, hastens over to a wretched rooming house, where the landlady has to cover up, furtively, a hole in the quilt. Miss Shearer's cast of countenance, her alert eyes and classic features, make one reflect that this girl is not going to this particular house because she chooses to, but because the director insisted that it was the place in which she must rent a room. Therefore she appeals to one as a philosopher, especially when she smiles at her gloomy surroundings and pays the rent.This Dolly, as portrayed by Miss Shearer, is not the type of girl who would be quite as cool as Dolly is made to appear when, with startling abruptness, she is asked by Johnny Storm, in an office whither she went to seek a position as stenographer, to be his dancing partner. When Johnny wants to know if she can dance, she, with a marvelous confidence in her ability, announces that she won a Charleston contest. Apparently, when engaging a partner, Johnny took everything for granted or believed all that was told to him. The theatrical booking agent tries to persuade him to engage another girl, but Johnny is so impressed by Dolly's looks that he won't listen to taking any one else.It is not long afterward that Johnny, when trying out a few steps with Dolly, decides that her beauty will have to suffice as her dancing is by no means sure or light-footed. Dolly is peeved when Johnny voices his opinion of her terpsichorean ability, and she leaves in high dudgeon—that is, she gets as far as the top of the stairs, when Johnny, struck by her imperious carriage and haughty look, asks her to come back. He even tells her to act the imperious creature over again, and this, one is supposed to believe, supplies the beauty end of his act and helps Johnny to \\"stop the show.\\"Oscar Shaw's characterization of Johnny is only hurt by the subtitles. What Mr. Shaw does is excellent, but what he is made to say and think is frequently absurd. He is the trouper, who is soft-hearted when it comes to a beautiful face like Norma Shearer's. He is willing to overlook her ignorance, her selfishness and her strained confidence in her ability. He is tender to her after she deserts him and elects another partner, a saturnine individual who also admires Dolly's type of beauty. This girl, of course, learns her lesson, but she does so with extreme suddenness.Another weak and rather irritating feature of this picture is where Mr. Bell deliberately takes his time in making a child tumble from a backstage balcony. The suspense is so awkwardly filmed that it not only destroys the effect but it almost is humorous before the child really does fall. This youngster has been fascinated by the lay figure belonging to a ventriloquist, and so after the accident Mr. Bell turns his camera onto the painted smile of the dummy.The climax to this tale of troupers again makes Dolly the director's puppet instead of her having a mind of her own. And Miss Shearer has a physiognomy that betrays the fact that she can think of herself.Milton Sills in the Desert.ANOTHER effort to make capital out of the Foreign Legion is \\"The Silent Lover,\\" the story of which is concerned with a Prince of an imaginary kingdom, who, after being a drunkard and a great lover and misappropriating Government funds, seeks seclusion in the famous French military body.Milton Sills is the heroic figure in this yarn, which possesses little dramatic quality and many utterly absurd situations. Natalie Kingston plays the part of Vera Sherman, the dainty heroine, who seems to be the type of girl who would wear satins and laces and no fur coat to a Thanksgiving football game. In this picture she appears on the desert in a costume which has probably never been seen on the Sahara before. It is a frock that would look very well on a June day in New York or London, but on the sands of the desert it is almost as much out of place as sables. Not that it is unsightly, but because one knows that in an Algerian fortress it would never remain in its state of perfection for five minutes. It is a contrast, if you will, to the soldiers' uniforms in the supposedly baked spot.The idea of having Charlie Murray furnish the comedy in this desert feature is not singularly clever. Mr. Murray's fun here is akin to his portrayal in \\"Subway Sadie,\\" which, being interpreted, means that it inspires sadness rather than merriment. It is the sort of comedy one could easily do without, and its only redeeming feature is that it can be forgotten readily.Hectic Comedy.THE liberal translation of Sam Janney's play, \\"Loose Ankles,\\" decorated the Hippodrome screen last week. According to the program it was adapted from a stage effort called \\"The Desperate Woman,\\" which was the first title of \\"Loose Ankles.\\" The film is an uproarious low comedy with a generous supply of hectic activity. It bears hardly any resemblance to the play, but it caused plenty of laughter, whether it was by the unceremonious tripping up of two intoxicated elderly spinsters or by Lloyd Hughes rushing around an apartment stripped of some of his clothes.None of the characters in this bag of tricks ever forgets the type of fun wanted of them. They don't think, except in a few early scenes, and this start makes one expect something really witty. It is a scene with a lawyer reading a will involving more than $6,000,000. The maiden aunts and their giddy nieces are present, and the spinsters obviously believe in age before beauty. Not only are they confident of inheriting the millions, but a moment before the reading of the will they are discussing how they will rebuff the attentions of admirers. They are rudely shocked when the thin-lipped lawyer, looking over the top of his spectacles, informs them that the $6,000,000 is to go to Ann, the more tranquil of the two nieces, provided that she marries within three days a man who is approved by both the maiden aunts. This testator had a distorted sense of humor, and evidently hoped that none of them would get a penny of the estate.In a dizzy way, Doris Kenyon and Virginia Lee Corbin supply the beauty for this film, while Lloyd Hughes endeavors to be a polite comedian. Age and greed with a sudden liking for strong drink are portrayed by Louise Fazenda and Ethel Wales, both of whom had to make drastic sacrifices in their personal appearances to look old and severe.A Love-Smitten Pirate.YOU can't make every man look like a pirate, even if this sea-robber dates back to 1815. This is proved by the sight of Ricardo Cortez in Frank Lloyd's new picture, \\"The Eagle of the Sea,\\" the tale of which is not a little confused. Mr. Cortez, his chin bearing an imperial, is somewhat benign and dreamy as a follower of the skull and crossbones. His looks imply that he is always in love, and, to be sure, he is throughout this tale, for he gazes upon Florence Vidor in the first chapter, after he has stopped her runaway horses. He does not appear as if he had ever thought a bloody deed, let alone committed one. Yet Mr. Cortez is called upon to impersonate the pirate Lafitte, who ashore was known as the law-abiding Captain Sazarac.To lighten up this yarn Frank Lloyd projects into the tale André Beranger as John Jarvis. Beranger will be re-called for his good work in Lubitsch's \\"So This Is Paris.\\" In this new picture he is a drunkard who through the subtitles is made to have a touch of poetry running through his wine-sodden mind. He is rather a pest, for he elects to pick up some discarded blossoms from the gutter and offers them to the heroine as flowers fresh with dew. He dies, but death does not fasten itself upon him until the last chapter! He is then on the bed, aboard the Seraphine, intended for none other than Napoleon. He therefore smiles inanely and vouchsafes that he has jested with life and that now death is jesting with him in having him pass away on an Emperor's bed.The chief idea of this story is concerned with an expedition of young society men who hope, and only hope, to rescue Napoleon from St. Helena. There is a counter-plot, and then there is Sazarac sipping wine, stopping runaway horses, dancing at a mask ball and looking none too fierce aboard ship. He is a most phlegmatic pirate, a kindly sea murderer!

(University Press of Kentucky, $19.) Pay women what they need and men what they are worth. That was once considered wage justice, Alice Kessler-Harris points out in this instructive collection of essays. With clarity, sense and only a little jargon, Ms. Kessler-Harris, a professor of history at Temple University, examines early 20th-century campaigns for a female minimum wage (resolved by New Deal legislation mandating wage minimums for both sexes), the battle for equal pay that culminated in passage of the 1963 Equal Pay Act, and current debates about comparable worth. The marketplace does not transcend social mores, she stresses in \\"A Woman's Wage\\"","excerpt":"it is immersed in them. White men have generally been paid more for their work than women and black men, in deference to traditional gender roles and social prejudice -- not because of some value-free law of supply and demand. The ideal of a male-headed family demanded that men be paid enough to support their wives and children, while women were paid less than enough to support themselves, she writes. Lower wage rates for women were also justified by myths about women's character: they were said to require more supervision because they were especially sensitive; they were considered able to survive on less because they were used to \\"drudgery\\"; and their fiscal irresponsibility supposedly made them apt to squander surplus income on fripperies. That some women shared these ideals did not make them less discriminatory. Still, wage policy reforms have complex and varying effects on various individual workers, as Ms. Kessler-Harris notes. Comparable worth, for example -- the equation of male and female jobs -- is part of a larger transformation of gender roles with some far-reaching, less than certain consequences. Ms. Kessler-Harris poses hard, pressing questions about wage justice and provides the historical perspective that is needed to answer them.

Like all hospitals, St. Luke's cannot afford to run short of vital items -- least of all in the operating rooms. At St. Luke's, Dr. Denton A. Cooley's teams perform open heart surgery on 3,000 patients each year, using prodigious quantities of supplies.    But to achieve economies as the pressure to control costs intensified, St. Luke's shut its warehouse and sold the inventory to Baxter International, a major hospital supplier. Baxter is becoming a full-time partner with this 950-bed hospital in managing, ordering and delivering Baxter's wares as well as the products of 400 other companies. Baxter's daily \\"just-in-time\\" deliveries to the hospital loading dock were only the first step. In an innovative system that hospitals call stockless inventory, Baxter fills orders in exact, sometimes small, quantities and delivers directly to departments, including the operating rooms and nursing floors, inside St. Luke's.   At least 50 hospitals buy stockless services from Baxter and a handful of smaller distributors. Converts to the concept are multiplying. About 250 more hospitals will go stockless in at least some departments in the next two years, said Pat Dolan, a partner in Chicago with Arthur Andersen & Company. Dolan recently studied stockless systems for the Health Industry Distributors Association.  Industry Leaders Competitors in a $15 Billion Market   The nation's 6,700 hospitals spent $15 billion last year on products like disposable gloves and gowns, sutures and therapeutic solutions. Baxter International, Johnson & Johnson and Abbott Laboratories dominate the market. Baxter is the largest manufacturer of hospital supplies, with 29 percent of the market, said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a securities analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. J. & J.'s share is 11 percent, and Abbott Laboratories has about 10 percent.   Baxter is also the leading distributor, with 28 percent of that market. The company says it makes 70 percent of the products it sells. But Baxter is also a middleman for many of its manufacturing rivals","excerpt":"it is Johnson & Johnson's largest customer for hospital supplies. J. & J.'s hospital products unit makes one-third of its sales directly to hospitals but, unlike Baxter, does not distribute supplies for other companies. Other major suppliers include Owens & Minor Inc. in Glen Allen, Va., with $1.2 billion in 1990 sales; the A. Stuart Company in Greensburg, Pa., with $600 million, and the General Medical Corporation in Richmond, with $340 million, said Mr. Abramowitz.  Multiple Benefits 'Just-in-Time' Means Less Handling    Hospital supply expenses only begin with the $15 billion in purchases. \\"For every dollar spent to buy a product, hospitals spend another dollar moving that product through the system,\\" said David Cassak, hospitals editor with In Vivo Business and Medicine Report, a trade magazine.    Stockless systems lower hospitals' holding and handling costs. \\"We think we've saved $1.5 million a year since 1988\\" from just-in-time deliveries alone, said Randy Jackson, a St. Luke's vice president, with another $500,000 likely once the stockless system is fully implemented. Annual savings already have included $350,000 from reducing staff and $162,500 from eliminating inventory. The hospital has converted storeroomsto patient care and other money-generating uses.    Vernon R. Loucks Jr., Baxter's chairman, said the company is introducing the stockless service, which it calls Valuelink, at 17 large hospitals. \\"We walk very carefully and slowly, because we can't afford a glitch,\\" he said. \\"The first morning that an operating room doesn't open, we've got a problem.\\"    The distributors profit from stockless services because they impose extra charges, raise prices more readily and often become a hospital's sole source of medical supplies. They typically add 3 percent to 5 percent service fees. \\"Our price might be slightly higher than what the hospital used to pay us, but their total cost is reduced,\\" said Glenn Dozier, the chief financial officer with Owens & Minor, whose major stockless client is the huge medical center of the University of California at Los Angeles.   By helping hospitals reduce costs through computerized ordering, just-in-time deliveries and stockless services, suppliers have been able to raise their prices by at least 5 percent per year. They have withstood pressure from Government and private insurers and the buying clout of groups like Volunteer Hospitals, which has 600 member hospitals and 190 affiliates. Mr. Abramowitz said the hospital supply market is growing by about 8 percent a year; Baxter's sales growth in 1991 will be about 11 percent. \\"Stockless is Baxter's most exciting growth opportunity,\\" he said.    Mr. Loucks said stockless services benefit both sides. \\"We generally take about 30 percent of whatever is saved,\\" he said. \\"The hospital is picking up 70 percent.\\"   A medical supply company does not have to be Baxter's size to exploit these opportunities. Even before Baxter jumped in, smaller suppliers like the privately held Koley's Medical Supply Inc. in Omaha were providing stockless service to a handful of customers beginning in the mid-1980's. Michael P. Gittings, Koley's president, said 18 hospitals, mostly small and all within 200 miles of Omaha, buy the service. He said Koley's sales rose to $38 million this year, compared with $6 million in 1984, before it introduced the service. Being near at hand and relatively small helped Koley's make the service work. \\"The hospitals have a very strong trust relationship with us,\\" Mr. Gittings said.  Concern Over Conflicts Most Hospitals Remain Skeptical    The overwhelming majority of the nation's hospitals still shun stockless services. Some administrators fear that suppliers would write themselves larger orders than the hospitals needed. Administrators say group buying organizations already give them deep discounts. \\"Some hospitals would not want non-employees working in sensitive areas like ordering supplies,\\" said Dwight Winstead, president of the VHA Supply Company, the buying unit of Voluntary Hospitals of America. Administrators of hospitals that belong to the VHA are wary of becoming hens opening the door to an eager fox, he said. \\"They feel there could be a conflict between supplying and servicing stockless and a corporate strategy to move products,\\" he explained.    Some suppliers say hospitals must be on guard to realize the potential savings. \\"Hospitals that don't have the internal systems and controls to manage it will be in trouble,\\" said Frank J. Ryan, president of Johnson & Johnson Hospital Services, a unit of J.& J.   Hospitals also need to see whether the savings from going stockless are greater than the extra charges. \\"You have to find the happy medium where the price of the product doesn't exceed the need for the service,\\" said Jerome L. Stracke, an assistant vice president at the Evanston Hospital in Illinois.   One hospital may have found a way to realize many of the benefits from new delivery systems without the risks. The independent St. Paul-Ramsey Medical Center in St. Paul, Minn., requires Baxter and two other suppliers to bid against each other. All three provide just-in-time deliveries to the loading dock, but the hospital takes charge of internal distribution. Michael I. Kerr, St. Paul-Ramsey's support services director, said this system keeps prices and inventory costs low, with the hospital staying in control of its supplies. Last year, as the cost of medical supplies rose nationally by 4 percent to 6 percent, his hospital's costs increased only 3 percent.   'PARTNERS' IN INVENTORY CONTROL    Steve Seide, a general manager in Houston with Baxter International, and Dave Render, his operations manager, meet every day with nurses and executives in two local hospitals. \\"We talk about everything from a request to stock the new Diet Dr. Pepper to a complaint that a pest control truck is taking too long at the loading dock,\\" Mr. Render said.    Mr. Seide and Mr. Render run a service that Baxter calls Valuelink at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital and Hermann Hospital. Under this stockless system, Baxter fills precise orders for supplies and delivers them just as they are needed, directly to the departments that place the orders.    \\"We have become their warehouse, their central supply -- we're it,\\" Mr. Seide said. As the hospitals phase in the stockless system, he said, \\"all they will have left is two to three days of supplies. Then it's all up to us.\\"    Among other economies, stockless service has enabled Hermann Hospital to eliminate a 68,000-square-foot warehouse and St. Luke's to get rid of a 20,000-square-foot warehouse. Baxter keeps enough supplies for both institutions in an automated warehouse with only 44,000 square feet.    Baxter has used the stockless system to become a virtual partner with St. Luke's and Hermann in managing their supply flow. \\"We formed teams in the hospital units, with leaders and steering committees to deal with problems,\\" Mr. Render said.   Mr. Seide said Baxter can tailor its services according to the wishes of a hospital's staff. \\"Seventy percent of it is good communications,\\" he said. Based on a suggestion from the operating rooms, Baxter became part of the telephone voice mail system at St. Luke's. Anyone in an operating room can dial the letters RSVP to reach the company.    A suggestion by an operating room nurse at St. Luke's has helped Baxter prevent surgical mix-ups. Mr. Seide said she had noticed that Baxter's blue labels on pentalyte liquid, used to moisten and clean surgical incisions, closely resembled the blue labels on sterile water. Baxter, which says it was already planning to remedy the problem, promptly started putting black labels on pentalyte.   Mr. Seide and Mr. Render have good reasons for boasting of their progress at Hermann and St. Luke's. They are hoping to attract other Houston hospitals to their service. Analysts say that the more hospitals join, the greater the economies for Baxter.

Mr. Bancroft's smile as a rogue is something to conjure with","excerpt":"it is malicious and ominous. But as a comedian his merry mouth and twinkling eyes seem only to imply that he is enjoying himself more than the majority of spectators. In this sledge-hammer, loosely rivetted type of fun, Mr. Bancroft's partner is the talented Chester Conklin, who, because of the absurd exploits of these two characters, returns to the Mack Sennett style of acting.The yarn in this picture is about as possible as would be the sight of Messrs. Conklin and Bancroft on horseback trying to cross the Atlantic. A wild cat engine means little in the lives of these hardy adventurers. \\"Cannonball\\" Casey (Mr. Bancroft) and Luke Beamish (Mr. Conklin) are respectively the driver and fireman of a locomotive. Mr. Beamish enjoys that position after the flashing of a scene or two. Then Mr. Beamish wishes he were anywhere but with the big and terrifying Casey. Beamish has to shovel coal until his back is bent, and he is forced to use a shovel much larger than he is accustomed to.The more or less coherent portion of this tale is concerned with Casey wanting to make time with his locomotive and Beamish wanting to delay the train so that his daughter will have time to marry the railroad superintendent's son, with whom she has eloped.In their diverse ways Casey and Beamish tangle up matters and eventually they fall off the engine. They are not hurt and they succeed in reaching a short-cut to a bridge and then they jump on to their train. Soon they are off again, for they forget the tunnel. After diligent work on another engine these experts eventually catch up with the runaway train. They dash over the tops of the coaches and board the locomotive in time to stop it at its destination.Some of the rugged conceptions of mirth stirred up a little laughter yesterday and occasionally, for the fraction of a minute. Mr. Conklin introduced a little bright work, especially when he inspected each piece of coal before he tossed it into the fire. Mr. Bancroft's actual acting is not so bad, but he has nothing that is in the least droll to do.John Murray Anderson's stage affair, \\"Dancing Brides,\\" is a much better entertainment than the film.

I can live with the disappointment, but because the review leaves your readers with some seriously mistaken impressions, I am writing to set the record straight.    Shesol asserts that out of office, Theodore Roosevelt largely abandoned the restraint he had displayed as president, and Shesol declares that my book ''mostly overlooks'' this. The notion of former President Roosevelt as out of control is not a fact","excerpt":"it is merely a point of view.    The review correctly points out that the 1912 election has been so extensively chronicled that it leaves an author little room for novelty. A better-informed reviewer would have recognized (and perhaps even taken issue with) my out-on-a-limb argument that by the time Roosevelt went to Chicago during the Republican convention, he had already concluded that he could not win the G.O.P. nomination and therefore would have to bolt the party in order to continue his run for president. My analysis of the black vote is entirely new. Frankly, I have been expecting reviewers to contest my new interpretations, not pity me for recycling.    Finally, Shesol says I conclude that Roosevelt seems not to have grasped the immensity of his need for power and often confused the call of personal ambition with a call to serve his country. Although I do say this, it is my starting point, not my conclusion. The book goes on to show and analyze, in detail, Roosevelt's valiant struggle to lead a purposeful life in the face of an existential predicament he did not understand.

Both are also alternative schools but in the progressive tradition, open to new ideas and less dominated by teacher and syllabus, the very opposite of Dennison.

Love scenes should not be portrayed, it is said, and to show a bold, bad man drinking from anything other than a water faucet is almost the height of immorality. Not that the deploring element minds, of course","excerpt":"it is merely for the effect on the younger generation.It does seem at this point, however, that the movies may be the means of salvation for that younger generation. Certain members of it are presumably designed (heredity and environment) to grow up with a hatred of patrolmen and a love of other persons' property. These should go to the movies often—because there they will learn that gangsters are really gentlemen at heart. Pretty soon, if humanity only followed film plots, there would be no crime wave.Such an educational picture can be found this week at the Paramount, where Clive Brook, Mary Brian, Baclanova and William Powell teach the lesson that, after all, one's word is sacred, one's trade uncertain, one's greatest pleasure is to be found in bringing happiness to others. \\"Forgotten Faces\\" features a hold-up man who kills his wife's lover, spends a time in jail, is pardoned and finally is shot as he tries to keep his past a secret from his daughter.The theme is sentimental and old, but certain scenes and some good acting bring it up from the cellar, where it ordinarily would be, to about the first floor. Many incidents are incredible, many others are overdone, some few are utterly impossible; yet on the whole \\"Forgotten Faces\\" is average entertainment.Mr. Brook portrays the hold-up man, a stern, silent person without much humor and with a curious love of heliotrope. His wife is played by Baclanova, who gives a good interpretation of her part. Mary Brian is \\"Heliotrope Harry's\\" daughter grown up, but she doesn't have much to do save wander around. William Powell takes the part of \\"Froggy,\\" the assistant in crime to the leading actor.Some day one of the persons responsible for moving pictures should go out and take a good look at a hold-up man, then return to the office and produce a film on the subject. \\"The Racket\\" is perhaps the nearest approach so far, with \\"Forgotten Faces\\" quite some distance off. The ordinary criminal does not resemble the combination of virtues he gets in the movies; the extraordinary one is rarer than one might believe by a glance at current film offerings.Mr. Paul Ash and the Paramount Orchestra are glorifying the Northwest Mounted this week, with an Indian effect forming a background. The finale of the stage show is an excellent vision of a forest fire.

The sins for which one may be forgiven -- pride, anger, lust, sloth, avarice, gluttony, envy -- are all firmly attached to the objects of this world, but despair seems to bleed out beyond the confines of the immediate ego-centered self and to relate to no desire, to no thing. The alleged sinner has detached himself even from the possibility of sin, and this the Catholic Church, as the self-appointed voice of God on earth, cannot allow.   Religion is organized power in the seemingly benevolent guise of the sacred, and power is, as we know, chiefly concerned with its own preservation. Its structures, its elaborate rituals and customs and Scriptures and commandments and ethics, its very nature, objectify human experience, insisting that what is out there in the world is of unquestionably greater significance than what is in here in the human spirit. Despair, surely the least aggressive of sins, is dangerous to the totalitarian temperament because it is a state of intense inwardness, thus independence. The despairing soul is a rebel.

The reason why seems obscure, but probably it is brought about by the fact that \\"Little Johnny Jones\\" once was a musical comedy.At all events, Johnny Jones is a jockey—quite a good one. He rides a lot of winners and ultimately he arrives in New York, where he meets a girl who plans to use him and he tours the night clubs. He sings as he goes. On the day of the big race the girl tries to get him to pull his horse, but Johnny refuses. He loses anyway, and is suspended for the irregularities he was suspected of committing.After this he goes to England and sings in the music halls while trying to get a job as a jockey again. Finally he runs into Yankee Doodle, his old horse. Then the owner of the horse—and the father of the girl—comes along and there is a reconcilliation. Johnny wins the race and the girl.There are some good racing scenes in the picture and Mr. Buzzell has his musical comedy public. But the film, while fair enough as entertainment, doesn't become either a good musical piece or a good play.The surrounding program includes the news of the day, a Grantland Rice sportlight called \\"Bows and Arrows,\\" and James Barton in a Vitaphonic piece called \\"The Under Dog.\\" There is also a \\"dramatic playlet\\" named \\"Vanity,\\" with Ruth Lyons, Rudolph Cameron and Vivian Oakland.

Could someone explain what a single supplement buys? For example, last year on a Perillo tour to Italy, the supplement was $399. -- Joanne Palmer Morgan, Drexel Hill, Pa.     A.  All the single supplement buys is privacy. The cost that is cited for tour packages is almost always based on two people sharing a room (or ship cabin), and those who occupy a room alone often are charged extra. A spokeswoman for Perillo Tours said their single supplement is \\"not our charge, it's the hotel's charge.\\" (For your tour this year, the supplement is $539.)   Hotels almost always negotiate with tour operators on the basis of double occupancy","excerpt":"it is more profitable to take in $100, say, for two in a room than $75 for one. Also, two people eat and drink more at a hotel than one, and the hotel wants to make up for what it sees as lost revenues. So the tour agency levies a supplement to make up for what it loses on the room if one person occupies it.   According to Paula Saint-Amour, senior vice president for wholesale travel for American Express, the single supplement is practically universal in Europe, but is not always charged for some newer domestic hotels and resorts, which take into account the fact that a certain portion of single travelers will be staying there. There are no single supplements for American Express's independent packages in Hawaii, where there are many new hotels, she said, though there is still a supplement for escorted tours there.    If your privacy is not worth the extra charge, one option is to ask a tour company if it will provide another willing single traveler as a roommate. Both Perillo and American Express will do that.   Another option is to use a service that matches singles who want a travel companion, either through newletters with ads or by putting putting people in touch. The services generally charge a fee. Among them: Travel Companion Exchange, Post Office Box 833, Amityville, N.Y. 11701; (516) 454-0880. Partners in Travel, Post Office Box 491145, Los Angeles, Calif. 90049; (213) 476-4869.

Pei, creator of the East Building of the National Gallery in Washington, the New York City Convention and Exhibition Center and some of the most conspicuous skyscrapers of the last decade, does not normally design relatively modest 325-room, low-rise hotels. But few of the small hotels he would be likely to disdain as unworthy of his time are intended for a hillside 25 miles outside of Peking, and so when the Government of China invited him to design such a building in 1978, he did not say no. He returned to China - where he had been born in 1917 - and began to produce what in short order became the most eagerly awaited piece of architecture in recent Chinese history.  The building is called Xiangshan (meaning ''Fragrant Hill'') Hotel, and it will not be entirely completed until this spring, when it will serve as a luxury hotel mostly for foreign visitors. Its first wing opened last October, before a gathering of Chinese dignitaries and Americans, including Pei's friend Jacqueline Onassis, at whose behest he had designed the John F. Kennedy Library near Boston. Fragrant Hill resembles neither that building nor the National Gallery, nor any of Pei's other well-known works","excerpt":"it is no exaggeration to say that it is a mix of Chinese and Western architectures the likes of which have never been seen in China or anywhere else. t is too soon for a formal critical evaluation of Fragrant Hill, which is impossible in any event without a visit to the building, which this critic has yet to make.

The former Soviet grandmaster, now a Swiss, is one of the super class who have repeatedly challenged for the world championship.   Scoring 8-3 in a field of 12, Korchnoi was trailed by Boris Gulko, a Fair Lawn, N.J., grandmaster, and John Nunn, an English grandmaster, sharing second place. Each scored 7 1/2-3 1/2 in the tourney, sponsored by Mindscape, maker of the computer program Chessmaster 4000, and by the Mechanics Institute, one of the oldest chess clubs in America. FINAL STANDINGS  Player . . . Pts.  Korchnoi . . . 8 Gulko . . . 7 1/2 Nunn . . . 7 1/2 De Firmian . . . 6 1/2 Hubner . . . 6 Christiansen . . . 5 1/2 Xie . . . 5 1/2 Browne . . . 5 Waitzkin . . . 4 Polgar, Z. . . . 3 1/2 Tisdall . . . 3 1/2 Ashley . . . 3 1/2    Korchnoi's daring, pugnacious play was nowhere so evident as in his defiant victory over the German grandmaster Robert Hubner in Round 5 on Feb. 26.   One virtue of 4 e5 in the Classical French Defense is that it avoids the reduction of material that can arise from 4 Bg5 de 5 Ne4 Be7. Over a century ago, Wilhelm Steinitz favored it because it pressed for spatial superiority in the center. The main question is how well it can put down black counterattacks.   On 4 . . . Nfd7, the old attempt to erect an imposing center with 5 Nce2 c5 6 c3 Nc6 7 f4 b5 8 a3 cd 9 Nd4 Nd4 10 cd has reappeared again","excerpt":"it is not clear whether White's lead in endgame development after 10 . . . b4 11 Nf3 ba 12 ba Ba6 13 Ba6 Qa5 14 Bd2 Qa6 15 Qe2 Qe2 16 Ke2 should amount to anything serious.   Steinitz preferred a more modest center with 5 f4 c5 6 Nf3 Nc6 7 Be3, the plan that Hubner follows in this game. In an encounter last year in Amsterdam, Jan Timman returned to the violent 7 . . . Qb6 8 Na4 Qa5 9 c3 cd 10 b4 Nb4 11 cb Bb4 12 Bd2 Bd2 13 Nd2 g5 14 Rb1 gf, but with 15 Bb5 Rb8 16 Nc5 Qc3 17 Nd3, Nigel Short got decisive advantage for White.   Korchnoi's order of moves, 7 . . . cd 8 Nd4 Qb6, produces a considerable change. Now, 9 a3 Bc5 10 Na4 Qa5 11 c3 Bd4 12 Bd4 Nd4 13 Qd4 b6 14 Qb4 Qb4 15 ab Ke7 gives White nothing more than an even game. And the gambit with 9 Qd2 Qb2 10 Rb1 Qa3 11 Bb5 Nd4 12 Bd4 Bb4 13 O-O a6 14 Rb3 Qa5 15 Rfb1 Be7 yields Black positional advantage after 16 Bd7 Bd7 17 Rb7 Rc8 18 Kh1 Bc5 19 Bc5 Rc5 20 Rb8 Bc8, according to an analysis by Jorge Magem Badals in Informant 61.   So Hubner reverted to the sharp 9 Ncb5, which John Nunn introduced in 1988, but Korchnoi unflinchingly came up with the innovation 9 . . . a6!, in place of the weak 9 . . . Bc5 or 9 . . . Qa5. Hubner could not retreat without losing his b2 pawn and therefore came on with 10 Nf5. And once again, Korchnoi stood his ground with 10 . . . Bc5!   He did not mind having his king jolted by 11 Bc5 Nc5 12 Nbd6 Kf8 and he resisted 13 Qh5 by 13 . . . Nd8. A retreat with 14 Nd4 would have failed against 14 . . . Qb4! 15 c3 Qb2 16 Rd1 Qc3 17 Kf2 Bd7 18 Be2 Ba4.   Thus, Hubner tried 14 Ng7, hoping for 14 . . . Kg7 15 Qg5 Kf8 16 Qh6 Kg8 17 Ne8, forcing mate. But Korchnoi struck first with 14 . . . Qb4! 15 c3 Qb2 16 Rd1 (16 Qh6 Qa1 17 Ke2 Ke7 18 Qf6 Kd7 also fails to rescue White) Qc3 17 Rd2 h6! There was no use playing 18 Qh4 because 17 . . . Kg7 18 Qf6 Kh7 19 Nf7 would be crushingly rebuffed by 19 . . . Qd2! 20 Kd2 Ne4!   After 18 Nge8 Ne4!, Korchnoi's easiest winning procedure would probably be 19 Qe2 Ke7 20 Nc8 (20 Ne4? de 21 Nd6 e3 is even worse) Rc8 21 Nd6 Nd6 22 ed Kd6 with two pawns to the good. Hubner gave up.

At the University of Utah Medical Center, Dr. William C. DeVries was explaining the death last week of Dr. Barney B. Clark, the first recipient of an artificial heart. The device had not failed, he said. The rest of the body had. The artificial heart had achieved fame as a marvel of medical technology, and Dr.Clark as a man of courage. He had survived 112 days on the device. Without it, and with his own heart rapidly degenerating, he would have died in December.   Doctors say that relatively few others with heart disease would benefit from the device. Dr.Clark had been a special case, carefully selected for an experiment. The majority of heart patients must look to other treatments. But if a plastic pump promises to benefit so few, what wider medical purposes did the Clark experiment serve?  Harold M. Schmeck Jr., a science reporter for The New York Times, put these and other questions about heart disease and devices to Dr.  Peter L. Frommer, deputy director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Dr.Frommer trained as an engineer and a physician.  The institute is the Government's main agency for heart disease research.

In this same film Fred Kohler, who plays the heavy, is constrained to adopt George Bancroft's tactics, by laughing his way to successful villainy. Mr. Bancroft had a great deal more back of his expression. Mr. Kohler's laugh lacks spirit and thought","excerpt":"it is not much more than a wide open mouth.Mr. Dix's hair is a little curly in this new film. He also affects whiskers and a timid looking moustache. His costume is picturesque, for the story is laid in Southern California in 1848. This is a photoplay that takes you with a jerk from gold and gunpowder to roses and romance, and Joaquin Murrietta is evidently keen to impress one with his sporting spirit rather than put an end to the rascality of Jake Hamby. So one is apt to think that Murrietta (Mr. Dix) might have saved himself and others a lot of danger and annoyance if he had aimed his knife into Hamby's heart instead of at a target, or, at least, to have gagged and bound the rogue.Here Mr. Dix carries on a somewhat hazardous flirtation under fire, which proves more exasperating than exciting. Mr. Dix's face is about the palest a California sun shone upon, that is for an individual who spends as much time in the open as he does in character.In this squabble about land and gold, Mr. Dix not only illustrates his skill in throwing a knife, but he also uses a whip and a pistol. He is able single-handed to hold a host of bandits at bay, the low-browed men of the story being just a wee bit stupid when occasion demands.Gregory La Cava, an accomplished director, has succeeded in creating interest in the scenes with knife-throwing, the whip and the gunplay. He causes one to think that gold is as plentiful as pebbles on the land for which Murrietta and Hamby are fighting.Mr. Dix is energetic and agile, but he does not look as if the name Murrietta belonged to him. Thelma Todd figures as the cheery little heroine, who is never afraid when Murrietta is by her side.

At worst, this approach smacks of the same careless, sloppy \\"teaching\\" that gave us the infamous \\"open classroom\\" debacle that most of us remember to our chagrin as the beginning of the end of American education.

The agency's action against the nine employees was taken last May but was first reported today in The Washington Post. It was confirmed Friday night by a C.I.A. spokesman, Mark Mansfield.    The case dates from 1986, when a crew at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing made an error that caused the depiction of the aureole around a candle flame to be printed upside down and out of place on 400 stamps. The error went undetected, and in a routine purchase the C.I.A. acquired 95 of the $1 stamps at a post office in McLean, Va., for use on the agency's mail.    Such misprints can be extremely valuable to stamp collectors, who estimate that the value of the misprinted oil-lamp stamps is now $17,000 each. Each Kept a Stamp     When the nine employees, who have never been identified, discovered the 95 stamps, they sold 85 of them to a New Jersey dealer and also gave the dealer one torn stamp. Each employee keptone stamp, although one of the nine is believed to have lost his.    Mr. Mansfield said Friday night that the four employees who were dismissed had refused to turn over to the agency the stamps they had taken. Other grounds for dismissal were their lying to investigators and misappropriating Government property, he said.   The dismissals were reluctantly ordered, he said, \\"only after all alternatives were fully explored, and this resolves the case from our point of view.\\"    The five other employees, except the one who said he lost his stamp, apparently returned theirs. The Post quoted officials of the C.I.A. and the Smithsonian Institution as saying the agency had donated four of the stamps to the museum.  A Job With Temptations     The agency said the five employees had been disciplined, but it did elaborate.    Mr. Mansfield said that in resolving the case, William H. Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, had issued an internal statement that said: \\"This case is important to every employee in the agency because it gives a clearer picture of what is expected of us. Public service is a special trust. It is not easy","excerpt":"it is not without temptations.\\"    As for the other 305 misprinted stamps, all were apparently sold to the public and used on mail, the purchasers never knowing their value.

The house, a milestone in Wright's career (and a frequent set for fashion shoots and movies, including ''Blade Runner''), has been placed on the World Monument Fund's most-endangered list, and inspectors have tagged as unsafe parts of the retaining wall, the motor court and chauffeur's quarters. Franklin De Groot, executive director of the nonprofit foundation that owns the house, said that it had raised about $3 million, but that the cost of stabilizing the structure is estimated at $5 million.    Damage to the Ennis house began well before the recent rains or the 1994 earthquake. It is one of five structures Wright built in Los Angeles and Pasadena in the 20's using textile blocks -- squares of cement and an aggregate cast in molds that left complex geometric imprints. But the blocks were not adequately pressed, hydrated and cured, so they absorbed moisture. Over the years, the water has rusted the steel reinforcing bars and exploded the surrounding grout, causing the blocks to crack and flake. And from there things just got worse.    The first of the houses, the Millard residence in Pasadena, leaked from the beginning","excerpt":"it is now tarped and awaiting restoration by its owner, the film producer David Zander. The architecture school at the University of Southern California owns the Freeman house in the Hollywood Hills and has rebuilt the foundations and supporting structure; students have been casting new blocks from the original molds.    Designed in 1924 for wealthy clothiers, the Ennis house was the most grandiose of the block houses in Los Angeles, and at 10,000 square feet, one of Wright's biggest anywhere. The problems there were aggravated when an owner sealed the blocks with a coating that trapped water inside, accelerating the damage. Dissolving behind the sealant, the complex patterns of interlocking squares are losing their clarity. Halting that deterioration and restoring the exterior would be a huge task because of the sheer scale of the building. For now, though, the goal is to stabilize and restore the retaining walls according to plans prepared by Eric Lloyd Wright, a grandson of Wright who has worked on rehabilitating most of the Los Angeles block houses.    Adding to the time pressure, unless more money can be raised, grants that the foundation has obtained will expire before the end of the year. (Donations can be made at the foundation's Web site, www.ennisbrownhouse.org). When Wright built the Ennis-Brown house, it looked unassailable and eternal; these days, it's looking very mortal.

Paramount-Famous-Lasky's only woman director, and it is her first achievement in this line. The background of this narrative is Paris, and it is a fair conception of the French metropolis as seen from 7,000 miles. Whether this story is exactly the type of yarn for Miss Arzner is questionable. She undoubtedly has an eye for attractive costumes, but her incidents are cut off abruptly in some cases, and there are episodes that are too fractious even for this style of story.Being a chronicle concerned with a cigarette girl impersonating a notorious beauty, it is reminiscent of \\"Her Big Night,\\" Melville Brown's charming picture. The fun in \\"Fashions For Women\\" is supplied chiefly by Sam Dupont, who is described as a press agent for a queen, the English Channel and the United States Marine Corps. His exploits go back to the days of Anna Held and her famous milk bath.Both Celeste de Givray, the woman of the world, and Lola Dauvry, are impersonated by Esther Ralston, who adopts one hair arrangement for the notorious Celeste and another for the short-skirted cigarette girl. Celeste is painstaking with the use of her cosmetics, while Lola's charm is more natural.Circumstances prevent Celeste from appearing for a week or so at her usual entertainment. Therefore dressmakers and plungers in the ostrich feather market are panic-stricken, for Celeste is the arbiter of fashion. Hence somebody has to be found to take her place and Lola is a candidate. She is scrutinized by the male designers of feminine modes, who decide that she is not acceptable. Sam Dupont, the firebrand publicity instigator, brings in Mimi, and the committee are quite enthusiastic about her appearance. Lola, however, being unusually powerful, binds Mimi's wrists and ankles and locks her up in a closet. Then, after twisting a few yards of metallic cloth around her graceful figure, Lola approaches the monarchs of the Rue de la Paix, who go into ecstacies over her beauty and her resemblance to Celeste.There is a sort of hero in this story. He happens to be the Marquis Raoul de Bercy, who, believing that he has lost all his money in stock speculations, becomes private aviator, as he thinks, to Celeste. He does not remember Lola as the little cigarette girl, but she, of course, recognizes the Marquis as the handsome young man she had served in the restaurant.In a fashion sequence, Lola is seen in resplendent costumes, and she wins the coveted golden apple. She is a victim of dozens of photographers, and after a frown or two from the jealous Celeste, Lola is seen in the arms of her aviating Marquis.Miss Ralston is radiant as Lola and impressive as Celeste.

It was to give this somewhat metaphysical quest an outlet that the architects Tod Williams and Ricardo Scofidio, who teach at the school of architecture at Cooper Union, invited 200 architects and artists two years ago to present interpretations of three basic elements of architecture: window, room and furniture.   It was Mr. Williams's and Mr. Scofidio's feeling that these elements are things that, conceptually at least, we take for granted, and that both architects and the public might benefit from a chance to think about them in a pure fashion, with no demand for these elements to be part of an overall design.

''At my age, the trip was unthinkable, so I said let's have the party,'' explained Mr. Targ, a book editor for 45 years. That explains why some 100 friends, former colleagues and well-wishers jammed the Targs' gaily decorated penthouse apartment in Greenwich Village last night. ''The theme of the party is 'Live at 75,' '' Mr. Targ said, ''and we're thinking of having another in five years in which everybody who was at the 75th is invited automatically.''   Mr. Targ retired as editor in chief of Putnam's in 1979, after having worked at Macmillan and World. Four years earlier he wrote in his book ''Indecent Pleasures'' that, ''Retirement is an obscene word in my lexicon","excerpt":"it is one step away from euthanasia. Not being involved in the book publishing process is for me like not breathing. Sharing the joys and anguish and hopes and authors is my purpose, my need.'' He satisfies that need now by heading up Targ Editions, a one-man operation that prints and binds by hand limited editions of books by Saul Bellow, John Updike and others. And Roslyn Targ is still a literary agent in Manhattan. PUBLISHING: A 'LIVE AT 75' PARTY FOR WILLIAM TARG"},{"year":"1940","title":"Sermon on Christianity VALUE OF CHRISTIANITY","excerpt":"It Is One Sure Foundation of Democracy, Dr. Scherer Says"},{"year":"1990","title":"To the Editor:  I am writing in response to Susan Best's letter of Oct. 3, which was in favor of the legalization of crack and heroin.   Ms. Best claims to \\"hate drug abuse\\" but to \\"hate drug-related crime more.\\" Yet the plan she advocates would increase abuse and have little effect on crime.   She lauds the British system, in which heroin addicts are forced to register with the Government in order to be entitled to a \\"free fix\\" of methadone (not heroin, which is legal only for medicinal purposes). Methadone is not as powerful a \\"high,\\" nor is it an effective way to stop opiate addiction. Recent studies show that at best it is a transfer from the dependency on illegal drugs to a dependency on the state's drugs.   And what of all those addicts who refuse to register, who fear government control or who have criminal records or would lose their jobs if their addiction went public? What about the large number of doctors who are heroin users? What about all those people for whom methadone, for one reason or another, is not an attractive option?   The effects of heroin are short-lasting. If heroin were legal to all comers who registered for it (which, again, it is not in England), they would probably need three or four doses per day, at least (the effects of heroin last six hours as compared with 24 hours for methadone). The addicts would need to live near the dispensary, and so would never truly get a chance to leave their home neighborhood in which they are known only as addicts, and so the cycle of addiction would have little chance to be broken. Dispensation is not a rehabilitative policy","excerpt":"it is one that maintains the problem.   But the real problem drug is not heroin, whose popularity, except in speed-balls where it is used with cocaine, is on the decline. The real problem is crack. The crack high lasts 2 to 15 minutes, which barely gives the addict time to get on line before his craving starts again.   Finally, the logistics of dispensation are worth more than a passing mention of the Nimby, or not-in-my-backyard, syndrome. Distribution centers could not be put in hospitals for the same reasons that most hospitals will not give space to abortion clinics: public criticism; loss of private funding; disruption of the immediate hospital area by addicts waiting for a fix (which might deter other patients); protesters (who would occasionally be violent); the cost (hospitals are already lacking in funds); the cost of added security bills (greater than any amount of increased Federal funding, especially in the day of the budget cut); problems with overdoses and verifying the ages and identities of the \\"patients,\\" and so on.   Such problems would create quite a lucrative \\"black market\\" for these drugs, much like the one that exists today in England. England's policy has frequently been reviewed and updated, because the number of unregistered addicts tripled between 1980 and 1987.   Legalization is not the key to the crime problem. I am not sure that more police are either. England has less crime because it has a better municipal system and smaller cities (and fewer cities as well). What would probably help us are laws that require stricter dispensation of guns, rather than of drugs.   It might also help if we improved education, forced Medicare to apply to crack addiction, increased rehabilitation (the wait for a room at a treatment facility can be almost a year), and stopped blaming addicts (England is better on all of these counts than we are). It is our \\"crackdown on crack\\" mentality, which assumes drugs to be a legal rather than a social problem, that is responsible for creating many of our problems.

If Rouben Ter-Arutunian's depiction of the Sugarplum Fairy's Palace of Pleasures is obviously a painted stage set, its elegant swirl of domes and pedestals is still gorgeous.

The production, which is an elaborate one, done in very good taste, contains many impressive scenes and a number of original ideas in photography and sets.It seems as if Ballin had undertaken too many tasks on the production, for he not only directed the film, but he is is responsible for the scenario, and it may be taken for granted that he can also be credited with most of the \\"cutting\\" and titling. In addition to all this, Mabel Ballin, his wife, has the rôle of Becky Sharp. She is a pretty woman, who acts quite well throughout the production, but does not get away from herself sufficiently to give one the impression of being a scheming, flinthearted little flirt. It would possibly have been better for the picture as a whole if Eleanor Boardman, who is cast as Amelia Sedley, had played Becky Sharp.Neither does George Walsh appeal as Rawdon Crawley, the reckless young gambler. Both he and Mabel Ballin appear to be acting too much under direction instead of giving their parts the necessary spontaneity. The laurels of the production so far as acting goes fall to Hobart Bosworth, who plays Lord Steyne. He is interesting in every scene in which he appears, especially in the sequence where he is caught in a flirtation by Crawley.Great pains have been taken with the costuming of the production, and the scenes of the soldiers going forth to battle are quite well done, as is also the calling of the officers from the Brussels ball. It is dubious whether the scenes of the staged battle of Waterloo add anything to the picture, for even as a contrast to present day warfare they are not up to much, as the sight of the battle is not impressive. Napoleon's prototype awaiting the result of the conflict also is superfluous. There are one or two illustrated titles labelled Brussels, whereas they are actually well-known views of Bruges, in this instance, with a distorted view of the old belfrey in the background.In spite of all deficiencies this production is infinitely more entertaining and far better done than many other films","excerpt":"it is only a pity that the zealous Ballin attempted to get so much on the screen and did not pay more attention to the story even if he had to take a few motion picture liberties with Thackeray's novel.Miss Boardman is charming as Amelia Sedley, getting all out of this minor rôle. Willard Louis as Joseph Sedley deserves credit for his performance. Harrison Ford and Earle Fox are fair, as are George Osborn and William Dobbin. But as in the case of Mabel Ballin and George Walsh, there seems to be little real characterization put into these parts.\\"Vanity Fair\\" was previously produced about eight years ago.

Edgar Hoover\\" is still just a B-movie about a G-man. Its tone hovers midway between soap opera and expose, as when Hoover (played by Broderick Crawford) is seen meeting Senator Joseph R. McCarthy for dinner. Hoover jocularly hands over the names of a few dozen homosexuals in the Government's employ, and then McCarthy suddenly waxes wistful. \\"People liked me,\\" he says. \\"I don't understand why they're so down on me now.\\"Moments like this give the movie its zest, but there aren't very many of them. The film mostly barrels along at a flat, uninteresting pace, with no big scenes to give it any structure. The script seems to have been well researched, and it goes to considerable trouble to propound a theory of what Hoover's role may have been in Watergate, or of the nature of his dealings with Robert F. Kennedy. But this information is revealed so blandly that it seems neither surprising nor dramatically effective.\\"The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover\\" was made in 1977, directed by Larry Cohen, who also directed \\"It's Alive!\\"","excerpt":"it is only now having its New York premiere, at the Public Theater. It features a big cast of medium-big players, among them Rip Torn as a disgruntled young Federal Bureau of Investigation man, Dan Dailey as Hoover's companion Clyde Tolson, and Ronee Blakley as the woman who upset the young Hoover mightily, if this movie is to be believed, by giving him a kiss.The film spans the entirety of Hoover's career, which gives it an opportunity to offer cursory re-enactments of Great Moments in Crime History, like the capture of \\"Old Creepy\\" Karpas or the killing of John Dillinger. The film is so muddily photographed that the Lady in Red, a major figure in the Dillinger episode, becomes the Lady in Puce.Many of the actors are photographed from bizarre angles, to accentuate their nonresemblances to the people they are playing. Michael Parks, as Robert Kennedy, is filmed so that his nose becomes prominent, because that — and a few \\"uh's\\" in his conversation — are really all he and Kennedy share in common. Raymond St. Jacques suggests absolutely nothing of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., nor does Andrew Duggan recall Lyndon B. Johnson. However, Mr. Duggan has one of the film's funnier scenes, when he shows Hoover a photograph of the Kennedy brothers with several women.

He throws out plot, structure and conventional characterization until he creates a desolate, almost lunar theatrical landscape inhabited by phantasmagoric images and fragmented lives.   In this sense, Mr. Auletta at times resembles Sam Shepard - a fact not lost on Harvard's American Repertory Theater. Mr. Auletta's latest full-length play, ''Rundown,'' is being performed in repertory here with Mr. Shepard's ''True West.'' Yet ''Rundown'' too often seems like mock Shepard rather than the real thing.

It has long been fashionable to attribute these figures to ''voter apathy,'' sometimes with the added lament that the lack of interest is a sign of the inability of the major parties and candidates to address the needs of a large part of the electorate.

Of those who are registered, between 80 and 90 percent do vote - a respectable figure comparable to that in other democracies. In New York State, for example, the low turnout of the voting population is cast in a different light when we know that only 56.5 percent of those qualified were registered in 1982; it means that some 85 percent of those actually eligible on Election Day did vote.

Stanton Wood's ''Magical Forest of Baba Yaga,'' a freewheeling translation of the Eugene Schwartz Russian play ''Two Maples,'' unfolds in Prospect Park, where a fast-talking real estate agent (Ned Massey) has been transformed into a bear by the witch Baba Yaga (Nikki E. Walker), here a blue-haired pop diva. Lisa (Maria Silverman), a Russian immigrant, is trying to find her sons, Fred (Rainey Lacey) and Egon (Catherine Kjome), whom Baba Yaga has changed into maple trees. The show features a score by Greg E. Adair and Colm Clark","excerpt":"it is played onstage with instruments including a glockenspiel and a saw, which creates a delightfully eerie tone. Ryan Kravetz, the set designer, has created a shimmering forest and an ingenious version of Baba Yaga's mobile home, a hut on chicken legs.

Possibly we should have guessed last year that the first Lenin film—human, unpretentious, informal as it was—was only the prelude, that the Russians would not long permit their great national hero to go his way unglorified.\\"Lenin in 1918,\\" which the Cameo presented last night, finds his biographers in a far more worshipful mood. They hasten to tell the legends about him: how simple he was, how kind to the little waif, how he asked an old peasant for advice, how he disobeyed the doctor's orders and returned to his desk, how he patted Stalin's arm, how he never patted traitor Trotsky's arm. The real and the apocryphal are beautifully interwoven. The picture is a mine of Leniniana (if that's the word). But somehow, in their pious zeal, the biographers have forgotten to make it drama.It is one thing to neglect narrative or dramatic unity in a short film presented as semi-documentary","excerpt":"it is quite another when the film has a running time, as this one does, of two hours and fifteen minutes. There are a few uncertain gestures toward story—an episode about bread shortage and hints of a kulak conspiracy, another about a counter-revolutionary plot to take the Kremlin. Neither is followed very far. Lenin is shot (and recovers), Stalin remedies the Soviet Army's tendency to retreat. The picture ends there, with six of Lenin's years still to be accounted for. It promises to be a long life and a most dutifully documented one.Except for a few sequences of vivid action—the downhill rout of the White Army, the mob scene after Lenin's shooting—the film is uncommonly static, a sign that Director Mikhail Romm was more concerned with party duty than camera duty. What remains, and this, fortunately, is a valid asset, is the uniformly excellent performance of its cast. At its head, of course, stands Boris Shchukin, who triumphs brilliantly over his awestruck scenarists by keeping Lenin human and understandable in spite of their efforts to turn him into a demi-god. Most impressive, too, are Nikolai Cherkassov's Gorky, N. Okhlopov as the husky army aide, V. M. Markov as Dzerzhinsky and V. V. Vanin as Matveyev. A cast so notable deserves much of its director and writers; the least they should have had was a compact and dramatic script. And that is exactly what \\"Lenin in 1918\\" lacks.

Originally an English teacher in the New York public schools, he began his artistic career in the 1930's as a documentary photographer. He quickly became one of the leading members of the renowned Photo League, but by the mid-40's he had shifted gears radically, adopting a semi-abstract style that emphasized tonality and texture while eliminating any sense of pictorial depth. ''First, and emphatically, I accept the flat plane of the picture surface as the primary frame of reference of the picture,'' he wrote in 1950 - a position as sure to alienate him from the then-mainstream of photography as it was to endear him to the New York School of Abstract Expressionist painters.

For this giant, panoramic color picture of a 17,000-mile ocean cruise in a Norwegian training sailing vessel, shown in the new Cinemiracle process, which is akin to Cinerama, is so full of the thrills and beauties of ocean sailing that it takes the breath away.Louis de Rochemont made it, and Mr. de Rochemont, as every movie buff should know, has done more to put the sea in cinema than anyone making films. He is the man who produced \\"The Fighting Lady\\" for the Navy back in World War II, and he gets something maritime or naval into practically every film he does.But this time, equipped with the new process that fills with image the forty-foot-high screen extending 100 feet across the opening of the Roxy's proscenium arch, he has had his supreme opportunity to film the ocean and ships in scope and size that will make them real to people in a theatre. And this he has stunningly done.The substance presented in this picture is no calculated drama of the sea, no story of maritime adventure with a conflict, a climax and an end. It is simply the motion-picture record of a school-ship's leisurely cruise across the rolling Atlantic, from the cold waters of Oslofjord to tropical islands in the Caribbean, where a lot of sight-seeing is done, then north to New York for more sight-seeing and back across the Atlantic to home.But so much is encompassed in this record, which takes more than two hours to unfold—so much of the business of sailing a beautiful, white, three-masted bark, of boys sight-seeing in strange places, of ancient lore and modern contrasts of the sea—that it leaves one with more of a feeling of having lived with people than many a plotted film. You'll feel you know the forty-five stout youngsters and their beaming officers when you get through with this cruise.Space limitations do not allow us to begin a catalogue of the countless exciting adventures, sights and experiences that are shown on the giant screen in colors of rare richness and subtlety. There are those wonderful, spumelashed glimpses of the young sailors working their ship across the stormy Atlantic, with the great waters towering alongside. There is the first landfall on Madeira and a wildly clattering run down a long cobbled hill aboard a land sled, which compares with Cinerama's roller-coaster ride.There are lovely views and tourist encounters with pretty girls in Curaçao, a musical visit with Pablo Casals in Puerto Rico, a calypso \\"jump-up\\" in Trinidad. At the island of St. Thomas, some of the lads go skin-diving in the emerald sea and, when the windjammer lands its boys in New York, the viewer is treated to a delightfully fast, impressionistic tour of Manhattan.The most beautiful shots in the picture, however, recount the school-ship's rendezvous at sea with ships of the United States Navy—destroyers, an aircraft carrier and submarines—wherein the camera deftly contrasts the old seafarer with the new. And there is one sequence taken from a glass house on the deck of a submarine that shows the vessel submerging and surfacing to one of the most thrilling, dramatic views we've ever seen.Intercut in a sequence recording a performance by one of the lads of Grieg's Piano Concerto with Arthur Fiedler's Boston \\"Pops\\" Orchestra are beautiful shots of scenes \\"back home\\"—of farmlands and pastures of Norway hanging high above the blue fjords. This is a bit artificial in the context, but it does continue the varied travelogue.There are things you might say about this picture","excerpt":"it is rather erratically edited and cut; the musical score, with several songfests, is but middling, and it becomes a mite monotonous. But the Cinemiracle process is so striking (it only occasionally shows its tri-panel match-lines) and it gives such a \\"wrap-around\\" illusion that it tends to carry one away.The Christian Radich is the name of the windjammer and she'll give you an unforgettable cruise.

''There's only two places in the entire movie where he talks about his feelings, and this is one of them,'' said John Logan, the screenwriter. Mr. Logan used the setting to convey how Hughes and Hepburn softened in each other's presence. ''It's the two of them sitting alone in his bathroom, with his shoes off, and she's literally cleaning his feet,'' he said. Hepburn's line -- ''You taught me to fly, Howard. I'll take the wheel'' -- was another breakthrough","excerpt":"it is reprised later, when the former lovers see each other for the last time.

I'm so proud of you --    HOWARD -- She did it, baby.    KATE -- Now let me see your foot -- Good God, you're covered in blood!    HOWARD -- No, that's beet juice. I crashed in a beet field.

KATE -- Here let me get you fixed up -- Heavens, what is this, electrical tape?    She begins trying to clean the small cut on the sole of his foot as:    HOWARD -- Odie just sorta slammed it on -- wanted to get home to tell you.    KATE -- I'm so proud of you -- this is going to sting a little bit (he winces as she cleans the wound) -- this is useless, come to the bathroom. And don't get beet juice on the carpet!    She helps him hop into the master bath.    Sit down.    He sits on the edge of the tub. She turns on the tap and carefully cleans the beet juice off his foot.    HOWARD -- Too hot!    KATE -- Don't be a baby. Was the press there?    HOWARD -- No, they're calling everyone.    She turns off the tap and begins cleaning his wound.    HOWARD -- Should be on the wires by now (a beat) What is it?    A beat as she gently cleans his wound.    Kate?    She begins to carefully dress his wound, deep in thought.    KATE -- I've been famous -- for better or worse -- for a long time now I wonder if you know what it really means.    HOWARD -- I got my fair share of press on ''Hell's Angels.'' I'm used to it.    KATE -- Are you?    She stops dressing his wound. Considering whether to go on. She will. She sits back, leaning against a bathroom wall, looking at him deeply.    KATE -- Howard, we're not like everyone else. Too many sharp angles. Too many eccentricities. We have to be very careful not to let people in or they'll make us into freaks.    HOWARD -- Katie, they can't get in here. We're safe.    KATE -- They can always get in When my brother killed himself there were photographers at the funeral There's no decency to it.    She resumes dressing his wound.  A long beat. He is deep in thought.    HOWARD (very quietly) -- Look at me, Katie --    She stops dressing his wound and looks at him. He is completely honest. Completely vulnerable.    Sometimes I feel like well, I get these ideas crazy ideas about things that may not really be there.

That is the Vivian Beaumont Theater, most of the time the home of the Lincoln Center Repertory Company.The Beaumont, a legitimate theater whose sight lines aren't the best for movies, is the centerpiece of a building that soon will be partially converted to the purposes of film, specifically, the New York City Center-Henri Langlois Cinematheque—a decision that has prompted almost as much mail as would the discovery of a bald eagle nesting at Gracie Mansion.The film buffs, of course, are pleased, and the lovers of theater are having fits, some less literate than others. It continues to shock many people that movies can be taken so seriously as the theater—a reflection of the double standard that persists in the fact that people who are a little nutty about movies are called buffs, while their theater equivalents are described as lovers, as much in snobbery as in reverence.Because the New York Film Festival opening nights tend to be social occasions, largely attended by the Lincoln Center Film Society's patrons and friends—people who do not necessarily have to love movies as much as they love their association with them, \\"The Debut\\" was probably a wise choice to lead off with. It could neither offend nor bore the sort of moviegoers who, in the past, were offended and bored by Buñl's \\"The Exterminating Angel\\" and Godard's \\"Alphaville,\\" which were, in their artistic orneriness, perfect festival films.\\"The Debut\\" isn't. It's a nice, fairly conventional narrative film, about a spirited but hardly beautiful factory girl who suddenly finds herself playing the lead in a film biography of Joan of Arc. \\"The Debut\\" is black-and-white, which is still the mark of a \\"serious\\" film in some circles","excerpt":"it is Russian, which certifies it as being educational since we don't see that many Russian films (for good reason, I might add); and at its best, it recalls the humor and humanism that all of us were so surprised to find in the Czechoslovak films of Jiri Menzel, Milos Forman and Ivan Passer in the late 1960's.I must say that I like the movie, although with something less than a grand passion. At its center is an absolutely lovely performance by Inna Churikova as Pasha, a girl who is a good deal of the witch she is playing in a factory theatrical when she is discovered by the Moscow film director.Miss Churikova seems truly unbeautiful at first. Her peasant figure has the unyielding grace of a hay mattress, and no matter how she tries to control it, when she smiles, her upper lip is always rising to expose a lot more tooth and gum than one ordinarily wants to see. Very quickly, however, the magic of a complex personality begins to work to transform the actress into a most appealing heroine, awkward and terribly self-conscious, yet as ambitious and determined about her love life as about her career.One of the basic ironies of the film is the manner in which the director, Gleb Panfilov, cuts between the \\"Joan of Arc\\" that Pasha is making (which looks like a very ordinary, post-Eisenstein production) and her hilariously muddled love affair with a married zoologist (L. Kuravlev); a handsome, rather dumb fellow who is clearly not worthy of her. When pressed to examine himself, about all that he can find to recommend is the fact that he doesn't drink.Panfilov shares with Milos Forman die ability to build straight comedy, very delicately, into farce, and then to bring it back to reality again, without destroying the continuity of mood. He also possesses a point of view that never condescends to his characters, although he obviously finds their situations simultaneously sad and ridiculous. The scope of the film is small, but its emotions are true.\\"The Debut,\\" which starts its regular commercial run today at the Carnegie Hall Cinema, is a quiet film, made special by its star performance.
