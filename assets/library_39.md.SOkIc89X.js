The process, from start to finish, takes almost two hours on the screen. But that is because the subject is discussed in considerable detail and because it is highly complicated by the intrusion of an older woman, who brings a lot of practical wisdom and experience to the learning of the boy.Colette called her popular novel from which this offering was made \\"Le Ble en Herbe,\\" which might be freely translated as \\"The Ripening Corn.\\" And that is a much more expressive and appropriate title than \\"The Game of Love,\\" for there is precious little sense of the playful in this film of adolescent stress and strain.The boy, a handsome, wiry youngster, played by Pierre-Michel Beck, is in an almost constant state of nervous tension as he adjusts himself to the strange advances of nubile girls and fumbles in the unrestrained embraces of an amorous lady","excerpt":"played by Edwige Feuillere. And the girl, played by Nicole Berger, hardly ever emerges from the dumps, from the moment puppy-love overcomes her at the beginning of the picture until she walks off, sad and wiser, at the end.It is a pretty grim and painful experience that these flexible youngsters go through, and it is also extremely complicated—sometimes incredibly so. Working from the subtle, tender story that Colette stylistically told, Claude Autant-Lara, the writer-director, has made his film a thing of tangled and tortured moves and moods, all set against the airy background of a summer resort and parental complacency.At times it is desperately touching, as when the girl, whom the blonde Mlle. Berger renders exceedingly attractive, takes humiliating scorn from the boy. Then the concern of adolescence shows truly and vividly, and all the discomfort of young people in this gauche stage is made intense and real.At other times it is labored and provoking, as when the vageries and eccentricities of the girl and the boy in their fitful, clumsy courtship are made sporadic, discursive and far from clear. This may be entirely consistent with the behavior of French boys and girls—at least, those of Colette's refined acquaintance — but it also makes for confusion and tedium in a film. M. Autant-Lara, in these elaborate stretches, turns young love-making into a Federal case.And it must be said, with due decorum, that the attentions of the older woman to the boy are somewhat unwholesome and shocking, for all the gentle charm of Mlle. Feuillere. For the motivations of this handsome, attractive woman in latching on to the lad are so vague and unresolved that this shattering of convention injects a feeling of its being implausible and impure.Indeed, there arrives an apprehension that the whole thing has been contrived as an arbitrary coincidence and experience just to trouble an average tale of puppy-love. And this seems a bit unsporting. But then, this is French, after all.

A1    The Bush administration joined with a United Nations envoy in warning Syria that it should not make its promised withdrawal of troops from Lebanese territory contingent on the formation of a new government in Beirut.   A10    Allegations Spark Anger in Iraq  The Bannas, a well-respected Jordanian family, have been told that their elder son was a suicide bomber who killed more than 130 people in Iraq. There is no substantial proof, but hundreds of Iraqis are angry at Jordan for what they say is an instigation of violence.   A12    Excess billing for postwar fuel imports to Iraq by the Halliburton Company totaled more than $108 million, not $60 million as previously thought, according to a report by Pentagon auditors that was completed last fall. The report was completed the month before the American presidential elections, but has never been officially released to the public or to Congress.   A12    American and Iraqi forces have captured a former member of Saddam Hussein's government and two of the dictator's relatives, officials said. In separate attacks across Iraq, at least four people were killed.   A12    Israel to Hand Over 2 Towns  Israel agreed to hand over security control of two West Bank towns, Jericho and Tulkarm, to the Palestinians, a transfer the Palestinians have sought in fitful negotiations following a truce declared by the two sides five weeks ago.   A9    NATIONAL   A16-23    California Court Voids Ban on Same-Sex Marriage  A Superior Court judge ruled that California's ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, overturning a statewide proposition passed in 2000 that defined marriage as between a man and woman.

A20    Vote Is Today at Harvard  After weeks of discontent over the leadership style of the president of Harvard, Dr. Lawrence H. Summers, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will consider a no-confidence resolution at its regular monthly meeting.   A23    100 Gang Members Arrested  Federal immigration authorities announced that they had arrested more than 100 members of a violent Central American street gang.   A18    New Route for Heart Valves  A team of Michigan cardiologists has implanted an artificial heart valve in a 76-year-old man by feeding the device up through a vein in his left leg, instead of opening the patient's chest and stopping his heart.   A23    Trial Delayed in Bush Plot  Federal prosecutors won a delay in the trial of an American student accused of plotting to assassinate President Bush, contending that the use of Saudi witnesses and the defense's charges of torture would make the case unusually complicated.   A18    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-7    Albany Lobbyists Capitalize on Split  With Albany controlled to an unusual degree by just three men, and with these men in a state of near-constant, often quite bitter political warfare, companies have found that they can make a more effective case when their lobbyist has close ties to the official being lobbied or by hiring separate lobbying firms to help them win access to each player.

These works surely contain moments of infectious energy and subtle introspection, but generally they convey little more than a sense of charm, innocent pleasures innocently taken.   At his recital in Carnegie Hall on Thursday night, Murray Perahia, who has become one of the premiere Mozart interpreters of our time, may have sensed this, for he deliberately tried to make something more ambitious of these works. He tried to make the case that Mozart was a grand master of the piano repertory: profound, vigorous, tirelessly inventive and rarely simply charming.

The previous Met production of \\"Ariadne,\\" which was 26 years old when last done in 1988 (it can be seen on Deutsche Grammophon laser disks), was a straightforward, blunt staging of this peculiar opera. Elijah Moshinsky's beautiful new production goes closer to the spirit of the piece, in which a rich gentleman requests that two contrasting entertainments be performed simultaneously: a comic commedia dell'arte romp and a tragic opera based on the Greek myth of Ariadne.

Down South even the Shakespeare festivals play country music. Ted Swindley, who created ''Always Patsy Cline,'' has written another vehicle for excellent twang-filled songs in ''The Honky Tonk Angels'' (Aug. 6-Sept. 3), a revue that features the work of several ladies of country, including Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn. For more traditional fare, there will also be productions of ''Twelfth Night'' (through July 23), ''The Three Sisters'' (Aug. 13-26) and a few other stage classics. (800) 841-4273, www.asf.net.    California    AHMANSON THEATER AT THE CENTER THEATER GROUp Los Angeles, July 25-Sept. 10. ''Curtains'' -- the brand-new musical by John Kander and Fred Ebb, with some help from Rupert Holmes, who contributed lyrics (Mr. Ebb was working on it when he died in 2004) -- sounds as if it will be pure candy for musical theater fans. It's a backstage mystery full of inside jokes about life behind the footlights, and it features a detective (played by David Hyde Pierce, last seen vamping in ''Spamalot'') who also happens to love show tunes. Scott Ellis directs. (213) 628-2772, www.taperahmanson.com.    LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE Since shows at this West Coast institution are often coming to or from New York, Broadway watchers should keep an eye on the world premiere of ''Zhivago'' (through June 25), a musical adaptation of Boris Pasternak's romance, with music by Lucy Simon, the composer of ''The Secret Garden.'' Michael Weller (the ''Ragtime'' screenplay) wrote the book and Michael Korie (the ''Grey Gardens'' lyrics) and Amy Powers (''Lizzie Borden'') contributed the lyrics. Lisa Peterson will stage an updated version of Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' (June 20-July 23), and Trey Lyford and Geoff Sobelle star in the much-traveled Beckettian clown show ''All Wear Bowlers'' (Aug. 1-Sept. 3), which was a surprise hit at the Here Arts Center in Manhattan in early 2005. (858) 550-1010, www.lajollaplayhouse.com.    Connecticut    INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF ARTS AND IDEAS New Haven, June 10-24. ''International'' might be overselling it a bit -- at least when it comes to theater -- but this annual festival around the Yale University campus does certainly draw work from around the continent. Off Broadway's Will Power (''The Seven'') organizes and directs two nights (June 23 and 24) of hip-hop theater, including Aaron Jafferis's ''Shakespeare: The Remix,'' which pits several of Shakespeare's heroines against a street-wise modern teenager. And that's not the only unorthodox use of Shakespeare: there's a multimedia version of ''The Tempest (La Tempete)'' (June 16-18) mounted by the high-tech Canadian company 4D, which includes scenes between real people and virtual images. There will also be two shows by the New Orleans company Junebug, featuring a mythic storyteller named Junebug Jabbo Jones (June 21-24). (203) 562-5666 or (888) 736-2663, www.artidea.org.    STAMFORD THEATER WORKS June 7-25. Learn more about the birth of American pop music in ''The Music of Tin Pan Alley,'' with works by the great songwriters of the early 20th century like Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Cole Porter and Jerome Kern. David Bishop and Shawn Churchman created this revue. (203) 359-4414, www.stamfordtheatreworks.org.    WESTPORT COUNTRY PLAYHOUSE In his first summer after taking over from Joanne Woodward as artistic director of this longtime Connecticut fixture, Tazewell Thompson demonstrates a taste for politics and show tunes. On the schedule will be a musical about the antilynching crusader Ida B. Wells, ''Constant Star'' (July 13-30), and a rarely produced Arthur Miller play about government repression, ''The Archbishop's Ceiling'' (Aug. 24-Sept. 10), along with the oft-produced (except in New York) drama ''The Drawer Boy'' (June 22-July 9) and a new comedy of manners by David Wiltse, ''The Marriage Minuet'' (Aug. 3-20). Mr. Thompson is kicking the season off, directing a show he helped create, ''Jam & Spice'' (June 1-18), built on and celebrating the music of Kurt Weill. (203) 227-4177, www.westportplayhouse.org.    District of Columbia    JOHN F. KENNEDY CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS Christine Baranski will get her name above the title in a new production of Jerry Herman's crowd-pleaser ''Mame'' (May 27-July 2), and for good reason. This charming performer has won two Tony Awards and plays the eccentric title character. For ''Urinetown'' fans, the drawing card for the production, staged by Eric Schaeffer of the Signature Theater, may be the chance to see Jeff McCarthy, who was hilarious as Officer Lockstock in the Broadway version of the meta-musical. He plays Mame's love interest, the Southern gentleman Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside. At the other end of the spectrum at the Kennedy Center is a production of Goethe's ''Faust'' (June 1-18) mounted by the experimental Synetic Theater of Arlington, Va. (202) 467-4600, www.kennedy-center.org.    Florida    CITY THEATER SUMMER SHORTS FESTIVAL Miami. Don't have the attention span to sit through an entire play? Here's the solution: each premiere is around 10 minutes, long enough to be interesting but not too long to wear out its welcome. Presented by the City Theater and the Actors Theater of Louisville's National 10-Minute Play Contest, the collection of shorts runs from June 1 to July 2 at the Jerry Herman Ring Theater at the University of Miami, then moves to the Amaturo Theater in the Broward Center for the Performing Arts in Fort Lauderdale (July 6-9). (954) 462-0222, or www.citytheatre.com.    Georgia    GEORGIA SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL Atlanta, June 7-Aug. 20. A well-regarded Shakespeare festival stages ''Hamlet'' (June 7-July 22) and ''Twelfth Night'' (June 22-July 21), along with Mary Zimmerman's Tony Award-winning ''Metamorphoses'' (July 27-Aug. 20). (404) 264-0020 or www.gashakespeare.org.    Illinois    RAVINIA FESTIVAL Highland Park, May 31-Sept. 16. It's divas on parade at this classical-music showcase, which is attempting to beef up its musical theater credentials with a few thousand-watt names. Elaine Stritch, fresh off her cabaret stint at the Café Carlyle, lends her brassy charm to a night of stories and songs in ''Martinis at the Martin'' (Aug. 1). The season ends with a workshop of ''The Princess and the Black-Eyed Peas,'' a soulful musical retelling of the classic Hans Christian Andersen tale, starring Lillias White (''The Life''), on Sept. 15 and 16. But the highlight of the summer, and perhaps of the entire decade (if you're a musical theater obsessive), is the three-night run of ''Gypsy,'' starring Patti LuPone as Mama Rose, which begins Aug. 11. Not only does the show feature Ms. LuPone, who received rave reviews for her performance as Mrs. Lovett in the current Broadway revival of ''Sweeney Todd,'' but it will have the full sound of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra as well. Lonny Price (''A Class Act'') directs. (847) 266-5100, www.ravinia.org.    STEPPENWOLF THEATER COMPANY Chicago. Can novelists write plays? Find out this summer at Steppenwolf, where two of our greatest contemporary writers try their hand at the theater. Don DeLillo, who, to be fair, has a few fairly well-received plays to his credit, has written ''Love-Lies-Bleeding'' (through May 28), in which a family confronts difficult questions about a dying relative. Cormac McCarthy's ''Sunset Limited'' (May 18-June 25) has a setting that might surprise fans of this author, who is best known for novels set in rugged Western terrain. It takes place in the heart of New York City after a stranger saves another's life in a subway station. Austin Pendleton stars. The most intriguing new show of the summer, though, involves an even more canonized novelist: ''M. Proust'' by Mary Zimmerman (June 9-July 9) tells the story of the French author's housekeeper and confidante, Celeste Albaret, to whom Proust once said, ''You know everything about me.'' The text is based on the writings of Proust and Albaret. (312) 335-1650, www.steppenwolf.org.    Kentucky    MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME STATE PARK AMPHITHEATER Bardstown. The annual production of ''Stephen Foster -- The Musical'' (June 10-Aug. 18), a tribute to the composer of ''My Old Kentucky Home,'' will alternate with a revival of ''The Sound of Music'' (July 11-Aug. 19) in this half-century-old amphitheater. (800) 626-1563, www.stephenfoster.com.    Maine    MAINE STATE MUSIC THEATER Brunswick. The Great White Way isn't the only place to see those splashy, family-friendly musicals created by the Walt Disney Company. You can find productions of ''Beauty and the Beast'' (June 28-July 15) and ''Aida'' (July 19-Aug. 5) at the Pickard Theater on the Bowdoin College campus, produced by this popular Maine cultural center, which was established in 1959. For fans of pre-Disney Broadway, there will also be ''South Pacific'' (June 7-24) and, in a slightly -- very slightly -- more risqué bit of programming, ''The Full Monty'' (Aug. 9-26). (207) 725-8769, www.msmt.org.    Massachusetts    BERKSHIRE THEATER FESTIVAL Stockbridge, May 25-Oct. 21. The Berkshires are so jam-packed with major cultural institutions -- Williamstown, Tanglewood and Mass MoCA, to name a few -- that it's easy to forget this historic gem, which includes a main stage inside a building designed by Stanford White. The theater will have a busy summer, including productions of Wendy Wasserstein's Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Heidi Chronicles'' (Aug. 15-Sept 2), and, earlier, Tina Howe's ''Coastal Disturbances'' (July 11-29) and Tennessee Williams's ''Night of the Iguana'' (Aug. 1-12). There will also be a world premiere, ''The Pilgrim Papers'' (July 28-Aug. 26), a political satire by Stephen Temperley (''Souvenir'') that spins a cockeyed story about the Pilgrims coming to America. (Somehow Communism and the C.I.A. are involved. Don't ask.) (866) 811-4111 or (413) 298-5576, www.berkshiretheatre.org.    CAPE PLAYHOUSE Dennis, June 19-Sept. 9. A Cape Cod fixture for 80 years and a favorite retreat for Broadway talent, the playhouse offers a season of revival heavy on laughs and sentiment. Brad Oscar (''The Producers'') stars in ''Moonlight and Magnolias,'' an imagining of 1930's Hollywood, which ran at the Manhattan Theater Club. It's pitched directly to those who can't get enough of the making-of stories about ''The Wizard of Oz'' or ''Gone With the Wind.'' Next up is a version of the minor Kander-Ebb musical ''The Rink,'' revised by John Kander and Terrence McNally for a new production starring Leslie Uggams. The rest of the season will cover many eras, including shows about 30's gangsters (''Guys and Dolls''), a 60's singing duo (''Pete 'n' Keely''), Elizabethan playwrights (Amy Freed's ''Beard of Avon'') and one from the 90's about a dog (''Sylvia''). (877) 385-3911, www.capeplayhouse.com.    WILLIAMSTOWN THEATER FESTIVAL Williamstown, July 5-Aug. 27. In his second year in charge, Roger Rees puts his stamp on the festival in a big way, directing Cole Porter's ''Anything Goes'' (July 5-16) and ''Double Double'' (Aug. 16-27), a thriller he wrote with Rick Elice (''Jersey Boys'') about a widow trying to con her way into an inheritance. ''Romeo and Juliet'' (Aug. 2-13), staged by Will Frears, and ''Sweet Bird of Youth'' (July 19-30), staged by David Jones, will be on the main stage","excerpt":"plays by John Belluso (''A Nervous Smile,'' July 26-Aug. 6) and Cusi Cram (''Lucy and the Conquest,'' July 12-23) will be on the Nikos Stage, along with the show most likely to transfer to New York, the musical adaptation of the 1998 film ''The Opposite of Sex'' (Aug. 9-20), with music and lyrics by Douglas J. Cohen (''No Way to Treat a Lady''). (413) 597-3400, www.wtfestival.org.    Minnesota    THE PLAYWRIGHTS CENTER Minneapolis, July 21-22. After a two-week development conference, seven playwrights will present world-premiere productions at the 24th annual PlayLabs Festival. Among the writers are Michelle Lowe, who wrote ''The Smell of the Kill,'' and Winter Miller, an assistant to the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Nicholas D. Kristof of The New York Times, with whom she is collaborating on a play based on his coverage of genocide in Darfur. (612) 332-7481, Ext. 18, www.pwcenter.org.    New York City    BRITS OFF BROADWAY Through July 2. This diverse collection of British imports has been one of the finest recent additions to the New York theater scene, and its new crop includes shows that were produced or in development in London at the National Theater (''Defying Hitler'' by Sebastian Haffner), the Bush Theater (''After the End'' by Dennis Kelly) and even the West End (''Private Peaceful'' by Michael Morpurgo). Also of special interest should be ''Nothing,'' a comedy of manners adapted from a Henry Green novel by Philip Prowse and starring the captivating Sophie Ward. (212) 279-4200, www.59e59.org.    DELACORTE THEATER Central Park. One of the Public Theater's most interesting-looking summer seasons in years kicks off with Liev Schreiber returning to the park, where he last played Henry V, to bloody his hands in a production of ''Macbeth'' (June 13-July 9) directed by Moisés Kaufman, who is better known for docudramas like ''The Laramie Project'' than for Shakespeare. Next, George C. Wolfe, the former producer of the Public Theater, who was to direct ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' takes on a much more intriguing task, a new version of ''Mother Courage and Her Children'' (Aug. 8-Sept. 3) with Meryl Streep, whose performance in Mike Nichols's 2001 production of ''The Seagull'' at the Delacorte was one of the most memorable theatrical star turns in recent memory. (212) 539-8750, www.publictheater.org.    ICE FACTORY '06 July 6-Aug. 20, Downtown. Soho Think Tank usually presents a few idiosyncratic gems in this annual new-work collection, which has featured shows by clever companies like Elevator Repair Service and Les Freres Corbusier. Among the six new pieces are ''Aruba,'' a black comedy about three unhappy urbanites, arriving after a sold-out run at last year's Edinburgh Fringe; ''Jaded Assassin,'' the latest pop confection by Timothy Haskell, billed as the world's first ''action play''; and ''Achtung Grimm,'' a Gothic retelling of Brothers Grimm stories by a carnival troupe. (212) 868-4444, www.sohothinktank.org/icefactory.html.    LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL July 10-30. Despite being a major influence on everyone from Lorca to Beckett, the salty, lyrical work of the Irish playwright J. M. Synge is rarely presented in New York, with the exception of the occasional production of ''The Playboy of the Western World.'' So for those who want to know more about the man whose portraits of peasant life helped invent the modern theater, here's your big chance: DruidSynge, a marathon of all six of Synge's plays directed by Garry Hynes (''The Beauty Queen of Leenane''), runs for seven performances (July 10-23), and involves a 19-member company, including the Tony Award-winning actress Marie Mullen (''Beauty Queen''). The festival will also present ''Geisha'' (July 27-30), a theater piece inspired in part by a disciple of Sayuri, the woman depicted in Arthur Golden's popular novel ''Memoirs of a Geisha'' and portrayed by Ziyi Zhang in the recent film version; it will arrive after a run at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C. (see below). Also on the schedule: Benjamin Bagby with a new edition of the 1997 ''Beowulf,'' his retelling in Old English (with English supertitles) of a portion of the Anglo-Saxon epic to his own accompaniment on a medieval harp (July 18-22); and Heiner Goebbels's music-theater piece and mouthful ''Eraritjaritjaka'' (July 27-29), based on texts by the Nobel Prize-winning author Elias Canetti. Events hot line: (212) 875-5766; tickets: (212) 721-6500, www.lincolncenter.org.    NEW YORK INTERNATIONAL FRINGE FESTIVAL Aug. 11-27. The Fringe, believe it or not, is now old enough -- it turns 10 this summer -- to have a nostalgic retrospective, with old performers bringing back beloved shows. Among the familiar titles in the festival, which will also include the usual 200 or so new entries of every stripe, will be Brian Parks's ''Americana Absurdum,'' the madcap comedy ''The Bicycle Men'' and the Canadian drama ''Pith!'' It will be like your high school reunion, except the popular crowd probably won't make fools of themselves this time. (212) 279-4488, www.fringenyc.org.    THE $ELLOUT FESTIVAL June 2-July 2, Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In past summers the Brick Theater presented the Hell Festival and the Moral Values Festival, but it has really hit on a crowd-pleasing concept this year. The shows include sex, money, violence and, as the four festival directors explain in a joint printed statement, ''whatever it takes to prove we're serious about our lack of substance.'' So are they truly serious? Well, there's a puppet version of the film ''Die Hard,'' a two-man show about the Olsen twins, a solo piece starring Soccergirl (''the world's first naked podcaster'') and a musical featuring Anna Nicole Smith and James Joyce. I don't know about you, but I'm sold. (718) 907-3457, www.bricktheater.com.    SPF: SUMMER PLAY FESTIVAL Theater Row, Manhattan, July 5-30. It's the third year of this formidable new-play showcase, which has become a magnet for commercial producers and audiences looking for writers on the cusp of success. The lineup includes ''Marge,'' about a man who hires a prostitute to murder his wife, written by Peter Morris, whose political drama ''Guardians'' opened at the Culture Project on Bleecker Street earlier this year. Among the other 14 plays are stories about three friends who formed a rock band in college (''The Fearless'' by Etan Frankel), and a female Republican pundit (''Hardball'' by Victoria Stewart) and a fictitious imagining of Ben Jonson putting together the First Folio of plays after Shakespeare's death (''Swansong'' by Patrick Page). (212) 239-6200, www.spfnyc.com.    New York State    BAY STREET THEATER, Sag Harbor. Mercedes Ruehl is apparently a popular choice to play fascinating 20th-century women in historical solo plays. She recently portrayed Peggy Guggenheim in ''Woman Before a Glass (A Triptych in Four Parts),'' and now she stars as Frida Kahlo in a world premiere, ''Viva la Vida!'' by Diane Shaffer. She's not the first, of course: Julie Taymor directed a film about Kahlo in 2002 starring Salma Hayek. But this play, which runs from July 18 to Aug. 6, concentrates on the final year and a half of Kahlo's life. Bay Street is also presenting a new production of the rock musical ''The Who's Tommy'' (June 13-July 9) and a version of Ronald Harwood's ''Quartet'' (through June 4), set in a home for retired opera singers and directed by Jack Hofsiss, who won a Tony Award for his staging of ''The Elephant Man'' in 1979. (631) 725-9500, www.baystreet.org.    HUDSON VALLEY SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL Garrison, June 14-Sept. 3. Don't worry about rain ruining an evening of al fresco theater. This well-regarded festival inaugurates a new tent for this season, which includes a production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (June 14- Sept. 3), directed by Terrence O'Brien (whose ''Tempest'' in 2005 was well reviewed). ''The Rivals'' by Richard Brinsley Sheridan will be running from July 19 to Sept. 2. (845) 265-9575, www.hvshakespeare.org.    VASSAR AND NEW YORK STAGE AND FILM POWERHOUSE THEATER SEASON Poughkeepsie, June 23-July 31. A training ground for New York transfers, the Powerhouse Theater presents two world premiere plays and one musical workshop. Daisy Foote's ''Bhutan'' (June 28-July 8) is about a young girl dreaming of life outside her blue-collar town, and Keith Huff's ''Steady Rain'' (July 19-31) tells the story of two Chicago policemen whose friendship is tested. As for the workshop, there will be four performances, starting July 7, of ''Prairie,'' an adaptation of Laura Ingalls Wilder's ''Little House on the Prairie'' stories, with book by Beth Henley and music by Rachel Portman. (845) 437-5599 (box office opens on June 7), powerhouse.vassar.edu (online ticket sales begin on May 22).    Oregon    OREGON SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL Ashland, through Oct. 29. ''The Winter's Tale'' (through Oct. 29), ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' (June 6-Oct. 6), ''Two Gentlemen of Verona (June 8-Oct. 8) and ''King John'' (July 4-Oct. 29) are the Shakespeare offerings this summer at this Tony Award-winning theater. For those wanting a break from Shakespeare, there will also be David Edgar's version of ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' (July 26-Oct. 28). (541) 482-4331, www.osfashland.org.    South Carolina    SPOLETO FESTIVAL U.S.A. Charleston, May 26-June 11. This beautiful town, thick with old Southern charm, may be known for its wonderfully preserved 18th-century homes, but the two-week festival has developed a reputation for presenting ultramodern work from around the globe. This year's lineup includes work by two of the finest solo artists of their generation, Danny Hoch and Mike Daisey, and a new play by the stylish Canadian writer Daniel MacIvor, ''A Beautiful View,'' about a roller-coaster relationship between two women. Audiences will find just as many lesser-known artists, including the Kneehigh Theater of Cornwall, England, which will bring its National Theater hit ''Tristan & Yseult'' to South Carolina; and the Singapore director Ong Keng Sen, who will mount ''Geisha'' before it travels to New York City (see Lincoln Center Festival, above). (843) 579-3100, www.spoletousa.org.    Utah    UTAH SHAKESPEAREAN FESTIVAL Cedar City, June 22-Sept. 2. Within a day's drive of seven national parks, and only a few hours from Las Vegas, this stalwart summer festival won the Tony Award in 2000 for best regional theater. On three stages it presents a busy summer season of six plays including ''The Merry Wives of Windsor,'' ''Hamlet'' and ''Antony and Cleopatra,'' along with two modern plays (''On Golden Pond'' and ''Room Service'') and a classic operetta (''H.M.S. Pinafore''). (800) 752-9849, www.bard.org.    Canada    SHAW FESTIVAL Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, through Nov. 19. Scads of Americans cross the border every year to attend this superior showcase dedicated to plays by George Bernard Shaw and his contemporaries, as well as dramas about the period in which Shaw lived (1856-1950). This year audiences will get to see an early and popular Shaw play (''Arms and the Man,'' through Oct. 29) and a later and more obscure one (''Too True to Be Good,'' through Oct. 7); the first pokes fun at the military and the middle class and the second has a laugh at the expense of doctors, preachers and, again, the military. The festival will also present plays by Ibsen (''Rosmersholm,'' July 5-Oct. 7), Chekhov (''Love Among the Russians,'' June 10-Sept. 24) and Coward (''Design for Living,'' June 15-Nov. 18), as well as an adaptation of H. G. Wells's science fiction tale ''The Invisible Man'' (through Oct. 29). (800) 511-7429, www.shawfest.com.    STRATFORD FESTIVAL Ontario, through Oct. 29. Colm Feore, the rock-jawed stage veteran who portrayed the district attorney in the film ''Chicago,'' plays the brutal mama's boy Coriolanus in a production of Shakespeare's drama that kicks off the busy 54th season of this prestigious Canadian showcase. The theme of the season, with its 15 shows -- including two musicals (''Oliver!,'' ''South Pacific'') and two one-woman shows (''Fanny Kemble,'' about the 19th-century Shakespearean actress, and a new black comedy, ''The Blonde, the Brunette and the Vengeful Redhead'') -- is family, with equal doses of dominating mothers (''The Glass Menagerie'') and disappointed fathers (''Henry IV, Part I'').

Credit Mr. Sinatra with impressive dexterity.Credit him also with ability as his own producer to pick a good yarn. This fable by David P. Harmon is—or should be—an actor's dream. It tells of a skinny young bully in a frightened western town who thrives within the shadow of his brother, a famous gunman, until the latter is killed. Then, when a genuine bully arrives to take over, he turns coward and tries to make tracks out of that region, until—well, let's leave it at that.Plainly, it sets up a hero of uncommon cut for a western film and angles less in the direction of \\"High Society\\" than of the somewhat more memorable \\"High Noon.\\" The conflict of cowardice and bravery was the latter's theme.Furthermore, Mr. Sinatra does a pretty good job of making the chicken-livered tin-horn fairly credible. Outside of his dude-rancher's get-ups, he looks the punk he plays, and he ranges well from swaggering arrogance to sweating pusillanimity. It is something to see Mr. Sinatra swallow that Adam's apple of his.But, unfortunately, the finished screen play and Don McGuire's direction of this film are not up to the quality of the story or of Mr. Sinatra's job. The flow of events is ponderous and the performances the other actors give are either stiff or exaggerated. The whole thing falls into a standard western style.William Conrad as the bully who takes over and Wallace Ford as a full-fledged local coward are a little better than the others. Phyllis Kirk is merely pretty as the inevitable girl. And Keenan Wynn plays a pistol-packing parson quite ferociously in one scene.Mr. Sinatra, the actor, might mention to the producer of this film, who happens to be Mr. Sinatra, that he needs better writing and direction than he gets here.For all that, it seemed like old times at the Paramount yesterday, when Mr. Sinatra appeared in person to entertain with songs and wisecracks from the stage. A capacity audience of loud enthusiasts, clearly reminiscent of those who gathered at the Paramount in the Forties when Mr. Sinatra appeared frequently as a soloist with Tommy Dorsey's band, was on hand to greet him. And the old familiar chorus of shrieks and squeals, especially from the feminine patrons, often responded to his vocal tricks.The patrons were lined on Forty-third Street west to Eighth Avenue and north to Forty-fourth Street when the doors of the theatre were opened at 9:50 A. M. A few placards, carried by teen-agers, proclaimed \\"We Love Frankie\\" and \\"Sinatra for President.\\"Mr. Sinatra, accompanied by the joint band of Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, will make daily personal appearances at the theatre for one week.

Her voice is sad, her manner is tear-drenched, her gestures are those of despair, and the onlooker's reaction, to all this sorrowful business is decidedly negative, which makes for a unanimous mood. In this audible film at the Strand, the actress wends her weary way through difficult and slightly trite cinema matter, ending up no happier than in the beginning and not much further advanced.As Mildred Barker, she is sued for divorce by her husband, who wants to be free to marry another woman. He gains custody of their child. Subsequently Mildred obtains employment in a night club revue and listens to her associates' advice about becoming a \\"golddigger.\\" She finally does, then learns that her baby is dead, a fact which moves her to wander about in the streets until arrested as a vagrant. She is bailed out of court and promised marriage. Thus the story ends.Miss Griffith's listless manner is quite depressing even when feigning moments of happiness, and the photoplay falls flat.The picture includes scenes inside one of those gorgeous motion picture night clubs that presents a revue with more entertainers than customers at the tables. Some of the settings are nicely conceived and there is at least one scene in the revue that might have amounted to something. It appeared slashed. The subject material is ample and a sensitive performance might have made of it an interesting human drama. In its present state it is just another talking film.

Yes and no, but Wilde forgot to mention that art also imitates art. A quick glance up and down Broadway makes the point. The stage is stage-struck. In ''The Real Thing,'' ''La Cage Aux Folles,'' ''Noises Off,'' ''42nd Street,'' ''Dream Girls'' and ''Chorus Line,'' theater turns to itself for subject matter. All the world's a stage - there's nothing new about the metaphor. What's new is how obssessed popular theater has become with the comparison, how the conceit functions, and the psychological assumptions that underpin it. The poor players no longer strut and fret their hour upon the stage, they kick up their heels and belt out a song to celebrate a new-found freedom in lifestyle and role choice. But if the surface of these plays is light and bright and sparkling, underneath - at least from the sociological point of view - there's often a darker sub-text.\\n\\n Metatheater - theater which reflects self-consciously upon itself - goes back a long way. Shakespeare often used the play within the play to dramatize the nature of theatrical creation, most successfully in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' ''Hamlet'' and ''The Tempest''. Calderon, Spain's great dramatist, used the device to show the unreality of reality. In ''Life is a Dream'' and ''The Great Stage of the World,'' the physical objects we frantically grab and clutch slip through our fingers.

In new plays and revivals, from ''Balm in Gilead'' to ''The Ballad of Soapy Smith,'' from ''Death of a Salesman'' to ''Hurlyburly'' and ''Glengarry Glen Ross,'' we see business depicted as a rough-and-tumble competition dominated by panic and greed, underhanded dealings and no honor among thieves. Beneath that three-button suit, these plays tell us, beats the heart of a con man whose most valuable stock in trade is blarney. No matter where you cast your glance in these plays, the game is the same: ''Gotta' hustle,'' as our old friend George F. Babbitt put it. There's a gold mine in your neighbor's backyard. Go for it.
