During World War II, Diana Vreeland, working at Harper’s Bazaar, challenged the designer Claire McCardell to create an attractive garment to meet the needs of women “who faced the facts of life.” McCardell’s “popover,” a tie-fastened denim shift with patch pockets and a quilted oven mitt, sold in the hundreds of thousands. Soon aprons became associated with apple-pie moms, but across the Atlantic stars like Sophia Loren were using them to emphasize their swaying hips. With the advent of women’s liberation, though, aprons became passé, and it wasn’t until the ’90s that designers like Helmut Lang and artists like Andrea Zittel began re-examining them. At Zittel’s Smockshop (smockshop.org), artists still produce one-off versions. Lately, the cult of the apron has been gaining ground — witness “Desperate Housewives” and the earthy mamacitas of Pedro Almodóvar’s films. Apronology, a magazine targeting haute-apron fanciers, was introduced this month. In Japan, “hadaka apron” fetishists enjoy imagery of women wearing nothing but an apron — an aesthetic that evokes some of Thakoon Panichgul&# Wrap Star"},{"year":"2000","title":"Study by Jupiter Communications concludes that people who use Napster and other Web sites that allow sharing of songs as MP3 files are 45 percent more likely to be CD buyers than nonusers are","excerpt":"Jupiter also faults study by Recording Industry Association of America that shows CD sales in stores near colleges have dropped in areas with high levels of MP3 usage (M) Study Claims Downloads Spur Offline Music Sales"},{"year":"1960","title":"fired 900 mi, Canaveral TWO TESTS SUCCESSFUL","excerpt":"Jupiter and Polaris Are Fired From Cape Canaveral"},{"year":"1926","title":"Will appear in crescent of the moon STAR IN CRESCENT TONIGHT.","excerpt":"Jupiter and Quarter Moon Will Appear Together -- Meteors Due."},{"year":"1959","title":"fired, Canaveral 3 MISSILES FIRED AT FLORIDA BASE","excerpt":"Jupiter and Titan in New Test -- Experimental Rocket Is Launched From Jet"},{"year":"1930","title":"Venus and Mars brilliant in this week's eve sky PLANETS SHINE IN WEST THIS WEEK","excerpt":"Jupiter and Venus Both Brilliant in the Sky At Evening"},{"year":"1928","title":"42 Argentine polo ponies sold for $276,100 $276,100 Record Paid for 42 Argentine Polo Ponies","excerpt":"Jupiter Brings $22,000; ARGENTINE MOUNTS SOLD FOR $276,100 42 Polo Ponies Auctioned Off for Largest Sum Ever Received in This Country.

But nowhere on the enormous planet is there a liquid ocean to navigate  or a single square foot of solid land to stand on.

Only a small museum remains of the Hoa Lo prison, involuntary housing for 300 American pilots captured in the conflict. The Hilton Hanoi Opera, open since 1999, takes pains to not celebrate a connection to Hoa Lo, even if the hotel's Web site is www.hanoi.hilton.com. Tourists still drop in to ask if the prison was located there, or at least nearby -- but none of the guests, the concierge assured during a recent stay, confuse the hotel with a prison.    THE LOCATION -- The hotel is in the downtown commercial district, a short walk from the French-colonial cafes and architecture of Old Town. Even closer is Hoan Kiem Lake, the bustling moped racetrack at the center of everything.    THE BUILDING -- The hotel curves around the nearly century-old Hanoi Opera House (now known as the Municipal Theater). The Neo-Baroque facade is designed to mirror the loggias and high plinths of the opera house itself, and it does it well, even down to an identical colonial-yellow paint job.    THE AMENITIES -- Like many foreign installations in developing countries, the hotel can seem culturally and economically removed from the balletic chaos of its city. English is the only language needed inside the three-story lobby, which, with its gilded columns and ornate iron ceiling, somewhat resembles a bank. And anyone familiar with Hanoi will be aghast at the prices compared with those in the city at large. One night in the Hilton can get you a week at a hotel in Old Town. And a bowl of pho, a rice-noodle soup, in one of hotel's three restaurants costs $4.50 plus a 5 percent gratuity and a 10 percent value-added tax","excerpt":"just a block away, a similar bowl costs about 15 cents.    THE ROOM -- You've been in this room before in Chicago -- or was it San Diego? That's deliberately part of its appeal. The carpet, the tapestry behind the beds and the heavy striped drapes are Vietnamese green, cream and a red so deep it's almost crimson. In a watercolor painting near the beds, a peasant family shares a meal, their faces shaded by conical hats. A beautiful armoire features a heavily lacquered painting of the Vietnam countryside. But that's about it for local color. The television picks up HBO and ESPN. The minibar is stocked with Western comfort snacks like Oreos, Kit Kat bars, California pistachios, Pringles and four brands of beer, only one -- Halida -- that's Vietnamese.    THE BATHROOM -- Brown. Earthy brown tile lines the floor and walls. There's a brown stone countertop supporting a generous white half-moon sink. Next to the sink, a green vase holds a red rose, a Vietnamese symbol of life.    ROOM SERVICE -- An order form for breakfast listed omelets and chicken soup. We ordered both only to be awakened by a call the next morning reminding us that, as we suspected, no eggs or chicken will be available until the avian flu scare runs its course. The fish, cold cuts, cereals and fruits featured at the buffet in the main restaurant are a better choice, anyway.    THE CROWD -- Jazz musicians from California, executives tapping on their laptops in the lobby and the occasional homesick backpacker of means.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- The Hilton Hanoi Opera feels hermetically sealed off from Hanoi. In the lobby, eating a salami-and-cheese sandwich as Billy Joel crooned over the sound system, we couldn't hear the motorbikes zooming outside, their horns forever honking -- not in warning but as a general announcement of their existence. The hotel advertises a good night's sleep, which is rarely guaranteed in Hanoi. After two weeks in the country, the Hilton provided our first night of deep sleep.

Bring the liquid to a boil and let the fish simmer gently about two minutes or slightly longer, depending on the thickness of the pieces. Then drain and serve.

Mary Ann's husband, Brian, doesn't know that he's infertile, but Mary Ann does, so she decides to. . . . Thus begins ''Babycakes,'' and the fourth installment of Armistead Maupin's San Francisco saga careens beautifully on. People who haven't read his ''Tales of the City,'' ''More Tales of the City'' and ''Further Tales of the City'' might initially be confused by the plethora of characters, but they should continue. ''Babycakes,'' unlike the ''Tales,'' preserves a sense of irony while making paramount the values of warmth and love. Almost a decade into their promiscuous but caring friendships, the characters are tempered by age and wisdom, though still layered in reflecting, intermittently revealing levels of absurdity. Gestures have a life of their own - an ''Elizabethan'' wave of the hand, for example, belongs first to the Queen, then to a socialite, then to Mona, a mail-order lesbian bride, making equal the essentially unequal. If British high life and low life don't come across as different from San Francisco's, who cares? Credit, as Mr. Maupin does, ''the global village,'' or suspend disbelief and concentrate on the mostly deft twists and turns of plot. ''Babycakes'' seethes with pleasantly nasty topical references and has been likened by the over-enthusiastic to Dickens's Victorian melodramas and to Wodehouse's cheerful fables. Mr. Maupin's style, though, with all its near-perfect ear (''crumbling umber castle''), is still too alienated and grotesque for many, and Babycakes herself - Mary Ann - isn't central enough to function as a proper picaresque heroine.

As Mr. Forty sees it, design is not merely an indicator of esthetic taste, but a social phenomenon that both mirrors and shapes how we think. Whereas objects of art reflect the personal vision of their makers, manufactured goods - which are designed to be salable and profitable - tend to embody more generalized beliefs about society, and so ''can cast ideas about who we are and how we should behave into permanent and tangible forms.''

Since then he has formed his own record label, fathered some children, lavishly married the singer Whitney Houston (who is pregnant) and toured.

In mid-December Brett Weston, son of the modernist photographer Edward Weston and himself long renowned for his richly detailed black-and-white landscape images, fulfilled a decade-old pledge by destroying all but 12 of his negatives. Surrounded by almost 100 friends and associates at his home in Carmel Valley, Calif., the 80-year-old Mr. Weston sat in front of his fireplace, threw in 75 of his negatives, one by one, and watched as they caught fire, curled up and burned. Word circulated later that Mr. Weston had burned or defaced all but a dozen of the rest of his negatives as well.    His act touched a nerve at the core of many people's ideas about photography, and news of it was met with protest. Many photographers, after all, regard the negative as almost sacrosanct. One of the medium's central characteristics has always been the possibility of making a more or less unlimited number of prints from a given negative. In the 19th century that trait helped give photography its democratic quality, as cheap stereograph cards and cartes de visite, the small portraits that became popular in the 1860's, flooded the world.

And yet, with the summertime ritual known as Mostly Mozart only a couple of weeks away, this may be as good a time as any to fiddle with that seemingly incongruous idea. In most history books, the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, is picked out as the event that symbolizes the collapse of Europe's ancien regime, the beginning of the end for a privilege-encrusted society sharply divided between aristocratic masters and humble servants. However, eight years earlier a similarly symbolic act took place almost unnoticed in the provincial Austrian town of Salzburg. On May 9, 1781, a defiant servant and reluctant violinist named Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart gave up the instrument forever and left the employ of the Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus, Count of Colloredo.\\n\\nEmotionally and all but in fact, Wolfgang at the same moment broke with his father, Leopold, the contentedly servile court musician who had taught him the violin and continually urged him to settle down to a life as a flunky in the Archbishop's orchestra. Free of both masters for the first time in his life, the 25-year-old musician went to Vienna to pursue a career as a an independent artist, an experiment in freedom that ended, as his father predicted, in financial disaster and apparent artistic failure.
