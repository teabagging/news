Please explain the remarkable odor neutralizing ability of sodium bicarbonate, a common household chemical so innocuous that it is even used in baking. A. Dr. Joseph Liuzzo of the Department of Food Science at Louisiana University says sodium bicarbonate (or baking soda as it is commonly known) has  a special absorbing capacity for volatile odors as do most powders. ''Lingering  odors are literally absorbed by the fine white powder,'' he said. These odors remain trapped in the powder until air moisture causes the powder to slowly decompose, separating into sodium and bicarbonate and the bicarbonate further dividing into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Many of the trapped odors dissipate with the carbon dioxide gas. Some odors remain in the powder. The decomposing nature of sodium bicarbonate is the reason for its many uses. Cooks add it to flour mixtures because carbon dioxide bubbles released in its decomposition cause the foods to rise during baking. Sodium bicarbonate is also used as a stomach alkalizer. Once in the stomach, the compound decomposes: resulting sodium neutralizes excess acid, and carbon dioxide gas forces a burp. Q. What makes rising heat waves on the highway visible at certain distances and invisible at others? A. Heat waves are visible because of refraction, the bending of light beams. Dr. Clifford Swartz of State University of New York at Stonybrook says light beams are refracted as they pass from cold to warm regions","excerpt":"light travels faster in warm air than in cold.

In fairness, the little museum does not actually promote smoking. Rather, it tracks the history of tobacco from its pre-Columbian New World origins through its rapid conquest of Africa, Europe and the Orient.

But if they do, they could clarify \\"dark matter,\\" the 90 percent of the universe's mass that is still unaccounted for.

Tonight's offering is the third such film to be shown on the network since its inception in April of last year.

''   Like Nick Jenkins, the amiable narrator of his roman-fleuve, ''A Dance to the Music of Time,'' Mr. Powell tends to be self-effacing and reserved when it comes to talking about himself.

But in his remarkable and moving biography of Wilhelm Reich - controversial psychologist and founder of ''orgonomy'' - Myron Sharaf goes to the op-posite extreme: The first chapter is devoted not to Reich's childhood but to Mr. Sharaf's intense and troubled relationship with him. Mr. Sharaf can't take objectivity for granted","excerpt":"like anyone who knew Reich, he's had to struggle long and hard for it.

During the 10 years it took to write ''Fury on Earth,'' Mr. Sharaf had to come to terms with intense positive and negative feelings about his subject.

(Franklin Watts, $17.95.) Sam Patch, who enjoyed brief fame for jumping off waterfalls before plunging to his death over the Genesee Falls in 1829, was a decidedly minor figure in American popular history. Making him the subject of a 361-page novel is a risky business -especially when the story is told by Sam's pet bear, Bruin. Luckily, Bruin is very likable. Honest, loyal and brave, he has a knack for knockabout, punning narration, well suited to his creator's (perhaps debatable) vision of Jacksonian America as a place where people jes' natur'ly jumped off waterfalls, shot b'ars in public places and fell down drunk a lot. Unluckily, Bruin also tends without warning to start sounding like a furry Wittgenstein: ''Was \\n[\\nSam\\n]\\n saying . . . that the old quantitative, spatial way of looking at things was as primitive and false as the related error of thinking that we in fact do endure?'' A 500-pound bear who writes that way might be funny in some contexts, but William Getz takes him seriously.

L. Doctorow. (Random House, $22.95.) Beautifully written, meticulously plotted, scrupulously imagined stories that are impeccably civil in themselves no matter how shocking the action","excerpt":"like Doctorow's novels, they affirm the American theme of self-creation, of the individual's capacity to make for himself an original life to replace the one offered by convention, even though this often requires a certain amount of lawbreaking.    THE MASTER, by Colm Toibin. (Scribner, $25.) A deeply considered, crisply delivered novel whose hero is Henry James, of all writers the most ambiguous about the issue of secret sexuality; Toibin, a gay Irishman, sees in James an opacity, a failure of passion, a coldness and evasiveness that may conflict with the apparent happiness and sociability recalled by many who knew the real James.    WHY WE DO IT: Rethinking Sex and the Selfish Gene, by Niles Eldredge. (Norton, $24.95.) An eminent paleontologist takes on the adherents of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology; he pursues a quasi-teleological investigation of the main objective of sex, which in his view is species stability and extinction resistance, not just gene multiplication.    OBLIVION: Stories, by David Foster Wallace. (Little, Brown, $25.95.) Narratives in an exhaustive mode, told by people who notice absolutely everything and tell you all about it in a stubbornly elongated style; paradoxically (perhaps), some of the stories take as their subjects the limitations of words themselves.    AMERICAN TABOO: A Murder in the Peace Corps, by Philip Weiss. (HarperCollins, $25.95.) A tenacious investigator's account of the death of Deborah Gardner, 23, a Peace Corps volunteer in Tonga in 1976; the man who killed her, another volunteer, was found not guilty by reason of insanity and shipped back to the United States, where he was soon released and appears to be doing just fine.    THE LEMON TABLE: Stories, by Julian Barnes. (Knopf, $22.95.) Old age and getting there is the scene of this collection by the author of ''Flaubert's Parrot,'' who is now 58. ''The Lemon Table'' avoids broad satire, but sharp little comic pleasures abound: an old man who abandons gluttony for greed; a retired major who loses hold of some fictions he tells himself about his sexual activities.    NATASHA: And Other Stories, by David Bezmozgis. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $18.) An appealing, loosely linked anthropological collection that succinctly and unsentimentally depicts a world of Soviet Jews in Toronto. The seven stories are told through a general protagonist, Mark Berman, and they span two decades of his family's struggles to adapt to life in the West; the title story concerns a girl who has become a sex film star at 14.    LETTERS, 1928-1946, by Isaiah Berlin. Edited by Henry Hardy. (Cambridge University, $40.) The first of a projected three volumes of correspondence by one of Britain's most notable sages, whose genius for friendship and conversation tended to obscure his scholarship, which some critics believe was only so-so.   And Bear In Mind"},{"year":"1990","title":"Even the trusty old acoustic guitar isn't immune to musical changes. Michael Hedges, a solo guitarist and singer who performed Thursday night at the Bottom Line, plays instrumentals and songs that reflect the priorities of modern pop: rhythm and texture above melody and harmonic motion. He played unconventionally tuned acoustic guitars (with electronic pickups) and a hybrid electric instrument that adds five low harplike strings to a six-stringed guitar.    With virtuosic technique Mr. Hedges builds layers of syncopation and modal riffs. Although a few of his pieces use the warmth of sustained chords, his usual approach is largely percussive. He strums quick, steady chords and open intervals","excerpt":"like Eddie Van Halen and Alan Holdsworth, he taps notes on the fingerboard with both hands, creating repeating patterns. Then, with his unoccupied fingers he makes notes materialize above the rhythms in unpredictable accents or pinging harmonics. Amid the counterpoint he sings in a sustained tenor, either his own wide-eyed songs about love or eclectic cover versions; his first set included songs by Neneh Cherry, Jimi Hendrix and Fine Young Cannibals, arranged with jaggedly athletic guitar parts.     Mr. Hedges records for Windham Hill, the label that started the new- age music glut, and some of his own pieces for acoustic guitar have the signature of dull new-age music: paired, repeated phrases with numbing symmetry. Others have a tendency to devolve into an assortment of technical effects. But many of his instrumentals, even those with inauspicious titles like \\"Ritual Dance\\" or \\"Silent Anticipation,\\" weave meditative vamps and technical feats into music that has a rhapsodic sweep.

Her music sounds as if it comes from an imaginary country, and she sings in the accented English of someone from that country. In the fall of 2003, Hoop was living in a van in Sonoma County, 35 miles north of San Francisco, when late one morning she was awakened by a call on her cellphone. The voice on the other end belonged to Nic Harcourt, a disc jockey and host of a weekday music program, ''Morning Becomes Eclectic,'' on the Los Angeles public-radio station KCRW. Harcourt had received a copy of some unreleased self-produced ''demo'' recordings of Hoop's and had begun playing them on the air. Her song ''Seed of Wonder'' was especially popular: when it spun, the studio's phones lighted up and listeners in their cars pulled over to the side of the road, waiting for Harcourt to announce what it was. It would go on to become one of KCRW's top five requests for eight weeks running, a station record.     Hoop had no idea who Nic Harcourt was, what his radio show was like or even that he was in possession of a copy of her CD, but she could hardly have received a better break. ''Morning Becomes Eclectic,'' and KCRW as a whole, are renowned for purveying the contemporary music equivalent of art-house films or literary fiction, a genre the rock critic Robert Christgau calls ''semipopular'' music, marked less by style than by a certain base-line intelligence and tastefulness. (As the station's music director, Harcourt also oversees the rest of its music programming.) Harcourt, whose show is broadcast daily from 9 a.m. to noon, has a knack for finding interesting new music ahead of everyone else: he was the first in America to play Norah Jones and Coldplay on the radio","excerpt":"like Jesca Hoop, the platinum-sellers Dido and David Gray were unsigned artists whose demos Harcourt originally spotlighted on his show; and more idiosyncratic unsigned acts like Damien Rice, Sigur Ros and Jem have all also become the object of record-company bidding wars as a result of Harcourt's championing.

Her do-it-yourself music uses the noises of trains, thumping metal gates and cardboard carpet tubes as well as orchestral spirals of harps and trumpets. Though a pianist at heart, she embraces the blips of electronica and computer-programmed, multitracked vocals. Ms. Heap, who contributed silky, metallic vocals when she was part of the alt-pop duo Frou Frou, has done well with her second solo album, ''Speak for Yourself'' (Megaphonic/RCA Victor), which appeared last year. Songs from it continue to pop up on film and television soundtracks (most recently ''The Last Kiss,'' ''The O.C.,'' ''The Chronicles of Narnia,'' ''CSI'' and ''Six Feet Under''). Ms. Heap, 29, is touring the United States through December. She recently spoke by telephone with Winter Miller about what she's listening to now.    Barbara Morgenstern       She's this crazy chick from Germany. She's extremely musical. She's very active","excerpt":"like me she makes her own albums. She's very idiosyncratic and in her own world. She uses a lot of chords: it's not like 1, 4, 5 the whole time, it takes you places. ''The Grass Is Always Greener'' (Monika) is quite blippy. She swerves and takes real sharp corners, and your heart goes with her. She has these organ sounds; it's her signature sound through all her albums. My favorite on this record is ''The Operator''; it's part German, part English. The record is not polished. It has lots of charm.    Coppé       She's a crazy Japanese chick. She has her own label (sweetrice.com). She's very resourceful, very prolific. I'm dying to meet her. I love her vocal eccentricities, I'm so jealous I can't do it. As much as I love this kind of music, I feel like I need to write songs that have a lyrical thread through them and you can sing along to them. Her vocals you could not sing along to if you tried. She doesn't care about cutting up a vocal and moving the syllables. It's not about the lyrics with her. Half the time I'm not sure what she's saying. I'm not sure if she's singing in English or Japanese. She really takes sampling vocals to a new level. The music is free jazz, calypso, lounge; it's atonal and electronically anal. It's a trip, and you have no idea where she's going to take you next.    Kate Havnevik       This is her debut album. She's done stuff with Röyksopp. She's a lady who does a lot of it herself; she's very musical and beautiful to look at. A couple of songs on ''Melankton'' (Continentica) take my breath away. ''Unlike Me'' has this lush arrangement, beautiful melody, lots of depth musically and very orchestral palettes. The songs are traditionally structured, but because of their instrumentation it doesn't feel like your average meat-and-two-veg song. I personally don't listen to a lot of singer-songwriter music because it's so meat-and-two-veg. The music I listen to is about production; the lyrics are always secondary to me. A lot of people listen to the lyrics first and then decide if they like the song.    Cursor Miner       He's from London. I just fell in love with his music. This is unashamedly dance music, very electronic: layering up loads of '80s synth with beats that throw you right onto the 21st-century dance floor. ''Danceflaw'' (Lo Recordings) will get you jumping. For a while I was going down to the gym (that doesn't happen anymore), and his music makes me pump five times as hard. If there was a ''Rocky 20,'' this would be the music for it. My favorite one is ''Spassfaktor.'' It's just a really original rhythm. It's hard-gated: a long reverb that's cut really short.    James Figurine       I found his music looking on MySpace. He was in a band called Figurine, also the Postal Service. I'm a really big fan of ''Mistake Mistake Mistake Mistake'' (Plug Research). It's very electronic, but his lyrics, there are a few that kind of get to me. When I found this record, I'd just broken up with my boyfriend; it was quite mutual, but that seems to be the only time I pay attention to lyrics. There's nothing too metaphorical about it. It's all very open and almost obvious, but it's the way he says it, the way he puts words together that makes things interesting. It's not flowery, but it's a play on words and stuff like that. Very quirky, very square and yellow: that's not the CD case, it's how it makes you feel. You end up doing like a little skip and a dance on the pavement when you listen to him. ''Leftovers'' is the track I listen to sometimes before I go onstage.    Milosh       ''Meme'' (Plug Research) is my favorite album of the year. Mike Milosh has his own sound world. It's compact in the way that he doesn't have that much breadth of instrumentation, but it's very much full of goodness and nutrients. Every song ebbs and flows. I want to walk around parks and cities on cold crisp mornings in lots of layers and watch the world go by when I'm listening to him. I love the whole record. If you were going to listen to one song on this record to decide if you liked it, I'd choose ''City.''

An ambitious, satisfying father-son memoir about a family that fought a deadly civil war with several sides on several fronts for several decades.    LE MARIAGE, by Diane Johnson. (Dutton, $23.95.) A highly entertaining novel whose European-American couples misread each other not just as individuals but as cultural products; a manuscript is involved, also a murder, maybe a kidnapping.    USE ME, by Elissa Schappell. (Morrow, $23.) An unusually urgent coming-of-age novel whose two narrators meet as college roommates; a casual, ironic tone interferes not at all with the rendering of agonizing needs and desperation, from girlhood through motherhood and a parent's death.    WAY OUT THERE IN THE BLUE: Reagan, Star Wars and the End of the Cold War, by Frances FitzGerald. (Simon & Schuster, $30.)

Neither was imposing in opening defeats, Wildcats to William and Mary, 27-14; Huskies to Furman, 26-17. Midwest   Notre Dame (1-0) at Michigan (1-0) 17-17. If underdog Irish can win this one, then Coach Lou Holtz will have several last laughs.    Washington (1-0) at Ohio State (1-0) DNP. Huskies on a mission of redemption. Buckeyes had satisfying 34-7 opening victory over Rice and won't be easy.   Texas A&M (1-0) at Oklahoma (1-0) DNP. First meeting since 1951. Aggies, with mild schedule, will not often be tested like this. Sooners were formidable in 35-3 rout of T.C.U.    Iowa (1-0) at Iowa State (1-0) 21-7. Hawkeyes usually win but maybe not this time. South    Clemson (1-0) at Florida State (2-0) 20-24. Tigers were unimpressive in 10-point triumph over Nevada-Las Vegas. The Seminoles seem awesome.    Georgia (0-1) at Tennessee (1-0) 31-34. Two of nation's best quarterbacks on display. But Vols' Heath Shuler has stronger cast than Bulldogs' Eric Zeier.    Maryland (0-1) at North Carolina (2-0) 24-31. Tar Heels imposing so far. Terps seldom score faster or more often than their foes.    Alabama (1-0) at Vanderbilt (1-0) 25-8. Commodores, who rushed for 431 yards against Wake Forest, may dent the resolute Bama defense. But not enough.    Florida (1-0) at Kentucky (1-0) 35-19. Gators broke in an impressive new quarterback, Terry Dean. They merit everyone's attention.  West    San Diego State (1-0) at California (1-0) DNP. Marshall Faulk may have trouble running through the Golden Bears. Mismatches    Colgate (0-1) at Army (0-0) DNP. Cadets will show a more diversified offense in this rehearsal.    Navy (0-0) at Virginia (1-0) 0-53. The Middies will be stronger this season but won't come close to Cavaliers.    Texas Tech (1-0) at Nebraska (1-0) DNP. Another breeze for Cornhuskers.

The recipe below reminds me of those sumptuous days at the World's Fair. This salad combines crab meat with shrimp for a different texture and flavor.

A1    The explosions in Mumbai prompted heightened security in transit systems in the United States.   A6    Baghdad Rocked by Violence  More than 50 people were killed in Baghdad in violence that included a double suicide bombing near busy entrances to the fortified Green Zone, shootings, mortar attacks, a series of car bombs and the ambush of a bus with Shiite mourners returning from a burial.   A1    Israeli Army Advances in Gaza  Israeli troops moved in force into central Gaza, expanding a two-week-old Israeli offensive intended to release a captured soldier and stop rocket fire into Israel.   A12    Talks With Iran Stalled  Negotiations in Brussels have stalled between the world's major powers and Iran, weeks after Iran was offered economic and political rewards if it halted its nuclear program. Iran has yet to accept or reject the offer or give a timetable for any response.   A12    NATIONAL A16-21    U.S. to Grant Detainees Geneva Convention Rights  The White House conceded for the first time that terror suspects held by the United States had a right under international law to basic human and legal protections under the Geneva Conventions.  A1    Terror Target List Criticized  The inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security found that the National Asset Database, which is used to help allocate the hundreds of millions of dollars in antiterrorism grants each year, is flawed.   A1    Big Dig Accident Kills Woman  Huge slabs of concrete, each weighing at least three tons, fell from the ceiling of one of the Big Dig tunnels in Boston, crushing a woman to death in a car.   A16    Crackdown on Online Gambling  The House approved a crackdown on Internet wagering that would ban not only sports bets but also online poker and other games.  A18    Immigration Deal in Colorado  Colorado legislators have struck a compromise over illegal immigration law, forging a deal that Democrats and Republicans said could be the most far-reaching state overhaul in the country.   A18    Leak Case Revelation  Robert D. Novak, the journalist who first identified the intelligence officer at the center of the C.I.A. leak case, says in his syndicated column that six months later he voluntarily identified three sources to the prosecutor in the case, who, he says, had already learned of his conversations with each of them.

A1    New York's Violent Divorces  The epic East 62nd Street divorce battle that apparently culminated in the explosion of a town house was bad by any standard. But in New York, divorce lawyers say they have seen comparable acts. Some say such spiraling levels of anger, rage and eventually violence are a function of New York's cumbersome divorce laws. B1    Officers Said to Aid Dealers  Five police officers and one retired county sheriff's officer from several towns in Passaic County, New Jersey, were indicted on charges that they conspired to help twin brothers avoid arrest on drug charges and hide their close social relationships with the two men. The brothers were later arrested and charged with illegally selling drugs and prescription medications.

In this, his 25th work, as in his other studies of American institutions, from a hospital to a race track to Central Park, he allows his subject to reveal itself, the mundane along with the sensational.   What that means for tomorrow night's two-hour visit to the Miami Metrozoo are many pictures of fauna on both sides of the bars. The zoo workers are efficient and conscientious, the visiting children are cute and the elephants, chimpanzees, zebras and so forth are easy to look at, even if you think you recognize most of them from other public television programs. But they do not make for steadily enthralling television. The opening 10 minutes of disporting families and showoff animals tests even a Wiseman fan's endurance, and after the sixth or seventh time the zoo train goes by, you might find yourself hoping for a derailment.
