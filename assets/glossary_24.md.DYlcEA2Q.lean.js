Iowa (7-2 over all, 5-1 in the Big Ten) needed a victory and losses by Illinois and Minnesota to clinch a tie for the conference title with two games remaining. Instead, Ohio State (6-2-1, 4-1-1) pulled to within a half-game of the Hawkeyes.   Iowa seemed in command with a 26-14 lead after a 1-yard touchdown plunge by Lew Montgomery, his second of the game, with 11 minutes remaining.   With 7:22 left, the Buckeyes' Foster Paulk blocked a Jim Hujsak punt to give Ohio State the ball at the Iowa 24. Three plays later, Frey hit Olive with a 21-yard touchdown pass to cut Iowa's lead to 26-21 with 6:34 to play.   On Iowa's next possession, Lance Price stepped in front of Alan Cross to pick off a Matt Rodgers pass, Rodgers's first interception in his last 88 throws. But Jason Olejniczak intercepted a Frey pass in the end zone on a fourth-and-6 play with 2:31 to play.   Iowa failed to move the ball on its next possession and Ohio State downed a punt on the Iowa 48 with 59 seconds left. Frey hit Olive for 23 yards over the middle, then connected with Jeff Graham to put the ball at the Iowa 19. Two plays later, Frey hit Graham again to move the Buckeyes to the Iowa 3.   After an incomplete pass, Frey hit Olive, who had beaten Merton Hanks, in the back of the end zone.   Iowa appeared to be in charge in the first half, leading by 17-7 with about two minutes left. Rodgers's first-quarter touchdown run, a 34-yard field goal and Montgomery's 1-yard run had produced the 10-point lead. The Buckeyes, who scored on Frey's 1-yard run 2 seconds into the second quarter, had the ball on their 24 with 43 seconds left before intermission.   After moving the ball to the Iowa 48, Frey threw a pass that appeared to be picked off by Hanks as the clock ran down. But the ball bounced out of Hanks's arms and into the hands of Graham, who dashed into the end zone to pull the Buckeyes within 17-14 at the half. Michigan 22, Illinois 17     ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- J. D. Carlson tied a school record with five field goals for Michigan in the Big Ten game.   The Wolverines (5-3, 4-2), who led by 19-3 after three quarters, got an important interception by Vada Murray at their 2 with six minutes remaining. Michigan then ran out the clock, driving to the Illinois 22 before time expired.   It was the second straight loss for the Illini (6-3, 4-2) who have lost five in a row to Michigan and haven't won in Ann Arbor since 1966.   Carlson kicked field goals of 28, 51, 19, 18 and 18 yards. He tied the record set by Mike Gillette in a 22-7 victory over Minnesota on Nov. 5, 1988. Ricky Powers, a freshman who ran for 113 yards on 23 carries, had a 3-yard run for Michigan's only touchdown. Indiana 20, Wisconsin 7     BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Vaughn Dunbar rushed for 161 yards and a touchdown, and Rob Turner caught a 67-yard scoring pass from Chris Dyer as Indiana (5-3-1, 2-3-1) dealt a school-record-tying 11th consecutive conference loss over two seasons to Wisconsin (1-8, 0-6). Michigan St. 28, Minnesota 16     MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Michigan State (5-3-1, 4-2) kept its slim Rose Bowl chances alive, moving one game behind Iowa. But the Spartans, who close the season against Northwestern and Wisconsin, have lost to Iowa. In the Big Ten, Michigan and Illinois are also 4-2 and Ohio State is 4-1-1. Michigan State has already announced that it will appear in the John Hancock Bowl in El Paso, if it doesn't win the Big Ten. Minnesota fell to 5-4, 4-2. Purdue 33, Northwestern 13     EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Eric Hunter ran for two touchdowns and passed for another in leading Purdue out of the Big Ten cellar.   Hunter completed 17 of 28 passes for 185 yards and gained 20 yards on 8 rushes before leaving the game late in the third quarter with a bruised knee.   The Boilermakers (2-7, 1-5) scored 21 points in the third quarter and clinched it in the fourth period when Jarrett Scales returned a blocked punt 18 yards for a touchdown. Northwestern dropped to 2-7 and 1-5 in the conference. Wisconsin fell to 1-7, 0-6. Nebraska 41, Kansas 9    LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Johnny Mitchell caught two touchdown passes and Scott Baldwin rushed for 170 yards and two touchdowns, leading Nebraska to its 22d straight victory over Kansas.   Nebraska (9-1, 5-1) trailed by 3-0 in the first quarter and was having trouble moving against Kansas (3-6-1, 2-3-1). But a bad kickoff after Dan Eichloff's 36-yard field goal gave Nebraska the ball on the Kansas 41. Then on fourth and 4, Mickey Joseph found Mitchell all by himself down the middle and hit the backup tight end with a 35-yard scoring pass. Central Michigan 52, Ohio University 7     ATHENS, Ohio (AP) -- Jeff Bender ran for one touchdown and passed for another in a 31-point second-quarter explosion as Central Michigan clinched a share of the Mid-American Conference title and a berth in the California Raisin Bowl.   Central Michigan completed its regular season with marks of 8-2-1 overall and 7-1 in the M.A.C., tied for the championship with Toledo. By virtue of a 13-12 victory over the Rockets, the Chippewas grabbed the bowl bid Dec. 8 in Fresno. Ohio University fell to 1-8-1 and 0-6-1.

Cyrus the Great established the Persian empire by uniting Persia and conquered Babylonia. Alexander the Great conquered Persia in 333 B.C., but the Persians regained their independence after his death. The Persian Sassanian empire, established in A.D. 226, was the principal eastern rival of the Roman Empire. In 641 the Sassanians were defeated by invading Arabs, and Islam replaced the indigenous Zoroastrian religion. Persia reasserted its national identity—though not its political independence—under Islam and became a major center of Shia Muslim culture. In the early 13th century, Persia was conquered by the Mongols, who ruled the country until 1502. The brilliant Safavid dynasty (1499–1736) was followed by two centuries of decline. During the 19th century, Persia lost control over Afghanistan and the Caucasus, while internal affairs came increasingly under British and Russian control. In 1907 an Anglo-Russian agreement formally divided Persia into spheres of influence. Following World War I, Persia was recognized as an independent nation, but was virtually a British protectorate. The Soviet Union renounced all claims to Persia in 1921. In 1921 Reza Khan established a military dictatorship and had himself declared a hereditary monarch, Reza Shah Pahlavi, in 1925. In March 1935, the country's name was formally changed to Iran. In 1941 Great Britain, anxious over access to Iran's rich oil fields, charged Iran with pro-Axis activity, occupied Iran, and forced the abdication of Reza Shah in favor of his son, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. In 1945 Iran became a charter member of the United Nations. Under Mohammed Mossadegh the National Front gained power in 1951. Parliament nationalized the oil industry; Britain responded with an economic blockade. The shah was briefly driven from power, but in August 1953, monarchist elements with clandestine British and American support ousted Mossadegh and restored the shah to the throne. The shah pursued a pro-Western policy of modernization and anticommunism and was rewarded with massive military and economic aid. His combination of secular, authoritarian rule and economic and social modernization was popular with the urban business sector but deeply resented by the rural and urban poor. Unrestrained use of the secret police to suppress dissent led to widespread disaffection. Religiously inspired protests resulted in widespread violence in late 1978. A military government was installed by the shah on Nov. 6, with Prime Minister Shahpur Bakhtiar given sweeping powers. The shah went into exile on Jan. 16, 1979. On Jan. 31 Iran's dominant religious leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, returned to Iran from his exile in France. Government forces were routed by Khomeini's supporters, and Bakhtiar's government fell on Feb. 11. In 1979 clashes took place between rival religious factions, between religious parties and secular leftists, and between the urban middle class and the disenfranchised poor. Thousands were arrested and executed by the religious militia forces. On Nov. 4, 1979, militants seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 62 Americans hostage, provoking a long international crisis. An American military raid in April 1980 failed in an attempt to free the hostages. The hostages were finally freed on Jan. 21, 1981, minutes after Ronald Reagan's inauguration. The following day Iran's president, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, was dismissed and the Ayatollah Khomeini took over executive power. A new wave of executions followed, with political moderates and non-Islamic religious believers among the principal victims. On Sept. 22, 1980, a dispute between Iran and Iraq over the Shatt al-Arab waterway flared into open warfare. The war severely crippled Iran. Estimates on casualties range from 450,000 to over a million dead on both sides, and the war absorbed nearly all Iran's revenue from oil exports, leaving it nearly bankrupt. The U.S. was also drawn into the conflict. In 1986, Reagan administration officials attempted to secure the release of hostages in Lebanon by trading arms to the Iranians; and on July 3, 1988, an American ship patrolling in the Persian Gulf accidently shot down an Iranian civilian airliner, killing all aboard. In Sept. 1988, a U.N. initiative led to a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and to the opening of negotiations to find a permanent settlement to the war. Largely isolated from the world community, Iran's domestic priority was rebuilding the nation's economy. On June 3, 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini died, but the dire predictions that his death would cause turmoil within the Iranian political hierarchy proved wrong. Ali-Akbar Rafsanjani assumed the presidency. In elections held Apr. 10, 1992, supporters of Rafsanjani's moderate policies wrested a parliamentary majority from the radical fundamentalist Islamic factions that had controlled the Iranian Parliament for 13 years. But “moderation” proved elusive, as Rafsanjani's party was subjected to pressure from religious extremists. Although Iran had condemned the presence of Western troops in the Middle East during the Persian Gulf conflict, it abided by U.N. sanctions against Iraq and grounded Iraqi planes that sought refuge from Allied bombing raids. In 1995 the U.S. accused Iran of beginning a strategic military buildup and forbade all trade with Iran. Iran has remained mired in economic and political stagnation with evidence of popular discontent for several years. In the 1997 elections the religious authorities gave the voters a genuine choice of presidential candidates and they shockingly chose (in a landslide) a moderate reformist, Mohammed Khatami. Since May 1997 Khatami has carefully maneuvered for moderate reforms in the face of Islamic clerical opposition, opening non-governmental dialogue with the American “great Satan”, quietly replacing provincial governors with reformers, reining in secret police agents and the like. In Feb. 1999, the religious leaders permitted the first local elections in twenty years: Khatami's new party, formed only in December, swept all 15 seats in the Tehran city council, winning large victories nationwide. In July 1999, a militant Islamic group attacked pro-democracy students in Tehran, killing several. Student demonstrations against the government erupted in many cities across the country and in Tehran the police dispersed the crowd with severe violence after students attacked buildings and burned cars. Pres. Khatami condemned the riots, leaving questions about the future of reform. In Feb. 2000 parliamentary elections, voters gave about two-thirds of the seats in the 290-seat Majlis to reformers. But authorities closed most reform newspapers. In June 2001, Khatami won a landslide victory for re-election but his all his reforms have been rejected by the Council of Guardians and all demonstrations violently suppressed. In the wake of the Sept. 11th attacks on the U.S., Pres. Bush included Iran in the “axis of evil” that threatened civilization. In 2003 the U.S. accused Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons.

That would constitute a military victory for the coalition and a defeat for Iraq.   Second, if Iraq complies, we will avoid an unnecessary and costly ground war. The air campaign has worked. Iraq's army is demoralized. Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf says it is on the verge of collapse. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney says we have eliminated Iraq's nuclear facilitiesand done a lot of damage to its chemical and biological capabilities.    Yet we do not want to destroy Iraq and destabilize the region: We want to contain Iraq and avoid further casualties and civilian deaths. A ground war would inflame passions and deepen rifts in the Arab world. Our interests are best served if we avoid it.   Third, we do not want to make Saddam Hussein a hero or martyr. We move beyond the mandate of the U.N. if we target him. No U.S. official, including the President, has stated that this is a U.S. objective. The U.N., the Congress and the U.S.-Soviet joint communique in January endorsed the U.N. resolutions, not expanded war aims. It is desirable to have a new Iraqi leader, but we should leave the question of Iraqi's future leadership to the Iraqis. A weakened Saddam Hussein will have to answer for his country's devastation; a martyred Saddam Hussein won't.   Fourth, continuing the war beyond the mandate of the U.N. resolutions risks the future unity of the coalition. Diplomacy will be essential to address the region's messy political questions at the war's end. Complicated challenges -- peacekeeping in Kuwait, containing Iraq, controlling arms, creating future security structures -- all require tough negotiations. Chances for success in postwar diplomacy are enhanced if we keep the coalition intact.   Fifth, it is in our interest to preserve U.S.-Soviet cooperation. It is remarkable how little U.S.-Soviet relations have been strained to date by the five week campaign against Iraq. Those relations are now going through a difficult period and our approaches in the Middle East may be diverging.    The Soviets fear a widening conflict close to their borders and repercussions among their 50 million Muslims. We can maintain Middle East cooperation with the Soviets if we stick to U.N. objectives. If we go beyond them, we risk losing it.    We have a unique opportunity to help shape and define the gulf region in the postwar period. We will have a better chance to do that if we end the war, not as a conqueror laying waste to Iraq but as a coalition member working to turn back aggression, put aside vengeance and build a stable and more peaceful Middle East.

Can a clergyman be far away? In Thaddeus O'Sullivan's 1990 film \\"December Bride,\\" the local minister is indeed troubled by this domestic arrangement, as is practically everyone who lives nearby. The time is turn of the century, and it is the minister's job to point out that this living arrangement violates the rules of the community. Sarah (Saskia Reeves), the quiet but shockingly bold heroine of the title, simply ignores him. She thinks some rules are made to be broken.   Repression and rebellion are constantly at war throughout the films in a new, landmark series exploring the full range of Irish cinema. In the Name of the Nation: Celebrating Irish Film Making 1910-1994, which begins today and will run through July 7 at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center, explores an astonishing variety of similar tensions. These dramas are often played out against rugged, lonely landscapes of extraordinary natural beauty, and acted by a small circle of fine Irish actors whose work has been seen elsewhere, but not to such obvious advantage. The great appeal of this series rests on both academic interest and entertainment value.

She is also about as unlike a diva as a pop singer could be. And last Monday evening at the Bottom Line, where she performed with two guitarists and a bass player, she projected the naturalness of someone who had just dropped into her local pub with a few friends to knock off some favorite tunes.    Miss O'Connell, who comes from a working-class family in County Clare, brings a clear-eyed realism to everything she sings. But if her Irish folk roots are evident, there is nothing provincial about her style. Her taste in material runs from the best progressive country songs to folk-rock numbers by Paul Brady, the Irish singer, songwriter and cult hero whose songs have also been recorded by Bonnie Raitt.

Smith and Mrs. Smith, Mrs. James J. Walker, opera singers and jurists, in the Forty-fourth Street Theatre. The unusual audience that had come to witness this motion picture enthused first over the sound news reel subjects and finally over the excellent reproduction of Mr. McCormack's appealing voice.Never has an audible film been recorded as flawlessly as this feature. The tone is subdued throughout, and when Mr. McCormack, as Sean O'Callahan, sings, a reason is offered for the melody. The story is charming and sensitive. It has been singularly ably directed by Frank Borzage, producer of \\"Street Angel,\\" \\"Seventh Heaven\\" and other worthy screen offerings. Every scene is pictured in good taste and photographed with truly artistic lighting and shadows.The comedy is gentle and natural, really Irish. It evoked its reward of laughter from the spectators. Considering that the hero of this adventure is no longer in his youth, it is a narrative suitable and adroitly handled. Aside from the distinctly pleasing and inspiring melody, it holds the interest, and all the players do their share to make it a huge success. It is something from which a reporter bounds with glee to write about, for it is wholesome and human, with several nicely imaginative scenes.Sad as it is, Mr. McCormack's rendering of that beautiful song \\"Little Boy Blue\\" is something to be remembered for many a day, and also the manner in which it is pictured. Sean is singing then in a New York concert hall, and as he renders the melody there comes to the screen a glimpse of a little boy playing with a woolly toy dog and his soldiers. The child kisses the dog and each soldier good-night and then comes the day when this little soul passes away, which Mr. Borzage shows in a brief, sympathetic scene. Then one perceives the woolly toy dog and the soldiers covered with cobwebs.The perspective of sound has been accomplished better here than in any other production, for when Mr. McCormack sings in an empty church the voice is fainter as a scene is shown a few yards away from the open door of the edifice.It may be a simple story, but there is so much to the picture that one is apt to forget some of its entrancing scenery. Most of the exterior views were taken in Erin, several of them near Mr. McCormack's home and the River Barrow. A constant flow of winding roads, gnarled trees and mirror-like lakes appears on the canvas.Some of the participants in this picture were discovered in Ireland. Among them are Maureen O'Sullivan, who plays the romantic girl Eileen, and Tommy Clifford, a youngster, who won the hearts of the audience last night in the rôle of Tod, Eileen's manly little brother, who is rather like an Irish Tom Sawyer.In the opening scenes, Sean is a singer who has been disappointed in love. Mary, played by Alice Joyce, returns with her two children, Eileen and Tod, to the hamlet in Ireland, her husband having deserted her. Sean is still devoted to Mary.To lend a touch of levity to the film there is Farrell Macdonald, who figures as Rafferty, a man who dreads elderly females and particularly widows. He is usually spatting with Peter, a driver of a jaunty-car, whose weakness is that he imagines that he can sing. His criticism of Sean's vocal efforts is that Sean does not get the necessary \\"nyar,\\" a twist of the tongue, in his vocal efforts. These two blithe Paddys are never at a loss for swift repartee and even when Rafferty is on a sick-bed, Peter reminds him of another man who died just when he thought he was getting well. On that occasion, as he is leaving, Peter halts at the door of the chamber and when asked by the ailing Rafferty what he is doing, Peter replies that he was just wondering whether they could get a coffin by the door!In the Irish sequence, Mr. McCormack sings, \\"Then You'll Remember Me,\\" and, to a group of children, he renders \\"A Fairy Story by the Fireside,\\" which is wonderfully appealing and charmingly pictured. After that Mr. McCormack's songs are \\"Just for a Day,\\" \\"I Feel You Near Me,\\" \\"Kitty, My Love\\" and that lovely ballad, \\"The Rose of Tralee.\\"In the New York episodes, at the concert, where Sean is greeted with overwhelming applause, he sings \\"Loughi Sereni E Cari,\\" \\"Little Boy Blue,\\" \\"Ireland, Mother Ireland\\" and \\"I Hear You Calling Me.\\" Then when he returns to Ireland he lifts his voice to the lilt of \\"A Pair of Blue Eyes.\\" All these songs issue from the screen with stirring effect, so great that, although one becomes interested in the incidents of the narrative, one always looks forward to Mr. McCormack's (or Sean's) next song.J. J. McCarthy, that renowned manager of pictorial productions, who was responsible for the excellent presentation of \\"The Big Parade,\\" deserves great praise for the highly successful mounting of this current contribution. As supervisor of this picture he went to Ireland and later to Hollywood. He has been with it since the very engaging of Mr. McCormack.

The fact that this striking production opened in Dublin rather than at Stratford or in London says something about the convocation of talent that is energizing the Irish theater.
