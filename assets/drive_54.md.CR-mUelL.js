Nassikas has said on other occasions that gas prices will depend on many elements, such as availability of other fuels, that cannot be foreseen with certainty; in other energy development, US Treas says 3-degree reduction in thermostat settings in winter could reduce consumption of heating oil and home-heating bills by about 12%; Deputy Sec Simon says that for homes heated by natural gas, saving would be 14%; releases analysis by J Lerner which calculates aggregate econs at $609-million for oil and $927-million for gas; says other ways to economize are to lower thermostat settings at night and when home is unoccupied, insulate ceilings to thickness of 6 inches and walls to 4 inches, properly maintain heating systems and use humidifiers;
