TOURIST INFORMATION (800) NATURAL. www.arkansas.com . First inhabited by bluff dwellers 10,000 years ago, the Boston and Ouachita mountains of western Arkansas are the only mountains between the Appalachians and the Rockies. By the time of the Hernando De Soto expedition of 1541, Arkansas was inhabited by a variety of peoples: the agrarian Quapaws to the south, the Caddo to the west and south, the Osage to the north, and the Chickasaw and Choctaw in the northeast. The Arkansas Post, the first permanent settlement in the Mississippi Valley, became the pillar of the French claim to the region that became the Louisiana Purchase. Not fully part of the deep south, and cut off geographically from the Midwest, Arkansas has developed slowly. Although cotton was a mainstay of the economy and Arkansas joined the Confederacy during the Civil War, it was the first southern state to have integrated public colleges after World War II, a fact overshadowed by Gov. Orville Faubus's resistance to the integration of the Little Rock public schools. In recent years, Arkansas has attracted manufacturing and industry, but has one of the highest rural populations and ranks low in services, income, and education attainment.

South Carolina's early economy was based on rice—its plantations worked by slaves—though tobacco later played a major role. As was true in North Carolina, many settlers made their way into the back country where they eked out a living as tenant farmers. During the Revolution, Ft. Charlotte was the first British installation to fall to Colonial troops, and at the outbreak of the Civil War, Ft. Sumter was the first Union installation to fall to Confederate forces. While agriculture remained a staple of the state's economy through the close of the 19th century, textile manufacture took over in the early 20th century. The postwar era has seen the rapid expansion of the chemical and paper industries, as well as large-scale development of the Atlantic Coast ports of Charleston, Georgetown, and Port Royal.

The United States did not organize the Dakota Territory until 1861, and even then interest in the region was scant until gold was discovered in 1874. The majority of those who remained after the gold rush turned to cattle ranching, which was a mainstay of the economy through the first half of the 20th century. The manufacturing base was developed after four major dams were built on the Missouri River in the 1930's. They provided hydroelectric power and increased irrigation along the Missouri, which cuts the state in half. Concerned especially over the abrogation of 19th-century treaties, the American Indian Movement (AIM) took over the courthouse at Wounded Knee for 10 weeks in 1973.

The first settlements in Ohio were Marietta, in 1788, and Cincinnati in 1789, on the Ohio River, but significant migration into the state didn't occur until after the War of 1812. Shipping flourished in the 1820's and 1830's thanks to a network of canals connecting the Ohio and Lake Erie. Since 1959 the St. Lawrence Seaway has helped keep Ohio among the top five exporting states. Heavy industry also flourished in the northern cities that had access to coal and iron ore from the Lake Superior region. The 1870's saw the development of a manufacturing base that later became an integral part of the automotive industry. Although Ohio's economy has traditionally been well balanced between agriculture, industry, mining, and trade, the recession of the early 1980's weakened manufacturing, triggered flight from the industrial cities, and saw a dramatic shift to a service economy and to high-tech industry.

TOURIST INFORMATION (800) CT-BOUND. www.state.ct.us . Called the “arsenal of the nation” during the Revolution, Connecticut remained in modern times the leader among the 50 states in defense-contract dollars per capita. In recent years, this has caused a serious dislocation in the economy as the nation downsizes its military capabilities. Still, as home to over a dozen Fortune 500 companies (including several major insurance companies), and with easy access to New York City, Connecticut remains the state with the highest per capita income in the country. Severe budget deficits in 1991 forced passage of a state income tax and helped to reveal the disparities in wealth between the very rich suburbs and the decaying industrial cities such as Bridgeport. As the economy is being retooled, population has actually declined slightly. From Mahican word meaning “beside the long tidal river.” Nicknames Constitution State, Nutmeg State. Capital Hartford.

New Hampshire has a disproportionate influence on presidential elections because by state law its primary must fall at least one week before any other state's (though Iowa's caucuses can come earlier). Through independence the mainstays of the economy were fishing, trade, and farming. Boston proved more suitable for trade, and New Hampshire's stubborn land was outproduced by the more fertile valleys to the south and west. The state's economy receded until the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when there was tremendous growth in textile-producing mill towns in the Merrimack River Valley. The mills began to close after World War I, and the economy faltered again. Improvement came as high-tech firms from Boston sought refuge in New Hampshire's favorable tax climate. The state's economy was pummeled by the severe New England recession in the early 1990's, but has rebounded since. For English county of Hampshire. Nickname Granite State. Capital Concord.

With the entire state population classified as living in metro areas, New Jersey is the most densely populated state, 15 times the national average. The image survives of New Jersey as a chemical-industrial wasteland south of New York Harbor. Pharmaceuticals and chemicals are in fact New Jersey's leading products, but the next most important industry is tourism, because of the money tourists spend at the gaming tables of Atlantic City. What earns New Jersey its nick-name, the Garden State, is its extensive small-scale agriculture, which produces tomatoes, dairy products, asparagus, blueberries, corn, and poultry. New Jersey lies on a plain between Philadelphia and New York City, two larger neighbors that have overshadowed New Jersey on the national scene since colonial days.

Tourism is Hawaii's key industry, attracting more than 6.5 million visitors to the state each year. Recent economic problems in Japan have had a negative effect on Hawaii's tourism numbers, and the state economy has suffered greatly as a result. Thousands of miles from both California and mainland Asia, Hawaii was originally peopled by Polynesian seafarers around A.D. 500 and has the richest ethnic mix of any state, with the lowest percentage of whites and highest percentages of Asians. It was partly fear of this diversity that stalled its statehood.

New York's greatest and most inviting asset has always been its strategic location and long arteries into the hinterland. New York Bay is one of the great natural harbors of the world, and the broad Hudson River is one of the most fortunately placed. After the opening of the Erie Canal between the Hudson and Lake Erie in 1825, New York City became the trading center for the Midwest as well as the Hudson Valley and the Atlantic Coast. Buffalo also experienced a boom, becoming a major Great Lakes industrial port. New York is still the first state in number of manufacturing establishments and employees. Wall Street alone employs half a million people. Although New York's population grew by nearly half a million people between 1980 and 1990, its relatively slow rate of growth resulted in a loss of three congressional seats—an indication of the change in the state's political clout.

Culinary historians trace the term to the Dutch \\"sla\\" for salad. Coleslaw is so named because the Dutch word for cabbage is \\"kool.\\"   Indeed, coleslaw is the mother of all slaws. But the produce stands are filled with other inspirations for one of the most versatile and inviting salads.   The main ingredient must have an inherent crispness so it can sop up a dressing without losing its character. Asian Cabbage Slaw Total time: 20 minutes  6 cups shredded Chinese cabbage (about 1 medium-size head)  1/4 cup finely minced scallions  1 tablespoon finely slivered fresh ginger  2 tablespoons sesame seeds  1/3 cup rice vinegar  1 tablespoon light soy sauce  1/3 cup Oriental sesame oil  1 tablespoon finely minced fresh coriander leaves  Hot red pepper flakes to taste.    1. Put the cabbage in a large bowl.  Toss with the scallions and ginger.    2. Put the sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium-high heat and toast until golden, about three minutes. Remove from heat","excerpt":"set aside.   3. Mix the vinegar, soy sauce and sesame oil together. Pour the dressing over the cabbage and toss gently. Add the coriander leaves and red pepper flakes and toss again.    4. Transfer to a serving bowl and sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds. The salad is ready to serve, but it can wait, at room temperature, an hour or two before serving.   Yield: 6 servings. Moroccan Carrot Slaw Total time: 10 minutes plus 30 minutes marinating  1/2 teaspoon whole cumin seeds  1/4 cup fresh lemon juice  1/2 teaspoon ground cumin  1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil  1 pound peeled baby carrots (sold in bags), or 1 pound large carrots, peeled  Salt and fresh black pepper  1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh coriander leaves.   1. Toast the cumin seeds by putting them in a hot skillet over medium-high heat for about 30 seconds until they become fragrant. Remove from heat and put in a two-quart bowl.   2. Add the lemon juice, ground cumin and oil. Mix well.   3. Grate the carrots by putting them in the feed tube of a food processor and processing them through a shredding disk. (The reason for using baby carrots is one of convenience -- they come already peeled.)   Alternatively, regular large carrots, peeled, can be used. Without a food processor, it's better to use large carrots and grate them by hand on a box grater. Add the grated carrots to the bowl and toss to coat well with the dressing.   4. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Fold in coriander and marinate about 30 minutes at room temperature before serving. The salad can hold longer, but the coriander will turn dull green, so wait until the last minute before adding.   Yield: 4 to 6 servings. Warm Fennel Slaw With Bacon Total time: 30 minutes  2 large fennel bulbs  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  4 ounces country-style slab bacon, diced  3 tablespoons white wine vinegar  1 tablespoon Dijon mustard  Freshly ground black pepper  1 tablespoon minced fresh chives.    1. Trim the stems and leaves from the fennel bulbs. Chop and reserve two tablespoons of the leaves. Discard the stems. Quarter and shred the fennel bulbs by hand or on the fine slicing disk of a food processor. Put the fennel in a bowl.   2. Heat one tablespoon of the oil in a heavy skillet, add the bacon and saute over medium heat until the bacon is golden. Pour the contents of the skillet through a strainer into a heatproof bowl. Spread the pieces of bacon on absorbent paper.   3. Add the vinegar to the skillet and heat briefly, then stir in the mustard. Return the reserved bacon fat to the pan and add the remaining olive oil. Season to taste with pepper.   4. Pour the dressing over the fennel, add the chopped leaves and the chives and serve at once. For convenience, the dressing and fennel can be prepared in advance. Wait until just before serving to reheat the dressing, then toss it with the fennel.   Yield: 4 servings.
