Its cuts and additions -- a billion here, a few hundred million there -- are dwarfed by the total spending proposal of $1.5 trillion. But the tinkering does follow themes, and some areas will fare better, or worse, than others. Here are some examples. Dollar figures show what the Administration seeks from Congress for each program, not what may be spent in the 1995 fiscal year. WINNERS Technology Just about any program whose title boasts the words \\"computer\\" or \\"research\\" gains money. Some big winners: the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, once known only for winding the national clock but now a grantor for private research","excerpt":"information \\"superhighway\\" research. Still, the total Federal research and development budget, up 4 per cent to $72 billion for 1995, only slightly beats inflation.

Chapter I programs       for low-income schools   $6,912   $7,579   10%       Safe and Drug-free schools   472   660   40%       \\"Dislocated\\" workers   1,118   1,465   31%       Health Mr. Clinton's health plan aside, the budget envisions large spending increases for a select series of preventive care and drug-rehabilitation programs. Spending in the 1995 fiscal year for the National Institutes of Health's many units -- the National Cancer Institute, National Institute for Mental Health, and so on -- would rise a little over 7 per cent, to $11 billion.

But with crime atop the list of public concerns in polls, the new budget mirrors political reality, and seeks big increases for more police and for prosecuting and jailing wrongdoers. A caveat: much funding relies on passage of the crime bill now before Congress.

Public Works One area where the Clinton Administration differs from its Republican predecessors is in its support for construction projects. Democrats believe economic growth flows directly from investments in highways and mass transportation. But even here, the Administration is selective: for example, grants for operating expenses of mass transit systems (13 percent of which is spent in metropolitan New York) would be cut to $600 million from $800 million.

LOSERS Foreign Affairs The State Department would take it on the nose, losing a bigger share of its budget than any other Cabinet agency. Total foreign affairs funding, which includes items like Pentagon military aid and export loans, stays stable but loses ground to inflation. Aid to Israel ($3 billion) and Egypt ($1.8 billion) would not change. A growth area: aid to the United Nations for troops in foreign war zones, up 33 per cent.

Energy Department stockpiles of nuclear materials would be drawn down. One weapon prospers: the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice, beloved by the National Rifle Association and despised by liberals, rises $61,000 to $2.54 million. It sells ammunition and trains youngsters to shoot.

In trouble: foreign food aid, oilseed subsidies, the Rural Electrification Administration, the Commodity Credit Corporation (which makes loans for farm exports) and a raft of others.

But traditional public-housing monies dry up: new construction funding plummets, as does money for renovating old units.

Peter Stampfel, a singer and fiddler with a cracked Appalachian-style voice and a well-developed sense of the ridiculous, calls his band the Bottle Caps, and on its new album the group also combines hillbilly with reggae, sets a fragment of ''America the Beautiful'' atop a rock-and-roll riff from ''Wooly Bully,'' and interrupts an old-timey hoedown for a screaming jazz-saxophone break.   Why name the band the Bottle Caps? Over the years, Mr. Stampfel has assembled an immense collection of rare soda and beer bottle caps. Some of them - ''Inca Kola,'' ''Hava Swig,'' ''Joe Louis Punch,'' even the legendary ''Moxie'' - are seen on the back cover of ''Peter Stampfel and the Bottle Caps,'' a new release in the Rounder label's New American Music Series and the group's first album.   Even the recombinant genre-splicing of the album pales next to the freewheeling eclecticism and zany good humor of a live Bottle Caps performance.

The fog of euphoria that has settled over the country has obscured the information available at the time of the Congressional vote.   We were led to believe that Saddam Hussein was a formidable opponent and that responding to him offensively would result in massive United States casualties. This view was shared by the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, former Secretaries of State, Defense and the Navy, as well as a large segment of the population. Everyone felt that sanctions (if they worked) would take longer than military force. The debate in Congress was about incurring large numbers of casualties to liberate Kuwait sooner rather than later. Fortunately, the Iraqi military made that question moot. However, those members of Congress who voted to put the safety of United States servicemen and women before the welfare of the Emir of Kuwait should not be faulted for the concern they showed. They have nothing to be ashamed of.   As this new fog dissipates I hope we take a long, hard look at how we gathered the information that left us surprised when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and then astounded when his military collapsed.

Thomas B. Stanley of Virginia and some 200 members of the State Legislature and their wives. They were the guests of Winthrop Rockefeller, chairman of the board of trustees of Colonial Williamsburg. Mr. Rockefeller said the new facilities and the film were meant to provide \\"a bridge of Understanding over which Americans can walk from the twentieth century into the past.\\"This aim is clearly evident in the content of the picture and the architectural design of the building, which includes new exhibits shoving the culture of early Williamsburg.The most striking aspect of the theatres, which seat 250 persons each in eight tiers of chairs that extend in straight parallel, rows Across their widths, is the illusion of space inside them and the sense imparted of complete removal from the outside world.As one enters the semi-darkened interior, an illusory purple light, suffusing the whole forward area, attracts and bemuses the eye. The tiers of chairs, indirectly lighted from beneath, are separated by wide spaces and lacquered steel barriers (or row dividers) that mask the heads of viewers in the forward tiers. The illusion created is that of being under the dome of the sky at night.This effect is enhanced as the performance of the film is introduced with a lowering of the under-chair lighting, fading out of the music that plays during intermission and a fading in of the sound of chirping birds. Then the film commences indirectly with a forward traveling shot into a scene of a plantation yard in Colonial Virginia. Thus is achieved the first step upon the \\"bridge of understanding . . . into the past\\" of which Mr. Rockefeller spoke.The film itself is a dramatization of the preparation of the mind of a Virginia gentleman and a member of the House of Burgesses in Williamsburg for the decision of rebellion against the tyranny of England that took place in the six years before the American Revolution. The central character is a composite figure, but he is surrounded in the film by familiar historical characters, including George Washington, Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson.In tracing the reluctance of this gentleman to subscribe to the vigorous suggestions of Patrick Henry, at first, and then his slow acceptance of the necessity for the union and resistance of the Colonies, the film is intended to give an understanding of the social atmosphere and the political ferment in Williamsburg. The whole thing was shot in this area, and includes numerous scenes of the interiors of familiar buildings.It was produced for the Williamsburg Foundation by Paramount Pictures, with George Seaton, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, directing from a script prepared by Emmet Daver. The principal roles are played by generally unfamiliar actors. It is photographed in color and Vista-Vision, with stereophonic sound complementing the illusory effect of spaciousness achieved from the screen.The latter, designed by Ben Schlanger, who worked in cooperation with the architects, Harrison & Abramowitz of New York, has no familiar marginal definition. It extends from ceiling to floor, and is provided also with sides that curve in a radical arrangement, so that the large image appears unconfined.The new information center is part of a 188-unit motor court and recreation center operated by Colonial Williamsburg.

Broadway    ''AIDA.'' Pretty much everything that's right about this Disney cartoon pretending to be a Broadway musical can be summed up in two words: Heather Headley. Playing a Nubian princess in captivity, Ms. Headley has fire, self-possession and an uncompromising sense of purpose. That is more than can be said for anyone or anything around her. ''Aida,'' which has been directed by Robert Falls with songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, seems stranded in its own candy-colored limbo, thrashing between childish silliness and civic preachiness, between campy spoof and tragic tear-jerker, between two and three dimensions. Although it is the first Disney production for Broadway not to be inspired by an animated film, it nonetheless appears to be waiting for the greater destiny of translation into a cartoon. With Adam Pascal (of ''Rent'') as the hieroglyph-stiff love interest and Sherie Rene Scott, making like a refugee from ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' as Aida's rival.

No glue is required (the tiles have a cork back for traction) and the seams are pretty much undetectable. The tiles come up easily if you want to replace or rearrange them.

Salsa is a music ruled by its formulas, by the overwhelming power of record companies and their marketing ideas. That isn't always bad: it makes musicians write melodies and work on songs. The commercial pressure has also produced a whole tradition of descarga records, jam-session recordings that allow the musicians to stretch out, usually showing their love for jazz. This is an ambitious two-CD set, does exactly that, letting the musicians have some say. The opening track, nearly 16 minutes long, is the sort of heated, improvised performance that's heard regularly in clubs but rarely on records. The rest of the album features all sorts of music, from pop salsa tracks to a chant for the santeria saint Elegba, from a long homage to the great Cuban bassist and composer Cachao to a few instrumental pieces. P. W. Sounds Around Town"},{"year":"2005","title":"The Whitney Museum of American Art continues to journey down avant-garde memory lane, with a retrospective devoted to Morgan Fisher. Like the films of Owen Land (a k a George Landow), the subject of a recent museum retrospective, Mr. Fisher's work falls under the rubric of structural film in that it calls attention to its own materiality as well as to the conditions of its production and reception. One significant difference is that like many filmmakers who work in the shadow of Hollywood, the Santa Monica-based Mr. Fisher has long explored the space that segregates art cinema from industrial moviemaking. A film like the one-minute-30 second-long ''Wilkinson Household Fire Alarm'' (1973), an eye-blink homage to Marcel Duchamp, is more obviously engaged with conceptualism than with studio manufacturing. Yet many more of Mr. Fisher's films explore the divide between art and industry directly, including his autobiographically inflected 1984 short ''Standard Gauge,'' above, in which he traces the history and uses of 35-millimeter film through discarded bits of celluloid and a voice-over that waxes both pedantic and poetic. This dialectical engagement continues in the 2003 short ''( ),'' in which the filmmaker shows his editing skills to bravura effect by stringing together insert shots -- those discrete images of, say, a newspaper headline or a pointed gun that fix your attention on narrative details and actions -- that he has lifted from other movies. Although Mr. Fisher includes clocks and dice in his entrancing cavalcade -- which ebbs and flows like a series of unfinished stories -- what seizes the imagination are all the hands clutching weapons and knees, flying across typewriter keys and cooking and serving. Here, from the detritus of the movie industry, Mr. Fisher has created singularly, authentically handmade art.

This weekend in particular, the scene is alive with promising entertainments. The emphasis is very much on spectacle, but in typical, experimental fashion, the spectacle can be an extravagant musical drawn from the Biblical plagues, Shakespeare transplanted to ancient China or a trio of inspired tomfools.

Two prolific theaters are showcasing a range of work by favorite sons and daughters. In the vast expanse of La Mama Annex is a musical called ''The Plagues,'' written by Eve Merriam and Tom O'Horgan, and directed by Mr. O'Horgan. In residence on other La Mama stages are Paul Zimet's Talking Band, doing an ensemble play with music titled ''Hot Lunch Apostles,'' and Harris Yulin, a Broadway star, playing the title buncombe artist in Richard Ploetz's ''Barnum's Last Life.''

Now, for the Showtime realization, the director Marshall W. Mason, perhaps best known as the founder and artistic director of Manhattan's Circle Repertory Company, has pieced together yet another script, one that draws on passages from all of these previous outings of ''Picnic'' as well as a few ingredients of Mr. Mason's own.

Painted in expressionist swirls and strata, in colors that shift from cerulean blues to somber grays, it is as changeable as life itself, promising serenity and portending storms. We may be in the land of fantasy, but it is a fantasy deeply rooted in a very real, universally felt sense of cosmic flux.   The great strength of Adrian Noble's staging of this late Shakespearean romance is its ability to fold its seemingly disparate elements into a gloriously symmetrical whole. It slights neither the disturbing darkness of the play's first acts nor the sunny ebullience of the pastoral scenes, but it leavens each with comic and potentially tragic elements that inextricably link the two parts.

RELIGIOUS PROBLEMS'","excerpt":"Ingmar Bergman Faces Same In His Films BERGMAN AND RELIGION"},{"year":"1959","title":"DON'T knock the spell of illusion. That's what Sweden's Ingmar Bergman says in the latest of his highly esoteric and techically exquisite films, \\"The Magician\\" (\\"Ansiktet\\"). It opened at the Fifth Avenue Cinema yesterday.More than in either of his pictures exhibited hereabouts recently (\\"The Seventh Seal\\" and \\"Wild Strawberries\\"), Mr. Bergman is offering in this a mystical contemplation that could well have wide popular appeal. For he is dealing with magic, spiritual manifestation, spells and \\"animal magnetism,\\" which are more exciting when they're not fully understood.And it's a safe bet that very few viewers are going to understand everything that Mr. Bergman here levitates and puts forth in his bewitchingly imagistic style. That drunken and dying actor who is found in a haunted woods by a vagrant troupe of medicine-show performers—what does he symbolize What is the esoteric meaning of his seeming to die and then come back to life? And who is that weird old woman who tags along with the troupe?These are a few of the mysteries that rise from the shadows and the glooms of this eerie and Rabelaisian study of the susceptibility of the human mind to the powerful sway of illusion and of the ephemeral nature of Truth.But never mind about those details that may be vaporous and vague. The important thing is that this picture is full of extraordinary thrills that flow and collide on several levels of emotion and intellect. And it swarms with sufficient melodrama of the blood-chilling, flesh-creeping sort to tingle the hide of the least brainy addict of out-right monster films.Is it something supremely contemplative of the marginal regions between reality and unreality that you would care to cogitate? Then watch the subtle inquisition of the pitifully tawdry little troupe when, in its travels through the country in the mid-nineteenth century, it is strangely incarcerated in a quizzical merchant's home. Is it eroticism you are after? Then study what occurs to the neurotic wife of the merchant when she watches the hypnotist. Or are you for Rabelaisian humor? Then get those servant girls when they drink the fake love-potions and start going after the lads.As for the sheer melodrama, you'll look far to find a creepier scene than the one in which the skeptical surgeon is hounded by the \\"body\\" on which he has just performed an autopsy! The practical uses of suggestion are beautifully indicated here.As in all his pictures, Mr. Bergman (who does everything) has achieved remarkable magic with his camera and with his cast. Max von Sydow as the magician is a haunting figure who floats between the realms of an agonized mystic and a vulgar charlatan. And he recalls the late Lon Cháney in his sad unmasking scene and in the one he plays with the surgeon, brilliantly performed by Gunnar Bjornstrand.Ingrid Thulin as the wife of the magician, Erland Josephson as the merchant-dilletante, Ake Fridell as the medicine-show barker and Bibi Andersson as one of the servant girls stand out in a cast that is superior in absolutely every role.Brilliant use of the sound-track—lengthy silences broken by weird guitar phrases, thumps and strikings of clocks—is a notable feaure. It is just too bad one has to read so many English subtitles to follow the Swedish dialogue.

I was too much of a coward to break up face to face with these girls on whose blouses dangled the little gold doodad that was my fraternity pin.

There is the occasional exception - for instance, the gory portrait of Idi Amin currently being shown in movie theaters. But the average product, especially on television, runs to carefully calculated inspirational drama, from ''The Missiles of October,'' with its hero-worship portraits of John and Robert Kennedy, to ''Ike,'' with its macho depiction of a tough Dwight D. Eisenhower, played by Robert Duvall, of all people.\\n\\nNow, for the next two Monday evenings on WPIX-TV/Channel 11, from 8 to 10, there is ''A Woman Called Golda,'' with Ingrid Bergman giving one of the finest performances of her career as the extraordinary Golda Meir, the former Prime Minister of Israel who, at the age of 80, died in Jesusalem in 1978. Not surprisingly, this is an admiring, not to mention loving, depiction of a woman who became an unusual figure on the world stage. She was a grandmother who chain-smoked cigarettes. She was a crafty politician who charmed with her bluntness. She was a shrewd warrior cleverly projecting the public image of a delightful little old lady. A famous exchange is included in the film: Ben-Gurion (David de Keyser), then Israel's Prime Minister, proudly told Mrs. Meir that he often told people that ''Golda is the best man in my cabinet.'' She quickly replied: ''Excuse me, B-G, if I'm not wild about the compliment.''

Then in struts Mr. Spencer, as a motorcyclist. There is some perverse humor as the twittering clothiers flutter around the new customer. But for the remainder of the film, which uncoils for two hours, the hero babbles incessantly and obscenely about his sexual prowess, capacity and versatility.
