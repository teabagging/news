Despite all the energy displayed by its hedonistic principals, they merely indicate fun, games and bittersweet involvement that in the end hardly ever involves a spectator.Echoes of \\"The Knack,\\" \\"Morgan!\\" and the like come to mind as Ginger, the obviously red-haired, window cleaner-hero, who is more devoted to scoring with practically every lass in South London than polishing panes, snares his first \\"bird,\\" a nurse. Ginger also has the magnanimous penchant of sharing his conquests with his neighbor, Dwyer, and that leads to complications when Ginger runs into Jill, who is not just another conquest.Ginger, you see, has fallen in love. Jill is not a pushover and is to be treated with respect. At a weird party Dwyer unwittingly \\"shares\\" Jill, and Ginger, still lovesmitten, decides to do the decent thing by Jill. But as a new, token \\"father,\\" Ginger, already soured on true romance, is cynically eying another girl all neat in black stockings at the fadeout.Within this basically simple framework, a variety of incidents meant to enlarge on this meager theme, keeps Ginger and company hopping but only superficially conveying their humor, cynicism or character.

But while uniqueness was its glory when it burst forth from that proverbial garage, its separateness now is an increasing liability. As Microsoft and Intel barrel ahead in creating a standard for business computing, Apple is going it alone -- and showing the scars. John Sculley, who just gave up the chief executive's reins, has even pondered a merger with I.B.M. or A.T.& T. Last week, Apple revealed its latest wound, saying it would cut 2,500 workers, or 16 percent of its payroll. And the new chief executive, Michael Spindler, froze the pay of those who remain -- unless they're vice presidents or higher, who got a 5 percent cut. When Apple announces its earnings this week, the job-cut damage could hit $300 million, and mean a quarterly loss. Many eyes now are on the fruits of a joint venture with I.B.M. and Motorola, a line of computers due next year.  [ Page 10. ] New Hope at Northwest Air The airline industry has been on a pendulum in recent years. Saddled with high costs, airlines have swung in and out of bankruptcy, with bankrupt carriers, out for quick cash, igniting repeated fare wars. But last week Northwest just may have taken a step toward breaking that cycle, striking a deal with its pilots that could head off what had seemed a likely bankruptcy. The pact involves big concessions from both sides -- pilots give up $365 million in pay and work-rule changes over three years, but the unions could end up owning 37.5 percent of the company. Now the machinists need to go along, and the Administration is watching keenly -- Transportation Secretary Federico Pena, in fact, called managers and labor leaders to Washington to push things along. Any pact would put pressure on the industry's Big Three -- American, United and Delta -- to cut costs, too. And if the pact holds, of course, the bad news for travelers is that fare-war bonanzas are a bit less likely. Euro and Disney Don't Mix How do you say \\"Magic Kingdom\\" in French? Maybe the answer is that you don't. Euro Disney said last week that it lost $87 million in its latest quarter -- more than expected -- and saw no end in sight to the bad results. Europe's decidedly unmagical economy these days just doesn't seem to fit Euro Disney's script, and the resort even expects a loss for the peak summer season. To top it off, it now appears that completion of the resort's second phase, a movie-based theme park, will be delayed another year, until 1997. You Break It, You Pay for It If you run a company badly, you should pay -- right out of your own pocket. That was New Jersey's message last week as it sued three dozen former executives and directors of Mutual Benefit Life, saying their mismanagement had plunged the insurer into insolvency and that they should be liable for $1 billion in losses. Mutual Benefit was taken over by the state in 1991, after years of heavy investment in real estate and other speculative ventures, and most of its 700,000 policyholders are still waiting to be made whole. There are some big names among those sued: Richard Furlaud, former American Express chairman","excerpt":"Leon Hess, owner of the New York Jets, and Christopher Bond, the Missouri Senator. For Keating, Double the Pain Elderly investors whose savings vanished after they bought American Continental junk bonds would probably like to pull out Charles Keating's fingernails one by one, sloooowly and paaaainfully. But they'll have to be satisfied with this: Last week a Federal judge in Los Angeles, deciding that sentencing guidelines just didn't fit crimes so \\"staggering in proportion,\\" doubled the recommended amount. She sentenced Mr. Keating, 69, who is already serving a state prison term, to 12 years and 7 months in Federal prison for defrauding investors. She also ordered him to pay $122.4 million in restitution to the Government, but it'll be hard getting blood from this particular stone: Mr. Keating insists that he's broke. But lest we forget that no man could wreak such havoc alone, here's the last word: \\"What happened,\\" asked a lawyer for bondholders, to \\"all the public officials who looked the other way?\\" A Farewell to The Post? Has anything been clear at The New York Post lately? An odd parade of would-be owners come and go with dizzying frequency. An editor-for-a-day sets up shop in a diner. Rupert Murdoch saves the day -- then doesn't quite. For now, though, this much is clear: Mr. Murdoch, unable to strike a deal with the unions to cut costs, pulled the plug on Friday. Now, with no new bidder in sight, the paper has no owner but the bankruptcy court, which is unlikely to keep publishing at a weekly loss of $300,000. So, after 192 years, is this an obituary? Again, unclear. \\"It's over,\\" said Mr. Murdoch's spokesman. But a lawyer for the paper's creditors said, \\"Murdoch has not closed the door.\\" So at press time on Friday, the muddle was as thick as ever. THE ECONOMY When in Doubt, Buy a Car The economy still looks shaky, and on the horizon loom higher taxes, not high times. But some things cannot wait. Americans have to have their wheels, and when the old car starts to wheeze -- you know, the one you would have traded in two years ago if it hadn't been for the recession -- it's off to the showroom. So while most economic signposts point downward, car sales keep climbing, with Detroit's Big Three last week reporting a 10 percent rise in June. Imports fared less well, though, as drivers increasingly turn to domestic models, with Chevrolet's Cavalier steadily gaining ground and Honda's Accord, the king of the road a year ago, falling further behind. Today's buyers are determined to root out the best value, and these days they are finding it in Detroit. If It's Hot, This Must Be the Mall Is there anything good about a heat wave? (Or are you too hot to think about it?) Answer: It could just help the economy. Look at it this way: last week an index showed that retail sales rose 5.6 percent, the fourth straight monthly increase, with leading department stores showing the biggest gains. And that was for June. Just think what the July numbers will bring. After people hide in air-conditioned movie theaters until the managers eject them, where do you think they go? Why, the air-conditioned mall, of course. And what do they do in that one-climate-fits-all oasis? They whip out their little plastic cards, and they spend, spend, spend. Those July numbers, if we survive to see them, could go through the roof. The Rich Get Healthier It's no surprise that the rich are healthier than the poor, but a Government study out last week shows that the rich, by comparison, are rapidly getting even healthier. In fact, between 1960 and 1986, the inequality in death rates more than doubled, according to the data, published in The New England Journal of Medicine. It reached the point that those with family income below $9,000 had more than triple the death rate of those above $25,000. And it's not just that affluence buys more health care -- that's always been true. Much of the difference lies in the tendency of more affluent, better-educated people to take better care of themselves, whether through diet, exercise or quitting smoking. Remember Gold? It's Back Gold is hard to define. Is it more like a pork belly, or more like cash in the mattress? It's both, of course, which makes investing in it tricky indeed. Beyond its jewelry value, at politically stormy times people see it as a haven for cash -- on the theory, presumably, that governments come and go, but gold is forever. It fell out of favor in recent years, though, partly because there was just too much gold around after Russia dumped tons of it on the market when the Soviet Union collapsed. But suddenly, because of falling production, there's less supply than the market demands, and gold has rallied and is a hot investment again. Last week, in fact, it neared the $400-an-ounce level, for the first time in almost three years, after being as low as $325 last fall. It may soon be time to search the dresser drawers again for those old gold rings and cash them in. The Name's Chicago, Pardner What if the New York Stock Exchange were called, say, the Northeast Stock Exchange? Sounds imprecise, doesn't it? A bit mushy even. Not the strong, crisp image the times demand. That must have been what the folks at the Midwest Stock Exchange were thinking last week when they went back to a name they'd used in simpler times: the Chicago Stock Exchange. In 1949, the exchange took the Midwest name after absorbing regional exchanges in St. Louis, Cleveland and Minneapolis-St. Paul. But since then, the city's name has gained global force with the rise of powers like the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. And now the stock exchange, the nation's largest outside New York, hopes to cash in on some of that new magic. INTERNATIONAL The World Still Has Problems Leaders of seven powerful nations put their heads together in Tokyo last week to tackle the world's economic problems. The problems survived, pretty much unscathed. The mighty seven did agree to a quick $3 billion in aid to Russia, but that aid was mainly just a rearranging of prior commitments. What's new is that it will get to its target more quickly, and its focus will be on transforming state companies. And newly private industries, President Clinton predicted, his finger solidly on the domestic pulse, will eventually provide \\"a huge new market for American goods and services.\\" The leaders also vowed to \\"curb protectionism in all its manifestations\\" -- a hot topic as America and Japan haggle over their hefty trade imbalance.   There is progress on the trade front, mainly because the United States has seemingly become more realistic about what it can and can't get. Last week it reached a compromise with Japan, Canada and Europe that will cut many tariffs but will not touch issues that regularly set off political fireworks, like American textile barriers. Not Made in China Once, everything said \\"Made in China\\"; in China, though, a great wall kept imported goods out. Trade deficit? You couldn't say it in Chinese. But China has gone on a spending spree recently, and its trade gap quickly took on American proportions. Last week, China said its deficit had doubled in two months -- and disclosed a new austerity plan.

Sidney (Zack Norman) is also in his 30's and considers himself a swinger. If he had a gap between his upper front teeth he'd look like an American Terry-Thomas. Sidney is tall, fast-talking and optimistic, but he's really no more able to cope with crime than Simon.In \\"Sitting Ducks,\\" which opens today at the Gemini I Theater, Simon and Sidney score something of a coup. They hit the mob for one day's bookmaking receipts (approximately $750,000) and take off in a Cadillac limousine for Miami, where they plan to fly to Costa Rica and eternal, moneyed ease.In comedies like \\"Sitting Ducks\\" you know right away that Simon and Sidney can't get away with this caper without problems, and the problems that arise are of a consistently cheerful if slapdash order.\\"Sitting Ducks\\" is the third film to be made by Henry Jaglom, a fellow whose ambition to be a movie maker somewhat exceeds his talent. I'm not sure that this gap is noticeably narrowed by \\"Sitting Ducks,\\" but it's certainly far more fun than either his \\"A Safe Place,\\" in which Tuesday Weld prepared for suicide, or \\"Tracks,\\" in which Dennis Hopper played a returning Vietnam vet.Mr. Emil and Mr. Norman are not, as has been suggested elsewhere, the Laurel and Hardy of the age of anxiety. They are too friendly. Their personalities lack the clearly defined edges of seasoned comic actors. What they do have, though, is an approach to comedy that is endearingly tentative. They're like old friends, say, an accountant and a salesman, who are asked to perform their amateur routines in front of a group of people they don't know. They come on with modesty and good humor and do their best.

I wanted to hear that crystal-clear sound.\\"\\n\\nLes Paul is a seminal guitarist and a pioneering technologist. A recent resurgence of interest bespeaks his influence. A video based on the \\"Les Paul and Mary Ford at Home\\" television shows (starring Mr. Paul and his wife and broadcast from 1949 to 1958) is in production, a new boxed set of his music has just come out, and an all-star tribute, scheduled for release next year by Epic, is being recorded. It will feature performances by Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and other musicians whose creative visions owe a debt to Les Paul.

You had to skim down to No. 8 to find a novel you might still want to read (John le Carré's ''Smiley's People'') and then down to No. 15 to find William Styron's ''Sophie's Choice,'' still hanging on in its 47th week. (This was Styron's last work of fiction to make the Times list, but his memoir, ''Darkness Visible,'' was a hardcover best seller for 24 weeks a decade later.) On the nonfiction side, the No. 1 book was ''Free to Choose,'' a genial tutorial in laissez-faire economics from the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman and his wife, Rose Friedman. Their book caught on with non-economists, and even some lefties, largely because of a tie-in with a PBS series. The No. 2 nonfiction book was ''The Third Wave,'' by the futurist Alvin Toffler, which had a frenzied tone that made readers afraid not to buy it: ''Tearing our families apart, rocking our economy . . . shattering our values, the Third Wave affects everyone.''

Although the action is stilted here and there, obviously occasionally because of censorial deletions, the film has the compensating virtues of excellent acting, scintillating lines and original, but decidedly mad, escapades.In this somewhat exotic affair, which owes its origin partly to a French stage work, Leslie Howard appears as a French sleuth who frequently disguises himself as a physician bearing an uncanny resemblance to George Bernard Shaw. Sir Cedric Hardwicke portrays a swindling financier, who, after one of his schemes has gone on the rocks, coolly enthuses over his picture engraved on the worthless stocks and bonds. Binnie Barnes, the Catherine Howard of \\"The Private Life of Henry VIII,\\" has an exciting time as Helene, Dupont's wife, and Nigel Bruce acts an individual known as Welton, one of a trio who have invested their savings in Dupont's venture.Albert Latour (Mr. Howard), the impoverished private detective, elects to try and defeat Dupont's efforts to get control of property owned by Helene and, to accomplish his purpose, he makes up to look like Dr. Germont. The wild doings that ensue are presented with many really humorous surprises. For instance, as one scene fades out, it looks as though Helene had signed the document in favor of her husband's handling her estate, but soon one learns that, instead of putting her signature to the paper, she has drawn a sketch of herself thumbing her nose at her husband.In the course of the riotous activities Helene is kidnapped and held for ransom, an amount alluded to in a note as a mere pittance—5,000,000 francs. The boisterous humor continues until Latour has succeeded in getting a fair share of the bank notes locked in Dupont's safe.Mr. Howard gives a highly amusing performance. Sir Cedric makes the most of the dry humor which comes his way. Miss Barnes is charming and shows a true talent for comedy. Arthur Howard, Leslie's brother, plays the real Dr. Germont effectively. Sir Nigel Playfair, W. Graham Browne, Claude Allister and Nigel Bruce also do well by the comic proceedings.

The other film, a modest, pretty little yarn about an Indian sheepherder's son, is so genteely uneventful that it's almost antiseptic. Surely the kids deserve a bit more gristle in this candid day and age.As for \\"Beau Geste,\\" it's still the same old tale of heroism, self-sacrifice and brotherly devotion on the African sands, studded with fierce battles against the Arabs. The story by Pereival Christopher Wren has been marginally altered by the scenarist-director, Douglas Heyes. The honor-bound Britishers who once scooted to the Legion after the theft of Lady Somebody's diamond are now two young brothers, strictly All-American types, as played by Guy Stockwell and Doug McClure.

Taken exactly for what it is, a sandy, adventure-antique, the story retains a curiously appealing, old-fashioned dignity amid today's screen heapings of sex. Freud and technical angularity. Furthermore, the action marches in a straight line, uncluttered with any flashbacks to the home hearth.That is the sole improvement, this time, over the two costlier, splashier predecessors. With the fiercely earnest acting, plus a couple of rip-snorting battles staged by Mr. Heyes, the middle third of the new film, in good color, has a burly compactness that eventually levels off limply.Mr. Stockwell is personably determined but he can't hold a candle to the noble Beaus of yore, Ronald Colman and Gary Cooper.

The 12-year-old hero, Pat Cardi, is an Indian who spends most of the time helping his father and uncles tend sheep and yearning to go with them into the mountains during the winter. The color is moderate, but the mountainous New Mexico backgrounds are nice.

Major trading partners: exports: E.U., U.S., Japan; imports: E.U., U.S., Japan. South Africa was originally inhabited by San and related peoples. Bantu peoples, including the Zulu and Xhosa, migrated to the region beginning around the 15th century and established large native kingdoms. The Portuguese explorer Bartholomew Diaz discovered and named the Cape of Good Hope in 1488. The Dutch East India Company established a permanent settlement at Cape Town in 1652, which served as a supply and transshipment point for Dutch trade to the East Indies. It attracted Protestant settlers from throughout Western Europe. In a series of wars, the Xhosa people were expelled from the area under Dutch rule. Great Britain began to dispute Dutch control of the Cape of Good Hope region in the late 18th century. To escape increasing British hegemony, in 1836 many Dutch farmers undertook the Great Trek, a northward migration to lands not under the control of any European power. These Afrikaner pioneers later became known as Boers (farmers). They came into conflict with the Zulu kingdom that, under King Shaka, had recently widened its dominion in the South African interior. The Zulus were defeated at the Battle of Blood River in 1838, but they retained substantial power and territory for another 40 years. Great Britain formally took control of the Cape Colony in 1841 and annexed Natal in 1843. The other two Afrikaner provinces, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, remained free of British control. But when diamonds were discovered in the Orange Free State in 1867 and gold in the Transvaal in 1886, an influx of British miners and entrepreneurs provoked Boer rebellions. In 1878 the Zulu Kingdom under its last great king, Cetewayo, rebelled against British rule in Natal. British troops attacked Zululand in 1878 and crushed the rebellion in 1879. The first Anglo-Boer War of 1881–82 led to total British victory. A renewed uprising led to the Boer War of 1899–1902, which was fought with great ferocity between British regular troops and Afrikaner guerrilla forces. The eventual British victory led to the establishment of British rule in all of South Africa and to the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910. The union became a self-governing state within the British Empire in 1934. South African politics became dominated by friction between British and Afrikaner whites; no effective black participation in government was permitted. The United South African party, led by Jan C. Smuts, advocated cooperation between the two groups and led South Africa to join World War II on the Allied side, over the opposition of the pro-Afrikaner Nationalist party. After the war the Nationalists prevailed and won control of the government in 1948. Racial politics became the country's paramount concern, and the Nationalists introduced the policy of “apartheid” (separateness), under which racial groups were rigidly defined as white, black, Asian (primarily Indian), and colored (mixed ancestry). Each group was to be kept physically separate and develop its own political institutions within defined areas of residence; mixed neighborhoods, intermarriage, and other relations were prohibited. Blacks, in particular, were restricted by “pass laws” that allowed them only temporary access to white areas for employment. International condemnation of these policies began almost immediately, as India broke relations with South Africa in 1946 over discrimination against Asians, and South Africa became the focus of mounting protest, U.N. resolutions, and international sanctions beginning in the 1960's. On May 31, 1961, South Africa gave up its dominion status and became a republic; its application for membership in the British Commonwealth was withdrawn in the face of strong opposition. The African National Congress (ANC), organized in 1912, was banned by South African authorities. The imprisonment of its leader, Nelson Mandela, provided a focus for black political protest and nationalist aspirations. Homelands were established under the Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act of 1959 to further the policy of apartheid by creating separate, but dependent, states for South Africa's blacks. Their form of government was set up in the Black Constitution Act of 1971. The South African government intended that the homelands be regarded as separate nations, but none was ever internationally recognized. The scattered homeland territories comprised only a tiny portion of the total area of South Africa, and tended to include marginal and underdeveloped lands. Residents of the homelands were not considered citizens of South Africa, but rather citizens only of their homeland. As such, they could be considered temporary migrant workers and were therefore ineligible for unemployment and other benefits. An uprising in Soweto in 1976 was put down by South African police and armed forces with the loss of hundreds of lives, providing a further focus of black protest. Pieter Willem Botha was elected president in 1978, pledging to uphold apartheid while seeking solutions to racial problems. In 1983, a majority of white voters approved a new constitution that provided for limited power sharing by coloreds and Asians. Blacks, however, continued to be excluded. In the early 1980's, South African troops intervened in civil wars in Angola and Mozambique and were deployed to counteract growing proindependence rebellions in Namibia. Within South Africa, terrorism and uprisings led by the African National Union grew in intensity in 1983–84. A state of emergency was declared in 1985, accompanied by renewed political and economic pressure from abroad. In 1986, Bishop Desmond Tutu, a leading black nationalist, addressed the United Nations and called for renewed sanctions. The Botha government announced an end to the pass laws and promised limited black participation in government. Fighting among black groups in 1986–87 further increased domestic tension. On May 19, 1986, South African troops conducted raids against ANC bases in Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana. A new national state of emergency was declared as strikes and riots marked the 10th anniversary of the Soweto uprising. The U.S. announced measures designed to end American investment in South Africa. In early 1989, in anticipation of elections to be held in September, various proposals were put forward for constitutional reform. Most called for expanded power sharing but still within the context of defined racial groups. In July 1989 Pres. Botha had an unprecedented meeting with Nelson Mandela, amid strong suggestions that the white government was seeking an accommodation with the antiapartheid leadership. Botha's successor, F.W. de Klerk, continued that policy. A series of measures in 1989–90 resulted in the partial dismantling of apartheid, against the vehement opposition of the white right wing, but violence between supporters of the ANC and the Zulu Inkatha movement in Natal led to the declaration of a state of emergency in the province. Mandela was released from prison in the spring of 1990 and received a rapturous welcome from South Africa's blacks, and later made a triumphant tour of Western Europe and North America. His glory was short-lived, however, as the struggle for supremacy again erupted in murder and violence between Mandela's ANC and Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party throughout the latter part of 1990 and 1991. At the same time, Pres. de Klerk and Parliament continued to move the nation toward the ending of apartheid by repealing 60 years of segregation in hospitals, libraries, schools, and other public institutions. The government also released other political prisoners and completely repealed the legal foundations of apartheid: the Land Acts of 1913 and 1936, the Group Areas Act, and the Population Registration Act. The United States and other countries began lifting trade sanctions against South Africa in the summer of 1991. In September 1991, de Klerk, Mandela, and Buthelezi, together with 20 smaller antiapartheid groups, signed an accord to end factional violence. De Klerk proposed a new constitution that would provide universal suffrage and create a two-chamber parliament open to all races. The new constitution abolished the black homelands, consolidating them into one large, multiracial South Africa. In March 1992 a referendum of white voters overwhelmingly approved a government proposal to dismantle all forms of apartheid and to conduct talks with black leaders designed to end white-only rule. The new constitution was approved on Nov. 17, 1993, by all of the country's major political parties, except for Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party, which withheld its support until a week before the country's first-ever multiracial elections in April. More than 22 million voters cast ballots. An overwhelming majority chose the 75-year-old Mandela to lead a coalition government that included de Klerk's National party and Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party. In May 1996 South Africa completed the transition to democracy when it approved a permanent constitution to replace the transitional one implemented three years earlier. It created a strong central government, an independent judiciary, and a bill of rights with one of the broadest guarantees of liberty in the world. In addition to freedom of speech, movement, and political activity, the South African Bill of Rights protects rights to adequate food, housing, water, education, and health care. The day after the new constitution was approved, de Klerk and his colleagues in the National party quit their cabinet posts, saying that the government was strong enough to handle “robust opposition.” In 1997 there were reminders that troubles remain: in February, riots in Johannesburg suburbs by coloreds against discrimination in favor of blacks and in March, a mass rally (which turned violent) in Johannesburg by still-unsatisfied Zulus. Bitter feelings between the Inkatha Freedom Party and Mandela's ANC surfaced again when the Truth and Reconciliation Committee reported testimony linking Inkatha leaders to assasination squads during the apartheid era. On June 2, 1999, South Africa held its second post-apartheid elections: the ANC won a gigantic victory, taking 266 seats in the 400-seat Assembly. An “alliance” with the one member of the (Indian) Minority Front gave ANC the 2/3 majority that permits it to amend the Constitution. Thabo Mbeki, who replaced Nelson Mandela as party chief in December, was elected unopposed to be his successor as South Africa's president as well. There has been subsequent slippage in ANC popularity. As inflation heats up strikes grow more frequent. In Dec. 2000 local elections the ANC took only 59 percent and a serious bribery scandal is developing over a 1999 $3.5 billion arms deal. And the government's own report of March 2001 highlighted the gravity of South Africa's AIDS crisis. South Africa has the continent's most highly developed economy; it is a fully-developed, capitalist industrial-commercial society with manufacturing, mining, agricultural, service, and other sectors. It remains the world's largest producer of gold, a key source of chromium and other strategic metals, and of gem-quality diamonds.

Dr. Impellizeri states that our study, along with one by Deborah Anne Dawson in the same volume, focused on individuals who were \\"exposed to sex education programs that either provided them with condoms or told them how and where to obtain them.\\" Neither study reported that these sex education programs handed out condoms, and only about 63 percent of the courses gave information on where to obtain contraception.   This error is rather harmless compared with Dr. Impellizeri's statement that our study supposedly found that the odds of a 15-year-old virgin becoming sexually active by his or her 16th birthday were increased by \\"at least 20 percent\\" if he or she took a sex education course. The increase we report was only 2 percent among whites and 4 percent among blacks, controlling for social background.   We also state in this article that \\"The models do not tell us, however, whether this association is causal or spurious (spurious because we have not controled for all the factors potentially associated with both taking a course and initiating coitus).\\" The the bulk of evidence in this country, and in countries such as Sweden, indicate that sex education courses are not associated with higher levels of sexual activity, and some family planning policies and programs, other than \\"just say no\\" campaigns, can reduce teen-age pregnancies.   Those who use research findings to support a position must report them without bias.

Digital music services sold more than 244,000 copies combined of two of the tracks, and a week later snippets of the same songs sold 269,000 ring tones.

Culling its own collection - said to be the world's most comprehensive holding of its kind - the museum presents 52 works ranging from the 1950's to now, by names such as Josef Beuys, Andy Warhol, Yves Klein, Roy Lichtenstein, A. R. Penck, Claes Oldenburg, Jasper Johns, Elizabeth Murray and Julian Schnabel. A number are recent acquisitions shown here for the first time. The idea of this chronological survey, notes Bernice Rose, curator of drawings at the museum and the exhibition's organizer, is to deal both with tradition and ''the subversion of traditional categories'' that has occurred over the last 25 years.

The same thing happens to fish, shellfish and vegetables, only faster: browning draws the juices from the center to the surface, but with less fat inside to mitigate the flow, a second too long and the succulence becomes cardboard. This is particularly so when sauteing a thin fish fillet or a tiny shrimp and a Spartan amount of fat is used. You must, therefore, prepare very carefully for those few seconds of sizzle.    First, choose your weapon. According to the Larousse Gastronomique, sauteing should be done in a shallow copper pan with straight sides. For heavier cuts of meat or fish, there's a logic to this choice -- its construction promotes an even and sustained distribution of heat.

Released in 1983, the film did well enough at the box office, but critics were largely unimpressed, even contemptuous. S.E. Hinton had written her wildly popular book in her sophomore year of high school, and it was published in 1967. Years later, a school librarian wrote to Mr. Coppola and, on behalf of both students and faculty, asked him to turn Ms. Hinton's unvarnished adolescent musings into a film. In 1982, he complied and shot a movie he would describe as ''a 'Gone With the Wind' for 14-year-old girls.''     The film was made in the wake of the disastrous ''One From the Heart,'' which crushed Mr. Coppola's dream of creating a viable alternative to Hollywood. Whether he took on Ms. Hinton's popular young-adult novel out of opportunism is a matter of interpretation. Whatever the case, in spring 1982 he flew to Tulsa, Okla., the author's hometown, and soon began filming","excerpt":"less than a month after production ended, he began working on a second adaptation of one of her books, ''Rumble Fish,'' a vastly underrated film that led to his premature critical burial.

Thirteen months later, 18 banks holding 98 percent of the assets of the country's overall banking system were sold by the Government to domestic and foreign private investors. This effort raised more than $12 billion for the Government and increased the number of shareholders in Mexican banks from 8,000 to more than 130,000.

Saturday at the Waterloo Festival, in what might have been a fascinating experiment with a period piece, Gerard Schwarz conducted a concert revival of the Wagner score. It was a tame and ultimately pointless exercise in musical archeology.

But such law enforcement must be augmented by measures that reach the root causes of violence.\\n\\nThe public debate over what to do about escalating violence can no longer honestly refuse to consider a change in the current criminal law approach toward drug abuse. The common practice of drug dealers' settling \\"accounts\\" with automatic weapons is largely an outgrowth of the illicit industry -- the sale and consumption of drugs for huge profits. We must recognize not only the correlation between guns and the underground drug market, but that both guns and drugs have had lethal consequences for poor communities.\\n\\nWe must therefore ask whether decriminalization will reduce street violence and unclog the courts without causing a significant increase in dysfunctional drug abuse. We must ask whether treatment for addicts makes more sense than imprisonment. We must consider whether the deterrent effect of the present approach justifies the widespread erosion of civil liberties that accompanies the \\"War on Drugs.\\"\\n\\nFinally, wherever one comes out on decriminalization, one cannot seriously address the problems of drugs and violence without addressing the lack of economic opportunity and loss of hope in inner cities.

Lewis Libby Jr.'s 1996 novel, ''The Apprentice,'' was all but forgotten until Mr. Libby, then Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, was indicted on charges of obstruction of justice and perjury last month. Now it has taken on new life, and St. Martin's Press is rushing back into print 25,000 copies of the book, a thriller set in Japan in 1903, The Associated Press reported. ''There has been an overwhelming response from the marketplace and from booksellers who want this book,'' said Sean Desmond, a senior editor at Thomas Dunne Books, a St. Martin's imprint. Mr. Libby has pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to investigators and a grand jury about his role in the leaking of information about the C.I.A. operative Valerie Wilson to reporters.    Beanie Sigel Jailed Again       It was back to jail briefly yesterday for the rapper Beanie Sigel. Mr. Sigel, right, whose real name is Dwight Grant, was ordered to jail in Philadelphia until he paid $26,000 in child support and $2,000 in fines, The Associated Press reported. After an hour, he paid the money and was released, his lawyer, Walter McHugh, said. Mr. Sigel, 31, had received a six-month prison sentence in Philadelphia Family Court but was told he could win his release by paying the child support for his children by two different mothers. Mr. McHugh said that because Mr. Sigel had been under house arrest, in prison or in drug rehabilitation for much of the past two years, he had not been earning money to pay support. In August, Mr. Sigel, who has a lengthy arrest record that began in his youth, was released from a federal prison after serving nearly a year on a weapons charge. In September, a jury cleared him of charges of attempted murder in a shooting on a crowded Philadelphia street outside a strip club in 2003.    Another Paris Hilton Tape?       Did Paris Hilton allow her companion, the Greek shipping heir Stavros Niarchos, to drive and crash her Bentley while drunk? Did a police officer then let them go? Did Ms. Hilton blow a kiss and say, ''Thank you, officer -- we love the police''? The Los Angeles Police Department was seeking the answers to those questions yesterday after the celebrity Web site TMZ.com posted a videotape that showed what appeared to be Mr. Niarchos slamming the car into the back of a truck as the couple left a nightclub in Hollywood with at least two other people at about 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, Reuters reported. The tape shows the damaged car speeding from the scene as bystanders and photographers scatter. Then, according to Reuters, Mr. Niarchos is seen speaking to police officers who have pulled him over. One holds him by the elbow before the officers allow him and Ms. Hilton to leave with their friends, identified by TMZ as Kimberly Stewart, daughter of the rocker Rod Stewart, and Talan Torriero, star of the MTV reality show ''Laguna Beach.'' Although it was not clear who was driving the Bentley at that point, the man identified as Mr. Torriero is heard telling his companions, ''I'm the only sober one","excerpt":"let's just go.'' A spokesman for Ms. Hilton declined to comment. Grace Brady, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles police, said: ''We're trying to determine what happened. There have been callers alleging that this person was driving under the influence and that L.A.P.D. may have allowed them to drive away.''    Suit and Countersuit       Earlier this year, the Grammy Award winner Kanye West sued the Chicago disc jockey Eric Miller, also known as E-Smoove. Now Mr. Miller has countersued, The Associated Press reported. At the heart of the dispute are some unreleased songs. Mr. West sued to keep Mr. Miller from distributing them, maintaining that the two had no contract and that Mr. Miller used a fake contract with a fake West signature when he offered the songs to distributors. Mr. Miller's countersuit argues that Mr. West worked for and with him in the mid-1990's on recordings of 10 songs. Mr. Miller says that he was the co-author of the recordings and that Mr. West agreed that Mr. Miller's company, the Focus Music Group, would own them. Mr. West is seeking at least $1.3 million and a ban on Mr. Miller's using his name or voice; Mr. Miller is seeking $10.48 million and profits from the recordings.

A medallion is so expensive because income is more or less guaranteed (it is pretty hard not to make money driving a cab). But, considering the grueling and dangerous work, the money is certainly not out of line.    When I first applied for a license, a number of friends asked me if I wasn't afraid of being robbed or murdered. I am, but not as afraid as I am of being hit by or crashing into another vehicle, and thus being maimed or killed. In fact, I hope to get out of this business as soon as possible, because working 12-hour shifts is murder on my health, my personal life and my posture.
