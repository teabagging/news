Goma Journal","excerpt":"Next Door to Rwanda, Pillaged City Picks Itself Up"},{"year":"2006","title":"FIRST things first: Fresno has gotten something of a bum rap. It's usually thought of as an isolated place to pass through rather than go to. But perhaps because of that isolation, Fresno itself has turned into a quirky destination. Here, generations of immigrants from around the world have mixed together and invented their own ways of doing things, from underground gardens to far-more-than-organic peace farms. Moreover, if you plan to explore Yosemite, Sequoia or Kings Canyon National Parks, Fresno's location in the middle of California's long San Joaquin Valley makes it a perfect base. It's not exactly cool -- at least not literally, certainly not in the summer -- but the 'No can be a surprisingly individualistic city.   EVAN RAIL    Friday    6 p.m.  1 -- Fresno Vasco    Just imagine what the conversations sounded like. Fresno's historic Chinatown is also home to the Basque Hotel (1102 F Street, 559-233-2286), a former boardinghouse for shepherds from the old country, now a bar and restaurant. Start out with a Picon Punch ($2.50), a bittersweet cocktail made from a Basque brandy that resembles rocket fuel. If you wait until 6:30, they'll ring the bell for group seating just as they did when boarders still lived there and played jai alai out back. The set menu ($10) varies nightly but usually includes appetizers like beef tongue, oxtail, shepherd's stew and rich potato salad with bay shrimp. For main courses, the lamb chops are practically mandatory. And remember, this is a Basque place: just about the only thing that's not served with sautéed garlic is the ice cream.    8 p.m.  2 -- Blues and Brews    Though years of decline have left it deliciously decrepit, Chinatown was once a thriving and varied place, as witnessed by the stately Fresno Betsuin Buddhist Temple (1340 Kern Street), above, and the Nippon Building (at F and Kern Streets), now home to a ground-floor Mexican lunchroom with great tamales","excerpt":"next door, an unrelated Chinese herb shop sells dried beetles by the ounce. A rebirth of the neighborhood is in the works, led in part by places like the Full Circle Brewing Company (620 F Street, 559-264-6323), a warehouse-size microbrewery where local blues and rock acts share the stage with touring singer-songwriters. Though the Billsner, a German-style pilsner, is very good, the bar's real winner is the Decemator, a pleasantly sour-sweet Märzen with a knockout 10 percent alcohol by volume ($3.75 a pint).    Saturday    9 a.m.  3 -- Chicken Pie and Thrift    Start the day with a chicken-pie omelet ($6.75) at Grand Marie's Chicken Pie Shop (861 East Olive Avenue, 559-237-5042), a midcentury diner the size of a hardware store. Farmers, welders and poets sink into avocado-green vinyl booths for endless cups of coffee and huge plates of stick-to-your-everything fare: eggs, links, patties, bacon, pancakes and the pies ($4.75). Fresno hipsters meet here before tracking down what must be the valley's greatest natural resource: a never-ending supply of pristine vintage clothing from shops like Retro Rag (733 East Olive Avenue, 559-497-0717), which stocks disco duds, 80's T-shirts and classic 50's chiffon dresses ($10).    Noon  4 -- Nooks From Underground    Fair warning: in warm weather, the valley turns into an inferno, and about the only place to seek refuge is underground. From 1906 to 1946, Baldasare Forestiere created an expansive subterranean arboretum with trees from his native Sicily and around the world, digging some 10,000 square feet of bedrooms, skylights, living rooms, a kitchen, a chapel and even his own underground fishpond. Today, the Forestiere Underground Gardens (5021 West Shaw Avenue, 559-271-0734) are open to the public, and yes, they're mercifully cool when the mercury rises. Mr. Forestiere's great-nephew Andre lives on the site, giving tours (adults $10) at noon and 2 p.m., Wednesday to Sunday, Memorial Day to Labor Day.    2 p.m.  5 -- How the Other Half Cleaned    Grab a carne asada taco ($1) from Taqueria y Carniceria Michoacán (508 North Van Ness Avenue, 559-497-6131), a Mexican butcher shop with a sideline in quick meals, then head to the Meux Home Museum (Tulare and R Streets, 559-233-8007), top left, for a glimpse of high-style valley life from 1888. A surgeon in the Confederate Army, Thomas Meux moved to the West after the Civil War to build a house on what was then Fresno's eastern border, now directly downtown. Today the two-story museum (adults $5) is filled with oddball stuff like hand-pump vacuum cleaners and mechanized toilets. An excellent counterpart is the Kearney Mansion Museum (7160 Kearney Boulevard, 559-441-0862), an even more grandiose sister museum in the temporary home of one of the area's first agriculture barons, M. Theo Kearney, who intended the spacious building to be his servants' quarters. The 225-acre garden was started in 1892 (adults $5).    4 p.m.  6 -- Flippers Optional    Fresno may look flat, but some of the best rock climbing in the Sierras is less than an hour from downtown. When climbers create gridlock at Yosemite, Fresnans head to the overlooked Tollhouse Rock just east of town (approximately 20 miles on Highway 168), a 500-foot granite dome with dozens of routes and a friendly if goofy climbing culture. In late October, competitors in the annual Tollhouse Face-Off scale the mountain face wearing blindfolds, gloves and diving flippers. If you want to brush up on your technique, with or without flippers, try Yosemite Fitness (5075 North Cedar Avenue, 559-229-7625), where you can take a personal climbing lesson ($35) and practice on a wall.    8 p.m.  7 -- Melting Pot    The city's cultural mix is made manifest at Campagnia (1185 East Champlain Drive, 559-433-3300), where contemporary cuisine with an Italian-Asian influence competes with Fresno's indigenous cocktail, the Stockholm (Champagne, vodka, triple sec, sour mix and lemon, $8). Though the bar is a focal point for valley social life long after the dinner hour, the chef, Floro Bugnosen, prepares an eclectic fare that really draws crowds. The dinner menu flatters carnivores: the chef's special, a double-cut pork chop with Thai curry and coriander ($23.95), is nearly as good as the 16-ounce Black Angus ribeye ($30.95) flavored with chipotle and balsamic vinegar, each quite easily a meal to spread over a couple of days.    Sunday    10 a.m.  8 -- Oasis of Tranquillity    Promoting agriculture in harmony with nature, the Mokichi Okada center (5790 North Indianola Avenue, Clovis; 559-324-0465; www.moa-fresno.org) is the Japanese organization's only Zuisenkyo, or health oasis garden, in the contiguous 48 states. The center is open for tea ceremonies and flower-arranging classes call for reservations . Feel free to wander the gracefully planted peach and persimmon orchards and buy fresh fruits and vegetables, all farmed according to Okada's principles: much like organic, only with more restrictions. For a delicious if highly temporary souvenir, take home a basket of fresh strawberries, produced without pesticides ($1.50).    12:30 p.m.  9 -- Antique Frontier    Fill your trunk with porcelain dogs from China and cracked-glaze ceramic cheese keepers in the nearby city of Clovis. Though engulfed by the sprawl of greater Fresno (population 1 million), the area around Pollasky and Fifth Streets in Clovis still looks like a frontier burg, albeit one filled with antiques shops. One of the best is the Emporium (460 Clovis Avenue, 559-322-6105), a former dry goods store built in 1904. Before hitting the road, enjoy afternoon tea ($9 to $28 a person) at the Victoria Rose Cottage (356 Pollasky Avenue, 559-322-4832), where the waitresses serve scones and egg-salad sandwiches while dressed in Victorian-era garb. Someone has to.    THE BASICS    City of Many Sides       Many major carriers serve the Fresno airport, 15 minutes from downtown. You'll need a rental car to get around.      Most hotels are part of major chains; the Radisson (2233 Ventura Street, 559-268-1000; www.radisson.com/fresnoca) is among the best downtown. Rooms are $149 to $299. Given the area's size, the central location of the Ramada Inn University (324 East Shaw Avenue, 559-224 4040; www.ramadafresno.com), near the California State University campus, makes it a good point for exploring in all directions.

Like shows by Russian and drag ballet troupes, with all their last-minute cast changes, nothing is certain until performers enter the small, pristine stage space at the Construction Company. A few days before the event, which is free and includes dance, digital image, dance theater, performance installations and light refreshments, some of the scheduled participants were MEI-BE WHATEVER and the companies of ARIANE ANTHONY, CAROLYN LORD, CHRISTOPHER CAINES, ELKE RINDFLEISCH and REBEKAH WINDMILLER.    But the crucial ingredient is the theater itself, with its cozy lobby, interior galleries and nicely functional white-box stage, which all brim with a sense that the Construction Company is most of all a welcoming, low-key home where quietly imaginative art, of the upper- and lower-case varieties, can be made by longtime and new practitioners. Reservations are encouraged for the event, which is part of the annual arts-presenters conference but is open to the public.

One of the most enjoyable aspects of the JAPAN SOCIETY's annual showcase of Japanese contemporary dance is that it, too, is crammed with unexpected drama.

This year's series includes American debut performances by APE, ROUSSEWALTZ and YOUYA SHINJO and new work by SHINONOME BUTOH and YUKIKO AMANO. The themes include the daily lives of corporate recruits and the dining-out experiences of long-haired Japanese women.

Long before Caramoor became the site of public outdoor concerts and the Rosen mansion was converted into a museum, Walter and Lucie Rosen held musicals and gave private parties in what they called the Music Room. The spaciousness of the room itself - it occupies the entire north wing of the building - plus its lavish furnishings and the exquisite l6th-century ceiling brought here from a palace in Italy, lent an aura of Old World elegance to chamber music performances that will not be forgotten by anyone lucky enough to have been on the Rosens's guest list. (More than 40 years ago, I turned pages for my mother, the pianist Nadia Reisenberg, when she played sonatas there with the cellist Janos Scholz.) The Music Room will be opened for music once again today at 3:30 P.M., beginning what Caramoor says is the first indoor public concert series at the Katonah estate.

In 1990 it cost the bureau $2.6 billion for its decennial count. Bureau officials estimate that the cost for the year 2000 could nearly double. Surely, they believe, there is a better way.   With an increased number of immigrants, large concentrations of poverty-stricken blacks in inner cities, and a growing number of two-earner families, there are more people with a limited command of English, a historic distrust of government, or less time on their hands. The result: Only 65 per cent of households mailed back the census forms in 1990, a record low.

Brazil's popular and folk traditions are rich and heavily exported, but although classical composition flourishes there as well, the impact of Brazilian composers on the international mainspream has been virtually nil. A weeklong festival can hardly change that, but Mr. Davies, his orchestra and a slate of guest soloists have made a valiant effort. All told, 42 works were performed in  9 public concerts and 3 live radio programs. There were also 6 master classes, a symposium, 3 meetings at which 36 composers (19 from Brazil) debated contemporary musical issues, and 3 conferences in which the Brazilians were introduced to professional organizations like Ascap and B.M.I.

The commingling of cultures has been going on for centuries. The result is food that is earthy, exotic and compelling. So much so that America is currently in love with any combination of chilies, corn, beans, tomatillos and cilantro, what the San Franciscan chef Jeremiah Tower calls ''glamorous but approachable food, reflecting the open air, the open spaces and the beautiful colors of the region.''   Some say the increasing interest in Southwestern ingredients, especially as they are being reinterpreted by a group of young chefs, is here to stay, a continuation of an American fascination with regional cooking, part of a grander scheme to codify a culinary style that is distinctly ours. Others see it as a passing fancy. Last year, it was Cajun","excerpt":"next year, it will be something else.   To those chefs who are involved in reworking traditional Southwestern dishes - the enchiladas, the tacos and refried beans - in a contemporary style, the faddishness is worrisome.

He was re-elected in a runoff on Dec. 9.    Behind the News -- For Democrats, having regained control of the House in part by emphasizing ethics problems of Republicans, Mr. Jefferson presented a difficult test case. He has denied wrongdoing, and has not been charged with a crime. But the F.B.I. says its agents found $90,000 in bribe money in Mr. Jefferson's freezer, and two of his associates have pleaded guilty to charges of bribery and conspiracy. Last June, the House removed Mr. Jefferson from the committee, and having pledged to clean up Capitol Hill, Ms. Pelosi declined last week to return him to his post. The investigation continues.    VOTED OUT    The News -- A well-known, seven-term Republican representative from Texas, Henry Bonilla (above right), was defeated last week by former Representative Ciro D. Rodriguez in the final runoff election of 2006. The reversal of fortune for the G.O.P. in the House is complete. In the outgoing Congress, they held a 232-203 majority","excerpt":"next year, they would be outnumbered 233-202, including independents who are allied with Democrats. (A Florida race is still being contested.)    Behind the News -- Mr. Bonilla may have been the victim of a long dispute over redrawn Congressional districts engineered by Republican state legislators. The Supreme Court found that the new maps diluted the Hispanic vote to help Mr. Bonilla. (The rest of the redistricting was deemed constitutional.) Although Mr. Bonilla is himself Hispanic, in general that bloc tends to vote Democratic. The revised 23rd District raised the Hispanic voting-age population from 51 to 61 percent of the total, which appears to have given an edge to Mr. Rodriguez. The 23rd is sparsely settled but covers about one-fifth of the state's land mass.    CONSPIRACIES OUT    The News -- A three-year police inquiry into the 1997 death of Diana, Princess of Wales, was released. The report, weighing in at 832 pages, said there was no conspiracy to kill any of the occupants of the wrecked car. Rather, the inquiry concluded it was an accident. Also dead: the driver, Henri Paul, and Diana's companion, Emad Mohamed (Dodi) al-Fayed.    Behind the News -- Conspiracy theories have blossomed in the years since the wreck. The report was a blow to Mr. Fayed's father, Mohamed al-Fayed (above), who has said that the British royal family and British security services wanted Diana killed so that she would not marry Dodi and have children with him. Mohamed al-Fayed denounced Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, the leader of the inquiry, as ''a mental case'' and ''a tool for the establishment and the royal family and intelligence.'' Despite the report's firm conclusions, the case is far from over. It will be the basis for a formal inquest into the deaths, set to begin next year.    STILL IN THE PICTURE    The News -- Two University of South Carolina fraternity brothers, who are shown in the film ''Borat'' making racist and misogynist remarks, lost their petition for a court order to delete those scenes and block the DVD release of the movie.    Behind the News -- The students say they thought they would appear in a foreign documentary that would not be screened in the United States. They turned out to be boorish co-stars of a top-grossing film, ''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.'' The pair, along with a third classmate who did not participate in the suit, invite Borat, a fictional television journalist played by Sacha Baron Cohen, into their R.V. Over plenty of drinks, they hold forth on reinstituting slavery and disrespecting women. Their lawyer said the scenes cost one student a job at a large corporation and another a prestigious internship, and made both of them objects of humiliation and ridicule. Others in the film have said they, too, were duped into participating.

Ted Swenson is a middle-aged college professor and blocked novelist who becomes blindly infatuated with his most talented student, a punkish nymphet who happens to be writing a novel about a love affair with a teacher. This novel of ''high comic despair'' portrays ''a fissile world where the sexes and generations are forgetting how to mix, becoming as remote and unintelligible to each other as creatures of separate species,'' Lorna Sage wrote in these pages in 2000.    RON BROWN: An Uncommon Life, by Steven A. Holmes. (Wiley, $14.95.) A Washington correspondent for The New York Times profiles the former commerce secretary, who died in an airplane crash in the Balkans in 1996. Last year in the Book Review, Michael Wright called this ''a balanced portrait of a talented, driven, flawed man with an insatiable appetite for money, publicity and powerful women he wasn't married to.''    SURVIVAL RATES: Stories, by Mary Clyde. (Norton, $12.) These tales, set in the desert Southwest, revolve around ordinary people staidly facing melodramatic events yet aching for a way to break free of their natural reticence. Clyde ''has an exquisite sense of humor: sly, heart-battering and a little tetchy,'' Karen Karbo wrote here in 1999. Her greatest strength ''is her ability to transform a shallow experience into something resembling hope.''    BOBOS IN PARADISE: The New Upper Class and How They Got There, by David Brooks. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.) In a work of ''comic sociology,'' the author charts the rise of the bourgeois bohemian, a caste that blended the countercultural 60's and the acquisitive, achieving 80's into a dominant social and economic ethos in the 90's. ''The book is a pleasure, simultaneously bracing and comforting,'' Kurt Andersen wrote here last year. It ''is not a screed but a mixture of heartfelt fondness and dead-on ridicule, animated by an energetic, glass-half-full ambivalence.''    THE GLASS BEES, by Ernst J&#252","excerpt":"nger. (New York Review, $12.95.) At the center of this allegorical German novel is an autocratic industrialist seeking to protect his garden of glass bees, miniaturized robots that if mobilized would become lethal weapons. The futuristic narrative contains ''scenes as harrowing and thought-disturbing as any created by Karel Capek, George Orwell or Aldous Huxley,'' Siegfried Mandel wrote in the Book Review in 1961.    SELECTED NON-FICTIONS, by Jorge Luis Borges. Edited by Eliot Weinberger. (Penguin, $17.) The Argentine storyteller, holding forth on movies, literature or philosophy, displays the same avidity for knowledge, esoteric thirst and poetic sensibility that infuse his erudite, labyrinthine fiction. ''One reads these many essays . . . with amazement at their author's impetuous curiosity and penetrating intelligence,'' Richard Bernstein wrote in The Times in 1999.    ABE, by Richard Slotkin. (John Macrae/Owl/ Holt, $14.) This novel about the first 23 years of Abraham Lincoln's life focuses on his trip down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers on a flatboat, during which he faced the hardships of frontier life and was first exposed to slavery. '' 'Abe' is a rich, satisfying coming-of-age story'' with conscious echoes of ''Huckleberry Finn,'' Kevin Baker wrote here in 2000. ''Slotkin works the young Lincoln's words, thoughts, dialect and society seamlessly into his story.''    TURKEY UNVEILED: A History of Modern Turkey, by Nicole Pope and Hugh Pope. (Overlook, $16.95.) Two journalists survey the culture and politics of a complex nation whose growing sophistication is offset by a poor human rights record, irresponsible party leaders and fragile governments. The result is ''a deeply revealing guide . . . that fills a wide gap in general knowledge,'' Robert D. Kaplan said here in 1999. In The Multiple Identities of the Middle East, by Bernard Lewis (Schocken, $12), ascholar explores the jumbled layers of identity in the Middle East, and how the interaction of history, religion and language has created confusion and turmoil in the region. In 2000 our reviewer, Geoffrey Wheatcroft, praised these ''admirably erudite and illuminating essays.''    OUR FATHERS, by Andrew O'Hagan. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) In this first novel, a man returns from self-imposed exile to watch over his dying grandfather, a visionary social planner who rebuilt Glasgow's slums, and reflect on four generations of a family that built a legacy and then furiously tore it down. While uneven, the story features ''spare, lyrical prose that can be solemn and impressive as a hymn,'' Jeff Giles wrote here in 1999.

As a result, Administration officials have in recent weeks toned down their anti-Communist rhetoric - emphasizing peace initiatives, negotiations and democratic solutions instead of calling for increased American military assistance to combat the ''export'' of revolution by Cuba and Nicaragua.   The guerrilla offensive in El Salvador over the past two weeks has reminded Washington that victory proclamations may be premature, yet officials are nevertheless toting up their successes: In contrast to January 1981, rebel-led popular insurrections no longer seem imminent in El Salvador and Guatemala","excerpt":"Nicaragua's Sandinist regime has lost sympathy at home and abroad (although not enough to prevent its election to the United Nations Security Council last week against United States opposition); and Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama are increasingly supportive of American policy.   The mood of optimism, however, is largely limited to Washington.  Among officials in the region, there is scant feeling of progress. On the contrary, Central America seems more unstable and violent today than 20 months ago. Economic activity is shrinking, while social conditions deteriorate.

But, above all else, they are attracted to this longtime artists' colony for the art: even the casino has murals by René Magritte and Keith Haring, and there are about 50 galleries in town. Galleries André Simoens, Patrick De Brock and Mulier Mulier deal in such impressive rosters that, together, they read like a Belgian Art Basel. At the Gallery Mourmans, limited-edition furniture and objects by Ettore Sottsass or Ron Arad are presented in a Gaetano Pesce-designed space. This being the North Sea, the beach is best enjoyed from one of the chic cafes or restaurants on the main boardwalk, at least most of the year (high season is May through mid-September). Rembrandt and the terrace at Carlton are perfect for an afternoon beer, and for dinner the best bet is Si Versailles.

An avant-garde filmmaker who began directing movies while still in his teens, he was only 22 in 1970, when he made \\"Inner Scar,\\" which played last night in Alice Tully Hall.\\"Inner Scar\\" features Pierre Clementi (nude) and the Andy Warhol superstar Nico (dressed in a loose robe) and a few others, including Phillippe Garrel. Clementi speaks French","excerpt":"Nico sometimes complains in English and sometimes declaims in German verse, and sometimes sings for musical background on the soundtrack. There are no subtitles.The people, never more than two at a time, move through a variety of landscapes from glacial to nearly tropical—but that are always, in some manner, desert. The people may walk or run or ride a horse, or drive a flock of sheep or even sail a little boat—but almost always they are in movement. At some level I suspect there is a story in which Clementi, carrying bow and arrows and wielding a sword, comes as king or savior or avenging angel to Nico in the wilderness, and then disappears without satisfying her complaint. But the story is very obscure.Much of the time the landscape seems reduced—even self-consciously reduced—to the four elements of earth, air, fire and water. It conveys the feeling of a space unreal in the way, say, that the landscape of the Krazy Kat comic strip was unreal. And as if it were in a comic strip or cartoon, the landscape supports images and gestures of great stylishness and wit.\\"Inner Scar\\" is sometimes very funny, and it is a humor—usually concerning the indignities suffered by an unhappy Nico spurned — that grows out of, and depends upon, the incongruity of human finiteness seen against the vast perspectives of the film's natural world.In such stark, unyielding simplicity there is surely a good deal of pretension. But I think there is also some achievement, and irony, and an implicit appreciation of the ridiculousness of sticking a couple of people out in the middle of nowhere (in fact, several strange locations, including Iceland) to perform symbolic drama.Compared with the desert journeys of Alexandro Jodorowsky—\\"Fando and Lis,\\" \\"El Topo\\" — \\"Inner Scar\\" seems downright civilized. Not a movie you can exactly warm up to, and no startling breakthrough in screen art either—but a very interesting and restrained experiment in visual rhetoric, in minimal gesture, in setting some highly abstract patterns of human behavior in the midst of a curiously agreeable wilderness.
