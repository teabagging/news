Aleksandr Lebed, take just one moment to savor this moment. For the first time in history an independent Russian people -- not the oligarchs, not the bankers,  not the mafia -- has chosen a president in a free and fair election. Despite all the hardships and uncertainties that have characterized life here since the collapse of the Soviet Union, an overwhelming majority of Russians actually voted for the candidate who promised to continue the wrenching transition to an  open society with a free market. That is a big deal. It is a remarkable triumph  of hope over hardship. While this single election doesn't guarantee that Russia  will make it all the way to American-style free-market democracy, it does guarantee that the effort will move forward now with a solid popular mandate. The debate about where Russia is heading is over.         But whether it will arrive anytime soon is another question. And here one is  entitled to some pessimism. Americans who came of age during the cold war grew up with a Russia that was a very fixed, frozen entity. We knew exactly what it was and, more or less, what could be expected from it. Our children's generation, I suspect, is going to grow up dealing with a Russia that is in a long, long transition, lurching forward in the direction of free markets and democracy, but with much uncertainty over how long it will take. Because while a majority of Russians have now rejected the past, they still have not freed themselves from its lingering grasp in many areas.

Gerard Hourbette and Thierry Zaboitzeff, members of the French band Art Zoyd, have composed a vivid sound track for F. W. Murnau's silent horror classic \\"Nosferatu,\\" and on Saturday evening the group accompanied a clean print of the 1922 film as part of the Serious Fun festival.   Art Zoyd is a quartet, but its instrumental arsenal yields a sound with an orchestral heft. The group's main components are electronic, and include synthesizers, samplers, tape machines, keyboards, percussion and bass. But there are also parts for amplified violin, viola, two cellos and saxophone interspersed through the score.    Like any good silent-film soundtrack, the Hourbette-Zaboitzeff score moves with the screen action. There was not much subtlety in it: the scene that introduces Dracula's eventual victims, the Harkers, has a gentle music-box quality","excerpt":"morning scenes draw on either the tintinabulations of church bells or layers of bird calls; country scenes are set to a bagpipe timbre, and of course, scenes that show or even allude to Count Dracula have music that is hazy, bass-heavy and ominous. The sounds of wind and distant howling figure prominently in the blend.    Beneath the obvious coloration, the music brings together a standard Minimalist vocabulary of repeated melodic figures and a strong rhythmic pulse, and the crunching, mildly dissonant textures of industrial rock. It suited the film as well as, and often better than, a conventionally melodramatic organ score might, and in its best moments it gave an extra sense of eerie dimension to Max Schreck's marvelously decrepit, zombie-like portrayal of the vampire.    The band's members are Patricia Dallio, a keyboardist; Andre Mergenthaler, a cellist and saxophonist, and Mr. Hourbette and Mr. Zaboitzeff, who divide the rest of the instruments between them.

There is the glorious Brooklyn Museum, to be sure, but after that, what? No SoHo, no TriBeCa, no Madison Avenue - in short, no gallery ''scene.'' Yet Brooklyn actually has a lot to offer in the way of exhibitions, and part of the fun is seeking them out. The viewer must be willing to travel far and wide, stalking the shows with sharpened eyes and a borough map. A tip: they will mostly be found at university galleries and alternative spaces. Here are some highlights of a recent tour:   First and foremost, the Brooklyn Museum, which currently houses one of the season's spectaculars: ''The Machine Age in America, 1918-1941.'' Attempting to document the impact of the machine on American culture (and vice versa) between the two world wars, this beautifully orchestrated exhibition boasts some 275 objects - paintings, photographs, sculptures and designed products -by such talents as Charles Sheeler, Joseph Stella, Alexander Calder, Paul Strand, Alfred Stieglitz, Walter Dorwin Teague, Norman Bel Geddes and Frank Lloyd Wright. Among the treats are a 1934 Chrysler Airflow (in the flesh)","excerpt":"Morton Schamberg's ''God,'' a sculpture made from a mitre box and plumbing trap; John Vassos' TRK-12, an elegant television console, designed for RCA in 1939, and Gerald Murphy's 1925 painting ''Watch,'' an engaging symphony of levers, wheels and sprockets. If the show is a little scanty on the finer arts, it pays full tribute to a dynamic period in American design.
