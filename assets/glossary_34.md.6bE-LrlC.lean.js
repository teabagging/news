Mr. Presley flaunted his sex appeal more flagrantly than any white pop performer before him, and he introduced black rhythms and inflections into the American pop mainstream, making it possible for black rockers like Little Richard and Chuck Berry to appeal to white teen-agers directly.

Prince, the 21-year-old singer, songwriter and multiinstrumentalist who is performing tonight at the Palladium, is the most controversial contemporary rock star precisely because he challenges sexual and racial stereotypes.

Wallace C. Peterson and Paul S.

Writing in the summer issue of the Journal of Post-Keynesian Economics, the Nebraska economists maintain that ''substantative Reaganomics,'' by cutting taxes and sharply increasing Government spending, ''took advantage of a simple but empirically valid principle, namely, that Government deficits stimulate economic activity.'' Tax cuts and climbing military outlays, they say, led first to increased consumption and then to an investment surge. They insist it was not an investment-led recovery, as the supply-siders maintain.

Regan who thinks they are possibly leading the nation into another recession next year. In the midst of it all, a top economist in town during the Reagan Administration Martin S. Feldstein, who headed the President's Council of Economic Advisers, had to endure the indignity of the White House spokesman mispronouncing his name and the Treasury Secretary saying of the council's annual economic report: ''You can throw it away.'' \\n\\nBut as the holiday spirit descends on the rest of the nation, the grandest insult of all has come the council's way, and from the President himself. Ronald Reagan last week confirmed what had previously been just a rumor: He is seriously thinking of abolishing the council altogether. Mr. Reagan told the conservative weekly, Human Events, that he can get all the ''capable'' economic advice he needs from the Treasury Department and other Government agencies.

It is the new tenant at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse.Jean Renoir, son of the noted painter, directed it for Marcel Pagnol, who has given us \\"Topaze,\\" \\"Fanny\\" and 'Marius\\" by which to know him. M. Renoir takes for his framework an actual murder case of Le Sud and, with a camera that penetrates beyond the police records, photographs a story of rude smoldering passions, niggardliness and frustration that might well, along with its scenic backgrounds, have been given a little technical boost here and there, current film criteria being what they are. M. Renoir, in short, makes no concession to the spectator. He fails, in his studied fidelity to the locale and its people, to consider that what may be striking chiaroscuro to the naked eye may often be merely indistinct on film. Film audiences have come to expect clarity, even in news reels.The story itself is forcefully and naturally told by these peasant players under M. Renoir's direction. A train rolls into Provence, and a group of foreign-born laborers climbs happily down, off to new work in a new country. The love of one of them, Toni, goes first to Marie, and then, in three years which pass in much too blurred fashion due to unfortunate editing, it turns to Josepha, who has been forced to marry the grasping Albert.Marie tries to drown herself","excerpt":"is rescued, but refuses Toni's remorseful attempt at reconciliation.

The 1857 obituary of my great-grandfather, George Cole, gives his address as 72 First Street. Is the five-story building there now the one he occupied at his death? . . . Jane C. Weaver, Rahway, N.J.     A.  George Cole \\"coachman\\" first appears at this address in 1852, perhaps employed by Carsten H. Koope, a grocer who owned and also occupied the building, a frame structure at the northwest corner of First Street and First Avenue. But the brick tenement now on the site was built about 1868, after his death.  Parc V Predecessor     Q.     My grandfather lived in an apartment building at the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 60th Street, since replaced by the Parc V apartments. When was this grand old building built and where could I find a plan of the apartments?    . . .    John Lane, Bronxville, N.Y.     A.  Designed by Henry J. Hardenbergh in 1903, 787 Fifth Avenue was built with full-floor apartments. Plans for most upper-class apartment houses were published in renting compendiums like Pease & Elliman's \\"Catalogue of East Side New York Apartment Plans.\\" An edition in the late 20's -- available in the Avery Architectural Library at Columbia University -- shows that this building'sapartments had three master bedrooms, three servant rooms and a library, living room and dining room. The 10-story building was built by the Van Norden Trust Company which occupied the ground floor.  4 East 39th Street     Q.     The building at 4 East 39th Street has busts of Rembrandt and Whistler. Why? . . . Lois Evans, Manhattan.     A.  This four-story building was built in 1905 as a store for Frederick Keppel and designed by George B. Post & Sons. Keppel, who probably commissioned the busts, was active as a print dealer in New York City after the Civil War, speculating in the work of Whistler, Zorn and Pennell. He was the author of several works in the field including \\"Modern Disciples of Rembrandt.\\" He died in 1912, but his son David continued the firm, building a new store at 16 East 57th Street in the 20's. Post Office Mystery     Q.     The main post office at 33d Street and Eighth Avenue has an empty niche on each side of the building, flanking the steps. Was anything ever in them? They look so empty. . . . Jackie Butler, Manhattan.     A.  Photographs taken after completion show the niches empty. Construction drawings for the building, designed by McKim, Mead & White in 1908, are held by the New-York Historical Society. The curator there, Mary Beth Betts, says the original construction drawings show the niches you mention without statuary. But preliminary renderings of the building do show statuary groups of three figures each in each niche.  161 West 61st Street     Q.     I was born Oct. 28, 1916, at 161 West 61st Street. What was the name of the hospital there? My father's address is listed as 360 West 15th Street","excerpt":"is that building still standing? . . . James R. Maedler, North Bergen, N.J.     A.  The 61st Street building was at the northeast corner of Amsterdam Avenue and was ccupied by the New York Infant Asylum. The present apartment building at 360 West 15th Street, called the Kingsland, was built in 1910 and was on the site in 1916 when your father lived there.  The Nevada    Q.     My parents and I lived for a few years in the Nevada at 2025 Broadway. I returned a few years ago but could not locate it. Has it been remodeled? . . . Viola Mitzian, Hartsdale, N.Y.     A.  No, it has been razed. The Nevada occupied the triangular plot bounded by Broadway, Amsterdam Avenue and 69th and 70th Streets. Built in 1891 as an apartment hotel, it was designed by Thom & Wilson for John T. Farley, although it was leased out upon completion to a hotel operator. It was demolished for the present Nevada Towers, completed in 1977.    Koehler's Store   Q.     The enclosed photograph shows Louis Koehler, in the suit, in front of the Koehler Electrical Store somewhere on the Upper West Side about 1910. My father, Richard J. Kernan, apprenticed in the store and is about 15 in the photograph; he is marked with my mother's \\"X.\\" Where was the Koehler shop? . . . Richard Kernan, New Paltz, N.Y.     A. Luisa Koehler \\"electrician\\" is listed at 204 West 100th Street in this period and the buildings in the photograph correspond with those in period maps. Her son, Louis, was also in business with her.   130 and 140 West 57th Street     Q.     I've always admired the matched pair of buildings at 130 and 140 West 57th Street even though they seem to have had a hard life since they went up. When were they built? . . . Robert Beard, Manhattan.     A.  These buildings were intended for artists and went up in 1908 to designs by Pollard & Steinam. They were put up as cooperatives and the original syndicates were apparently arranged by the artist Robert Vonnoh, who was involved with earlier cooperative studio construction on West 67th Street. In 1907, he built 39 West 67th Street, designed by the same architects.   The original configuration of 130 and 140 was five apartments to a floor, with two simplex apartments at the rear, two duplex apartments (with double height studios) and one nonhousekeeping studio at the front. In the 1910's many artists lived in the buildings and the painter Childe Hassam was a longtime resident of 130; the unusual trapezoidal window appears in some of his paintings of interiors.    Author William Dean Howells also lived in the building.  127-129 East 19th Street     Q.     The two two-story buildings at 127 and 129 East 19th Street have interested me for years. Were they both once stables? Jeanne Geib . . . Manhasset, L.I.     A.  Yes. The building at 127 was put up in 1854 as a stable by Charles R. Harbeck for his adjacent house at the northeast corner of 19th and Irving Place.   No. 129 was built in 1861 as a stable for the family of James Couper (or Cowper) Lord, whose house backed up to it from 24 Gramercy Park. It is not clear just when the stable occupancy ended.    An alteration application filed by architects Hoppin & Koen in 1898 described 127 as a studio and a similar application filed by architect August Pauli in 1903 described 129 as a studio being converted to a private dwelling. In 1904, the Real Estate Record and Guide described 129 as a building \\"that excites interest and admiration\\" but most of its Gothic Revival detail probably dates from its original construction, not later alteration work.   Census records and directories prior to the 1920's generally do not list the buildings and only a few occupants are known. Robert W. Bruere, an \\"agent,\\" lived in 127 around 1910 and Samuel Bettle and Francis Cushing Green, both businessmen, occupied 129 around the same period.

Jim Guy Tucker. Mr. Clinton was questioned by Sam Heuer, Mr. McDougal's lawyer.      Q.  Mr. President, do you know defendant James McDougal? A.  I do. Q.  Please tell the jury when and how you got to know Mr. McDougal. A.  We met, oh, about 30 years ago when he was running Senator Fulbright's office in Little Rock and I was a student at Georgetown working for Senator Fulbright part-time on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee here  in Washington. . . . Q.  Have you ever been engaged in a business relationship with Mr. McDougal? A.  Yes. We had two. Q.  Would you please tell the jury about those? A.  In 1977, Mr. McDougal, who was -- at that time had been, I think, for some time, engaged in various real estate development projects, asked me if I wanted  to invest a small amount of money in one in Pulaski County. And I did, I invested, as I recall, about $2,800 for about a year and a half, and I liquidated the investment and made about $5,000. So I had a profit of $2,100, it was a nice profit. Then after that, Mr. McDougal invited Hillary and I to invest with Jim and Susan in 230 acres of land in Marion County which was unimproved land near the White River, and is now called Whitewater land. And we did that. And we invested in that in 1978, and I was in that investment until 1992. Q.  Were you aware of Mr. McDougal's purchase and ownership of a savings and loan in Little Rock, Arkansas in the 1980's? A.  Yes. I became aware at some point that he bought a savings and loan, I think it was maybe in Woodruff County, and then got permission to move it down to Little Rock in the early 1980's. Q.  Mr. President, did you ever have any loan relationship with Mr. McDougal's savings and loan known as Madison Guaranty concerning your investments? A.  No, sir, I did not, I never borrowed any money from Madison Guaranty. Q.  Did you ever cause anybody to borrow any money for your benefit, Mr. President? A.  No, I did not. . . . Q.  O.K. If you would, please, describe your relationship with Jim McDougal in the 1980's. A.  Well, in the early 80's, I didn't see Jim much in the first couple of years, because he didn't live in Little Rock. But sometime after his race for Congress, which was 1982, sometime after that, maybe 1983, he moved to Little Rock, he had purchased the savings and loan, he had moved the S&L to Little Rock, he set it up in downtown Little Rock, less than a mile from the Governor's mansion. So, after he moved there and began to get active in trying to rebuild that neighborhood and establish relationships in the community, I would see him more  frequently. Q.  Are you familiar with a former municipal judge by the name of David Hale? A.  Yes, I am. Q.  Please tell the jury when you became acquainted with him. A.  I think I met David Hale sometime in the mid-1970s, and I believe it had something to do with the Jaycees. He had -- at some time in that period, he was  the national president for the Jaycees, he was from Arkansas. I was a member of  the chapter at Fayetteville, and as a candidate for office, I would, from time to time, go to the conventions of the Jaycees. So, I believe I met him at one of those, somehow in connection with his Jaycee activities. Q.  Did you ever have a business relationship with Mr. Hale, either personally or through his company, known as Capital Management Services? A.  No. Q.  Did you ever receive any loan from Mr. Hale personally or from his business  known as Capital Management Services? A.  No, I didn't. Q.  You said earlier that you ran for political office in Arkansas in 1976, I believe","excerpt":"is that correct? A.  Yes, 1976, I was a candidate for attorney general. I won the Democratic primary, and the only time in my life I had no Republican opposition, so I was elected. . . . Q.  O.K. In late '85 or 1986, were you aware of any plans that Mr. Hale had to increase a capital base in his business known as Capital Management Services? A.  No, I wasn't. Q.  Are you familiar with an office that Jim McDougal established sometime in 1986 in the south part of Pulaski County on property that was commonly referred  to as Castle Grande Estates? A.  I know Mr. McDougal in 1986 had an office on 145th Street -- Q.  That's the same. A.  -- at south Pulaski County. I don't know if that's the same place, but I know he had an office out there. Q.  Did you ever visit him on 145th Street? A.  Yes, I did, one time. Q.  And tell me, you were known in Little Rock to enjoy jogging; is that correct? A.  I did, I did then, I do now. Q.  Tell the jury if you've ever jogged from the mansion to Mr. McDougal's office on 145th Street at any time. A.  No, sir, I didn't do that. In fact, I couldn't have done that. Q.  O.K. When you visited Mr. McDougal at his office on this singular occasion,  were you wearing jogging shorts? A.  No. I was dressed up. . . . I was going to a Siemens-Allison plant, it is a  big German plant. . . . And Mr. McDougal's office was in a trailer, as I recall, on the way out there. And I stopped there for a few minutes. . . . Q.  Did you have any contact in any shape, form, or fashion with David Hale at that visit to -- A.  No, I didn't. He wasn't there. Q.  All right. Were you ever present in Mr. McDougal's office on 145th Street when a discussion occurred about financial assistance from David Hale or his Capital Management Services Company involving any other business that you or Mr. McDougal may have had? A.  No, sir, never. Q.  Were you ever present at any time for any meeting between Jim McDougal and David Hale? A.  Never, I never was present at any meeting. Q.  Were you ever present when there was any discussion of getting any kind of loan from David Hale or his S.B.I.C. [small-business investment company]? A.  No. Q.  Did you ever make a statement that your name could not appear on any loan documents or financial documents related to any type of loan from David Hale or  his S.B.I.C.? A.  Absolutely not. Q.  Did you ever get assurance from Jim McDougal that your name would be secreted from any loan documents pertaining to any loan from David Hale or his S.B.I.C.? A.  No, we never had any conversation about it at all. Q.  Did you ever tell David Hale that you had property in Marion County, Arkansas, that you could use as collateral or security for a loan from him? A.  I did not do that, no. Q.  Did you ever ask David Hale to make you a loan? A.  No. Q.  Did you ever ask David Hale to make Jim McDougal a loan? A.  No. Q.  Did you ever ask David Hale to make Susan McDougal a loan? A.  No, I didn't. Q.  Did you ever ask David Hale to make Jim Guy Tucker a loan? A.  No. Q.  Did you ever, in any shape, form or fashion, put any pressure on David Hale  for the purpose of obtaining a loan or for the purpose of causing him to make loans through his S.B.I.C.? A.  I did not put any pressure on David Hale. Q.  Do you have any idea what he is talking about in regard to these loans that  he has come up with? A.  No, sir. I tried to keep -- he has told two or three different versions of this, and I've tried to keep up with these different stories, but all I know is  that any suggestion that I tried to get any money from him or I tried to keep that a secret or I put any pressure on him, these things are simply not true, they didn't happen. Q.  In late 1985 or early 1986, were you aware or made known of any purported agreement whereby Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan would advance money to Mr. Hale or his company in some shape, form, or fashion as agreed to between Mr. Hale and Jim McDougal whereby Mr. Hale would then make loans to various people?  A.  That was a long question, Mr. Heuer. Q.  I understand. A.  It has got a short answer. No, I didn't know anything about Mr. Hale's financial business. Q.  And the same question for Susan McDougal? A.  No, I did not. Q.  Or Jim Guy Tucker? A.  No, I did not. Q.  Did you ever have any conversation with Jim McDougal wherein you were led to believe that you and Mr. McDougal could obtain financing or money from David Hale at any time? A.  No, Jim McDougal never talked to me about anything like that.    Excerpts From Clinton's Testimony"},{"year":"1978","title":"Let's face it.

Such a turn in the market would send home-mortgage rates higher and could make the stock market, already at its own record levels, jittery.   Such a declaration is risky, mainly because of the economy's erratic performance in the last several years. But at least that seemed to be the view yesterday as bond dealers sold and sold as if they were running for the exits.

This year the season arrived especially early, at the opening-night ''Norma,'' when Renata Scotto was given an ill-mannered vote of no-confidence by an impatient few of her detractors even before she had opened her mouth for the recitative leading into the fierce test that is ''Casta diva.'' As it happens, Norma's first words were apt enough: ''Sediziose voci!'' (''Traitorous voices!''). But they did not put down the jeering, which went on intermittently in one form or another all evening. The final curtain apparently developed into a noisy competition between those who had come prepared to boo and less contentious first-nighters who either liked what they had heard from the Italian soprano and the conductor, James Levine, or simply felt that famous artists should not have to hear unpleasant sounds on such an occasion. In fact, Miss Scotto did not measure up in any way to this most dem anding of bel canto roles, but that is not the point here. The iss ue is to what extent booing or otherwise disturbing an opera perform ance can be condoned.

Gordon Liddy'' works quite well as an evening's entertainment. The madefor-television movie, which will be presented on NBC tonight at 9, has been made with care. Frank Abatemarco's script remains reasonably faithful to the published autobiography of the convicted Watergate conspirator, even though a prefatory note concedes that ''certain fictional characters have been introduced and a number of incidents modified for dramatic purposes.'' Robert Leiberman's direction avoids unnecessary frills. And Robert Conrad's performance in the title role is impressive and uncompromising. The A. Shane Company production offers still another smooth example of the ''based on a true story'' project that television has become so fond of these days.   But, more so than usual, something about this production rankles.  Does the public really need the autobiography of G. Gordon Liddy, either in book or movie form? What purpose is ultimately served? The basic criterion seems to be that ''it sells,'' enabling various companies and individuals, including Mr. Liddy, to make some money.  Admittedly, Mr. Liddy is not the only Watergate figure to cash in on his notoriety. And he is hardly the first ''real'' controversial personality to be featured in the halls of television entertainment.

Earlier this autumn, the 1995 Old Farmer's Almanac fed the fear of a repeat performance by predicting a snowier than normal winter for most of the Northeast. The credibility of that forecast took a major hit when November, which the almanac said would be cold and wet in the eastern two-thirds of the country, turned out to be warmer than usual everywhere east of the Rockies. Instead of the frigid, snowy month predicted by the Almanac for them, New Yorkers, for instance, experienced a gloriously warm November: Temperatures averaged more than 4 degrees above normal, slightly less precipitation fell than average and the merest trace of snow dusted the area on Thanksgiving Eve.   Prediction or Prestidigitation?    Now the National Weather Service, which itself is not always right but whose November forecast was on the mark, is predicting a milder than normal winter for most of the country.

Mrs. Whitman is the first in a long line of governors to try to bridge the gap without pouring hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars into the needy, mostly urban school districts.

The original entrance to the Parrish building has been reconstructed for the exhibition.\\n\\n\\"Post-World War II: Toward American Art\\" traces how, under the guidance of its longtime president, Rebecca Bolling Littlejohn Markoe, the museum and its collections moved into the 20th century.\\n\\nThe final section, \\"1992,\\" investigates what museums \\"are about today, as America redefines its cultural agenda,\\" said the curator, Donna De Salvo. That is shown through written material gathered in a reading room that also features Fred Wilson's \\"Museum Guards,\\" mannequins dressed as guards, and Judith Barry's guide to the exhibition.\\n\\n\\"A Museum Looks at Itself\\" runs through Nov. 8 at the Parrish, on Job's Lane. A panel discussion, \\"The Museum in the 21st Century,\\" is scheduled for Sept. 12 (283-2118).\\n'MESSIAH' SING-IN\\n\\n Members of the Long Island Choral Society are not intimidated by the calendar. So, not worried about being early for Christmas or late for Easter, today they are the host a \\"Messiah\\" Sing-In. The concert, which invites audience members to sing along with their own music or scores borrowed from the society, is at 7 P.M. in St. Agnes Roman Catholic Cathedral on Quealy Place in Rockville Centre (731-0012).\\n'SOUND' PERFORMANCES\\n\\n With four concerts planned, this is a busy week for the Sound Symphony. Performing \\"Music From Television,\\" classical themes that are familiar from their use on television programs, the orchestra appears on the Village Green in Stony Brook tonight at 8 o'clock, at Agawam Park on Pond Lane in Southampton at 6:45 P.M. on Wednesday, at Harborside in Port Jefferson at 8 P.M. on Thursday and on the grounds of the Shoreham-Wading River Library, off Route 25A in Shoreham, at 7:30 P.M. on Friday.\\n\\nAll the concerts are free.\\nCRUISING ALONG\\n\\n A view of the Island from the outside looking in will be offered four times this week.

The sloop leaves from the Oyster Bay Marine Center (747-0777).\\n\\nOn Thursday the action moves east, to North Haven and the South Ferry on Route 114, where under the auspices of the Group for the South Fork a ferry departs at 7:30 P.M. for a journey around Northwest Harbor for rare glimpses of the Mashomack Preserve, Cedar Point County Park, the Grace Estate and Barcelona Neck.

On Tuesday the Usdan Touring Theater Company performs \\"Spiders in the Hairdo and Other Urban Legends,\\" an original musical based on folk tales.\\n\\nGeared for both children and adults, the show will be offered at 8 P.M. in the Bald Hill Cultural Park in Farmingville. Admission is free (924-4344).\\nOPERATIC COLUMBUS\\n\\n \\"New World: An Opera About What Columbus Did to the 'Indians' \\" will have its premiere on Tuesday in Huntington. The work, by Leonard Lehrman and Joel Shatzky, was commissioned by the Puffin Foundation in honor of the Columbus Quincentennial and the 50th anniversary of the American Music Center in Manhattan.\\n\\nThe composer, Mr. Lehrman, of Roslyn, said the opera took a \\"nontraditional approach\\" to its subject.  \\"It's painstakingly accurate,\\" he said, \\"but is told from a point of view other than Columbus's -- his Jewish interpreter, his African cabin boy and, of course, the Tainos, who were the original inhabitants of the Bahamas.\\"\\n\\nThe cast of 11 professional singers will be joined by a chorus of members of the Long Island Singers Society, accompanied by a piano, three synthesizers and a percussion section.  The fully staged and costumed work will be performed at 8:30 P.M. at Heckscher Park on Prime Avenue.

The concert is at 8:30 P.M. in the house on Tiffany Road and will be followed by wine, coffee and conversation (222-7105).\\n'CHEZ HAMPTONS'\\n\\n There are benefits, and then there are benefits, and the groups sponsoring Grand Tour Design \\"Chez Hamptons 1992\\" have high hopes for their three-day event. In addition to tours of 23 houses \\"highlighting the best in interior design, architecture and the decorative and visual arts,\\" the event features a Cocktail Launch at 6:30 P.M. on Friday at the Country Club at Conscience Point in Southampton, a \\"Meet 'n' Greet Luncheon\\" at Sfuzzi on North Sea Road in Southampton at 11 A.M. on Saturday and a Designer Fantasy Picnic and Auction at 8 P.M. on Saturday at an estate.\\n\\nThe tours are divided in two areas, one covering Westhampton through Southampton, the other Sagaponack through Amagansett.

But how distant those embattled days already seemed, with no special security measures anywhere apparent in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium.   Fortunately, Mr. Stern's playing, which has been erratic in recent years, bore out the sense of occasion. The double stops in Brahms's Sonata in G (Op. 78) were remarkably well tuned, balanced and controlled. The harmonics in Szymanowski's \\"Fontaine d'Arethuse\\" (Op. 30, No. 1) were eerily pure and atmospheric.
