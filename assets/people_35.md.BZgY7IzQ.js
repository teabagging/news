The House has passed a similar bill, and President Bush has signaled he will sign whatever compromise is reached.   A1    Most provisions concern individuals, but changes in rules affecting companies may affect far more people.   C1    Soft-Money Ban Losing Appeal  Senate Democrats are growing wary about overhauling the campaign finance system because they raised more unlimited, unregulated donations than the Republicans did during the 2000 election cycle.   A1    President Bush issued a broad set of principles that he said would serve as his framework for assessing campaign finance legislation, including a partial ban on soft-money donations to political parties.   A14    Not All Heads Count the Same  The Census Bureau said it missed at least 6.4 million people in the 2000 count and counted at least 3.1 million people twice.

A12    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-10    City's 6% Growth Outpaced The Rest of the State  The population of New York City grew by 456,000 during the last decade, surging past 8 million for the first time and outpacing growth in its own suburbs and the state at large, census data showed. The rise was fueled by a decade of sustained immigration that was combined with several years of  prosperity.   A1    Most of the city's growth took place in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. Latinos now outnumber blacks in the city, and nearly one in 10 New Yorkers is Asian. Whites are just over one-third of the population.   A1    The census figures, which show a population shift toward New York City and away from upstate areas, bode well for Democrats and the city in the redrawing of Congressional and legislative district lines.

The plant is Nine Mile Point 2, in Scriba, on the shore of Lake Ontario, where the cost and construction are lurching at an uneven rate toward an uncertain conclusion.

It was for half a billion dollars, bringing the total $4.2 billion, or 11 times the original estimate. That means power the plant produces will cost nearly twice as much as power from other sources costs now.

Mr. Kennedy was with Channel 13 for many years, most recently the creator of Cabaret Thirteen, featuring a variety of singers performing selections and then discussing their careers and outlook. He was also featured in a TV tribute to Jack Paar, recalling the late host's remarkable personality and creative late show format of the '50s and 60's which still sets the style today. Joining NBC as a page in the mid-50's, Mr. Kennedy always had his heart in Manhattan. He was involved in buying rights to older movies for Corinthian Broadcasting, a network of CBS stations, anticipating TV's great demand for classic and run-of-the-mill cinema. Summers of watching movies in Maine gave him a competitive resource. He later helped develop Time Life Films, a division of Time Life, introducing BBC films to American TV audiences--series such as ''Civilization'' and Alistair Cooke's ''America.'' It was Mr. Kennedy's devotion to the theater that began with a childhood of watching Gilbert & Sullivan operettas and local theater in suburban Philadelphia and Maine Summer Theater. He was permanently hooked. A graduate of The Episcopal Academy, Merion Station, Pa., and Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, he was active in theater groups, and president of Bowdoin's Masque and Gown.
