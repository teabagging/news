It is true that Stengel often said it in monologue with those he called \\"my writers,\\" but it probably originates with James Thurber.   In 1941 Thurber published in The Saturday Evening Post a story titled \\"You Could Look It Up.\\" It dealt with a baseball manager who in the course of a tight game sent a midget up to the plate because his strike zone would be so small that the opposing pitcher couldn't help walking him. After the count had reached three balls and no strikes the pitcher, desperately trying to get the ball over the plate, threw such a fat pitch that the midget couldn't resist swinging at it. The ball dribbled a few feet, and the midget was thrown out. The story ended with the manager's setting a new record for throwing a midget.   Thurber's title refers to the fact that the narrator of the story alleges it all really happened and you could look it up, although he doesn't say where. Stengel was not the only baseball man who read the story, or at least heard of it. In 1951 Bill Veeck, the promotionally minded owner of the St. Louis Browns, hired a midget named Eddie Gaedel to take a turn at bat in a major-league game. Forewarned, Gaedel didn't swing and duly got his base on balls. In The Baseball Encyclopedia his record appears on one line: games, one","excerpt":"hits, none; bases on balls, one.

The number of wine drinkers was said to be doubling, and doubling again, and seers were predicting that by the end of the century America would rival some of the European wine-drinking countries in the amount of wine consumed.   It has not turned out that way. Nor is it now expected to, at least not in the next 15 years. And if it does, it will be because consumption in the traditional wine-drinking countries has fallen to our paltry level.

The originally scheduled director, Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, died. His replacement, the movie maker Werner Herzog, withdrew when it became apparent there would not be time to mount his ambitious version of Mozart's seriocomic tribute to the Enlightenment. What finally appeared on the stage on Thursday evening was basically the John Cox staging that originated at the Glyndebourne Festival 13 years ago and subsequently traveled to the San Francisco Opera. Was it reasonable to expect much magic from such a secondhand \\"Flute\\"?   Perhaps not, but pure, Kantian reason does not always call the tune in opera. Against expectations, this production, with its David Hockney designs, did what any good or even tolerable \\"Zauberflote\\" must: it created an atmosphere in which Mozart's opera could work on several of its many levels. On the first and most fundamental level, one heard uncommonly true and expressive singing, especially from Kathleen Battle as Pamina and Kurt Moll as Sarastro. There has not been a more affecting or more technically adroit account of Pamina's \\"Ach, ich fuhls\\" at the Metropolitan since Miss Battle last sang it there. Mr. Moll not only projected Sarastro's mystic nobility and humanity but also, more solidly and audibly than any basso profundo in years, the role's subterranean F's and F sharps of his two arias.
