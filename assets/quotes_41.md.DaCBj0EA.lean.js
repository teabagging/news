Krystyna Piorkowska has different memories of Avenue A. Ms. Piorkowska, 47, who has lived in the neighborhood for 22 years, laments the loss of beloved merchants like the kosher butcher, the cobbler and the pirogi maker, all of them driven out by the forces of gentrification. To her dismay, the old mom-and-pop stores have been supplanted by nightclubs and bars, businesses that can afford the avenue's pumped-up rents. In her view, Avenue A has become a place for unbridled carousing, where bar-hopping youths keep residents awake until dawn and where broken glass and the stench of urine greet early risers. \\"Avenue A has become the East Village theme park,\\" she said last week, standing amid a late-night crush of thrill-seekers. \\"It's now a place where you come to get drunk and see tattooed girls with spiked hair.\\"    NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LOWER EAST SIDE","excerpt":"New Life, New Gripes for Avenue A"},{"year":"1950","title":"Opening of smelter spurs mine reopenings, Cobalt, Ont SMELTER NEAR COBALT","excerpt":"New Life, New Industry Given to Canadian Mining Field"},{"year":"1956","title":"W Dover, Vt MT.

This offer of luxury cars at low rental rates, which will begin Sept. 1 from National Car Rental System Inc., Minneapolis, represents the auto-rental industry's latest marketing thrust. It is aimed at the vast number of travelers and vacationers who do not yet use auto rentals despite the substantial advertising that the industry pours into its competitive effort.    Although some 65 percent of all American adults have at some time taken an airplane, some surveys show, only about 13 percent have ever rented cars. The big gap between the two figures, in the view of Joseph F. Sullivan, National's vice president for marketing and advertising, ''leaves us lots of room to move.''

The famed Irish author will be lionized all year long in a series of special events, which includes issuing an important numismatic memento: a commemorative medal that will be put out by a prominent Dublin firm.\\n\\nThe medal, unveiled several weeks ago in New York, was designed and is being struck by Thomas Gear, a prestigious Dublin jeweler. It is not an official government issue, but it appears to enjoy quasiofficial status as the numismatic highlight of the observance.\\n\\nThough well known and highly respected as a jewelry designer, Mr.  Gear had fashioned only one previous medal: a 1979 issue marking the visit to Ireland of Pope John Paul II. Still, that one experience had whetted his creative appetite.

Kennedy's inaugural address.\\n\\nThe speech was widely regarded as one of the finest moments of his Presidency. A new medal has been issued to commemorate the occasion.\\n\\nThe medal holds unusual appeal for numismatists, since it carries a Kennedy portrait by sculptor Gilroy Roberts - the same man who designed the portrait of the President on the Kennedy half dollar. The 80-year-old artist was commissioned for the project by The Franklin Mint, a private mint in Franklin Center, Pa. Now retired, Mr. Roberts previously had served for more than 16 years as ninth chief sculptor-engraver of the United States Mint.

Iacocca, an assistant sculptorengraver at the Philadelphia Mint. Mr. Iacocca is suggesting that the Mint produce a series of medals honoring the 11 artists - 10 men and one woman - who have served as chief engravers since the start of U.S. coinage. Taking the proposal one step further, he already has designed two prospective medals for the series and is finishing work on a third.\\n\\nThe idea occurred to him some years ago, while he was working in a vault in Philadelphia where the hubs for Mint medals are stored.  There, in one location he saw the devices for the many historical medals that remain on permanent sale by the Mint -medals honoring U.S. presidents, military heroes and other important persons and events. The history of these medals parallels that of the Mint itself, and many of them were designed by the chief engravers.

He was born in Cincinnati in 1858, the eldest of six children. His family soon moved to Tennessee and his formal education was sketchy. However, he received a broad practical grounding in journalism at The Knoxville Chronicle where he started work as an office boy at age 11. The Chronicle, he said, was his ''high school and university.''\\n\\nIn 1877, while a teen-ager, he helped to establish The Chattanooga Dispatch. The following year, with a borrowed investment of $250, he acquired controlling interest in the faltering Chattanooga Times and built it into one of the leading newspapers in the South. By 1900, Mr. Ochs was able to buy controlling interest in The New York Times. He continued as publisher until his death in 1935. NUMISMATICS","excerpt":"NEW MEDAL WILL HONOR ADOLPH S.
