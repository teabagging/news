''And then we looked at each other and said, 'So now what do we do?' We didn't know where to start finding help.''   David became a resident at a drug- free center in Dutchess County, where he went to school in the mornings and, in the afternoons, underwent group therapy to wrestle with the problems that led him to drugs.

Both the Charlatans U.K. and Catherine Wheel, the two English bands that performed at the Academy on Thursday night, stand in shadows and play music that swirls around listeners' ears, while lights behind them flash and sometimes strobe. And neither band wants to admit that it's having any fun.    The Charlatans helped create a British psychedelic revival in the late 1980's, alongside fellow bands from Manchester, England, including Happy Mondays and Stone Roses. The Charlatans build their songs around the meaty tone of a Hammond organ, the instrument that drove bands like the Spencer Davis Group and early Deep Purple. Most songs are enfolded by the organ's burbling riffs and big, throbbing chords, although the band occasionally uses a guitar or a different electric keyboard to escape its own formula. Behind the riffs, drums pound out a choppy beat and Tim Burgess sings in a gentle, nasal voice.

Early in December, almost simultaneously with reports of 100-car pile-ups on superhighways because of ice and fog, heavy snow blanketed the mountains of Germany, Austria and Italy. Then France and Switzerland also reported enough snow to open the season early and to insure a good Christmas for skiers. After a series of indifferent winters, Alpine resorts are looking forward to a busy one.   The Suddeutscher Zeitung, published in Munich, reported in mid-December that almost all the Alpine ski areas had snow depths of 25 inches or more on slopes a mile high and between 15 and 25 inches on runs down into the valleys. Ski towns and hotels said that reservations were pouring in and many places were quickly sold out for Christmas. But a survey of some resorts turned up available rooms through the month of January and good chances of finding space in February and March.   Responding to inquiries, a skiing instructor in Lech, Austria, said, \\"12 to 38 inches and snowing heavily.\\" In Corvara in Badia, Italy: \\"We have enough to last until Easter\\" (12 to 48 inches), and in Zermatt, Switzerland: \\"30 inches on top and more snow predicted today.\\"    In the French Alps -- where many ski resorts were obliged to offer tennis, bicycling, hiking and other summer activities to winter vacationers last season -- snow started coming down in November and held to the slopes. Then came heavy snowfalls the second week of December that forced the temporary closure of some passes leading to resort areas and of the Mont Blanc Tunnel to Italy. High-altitude resorts like Val d'Isere and Tignes opened their slopes in November, earlier than scheduled, and places lower down, like Les Contamines, opened on weekends. Chamonix, at medium elevation, reported 45 inches of snow on its slopes. Most French resorts open officially this weekend.  Rome Gallery In First Show    An art gallery that opened this month in Rome's Palazzo Ruspoli, once a bank, is presenting an exhibition entitled \\"Expressionism: Masterpieces from the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection from van Gogh to Klee.\\" The exhibition, organized by the Memmo Foundation, part owner of the palace, contains 47 paintings representative of early 20th-century movements preceding Expressionism and associated with van Gogh, Chagall, Kirchner, Kandinsky and Schiele. It is the first of three exhibitions planned within a year at the Palazzo Ruspoli Art Gallery, which includes a conference room, cafeteria and gift shop.   The palace, about 100 yards from the Spanish Steps, is an attraction in itself. Built in the 16th century for the Florentine merchant and patron of the arts Orazio Rucellai, it houses frescoes by Jacopo Zucchi, a pupil of the Renaissance master Vasari.    The address is 418 Via del Corso (telephone, 6832177 or 6832179). The exhibition continues through the end of February","excerpt":"hours are 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. every day (until 11 P.M. on Saturdays). Admission is about $9. Brussels Copes With Growth    As the European Community moves toward integration as a single domestic market in 1992, work has begun on expansion projects designed to more than double the capacity of the Brussels National Airport Hotel Discounts In Three Cities    New York hotels and bargains may sound contradictory, but a discount service called Express Hotel Reservations says that on average it obtains rooms at 20 to 25 percent off regular rates at certain hotels in Manhattan as well as in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It says its leverage comes from volume and that its clients include many business travelers whose companies don't get corporate rates. Travelers are not charged for the service, and they do not have to join a club.    Express Hotel Reservations says it books about 50,000 rooms a year. Among the hotels are, in Manhattan, the Doral Court (39th Street and Lexington Avenue), the Warwick (54th Street and Avenue of the Americas) and New York Penta (32d Street and Seventh Avenue). In Los Angeles, they include the Midtown Hilton, the Ma Maison Sofitel and the Mondrian; in San Francisco, the Diva, Kensington Park and Parc Fifty-Five. The agency can be reached at (800) 356-1123 Monday to Friday from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. Eastern standard time.      Travelers bound for Disney World and other attractions in Florida at busy periods -- and that can be any time other than May and September to November -- can ask the Central Reservation Service to find them rooms. The service, a member of Orlando-Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau, operates around the clock and does not charge a fee. \\"Orlando fills up every holiday,\\" said Carlos Giraldo, the manager. \\"Demand outpaces supply, and travelers go through an ordeal trying to find a room. We can help.\\" The phone number is (800) 950-0232. Economy Class Gets New Name     Starting Jan. 15, British Airways won't have an economy class anymore. Instead, the section will have a new name -- two in fact. Economy will be called world traveler on long-haul routes, including trans-Atlantic, and Euro traveler on short-haul routes in Europe.   The change, the airline said, is the result of three years of market research resulting in improved catering, more comfortable seats, free newspapers and improved in-flight movies for the 13 million passengers who travel economy with British Airways every year.   In the cabin, world travelers will be greeted by a new blue and white decoration, designed to give a feeling of greater space, but the width and pitch of the seats will remain the same. Euro travelers will have improved service with free beverages. Tours: Horses, Wildlife, Food    A crossing of the Andes on horseback is offered by Southern Cross Expeditions. The trip is scheduled to begin from Mendoza, Argentina, on Feb. 9. Participants will ride across the Andes into Chile and back, making a 13-day loop amid glaciers, forests and Aconcagua, the highest peak of the Western Hemisphere. The price of $2,440 a person covers horses, tents, meals, guides and a two-night hotel stay in Buenos Aires but no air fares. (Southern Cross Expeditions, Post Office Box 1228, Bowling Green Station, New York, N.Y. 10274-1228;  [ 800 ]  359-0193.)     Changes in wildlife and plant and marine life that may have occurred in the Galapagos Islands as a result of the \\"greenhouse\\" global warning and the unusually strong El Nino current of 1983 will be studied on a 19-day trip next summer. In 1983, the El Nino current deluged the Galapagos with 103 inches of rain instead of the usual 3 inches. The tour will be led by Richard Hilton, an instructor in natural sciences at Sierra College, Rocklin, Calif. Participants will travel aboard a motor yacht with private cabins. The trip, scheduled for June 22 to July 10, costs $2,990, including accommodations and all meals on the yacht, lectures and a three-night hotel stay in Quito. Air fares to Ecuador and the islands are extra. (Nature Expeditions International, Post Office Box 11496, Eugene, Ore. 97440;  [ 800 ]  869-0639 or  [ 503 ]  484-6529.)     The cookbook author Eileen Yin-Fei Lo will escort a tour to Hong Kong for the colony's Food Festival. The eight-day tour starting March 11 costs $2,750 a person, including round-trip air fare from the West Coast ($200 more from the East Coast), rooms at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and most meals. Another tour leaving the same day offers one cooking class and provides rooms at the Kowloon Shangri-La Hotel. It is $2,495. (Orient Flexi-Pax Tours, 630 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017;  [ 212 ]  692-9550 or  [ 800 ]  545-5540 outside New York State.) VIEWING AREA IN HAWAII     The observation point at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, Hawaii's most popular tourist attraction, has reopened following a two-year renovation. The area, which offers a panoramic view of Honolulu, was redesigned to reduce traffic congestion and to provide a more tranquil setting.   Nearly 36,000 members of the military who died in World War II and the wars in Korea and Vietnam are buried in the cemetery.   The $2 million renovation, organized by the Veterans Administration, which maintains the cemetery, includes new parking areas for buses and cars, restrooms and enlarged viewing areas.   Memorial plaques donated by veterans groups will be placed along what was called Observation Drive but has been renamed Memorial Walk, now closed to traffic. The changes mean that passengers on buses have to walk up Memorial Walk from a new parking area, adding about 15 minutes to their visit.   In the year before the renovation began, more than 5.6 million people visited the cemetery. But even after the renovation, the area is still congested with traffic, especially tour buses. About 85 to 100 buses arrive each day along with stretch limousines and cars.   Officials of the cemetery and representatives of tour companies are engaged in discussions on easing congestion.   The cemetery is in the crater -- known as the Punchbowl -- of an extinct volcano.
