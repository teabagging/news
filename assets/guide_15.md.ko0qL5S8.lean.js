says diatremes are packed with material that has been found to come from depths as great as 125 miles; repts that dating of these diatremes has shown that they erupted some 30-million yrs ago when N America is thought to have begun pulling away from Eur, moving westward over earth's deep interior; says evidence has been found that African diatremes erupted when S Africa began moving relatively fast, some 120-million yrs ago; says only diamond pipe of any consequence discovered in N America has been at Murfreesboro, Ark, which now serves as tourist attraction; holds new theory of diamond eruption has been developed largely by Dr T R McGetchin and his students at MIT; says after number of yrs of studying Arizona-Utah diatremes, McGetchin likens their eruption to rocket 'stuffed into the ground upside down'; says he believes driving force is combination of gases in their fluid phase under extremely high pressure in region below earth's crust known as upper mantle; says McGetchin's theory is that material began fighting its way upward at relatively modest speed but that as it neared surface, water and other liquified gases turned to vapor and began to drive eruption at great velocity; notes diatremes are also of great scientific interest since they are derived from succession of depths well down into upper mantle; says Dr F R Boyd points out that chem composition of garnets from diamond pipes could be used to determine depths and pressure at which they were found so long as garnets contain 2 forms of pyroxene; says tech has been used to show that S African samples were formed 90 miles down at temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit while those formed as deep as 125 miles were at more than 2,500 degrees; says McGetchin has found that temperature of 1,750 degrees was relatively uniform from 30 miles down to 125 miles at Moses Rock Dide, Utah; notes Boyd points out that garnets from bottom 25 miles of sequence in African pipes are almost all badly sheared while those from shallower depths are not; says Boyd postulates that shearing occurred in bottom layer of rigid plate as Africa began to move and that heat generated by process could have caused eruptions;

there are nearly 50 such deputies; 10 yrs ago, under Defense Sec Robert S McNamara, only 3 flag‐rank mil officers held civilian rank of Deputy Asst Sec; 25 yrs ago, no mil officers held such policy‐making jobs in Office of Defense Sec; Pentagon civilian officials and long‐time Cong observers of evolution of Office of Sec of Defense feel trend raises questions of whether basic legis principle of civilian control over mil, exercised through Defense Sec's office, is being undermined and whether, in process, mil is being progressively ‘politicized’ by encouraging officers to serve in what are essentially policy‐making civilian jobs; common explanation is that mil is moving into gap created by difficulties in recruiting civilians to serve in $36,000‐a‐yr posts as Deputy Asst DSecs; in some areas, such as in manpower policy, mil officers serving in dept exercise more authority than civilian Secs of individual services; ostensibly the gens and adms serving in dept are responsible to Pres‐apptd civilians serving as Asst Secs but with steady turnover of civilian Asst Secs, who normally take 1 yr just to learn their jobs, their deputies tend to acquire considerable influence and authority;
