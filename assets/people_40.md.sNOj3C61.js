A1    Germany Aided U.S. in Iraq War  Two German intelligence agents in Baghdad obtained a copy of Saddam Hussein's plan to defend the Iraqi capital, which a German official passed on to American commanders a month before the invasion.   A1    Prisoners Riot in Afghan Jail  Up to 5 prisoners were killed and 31 wounded when the inmates in Afghanistan's main high-security prison, among them people accused of being members of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, rioted and seized control of one cellblock.   A5    Genocide Probe in Mexico  A secret report prepared by a special prosecutor's office says the Mexican military carried out a ''genocide plan'' of kidnapping, torturing and killing hundreds of suspected subversives in the southern state of Guerrero during the so-called dirty war, from the late 1960's to the early 1980's.

A1    Labor Leaders Gather  The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s leaders will gather in San Diego and will once again be on the defensive, a situation made worse by the split the labor federation suffered last year.

Milken was born on the Fourth of July in 1946 and grew up in Encino, Calif. As a boy, he helped his father, and accountant, prepare tax returns.   Mr. Milken graduated from the University of California at Berkeley, majoring in business administration, and married Lori Anne Hackel, his high school sweetheart.   He received a master's in business administration from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. In a study there, he concluded that a diversified portfolio of bonds rated below investment grade, now known as \\"junk bonds,\\" generally is a good investment because the high interest rates paid more than offset losses from defaults. CAREER   Mr. Milken was hired full time by the bond-trading department of Drexel Burenham Lambert in 1970, after working in its Philadelphia office during business school. He generatged a substantial amount of Drexel's profits by trading high-yield bonds.   In 1978, the firm allowed Mr. Milken to move the high-yield bond department to Beverly Hills, Calif. Drexel used junk bonds to finance hundreds of small companies in the 1980's, reaping hundreds of millions of dollars in fees. Junk bonds later were used to finance a wave of corporate takeovers.   Mr. Milken used some of his earnings to start charitable foundations that he and his brother, Lowell, also a Drexel employee, endowed with hundred of millions of dollars. CHARGES   In late 1986, after being linked to an illegal stocktrading network, Mr. Milken and Drexel became the main targets of the Government's investigation of insider trading. In 1988, they were charged with civil fraud and other allegations by theSecurities and Exchange Commission, and Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $650 million.   Mr. Milken, his brother and Bruce Newberg, a former Drexel trader, were indicted in March 1989 on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering related to insider trading and other alleged securities violations. Mr. Milken vowed to fight the charges. He resigned from Drexel in June 1989 and set up a consulting and investing firm. PLEA AND SENTENCING   In a reversal, Mr. Milken agreed in April to a plea bargain. In exchange, the Government agreed to drop all charges against his brother, Lowell.   On April 24, Mr. Milken entered guilty pleas to six felonies and agreed to poay $600 million in penalties. Specifically, Mr. Milken pleaded guilty to conspiracy","excerpt":"securities fraud, defrauding a mutual fund; assisting Ivan F.

I am truly sorry,\\" he said then.   Sentencing by Federal District Judge Kimba M. Wood was postponed to allow for a hearing on Government allegations of crimes Mr. Milken did not admit.   Yesterday, Mr. Milken was sentenced to 10 years in prison, 3 years of probation and 5,400 hours of community service.
