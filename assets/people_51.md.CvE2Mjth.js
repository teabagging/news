THE KING AND I (1956)  Friday at 8 p.m. on Fox Movie Channel  ''Hello, Young Lovers,'' ''Getting to Know You,'' ''I Whistle a Happy Tune'' and ''Shall We Dance?'' are the best-known Rodgers and Hammerstein songs from this classic romantic musical, directed by Walter Lang. Deborah Kerr stars as Anna Leonowens, a 19th-century American widow who moves with her son to what is now Thailand to become a live-in governess to the many children of the King of Siam (Yul Brynner, above, with Ms. Kerr). The king is a tyrant and a liar, but he sincerely wants to give his people better lives, maybe by learning from the Western world. He becomes Anna's best student. The film won five Oscars, including Brynner's for best actor.

This was Oliver's Reed's last screen appearance. He plays Proximo, a former gladiator who now coaches. The film, directed by Ridley Scott, falls far short of greatness, but it's quite a spectacle.
