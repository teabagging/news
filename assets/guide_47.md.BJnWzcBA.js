The ruling, issued Friday by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, is the first by a Federal appellate court on whether the Government may test its employees who are suspected of off-duty drug use that does not affect job performance.   In another case involving White House employees, the panel ruled thatGovernment officials with access to \\"secret\\" information may be subject to random drug testing along with officials who have the higher clearance of \\"top secret.\\"  Suspected Drug Use     In the Agriculture Department case, the three judges struck down regulations under which employees of the department's Food and Nutrition Service could be tested if they were suspected of off-duty drug use, even if that use did not impair job performance.   The ruling, which partly reversed a lower court's opinion, also struck down a part of the regulations that alloweddepartment officials to monitor employees while they provided urine samples, without any suspicion that a worker might tamper with the specimen before it was tested. The court called this an invasion of privacy.   \\"Because U.S.D.A. regulations authorize urinalysis testing of ordinary employees who are not suspected of on-duty drug use or impairment,\\" the court said, \\"and because those regulations mandate needlessly intrusive testing procedures, we find them unconstitutional.\\"    Although the ruling dealt with only one agency of one department, it has implications throughout the Government because most Federal agencies have adopted similar drug-testing programs, said Elaine Kaplan, a lawyer for the National Treasury Employees Union, which brought the case.  Wider Implications     The ruling means that \\"in order to drug-test the vast majority of Federal employees, the Government has to have individualized suspicion of on-duty drug use or on-duty impairment caused by drug use,\\" Ms. Kaplan said. \\"This is a significant limit on what they were trying to do.\\"   The decision was written by Judge Abner J. Mikva, who was joined by Judges Laurence H. Silberman and Harry T. Edwards. Judges Mikva and Edwards were nominated to the bench by President Jimmy Carter","excerpt":"Judge Silberman was appointed by President Ronald Reagan. The ruling said that the Government \\"has not produced evidence that might establish a relationship between off-the-job drug use and Government efficiency or on general integrity and deterrence rationales.\\"   \\"The Government may investigate and punish wrongdoing within the walls of its offices,\\" Judge Mikva wrote. \\"What the Government may not do in the case of ordinary employees is justify drug testing procedures that intrude upon constitutionally protected privacy interests with speculation about possible future job impairment or rules violations.\\"   In the same opinion, the court upheld the random testing of the Agriculture Department's drivers, on the ground that their drug use might endangerpublic safety.    In the White House case, the same panel upheld by 2 to 1 a policy of randomly testing employees of the Executive Office of the President who hold \\"secret\\" security clearances. The courts had previously upheld random drug tests of employees with \\"top secret\\" clearances.    Judge Edwards dissented from this decision, saying that \\"this case is not the first Fourth Amendment casualty claimed by the war on drugs; nor, in all likelihood, will it be the last.\\"   He added, \\"I fear today's decision finds us unwilling to do what we must to preserve fundamental Fourth Amendment freedoms.\\" Court Rejects Some Drug Testing of U.S. Workers"},{"year":"2006","title":"Second trial of former Enron chief Kenneth Lay, on charges of fraud and lying to banks, ends","excerpt":"Judge Simeon Lake, who is presiding over both cases, says he will announce decision after jury, in its fourth day of deliberations, rules in first case (M) Lay's Second Trial Ends;

Wigs and robes are mandatory dress in virtually all British courts above the lowest level.

More troubling, a courtroom filled with people who look like they just stepped out of a period costume drama can have an intimidating effect on other participants, including witnesses, juries and defendants.    Traditionalists scoff, arguing that wigs and robes provide a measure of dignity and grace and, not incidentally, anonymity (useful to judges and lawyers who worry that a vengeful defendant might find them too easy to recognize).   Over the last six months, lawyers, public interest groups and ordinary citizens have been offering their thoughts on the question, which the Lord Chancellor's office will use to frame a formal recommendation on whether to amend the rules and traditions governing court dress.

In Haydn's Quartet in D minor (Op. 76, No. 2), this flexibility was most telling in the Menuetto. After a robust opening Allegro and a light-textured, graceful Andante, the players took the decidedly uncourtly scoring of the Menuetto at face value and played it with a rustic grittiness.

That piece intensified the drama of his staple forms: not only the ambiguously unbalanced figure whose skewed beamlike limbs seemed to signal human catastrophe, but also the abbreviated geometric house shape, which for this occasion was presented precariously on edge. In that work, Mr. Shapiro depicted a world being blown apart with a clarity of form and meaning that can be the mark of a successful -- which is to say, accessible -- public monument.

The best dollar values, it seems, are concentrated among lowerpriced models, many of them employing belt-drive. Given the condition of our currency, it seems remarkable that such well-made machines, involving numerous precision parts, can still be offered at list prices between $100 and $150. As a group, turntables in this class have attained a musically satisfactory level of performance without the sophisticated refinements found in more expensive designs, and the tonearms furnished with these low-cost designs are capable of tracking at low stylus pressures (1.5 grams or less), thereby minimizing record wear.

If you did not know that Ms. Linhares was included in the landmark ''Bad Painting'' exhibition at the New Museum in 1978, you could initially mistake her for a follower of the young expressionist painter Dana Schutz. Knowing her history, you might conclude that Ms. Linhares has been an unacknowledged inspiration for many of today's younger artists. Regardless of which way the generational influences have flowed, Ms. Linhares certainly has tapped into her own rambunctious and starry-eyed inner child to wonderfully infectious effect.

It took Miss Straeten a year of experimentation before she was satisfied with the extraordinarily slender, fan-like mushroom pleating she was achieving with sheer silk, a close relation of the fabric that made Mariano Fortuny's dresses a collector's item and the name a legend in fashion. She dyes whisper-light silk in scores of colors, or to match (one woman wanted a dress the shade of her pale blue eyes, another something to match her emeralds). She makes the dresses herself, all of them based on original Fortuny patterns. Each dress -- some slim columns, with and without sleeves, others fashioned in a long tunic effect -- takes a minimum of five yards of fabric, has three panels and requires 40 to 60 hours of work from the dying and pleating process to the finished dress.

Her nearly vibratoless singing is especially well suited to contemplative ballads that take a long view of life. From her first big hit, Joni Mitchell's \\"Both Sides Now,\\" to her coolly wistful rendition of \\"Send In the Clowns,\\" the song with which she closed her Avery Fisher Hall concert on Friday evening, Ms.  Collins has made the exquisite distillation of memory the central theme of both her singing and her songwriting.    That theme was accentuated at the concert on Friday by the singer's two performances of her recent song \\"The Blizzard,\\" once at the beginning of the show and again in a reprise near the end. Like such earlier Collins songs as \\"Houses\\" and \\"Secret Gardens,\\" \\"The Blizzard\\" finds the balance between a folkish ease and a classical formality. Set in Colorado many years ago, the semi-autobiographical lyric describes an experience of spiritual and romantic rebirth, while its cascading piano blends a Debussian impressionism with American folk.

Although this year's concert, which was held at Carnegie Hall on Friday evening, held many pleasures, Ms. Collins's voice showed ominous signs of wear and tear. The singer was at her best accompanying herself on the piano and performing original ballads whose folk-flavored melodies were enriched by flowing semiclassical pianism.   The most impassioned performance was \\"The Blizzard,\\" a relatively recent original ballad about spiritual transformation set in the Rocky Mountains during a snowstorm. Ms. Collins's renditions of Stephen Sondheim's \\"I Remember Sky\\" and \\"Send In the Clowns\\" and of the Leonard Cohen and Jennifer Warnes ballad, \\"Song of Bernadette,\\" were also clear and ringing.
