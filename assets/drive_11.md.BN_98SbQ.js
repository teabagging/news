Are there any insurance companies willing to cover such a property? . . . Victor Brown, Manhattan. A \\"Absolutely,\\" said Robert E. Mackoul, president of Mackoul & Associates, an insurance agency in Lynbrook, L.I. \\"But you've got to be ready to pay the premium that's going to be involved.\\"   Generally, Mr. Mackoul said, insurance premiums are determined by the amount of insurance sought and the degree of risk involved. Difficulties in obtaining insurance arise when the risk is considered unacceptable.   And while it is not uncommon for some insurance companies to decline to insure properties they consider an unacceptable risk, there are usually other companies prepared to accept even significant risks -- for the right premium.   \\"There are probably insurance agents in the neighborhood who are familiar with the area and the buildings and who can find at least basic coverage,\\" Mr. Mackoul said.   In the event no agent can be found who will provide coverage, there is an \\"insurer of last resort.\\"   The New York Property Insurance Underwriting Association, a not-for-profit organization, was created by the New York State Legislature in 1968 to provide a residual market for personal and commercial property insurance.   The association provides basic property insurance for fire, vandalism, malicious mischief, sprinkler leakage, loss of rent and business interruption. The association does not provide liability coverage for personal injury. Rates are usually higher than standard market rates.   Applications for insurance through the association can be obtained at most insurance agents' offices or at the association's office at 100 William Street in Manhattan. Applicants should attempt to place coverage with three different companies before submitting an application. Information: (212) 208-9700.   New Jersey and Connecticut have similar organizations that provide coverage when it is not available elsewhere. Both are called FAIR Plans.

Different Methods Of Appraisal Q In appraising real estate, what is the difference between appraising by capitalization, comparison and summation? Which is best for residential property? . . . Chieko Katagiri, Congers, N.Y. A Neil Cherkosly, president of Upstate Appraisal Services, an appraisal company in Albany, said that there are three standard approaches for appraising real estate: cost, sales comparison, and income capitalization. Summation is not an appraisal method.   An appraiser using the cost approach to determine the value of a property would calculate the construction cost of the building -- at current construction rates -- and then add to that figure the current value of the land and other improvements.   \\"In today's market,\\" Mr. Cherkosly said, \\"an appraisal made using the cost approach often exceeds the resale value of a particular property.\\"   In the sales comparison approach, he said, the appraiser calculates the value of a property by comparing it to substantially similar properties that were either recently sold or are currently listed for sale. Adjustments are then made to account for any dissimilarities that may exist between the properties being compared.   The income capitalization approach, Mr. Cherkosly said, is typically used to appraise commercial property being purchased for investment purposes. With that approach, he said, the value of a property is essentially determined by the property's ability to generate income.   The term \\"summation,\\" he said, is not used to describe a single method of valuation, but describes a reconciliation of the differences between two or more valuation approaches to arrive at a final estimate of value.   For owner-occupied residential property, Mr. Cherkosly said, the sales comparison approach is the most reliable indicator of value.

No Sale\\" (The Editorial Notebook, Nov. 25), David C. Anderson identifies me and William F. Buckley Jr. among a growing number of \\"responsible people\\" who advocate \\"legalizing\\" drugs. He goes on to say the critical question is \\"How would legal drug distribution work?\\" He ends: \\"Those who think it can work have a responsibility to explain how.\\" He is almost right.   What unites those who oppose the current approach is not our belief in a particular form of legalized access to drugs, but our opposition to using the criminal law as the primary instrument for controlling the harmful effects drug use can have.   The use of the criminal law to reduce demand in the United States causes more harm than it prevents. It has led to increased homicides, particularly of bystanders. Children are being shot down in the streets and in their beds because they get in the way of drug dealers settling commercial disputes with automatic weapons.   Attempts to interdict foreign supplies often result in introducing more potent and more dangerous drugs, and enrich criminal cartels. The supply cannot be eradicated. We make things worse when we try.   Drug prohibition enriches criminals and creates an artificially inflated price that lures young people into the drug trade. Drug dealing is the major economic opportunity this country provides ghetto youth. How do we tell kids with no realistic economic opportunity, \\"just say no\\" to $300 or more a day? The money, not the drug, attracts many ambitious young people into a life of violence.   Drug prohibition has led to bans on the medical use of marijuana (for glaucoma, multiple sclerosis and the side effects of chemotherapy), even though the benefits are documented and the dangers nonexistent.   Drug prohibition also leads to bans on the distribution of clean needles to intravenous drug users. In the Netherlands, where clean needles are distributed by the Government, only 9 percent of intravenous drug users carry the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. In Liverpool, England, where medical clinics provide injectable drugs, the proportion of intravenous drug users with the AIDS virus is less than 1 percent. In the United States, it's 26 percent","excerpt":"in New York, more than 60 percent. Most of these are black or Hispanic. Our policy is racially genocidal.   Drug prohibition has inspired a Federal law that prohibits Medicaid reimbursement for treating pregnant women who use cocaine. When those women are turned away by hospitals and their babies are born drug positive, we try to imprison them.   Our criminal justice system is in permanent crisis, flooded with 1.2 million drug arrests a year. More than one-third involve marijuana, nearly 85 percent for mere possession. Trial courts are overwhelmed, prisons are bursting, and more young black men are in jail than in college.   Civil liberties are eroded. Urine testing of innocent employees is rampant; airport searches based on vague \\"drug-courier profiles\\" are increasing; homes are seized for a few marijuana plants cultivated for personal use. We have created a drug exception to the Constitution.   Drug prohibition aggravates, rather than ameliorates, the national drug problem. But when we try to discuss alternatives, official policy makers declare such discussion out of bounds. William Bennett refused to discuss or consider any approach that did not include criminal prohibition. In New York, Mayor David N. Dinkins instructed his study group on abuse not to entertain any legalization proposals. The California attorney general refused to publish the recommendations of his advisory panel to decriminalize drugs.   I have a very modest proposal:   (1) Repeal the Federal law that prohibits Medicaid from reimbursing  hospitals that provide drug treatment for pregnant women.   (2) Legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes.   (3) Stop enforcing the criminal laws against marijuana users.   (4) Repeal bans on providing intravenous drug users clean needles.   (5) Reverse Federal funding priorities, so that 70 percent of Federal funds are spent on treatment, education, prevention and research instead of law enforcement.   (6) Appoint a balanced, blue-ribbon national commission to study ways to regulate legal use and sale of drugs.   With few exceptions, no politician -- Federal, state or local -- would support these modest steps. Where are the politicians and editorialists with courage to advocate alternatives? How many more people have to suffer and die?

At the same time, the director's natural theatricality repeatedly asserts itself and, in several important instances, actors add their own inspired comic touches.   The four lovers have seldom seemed more youthfully vibrant, drawn, as they are, by mutual sexual attraction that, in this interpretation, can even seem to override their generally accepted motivations. When Demetrius is pursued by Helena, he usually is able to hold her at arm's distance, and he clearly shows his disdain. Mr. Ciulei asks, might not Demetrius - against his better judgment - find it difficult to withstand Helena's passionate regard for him? Perhaps, he thinks, Helena is worth a dalliance.

If the intention of the British Government is peace and a settlement of the conflict, then the partition of Ireland, and Britain's control of that part of the country, must be part of the agenda.

In the July 1932 election they became the strongest party, with 37 percent of the total","excerpt":"in November of that year they suffered a setback and declined to 33 percent. In the last almost free elections, in March 1933, they consolidated their lead to almost 44 percent. Thus a majority of Germans, strictly speaking, never voted for Hitler. But a great many did, and the question of who supported him has preoccupied historians and political scientists ever since. It is more than a mere academic problem, and there is no consensus to this day.   Richard Hamilton's massive study is an important contribution to the understanding of the Nazi phenomenon, but it is also an exasperating book. It starts by asking the right questions, and it reaches what I believe are some of the right answers. But in his circuitous journey, the author frequently gets lost in the byways of sociology, the statistical study of elections known as psephology and German social history.

Otherwise, however, Miss Garbo gives a thoroughly dignified, sincere and sympathetic portrayal. As Cavallini she even undertakes to exchange a few words in Italian with a passing organ grinder, and they are moderately well spoken, but seldom during the length of this current offering does she convey the impression of being anything but a Scandinavian.In this picture a singer is heard rendering \\"The Last Rose of Summer,\\" and again one regrets that the producers did not engage a contralto instead of a soprano, for it is quite obvious that Miss Garbo could not have done the singing.This much having been written on that phase of the subject, it is only meet to set forth that the picture has been ably directed and magnificently photographed. Lewis Stone gives an intelligent and convincing interpretation of the part of Cornelius Van Tuyl, a rôle which was acted in a stage revival of the play in 1921 by A. E. Anson, and Gavin Gordon rises to the occasion as Thomas Armstrong, the love-smitten rector of the main story and as the aged Bishop in the introductory and final scenes.It is a picture with a wealth of charm. It reflects the mood of the play most pleasingly. The story glides along easily and no matter what may be said regarding the quality of Miss Garbo's voice, she speaks her lines naturally and with a full appreciation of the sensitiveness of the romance.The picture opens with Harry, nicely acted by Elliott Nugent, announcing to the elderly Bishop that he is going to marry an actress. It is then that the prelate harks back to the romance of his own youth, saying as he does so that he is once again only 28. Gradually the two figures vanish from the screen and likewise the old man's voice becomes less and less distinct, until it is lost to the ear and there comes to the screen the story he is telling Harry. So, one goes from the glistening high-powered automobiles to horse-drawn vehicles of the dim and distant past, to the old-fashioned gowns, Watteau hats and the brown-stone front dwellings of Manhattan's bygone days. It is another New Year's Eve, with snow flying and inside Cornelius Van Tuyl's home a dance is being held. One of the guests expresses his indignation that Van Tuyl should have dared to invite the notorious Cavallini to the gathering. This guest airs his opinion of Van Tuyl and Cavallini to Thomas Armstrong, the young rector, who rebukes the man as a scandal-monger and a gossiping old woman.When Armstrong first sets eyes upon the alluring Cavallini he is quite unaware that she is the singer, whom rumor has it is Van Tuyl's mistress. Even before they speak to each other Cavallini and the rector have fallen in love. Soon he discovers that the fascinating woman is Cavallini, and he is all the more infatuated by knowing that this lovely creature is the owner of such a glorious voice. How he reconciles the low quality of Cavallini's speaking voice to the bell-like tones that issue from the distance in the ballroom is not explained. He is, however, young and in love. There are other matters that escape him, which might possibly escape any young parson of those blissfully innocent days.Cavallini and Armstrong, an ecstatic pair, go sleigh riding and tobogganing and, a few days later, the rector and the singer declare their love for each other. He wants her to let him know when she will become his wife, and it is then that Cavallini confesses to him past heart affairs. Subsequently, the rector is further disillusioned regarding the singer, by hearing of her relations with Van Tuyl.Clarence Brown has in most instances given to this picture a pleasing restraint and the opening and closing scenes of the present day are cleverly conceived. And while one may find Miss Garbo's intonation not a little disappointing, her appearance and grace are bound to elicit admiration.

This picture was presented for the first time at the Rialto Theatre soon after midnight yesterday morning before a brilliant gathering that demonstrated its keen appreciation of Miss Gray's personal appearance in one of her exhibitions of a South Seas dance and also of her charming performance in the shadow entertainment.John B. Hymer and LeRoy Clemens wrote the original play, which was far from being a masterpiece. The picture holds up its end in comparison with the footlights version, but that is about all. Considering the supporting cast, the players might have been more aptly chosen. Percy Marmont, for instance, fills the rôle of Bob Holden, a young man who has been cheated in love. There is a turbulent scene in which Holden and Red Malloy come to blows, and, what is not Unusual in photoplays, the weaker man of the two, after being pounded until one expects him to be unconscious for quite some time, pulls himself together and delivers a knock-out punch to his antagonist.Julanne Johnston, who achieved much distinction through her performance in \\"The Thief of Bagdad,\\" appears as Sylvia, the beautiful American girl, who, through no fault of her own, is responsible for Holden's temporary downfall. When Sylvia comes ashore at the South Sea island she wears filmy chiffon and flowing frills, a costume suitable for the afternoon in New York but quite out of place in a sun-scorched island where the people are perpetually fanning themselves. It would have been a relief if Sylvia had appeared even in one sequence garbed in a neat white suit.The tinting of the scenes causes one to be projected from a pink morning to a sepia afternoon and then back to the ordinary photographic black and white daylight. In some instances no time elapses between an abrupt change in the tinting, which except for the sepia tones, is so conspicuous that it seems rather like painting the lily.Aloma (Miss Gray) is a nimble little person. She falls in love with Holden, and with the aid of the captions, she is quite a whimsical character. Although a Pagan she prays to the white man's God to save Holden from being killed by sharks. She even promises on her knees that she will not marry the white man if he is only spared. Then there is Nuitane, impersonated by Warner Baxter, who is much too fond of smiling in tragic moments and also of sinking boats to have his white enemies and rivals eaten by sharks.Most of the exteriors for this production were made in Porto Rico, and not only are they of great beauty but they have been most effectively photographed, the director having taken into consideration the propinquity of the trees to the camera","excerpt":"in one \\"shot\\" the view is flanked by tropical trees and foliage.Harry T. Morey gives an intelligent performance as Red Malloy, and William Powell is effective as the rascal Van Templeton. While Mr. Marmont is a sincere actor he does not appear to be as powerful a man as one might anticipate in the role of Holden—that is if he has to thrash men as big as Mr. Morey. Maurice Tourneur, who directed this film, has not elicited much in the way of sound acting from Miss Johnston, who appears to stand in corners in a daze or look in front of her—in close-ups—wonderingly.Granted that Miss Gray's energy and grace help this picture, stories of this ilk need potential dramatic quality to hold the interest of intelligent audiences.

She was in Chris Terrio's little ensemble drama, ''Heights,'' this summer as a major actress in the midst of a marital crisis. She is the barely-keeping-it-together mother of a teenager who committed suicide in Ari Posin's satire, ''Chumscrubber,'' which is playing around the country but has yet to open in New York. And on Friday she'll be seen in Rodrigo García's ''Nine Lives,'' a series of vignettes that examine defining moments for each of nine women in real time -- no cuts. Ms. Close's character, Maggie, is visiting a cemetery with her young daughter, played by Dakota Fanning","excerpt":"in other scenes, a woman runs into an old love (Robin Wright Penn), arranges a tryst (Sissy Spacek), confronts her stepfather (Lisa Gay Hamilton). Mr. García, who in 2000 directed Ms. Close in ''Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her,'' said he wrote ''Nine Lives'' to explore ''the joined-at-the-hip quality'' of certain relationships. Ms. Close, 58, knows something about that. In recent years, she has tailored her career to fit the needs of her daughter, Annie, 17. ''Kids want you there,'' she says. ''There'' for the two of them is either an apartment in New York or a place in the country. Late last month, wearing low-slung jeans, a black blazer and a white top that allowed an occasional flash of skin, Ms. Close met with Sylviane Gold to discuss life in the indies.    SYLVIANE GOLD -- What's in it for you? You don't need to do small independent movies -- --    GLENN CLOSE -- Certainly not for the money!    Q. Or at this point for stretching -- --    A. No, stretching's good. I thought the character in ''Heights'' was very different from what I've played before. And I loved the script. It all begins for me on the page -- what you read. Then you meet the director. And both Rodrigo García and Ari Posin were people that I thought: ''You know what? I think it's going to be a good ride.'' People start coming on board, you know? And you get a really good group of actors to work with. So it's fun. And because they don't have a huge budget, you're not away from home for weeks on end. And I love being around young, talented people. Makes it worthwhile to pry yourself out of your house.    Q. Is getting out the hardest thing you do every day?    A. When I'm in New York, it's hard to leave your apartment. It's not like I'm agoraphobic, but I love puttering around. Both me and my daughter -- we're very much homebodies.    Q. Yet you schlep out to make these small movies.    A. Can't help myself. I get intrigued. It's what I do. No matter how much I say I don't know how much I want to do it anymore, it is what I do, and there's great satisfaction in that. Many times I feel like there is no choice but to do it -- I'd much rather lend my presence to something that will support an emerging talent than to do something that's, you know, the same old -- --    Q. ''Star Wars''?    A. Well, I wouldn't mind being in ''Star Wars.'' Fabulous costumes!    Q. Even without ''Star Wars,'' you've had the kind of career actresses aren't supposed to have: steady work for 30 years. What's the secret?    A. I've never taken anything -- and this is the absolute truth -- because of the money. I've always tried to be true to my own, specific, personal reactions. Sometimes I've been wrong, and it's been more painful than challenging. But there are so many pressures in this profession -- to make money, to be famous, to look a certain way, to dress a certain way -- that if you start really listening to that, you lose what's unique about you. And I have this rule: If you read something that's almost good, and someone says, ''We're gonna fix it'' -- no, no, no, no. You have to read on the page something that you think, ''This is good.'' And then I always think you can risk either a director or an actor. But not both. If you have a director you're not sure of, you'd better have a great D.P. [director of photography] and wonderful actors around you. If you have an actor you're not sure of, have a wonderful director. A good D.P. you should have all the time.    Q. Isn't it harder working with first-time directors?    A. There are ways to put them at ease, to let them know that you're not going to come with your own agenda, that you're there to serve their vision -- and if they're having a hard time articulating something, that it's O.K., that you're not going to get impatient. A first-time director with a first-time actor can be very problematic. But if it's a first-time director with seasoned actors -- which both ''Chumscrubber'' and ''Heights'' were -- it can be as good an experience as anything. And there's something very exciting about it, because it's the first time this particular person has had a chance to put their vision on film.    Q. You sound so nurturing, like the perfect mom.    A. Ooooh. Well, you'd better ask my daughter about that.

Please explain how the ''infrared wireless earphone'' I rented recently at a play in New York works.   A. According to officers of Sound Associates, which has just installed such a system in the Metropolitan Opera House, infrared wireless works much like FM radio, except that the radiation is in a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Audio frequencies picked up by microphones are used to modulate an electronic FM signal, which in turn is used to modulate infrared light","excerpt":"in other words, the actual information in the signal is contained in variations of its basic frequency. The signal is ''broadcast'' through the house from batteries of 100 or so light-emitting diodes whose light is invisible to the human eye (each battery contains one small red light so the engineers can tell by looking whether it is turned on). A detector on the earphone mechanism picks up the signal, which is decoded to audio frequencies and passed to a pair of earphones. The detector need not even be in line of sight from the diode batteries, since it is sensitive enough to respond to infrared light reflected from the walls. The advantage of infrared over radio systems, which might carry the sound equally well, is that infrared radiation will not pass through walls; the signal is entirely confined to the theater in which it is broadcast, so there can never be interference with (or from) neighboring houses.

Yokum Hokum"},{"year":"2006","title":"Following is the transcript of President Bush's news conference from the White House, as provided by CQ Transcriptions, Inc.BUSH: Thank you. (LAUGHTER) It's always a pleasure to be introduced into the Rose Garden. Thank you, Wendell. Thank you for coming. Looking forward to answering some of your questions. This week our nation paused to mark the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. It was a tough day for a lot of our citizens. I was so honored to meet with family members and first responders, workers at the Pentagon, all who still had heaviness in their heart. But they asked me a question. They kept asking me, What do you think the level of determination for this country is in order to protect ourselves? That's what they wanted to know. You know, for me, it was a reminder about how I felt right after 9/11. I felt a sense of determination and conviction about doing everything that is necessary to project the people. I'm going to go back to New York to address the United Nations General Assembly. And I'll talk to all leaders gathered there about our obligation to defend civilization and liberty, to support the forces of freedom and moderation throughout the Middle East. As we work with the international community to defeat the terrorists and extremists, to provide an alternative to their hateful ideology, we must also provide our military and intelligence professionals with the tools they need to protect our country from another attack. And the reason they need those tools is because the enemy wants to attack us again. Right here in the Oval Office, I get briefed nearly every morning about the nature of this world. And I get briefed about the desire of an enemy to hurt America. And it's a sobering experience, as I'm sure you can imagine. I wish that weren't the case, you know, but it is the case. And therefore, I believe that it's vital that our folks on the front line have the tools necessary to protect the American people. There are two vital pieces of legislation in Congress now that I think are necessary to help us win the war on terror. We will work with members of both parties to get legislation that works out of the Congress. The first bill will allow us to use military commissions to try suspected terrorists for war crimes. We need the legislation because the Supreme Court recently ruled that military commissions must be explicitly authorized by Congress. So we're working with Congress. The Supreme Court said, You must work with Congress, we are working with Congress to get a good piece of legislation out. The bill I have proposed will ensure that suspected terrorists will receive full and fair trials without revealing to them our nation's sensitive intelligence secrets. As soon as Congress acts on this bill, the men our intelligence believed helped orchestrate the 9/11 attacks can face justice. The bill would also provide clear rules for our personnel involved in detaining and questioning captured terrorists. The information that the Central Intelligence Agency has obtained by questioning men like Khalid Sheik Mohammed has provided valuable information and has helped disrupt terrorist plots, including strikes within the United States. For example, Khalid Sheik Mohammed described the design of plane attacks on building inside the U.S. and how operatives were directed to carry them out. That is valuable information for those of us who have the responsibility to protect the American people. He told us the operatives had been instructed to ensure that the explosives went off at a point that was high enough to prevent people trapped above from escaping. He gave us information that helped uncover Al Qaida cells' efforts to obtain biological weapons. We've also learned information from the CIA program that has helped stop other plots, including attacks on the U.S. Marine base in East Africa, our American consulate in Pakistan, or Britain's Heathrow Airport. This program has been one of the most vital tools in our efforts to protect this country. It's been invaluable to our country, and it's invaluable to our allies. Were it not for this program, our intelligence community believes that Al Qaida and its allies would have succeeded in launching another attack against the American homeland. By giving us information about terrorist plans we couldn't get anywhere else, this program has saved innocent lives. In other words, it's vital. That's why I asked Congress to pass legislation so that our professionals can go forward doing the duty we expect them to do. Unfortunately, the recent Supreme Court decision put the future of this program in question. It's another reason I went to Congress. We need this legislation to save it. I'm asking Congress to pass a clear law, with clear guidelines, based on the Detainee Treatment Act that was strongly supported by Senator John McCain. There's a debate about the specific provisions in my bill, and we'll work with Congress to continue to try to find common ground. I have one test for this legislation. I'm going to ask one question, as this legislation proceeds, and it's this: The intelligence community must be able to tell me that the bill Congress sends to my desk will allow this vital program to continue. That's what I'm going to ask. The second bill before Congress would modernize our electronic surveillance laws and provide additional authority for the terrorist surveillance program. I authorized the National Security Agency to operate this vital program in response to the 9/11 attacks. It allows us to quickly monitor terrorist communications between someone overseas and someone in the United States, and it's helped detect and prevent attacks on our country. The principle behind this program is clear. When an Al Qaida operative is calling into the United States or out of the country, we need to know who they're calling, why they're calling and what they're planning. Both these bills are essential to winning the war on terror. We'll work with Congress to get good bills out, because we have a duty -- we have a duty to work together to give our folks on the front line the tools necessary to protect America. Time's running out. Congress is set to adjourn in just a few weeks. Congress needs to act wisely and promptly, so I can sign good legislation. And now I'd be glad to answer some questions. QUESTION: Mr. President, former Secretary of State Colin Powell says, The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism. If a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former secretary of state feels this way, don't you think that Americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether you're following a flawed strategy? BUSH: If there's any comparison between the compassion and decency of the American people and the terrorist tactics of extremists, it's flawed logic. It's just -- I simply can't accept that. It's unacceptable to think that there's any kind of comparison between the behavior of the United States of America and the action of Islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective. My job and the job of people here in Washington, D.C., is to protect this country. We didn't ask for this war. You might remember the 2000 campaign. I don't remember spending much time talking about what it might be like to be a commander in chief in a different kind of war. But this enemy has struck us and they want to strike us again. And we'll give our folks the tools necessary to protect the country. That's our job. It's a dangerous world. I wish it wasn't that way. I wish I could tell the American people, Don't worry about it. They're not coming again. But they are coming again. And that's why I've sent this legislation up to Congress. And that's why we'll continue to work with allies in building a vast coalition, to protect not only ourselves but them. The facts are -- is that after 9/11, this enemy continued to attack and kill innocent people. I happen to believe that they're bound by a common ideology. Matter of fact, I don't believe it, I know they are. And they want to impose that ideology throughout the broader Middle East. That's what they have said. Makes sense for the commander in chief and all of us involved in protecting this country to listen to the words of the enemy. And I take their words seriously. And that's what's going to be necessary to protect this country, is to listen carefully to what they say and stay ahead of them as they try to attack us. Steve? QUESTION: Can I just follow up? BUSH: No, you can't. Steve? If we follow up, we're not going to get -- I want Hillman (ph) to be able to ask a question. It's his last press -- not yet, Hillman (ph). (LAUGHTER) Soon. You and Wendell seem... QUESTION: Thanks very much, sir. What do you say to the argument that your proposal is basically seeking support for torture, coerced evidence and secret hearings? And Senator McCain says your plan would put U.S. troops at risk. What do you think about that? BUSH: This debate is occurring because of the Supreme Court's ruling that said that we must conduct ourselves under the Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. And that Common Article 3 says that, you know, There will be no outrages upon human dignity. It's like -- it's very vague. What does that mean, outrages upon human dignity ? That's a statement that is wide open to interpretation. And what I'm proposing is that there be clarity in the law so that our professionals will have no doubt that that which they're doing is legal. You know, it's a -- and so the piece of legislation I sent up there provides our professionals that which is needed to go forward. The first question that we've got to ask is: Do we need the program? I believe we do need the program. And I detained in a speech in the East Room what the program has yielded","excerpt":"in other words, the kind of information we get when we interrogate people within the law. You see, sometimes you can pick up information on the battlefield, sometimes you can pick it up, you know, through letters, but sometimes you actually have to question the people who know the strategy and plans of the enemy. And in this case, we questioned people like Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who we believe ordered the attacks on 9/11, or Ramzi Binalshibh or Abu Zubaida, cold-blooded killers who were part of planning the attack that killed 3,000 people. And we need to be able to question them, because it helps yield information, information necessary for us to be able to do our job. Now, the court said that you've got to live under Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. And the standards are so vague that our professionals won't be able to carry forward the program, because they don't want to be tried as war criminals. They don't want to break the law. These are decent, honorable citizens who are on the front line of protecting the American people. And they expect our government to give them clarity about what is right and what is wrong in the law. And that's what we have asked to do. And we believe a good way to go is to use the amendment that we worked with John McCain on, called the Detainee Treatment Act, as the basis for clarity for people we would ask to question the enemy. In other words, it is a way to bring U.S. law into play. It provides more clarity for our professionals. And that's what these people expect. These are decent citizens who don't want to break the law. Now, this idea that somehow, you know, we've got to live under international treaties, you know -- and that's fine; we do. But oftentimes the United States government passes law to clarify obligations under international treaty. And what I'm concerned about is if we don't do that, that it's very conceivable our professionals could be held to account based upon court decisions in other countries. And I don't believe Americans want that. I believe Americans want us to protect the country, to have clear standards for our law enforcement, intelligence officers, and give them the tools necessary to protect us within the law. It's an important debate. It really is. It's a debate that really is going to define whether or not we can protect ourselves. I will tell you this -- and I've spent a lot of time on this issue, as you can imagine. And I've talked to professionals, people I count on for advice. These are the people who are going to represent those on the front line protecting this country. They're not going forward with the program. They're professionals -- will not step up unless there's clarity in the law. So Congress has got a decision to make. You want the program to go forward or not? I strongly recommend that this program go forward in order for us to be able to protect America. Hillman (ph)? This is Hillman's (ph) last press conference so -- sorry about that. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. On another of your top priorities, immigration, leaders of both parties have indicated that any chance of comprehensive immigration reform is dead before the election. Is this an issue you would like to revisit in a lame duck session after the election? Or would it be put off until the new Congress? BUSH: I strongly believe that in order to protect this border, Congress has got to pass a comprehensive plan that, on the one hand, provides, you know, additional money to secure the border and, on the other hand, recognizes that people are sneaking in here to do jobs Americans aren't doing, it would be better that they not sneak in; that they would come on a temporary basis, in an orderly way, to do work Americans aren't doing, and then go home. And I will continue to urge Congress to think comprehensively about this vital piece of legislation. I went up to the Hill yesterday and, of course, this topic came up. And that's exactly what I told the members of Congress. They wanted to know whether or not we were implementing border security measures that they had funded last January. And the answer is: We are. And one of the key things I told them was we had ended what's called catch-and-release. That was, you know, where the Border Patrol agent would find somebody, particularly from a -- not from Mexico -- and would say, Well, we don't have enough detention space, so why don't you come back and check in with the -- you know, the local person you're supposed to check in with? and then they'd never show back up. And that, of course, frustrated the Border Patrol agents, it frustrates American citizens, it frustrates me. And we ended it, because Congress appropriated money that increased the number of beds available to detain people when we get them sneaking into our country illegally. The border has become modernized. And Secretary Chertoff here later on this month will be announcing further modernizations, as he has let a contract that will use all kinds of different technologies to make the border more secure. But in the long run to secure this border, we've got to have a rational work plan. And finally, we going to have to treat people with dignity in this country. Ours is a nation of immigrants. And when Congress gets down to a comprehensive bill, I will just remind them, it's virtually impossible to try to find 11 million folks who've been here working hard, in some cases raising families, and kick them out. It's just not going to work. But granting automatic citizenship won't work either. To me, that would just provide an additional incentive for people to try to sneak in. And so, therefore, there is a rational way forward. I'll continue working. I don't know the timetable. My answer is as soon as possible. That's what I'd like to see done. Wendell? QUESTION: My apologies, Mr. President, for talking too long at the start. BUSH: I'm not going to apologize for talking too long to your answer. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: Talk as long as you like, sir. (LAUGHTER) When you go to New York next week, it's our thinking that one of the things you'll be trying to do is to get more international support for taking a tough stance against Iran. I wonder how much that is frustrated by two things: one, the war in Iraq and world criticism of that; and the other, the Iraqi prime minister's going to Iran and basically challenging your administration's claim that Iran is meddling in Iraqi affairs. BUSH: First, my decision, along with other countries, to remove Saddam Hussein has obviously created some concern amongst allies, but it certainly hasn't diminished the coalitions we put together to deal with radicalism. For example, there's 70 nations involved with the Proliferation Security Initiative. And that's an initiative to help prevent weapons of mass destruction and/or component parts from being delivered to countries that could use them to hurt us; or the broad war on terror, intelligence-sharing or financial -- the sharing of financial information; or Afghanistan, where NATO troops are there now, along with ours. In other words, there's a broad coalition -- most nations that -- you know, recognize the threat of Iran having a nuclear weapon in the Middle East. And there's common consensus that we need to work together to prevent the Iranian regime from developing that nuclear weapons program. I have -- I am pleased that there is strong consensus. And now the objective is to continue reminding the Iranian regime that there is unanimity in the world and that we will move forward together. And we expect them to come to the table and negotiate with the E.U. in good faith. And should they choose to verifiably suspend their program -- their enrichment program, we'll come to the table. That's what we have said and the offer still stands. During the Hezbollah attacks on Israel, the United Nations did pass a resolution with our European friends and ourselves and, of course, Russia and China voting for the resolution. I think it passed 14-1. One nation voted against the resolution toward Iran. So there is common consensus. And if you've heard me lament oftentimes it takes a while to get diplomacy working. There's one nation of Iran and, you know, a bunch of nations like us trying to, kind of, head in the same direction. And my concern is that, you know, they'll stall; they'll try to wait us out. So part of my objective in New York is to remind people that's stalling shouldn't be allowed. In other words, we need to move the process. And they need to understand we're firm in our commitment and that if they try to drag their feet or, you know, get us to look the other way, that we won't do that; that we're firmly committed in our desire to send a common signal to the Iranian regime. It is important for the Iranian people to also understand we respect them, we respect their history, we respect their traditions, we respect the right for people to worship freely. We would hope that people would be able to express themselves in the public square. And that our intention is to make the world safer, and we'll continue to do so. QUESTION: If I could follow up on that question, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian president, will actually be in the same building as you next week in Manhattan for the United Nations General Assembly. You say that you want to give the message to the Iranian people that you respect them. Is this not an opportunity, perhaps, to show that you also respect their leader? Would you be willing to perhaps meet face to face with Ahmadinejad? And would this possibly be a breakthrough -- BUSH: Yeah. QUESTION: -- some sort of opportunity for a breakthrough on a personal level? BUSH: No. I'm not going to meet with him. I have made it clear to the Iranian regime that we will sit down with the Iranians once they verifiably suspend their enrichment program. I meant what I said. Martha. QUESTION: Mr. President, you have said throughout the war in Iraq and building up to the war in Iraq that there was a relationship between Saddam Hussein and Zarqawi and al Qaeda. A Senate Intelligence Committee report a few weeks ago said there was no link, no relationship, and that the CIA knew this and issued a report last fall. And yet a month ago you were still saying there was a relationship. BUSH: Hm. QUESTION: Why did you keep saying that? Why do you continue to say that? And do you still believe that? BUSH: The point I was making to Ken Herman's question was that Saddam Hussein was a state sponsor of terror and that Mr. Zarqawi was in Iraq. He had been wounded in Afghanistan, had come to Iraq for treatment. He had ordered the killing of a U.S. citizen in Jordan. I never said there was an operational relationship. I was making the point that Saddam Hussein had been declared a state sponsor of terror for a reason, and therefore he was dangerous. The broader point I was reminding people is why we removed Saddam Hussein from power: He was dangerous. I would hope people aren't trying to rewrite the history of Saddam Hussein and all of a sudden he becomes, kind of, a benevolent fellow. He's a dangerous man. And one of the reasons he was declared a state sponsor of terror is because that's what he was. He harbored terrorists. He paid for families of suicide bombers. Never have I said that Saddam Hussein gave orders to attack 9/11. What I did say was after 9/11, when you see a threat, you've got to take it seriously. And I saw a threat in Saddam Hussein, as did Congress, as did the United Nations. I firmly believe the world is better off without Saddam in power. Dave? He's back! QUESTION: Sorry, I've got to get disentangled. BUSH: Would you like me to go to somebody else, here, till you get... (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: Sorry. BUSH: Well, take your time, please. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: I really apologize for that. Anyway... BUSH: I must say, having gone through those gyrations, you're looking beautiful today, Dave. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: Thank you very much. Mr. President, critics of your proposed bill on interrogation rules say there's another important test. These critics include John McCain, who you've mentioned several times this morning. And that test is this: If a CIA officer, paramilitary or special operations soldier from the United States were captured in Iran or North Korea and they were roughed up and those governments said, Well, they were interrogated in accordance with our interpretation of the Geneva Conventions, and then they were put on trial and they were convicted based on secret evidence that they were not able to see, how would you react to that as commander in chief? BUSH: My reaction is, is that if the nations such as those you name adopted the standards within the Detainee Detention Act, the world would be better. That's my reaction. We're trying to clarify law. We're trying to set high standards, not ambiguous standards. And let me just repeat: We can debate this issue all we want, but the practical matter is, if our professionals don't have clear standards in the law, the program is not going to go forward. You cannot ask a young intelligence officer to violate the law. And they're not going to. They -- let me finish please -- they will not violate the law. You can ask this question all you want, but the bottom line is -- and the American people have got to understand this -- that this program won't go forward if there's vague standards applied like those in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. It's just not going to go forward. You can't ask a young professional on the front line of protecting this country to violate law. Now, I know they say they're not going to prosecute them. Think about that, you know. Go ahead and violate it, we won't prosecute you. These people aren't going to do that. Now, we can justify anything you want and bring up this example or that example. I'm just telling you the bottom line. And that's why this debate is important and it's a vital debate. Now, perhaps, some in Congress don't think the program is important. That's fine. I don't know if they do or don't. I think it's vital and I have the obligation to make sure that our professionals who I would ask to go conduct interrogations to find out what might be happening or who might be coming to this country -- I got to give them the tools they need, and that is clear law. QUESTION: This is an important point, and I think it... BUSH: The point I just made is the most important point, and that is the program is not going forward. You can give a hypothetical about North Korea or any other country. The point is that the program is not going to go forward if our professionals do not have clarity in the law. And the best way to provide clarity in the law is to make sure the Detainee Treatment Act is the crux of the law. That's how we define Common Article 3. And it sets a good standard for the countries that you just talked about. Next man? QUESTION: But wait a second. I think this is an important point. BUSH: I know you think it's an important point. QUESTION: But, sir, with respect, if other countries interpret the Geneva Conventions as they see fit, as they see fit, you're saying that you'd be OK with that? BUSH: I am saying that I would hope that they would adopt the same standards we adopt; and that by clarifying Article 3 we make it stronger, we make it clearer, we make it definite. And I will tell you again, you can ask every hypothetical you want, but the American people have got to know the facts. And the bottom line is simple: If Congress passes a law that does not clarify the rules -- if they do not do that, the program's not going forward. QUESTION: This will not endanger U.S. troops in your... BUSH: Next man? QUESTION: This will not endanger... BUSH: David, next man please. Thank you. Took you a long time to unravel, and it took you a long time to ask your question. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: Good morning, sir. I'd like to ask you another question about Iraq. It's been another bloody day there. The last several weeks have been 40, 50, 60 bodies a day. We've been talking for the last several months about Iraq being on the brink of a civil war. I'd like to ask you if it's not time to start talking about Iraq as being in a civil war. And if it's not, what's the threshold? BUSH: Well, it seems like it's pretty easy to speculate from over here about the conditions on the ground. And so what I do is I talk to people like our ambassador and General Casey, which I just did this morning. And they and the Iraqi government just don't agree with the hypothesis it is a civil war. They believe that -- there's no question of violence; they believe that Al Qaida still is creating havoc. They know that there's people taking reprisal. They're confident there are still Saddamists who are threatening people and carrying out attacks. But they also believe that the Baghdad security plan is making progress. There was a lot of discussion about al-Anbar province recently. And I spent some time talking with our commanders. No question it's a dangerous place. It's a place where Al Qaida is really trying to root themselves. It's a place from which they'd like to operate. You know, this business about Al Qaida -- al-Anbar is lost is just not the case. That's not what our commanders think. So to answer your question, it's no question it's tough. What I look for is whether or not the unity government is moving forward, whether or not they have a political plan to resolve issues such as oil and federalism, whether or not they're willing to reconcile and whether or not Iraqi troops and Iraqi police are doing their jobs. QUESTION: But how do you measure progress with a body count like that? BUSH: Well, one way you do it is you measure progress based upon the resilience of the Iraqi people: Do they want there to be a unity government; or are they splitting up into, you know, factions of people warring with the head leaders, with different alternatives of governing styles and different philosophies? The unity government's intact. It's working forward. They're making tough decisions. And we'll stay with them. We'll stay with them because success in Iraq is important for this country. We're constantly changing our tactics. We're constantly adapting to the enemy. We're constantly saying, Here's the way forward. We want to work with you. But this is really the big challenge of the 21st century, you know, whether or not this country and allies are willing to stand with moderate people in order to fight off extremists. It is the challenge. I said the other night in a speech this is like the ideological war of the 21st century, and I believe it. And I believe that if we leave that region, if we don't help democracy prevail, then our children and grandchildren will be faced with an unbelievable, chaotic and dangerous situation in the Middle East. Imagine an enemy that can't stand what we believe in getting ahold of oil resources and taking a bunch of oil off the market in order to have an economic punishment. In other words, You go ahead and do this, and if you don't, we'll punish you economically. Or imagine a Middle East with an Iran with a nuclear weapon threatening free nations and trying to promote their vision of extremism through Hezbollah. I find it interesting that young democracies are being challenged by extremists. I also take great hope in the fact that by far the vast majority of people want normalcy and want peace, including in Iraq; that there is a deep desire for people to, you know, raise their children in a peaceful world; a desire for mothers to have the best for their child. That has not -- this isn't -- you know, Americans, you've got to understand, this is universal. And the idea of just saying, Well, you know, that's not important for us, to me or the future of the country is just not acceptable. And I know it's tough in Iraq. Of course it's tough in Iraq, because an enemy is trying to stop this new democracy, just like people were trying to stop the development of a Palestinian state, which I strongly support, or people trying to undermine the Lebanese democracy. And the reason why is because the ideologues understand that liberty will trump their dark vision of the world every time. And that's why call it an ideological struggle. And it's a necessary struggle, and it's a vital struggle. Richard. QUESTION: Mr. President, as you prepare to go up to the United Nations next week to address the General Assembly, Secretary Kofi Annan has been critical of some of U.S. policies, particularly in Afghanistan lately. How would you characterize the relationship between the United States and the United Nations at this point? BUSH: Yeah. First of all, my personal relationship with Kofi Annan is good. I like him. And we got a -- we've got a good relationship, personal relationship. I think a lot of Americans are frustrated with the United Nations -- (chuckles) -- to be frank with you. I -- take, for example, Darfur. I'm frustrated with the United Nations in regards to Darfur. I have said and this government has said there's genocide taking place in the Sudan, and it breaks our -- our -- our collective hearts to know that. And it breaks our collective hearts to know that. We believe that the best way to solve the problem is for there to be a political track as well as a security track. And part of the security track was for there initially to be African Union forces, supported by the international community, hopefully to protect innocent lives from militia. And the A.U. force is there. But it's not robust enough. It needs to be bigger. It needs to be more viable. And so the strategy was then to go to the United Nations and pass a resolution enabling the A.U. force to become blue-helmeted -- that means become a United Nations peacekeeping force -- with additional support from around the world. And I suggested that there also be, you know, help from NATO nations in logistics and support in order to make the security effective enough so that a political process could go forward to save lives. The problem is, is that the United Nations hasn't acted. And so, I can understand why those who are concerned about Darfur are frustrated. I am. I'd like to see more robust United Nations action. What you'll hear is, Well, the government of Sudan must invite the United Nations in for us to act. Well, there are other alternatives, like passing a resolution saying, We're coming in with a U.N. force in order to save lives. I'm proud of our country's support for those who suffer. We provided by far the vast majority food and aid. I'm troubled by reports I hear about escalating violence. I can understand the desperation people feel for women being pulled out of these refugees centers and raped. And now is the time for the U.N. to act. So you asked of levels of frustration. There's a particular level of frustration. I also believe that the United Nations can do a better job spending the taxpayer -- our taxpayers' money. I think there needs to be better management structures in place, better accountability in the organization. I hope the United Nations still strongly stands for liberty. I hope they would support my call to end tyranny in the 21st century. So I'm looking forward to going up there. It's always an interesting experience for a West Texas fellow to speak to the United Nations. And I'm going to have a strong message; one that's hope -- based upon hope, and my belief that the civilized world must stand with moderate, reformist-minded people and help them realize their dreams. I believe that's the call of the 21st century. QUESTION: On both the eavesdropping program and the detainee issues... BUSH: We call it the terrorist surveillance program. QUESTION: That's the one. BUSH: Yes. QUESTION: You're working with Congress, sort of, after the fact, after you established these programs on your own authority. And federal courts have ruled in both cases you overstepped your authority. Is your willingness to work with Congress now an acknowledgement that that is a fact? BUSH: First of all, I strongly believe that the district court ruling on the terrorist surveillance program was flawed. And there's a court process to determine whether or not my believe is true. That's why it's on appeal. We're working with Congress to add certainly to the program. In terms of the Hamdan decision, I obviously believed that I could move forward military commissions. Other presidents had. The Supreme Court didn't agree. And they said, Work with Congress. And that's why we're working with Congress. QUESTION: Polls show that many people are still more focused on domestic issues, like the economy, than on the international issues in deciding how to vote in November. And I'd just like to ask you if you could contrast what you think will happen on the economy if Republicans retain control of Congress versus what happens on the economy if Democrats take over. BUSH: If I weren't here -- first of all, I don't believe the Democrats are going to take over, because our record on the economy is strong. If the American people take a step back and realize how effective our policies have been given the circumstances, they will continue to embrace our philosophy of government. We've overcome recession, attacks, hurricanes, scandals, and the economy's growing -- 4.7 percent unemployment rate. It's been a strong economy. And I strongly believe the reason it is, is because we cut taxes, and at the same time showed fiscal responsibility here in Washington with the people's money. That's why the deficit could be cut in half by 2009 or before. And so I shouldn't answer your hypothetical, but I will. I believe if the Democrats had the capacity to, they would raise taxes on the working people. That's what I believe. They'll call it tax on the rich, but that's not the way it works in Washington, see? For example, running up the top income tax bracket would tax small businesses. A lot of small businesses are subchapter S corporations or limited partnerships that pay tax at the individual level. If you raise income taxes on them, you hurt job creation. Our answer to economic growth is to make the tax cuts permanent so there's certainly in the tax code and people have got money to spend in their pockets. And so, yes, I've always felt the economy is a determinant issue, if not the determinant issue, in campaigns. We've had a little history of that in our family and -- you might remember. But it's a -- I certainly hope this election is based upon economic performance. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. I'd also like to ask an election-related question. The Republican leader in the House this week said that Democrats -- he wonders if they are more interested in protecting the terrorists than protecting the American people. Do you agree with him, sir? Do you think that's the right tone to set for this upcoming campaign? Or do you think he owes somebody an apology? BUSH: I wouldn't have exactly put it that way. But I do believe there's a difference of attitude. Take the Patriot Act, for example. Interesting debate that took place not once but twice. And the second time around there was a lot of concern about whether or not the Patriot Act, you know, was necessary to protect the country. There's no doubt in my mind we needed to make sure the Patriot Act was renewed to tear down walls that exist so that intelligence people could share information with criminal people. It wasn't the case before 9/11. In other words, somebody had some intelligence that they thought was necessary to protect the people, they couldn't share that with somebody whose job it was to grab (ph) people out of society to prevent them from attacking. Just made no sense. And so there was a healthy debate, and we finally got the Patriot Act extended after it was passed right after 9/11. To me, that was an indication of just a difference of approach. No one should ever question the patriotism of somebody, you know -- let me just start over. I don't question the patriotism of somebody who doesn't agree with me. I just don't. And I think it's unwise to do that. I don't think it's what leaders do. I do think that -- I think that there is a difference of opinion here in Washington about the tools necessary to protect the country, the terrorist surveillance program, or what did you call it... QUESTION: Eavesdropping. BUSH: Yeah, the illegal eavesdropping program you wanted to call it. (LAUGHTER) IEP, as opposed to TSP. (LAUGHTER) There's just a difference of opinion about what we need to do to protect our country. I'm confident the leader, you know, meant nothing personal. I know that he shares my concern that we pass good legislation to get something done. QUESTION: I'd be interested in your thoughts and remembrances about Ann Richards, and particularly what you learned in running against her 12 years ago. BUSH: Obviously, Laura and I pray for her family. I know this is a tough time for her children. She loved her children and they loved her a lot. Running against Ann Richards taught me a lot. She was a really, really good candidate. She was a hard worker. She was -- she had the capacity to be humorous and yet make a profound point. I think she made a positive impact on the state of Texas. One thing's for certain: She empowered a lot of people to be -- to want to participate in the political process that might not have felt that they were welcome in the process. She is -- I will miss her. She was -- she really, kind of, helped define Texas politics in its best way. You know, one of the things we have done is we -- in our history, we've had characters, people larger than life, people that could fill the stage; you know, when the spotlight was on them, wouldn't shirk from the spotlight but would talk Texan and explain our state. And she was really good at that. And so I -- you know, I'm sad she passed away, and I wish her family all the best -- and all her friends. She had a lot of friends in Texas. A lot of people loved Ann Richards. And anyway, as I understand, they're working on the deal on how to honor her. And she'll be laying in state in the capital. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) BUSH: Yes, I will send somebody to represent me. I don't know who it's going to be yet. Well, we're trying to get the detail -- before I ask somebody, got to find out the full -- thanks for asking the question. New York Times, Sheryl? QUESTION: Hi, Mr. President. BUSH: Fine. How you doing? QUESTION: I'm well today, thank you. (LAUGHTER) BUSH: Did you start with, Hi, Mr. President ? QUESTION: Hello, Mr. President. BUSH: OK, that's fine. Either way. I thought it was a friendly greeting. Thank you. QUESTION: We're a friendly newspaper. BUSH: Yes. (LAUGHTER) Let me just say, I'd hate to see unfriendly. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: Mr. President... BUSH: Want me go on to somebody else and you collect your breath? (LAUGHTER) Sorry, go ahead, Sheryl. QUESTION: Mr. President, your administration had all summer to negotiate with lawmakers on the detainee legislation. How is that you now find yourself in a situation where you have essentially an open rebellion on Capitol Hill, led by some of the leading members of your own party, very respected voices in military affairs? And, secondly, would you veto the bill if it passes in the form that the Armed Services Committee approved yesterday? BUSH: First, we have been working throughout the summer, talking to key players about getting a bill that will enable the program to go forward. And was pleased that the House of Representatives passed a good bill with an overwhelming bipartisan majority out of the committee -- the Armed Services Committee. And I felt that was good progress. And, obviously, we got a little work to do in the Senate and will continue making our case. But, no, we've been involved. Ever since the Supreme Court decision came down, we've been talking about both the military tribunals and this Article 3 of the Geneva Convention. The Article 3 of the Geneva Convention is hard for a lot of citizens to understand. But let's see if I can put it this way for people to understand: There is a very vague standard that the court said must -- well, it's kind of -- be the guide for our conduct in the war on terror and the detainee policy. It's so vague that it's impossible to ask anybody to participate in the program for fear -- for that person having a fear of breaking the law. That's the problem. And so we've worked with members of both bodies and both parties to try to help bring some definition to Common Article 3. I really don't think most Americans want international courts being able to determine how we protect ourselves. And my assurance to people is that we can pass law here in the United States that helps define our treaty -- international treaty obligations. We have done that in the past. It is not the first time that we have done this. And I believe it's necessary to do it this time in order for the program to go forward. Peter? QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Sheryl's second question was whether you would veto the bill as it passed yesterday. BUSH: Oh, I don't, I don't -- that's like saying, Well, can you work with a Democratic Congress? when I don't think the Democratic Congress is going to get elected. I believe we can get a good bill. And I am -- there's a -- as you know, there's several steps in this process. The House will be working on a bill next week; the Senate will be. Hopefully we can reconcile differences. Hopefully that we can come together and find a way forward, without ruining the program. And so your question was her question. QUESTION: No, sir. (LAUGHTER) BUSH: Oh, you were following up on her question? QUESTION: Yes, sir. BUSH: That's a first. QUESTION: We're a friendly paper, too. (LAUGHTER) Mr. President, you've often used the phrase stand up/stand down to describe your policy when it comes to troop withdrawals from Iraq. BUSH: Yes. QUESTION: As Iraqi troops are trained and take over the fight, American troops will come home. The Pentagon now says they've trained 294,000 Iraqi troops and expect to complete their program of training 325,000 by the end of the year, but American troops aren't coming home. There are more there now than there were previously. Is the goal post moving, sir? BUSH: No. No. The enemy is changing tactics, and we're adapting. That's what's happening. And I asked General Casey today, Have you got what you need? He said, Yes, I got what I need. Look, we all want the troops to come home as quickly as possible. But they'll be coming home when our commanders say the Iraqi government is capable of defending itself and sustaining itself and it's governing itself. And, you know, I was hoping we would have or be able to -- hopefully Casey would come and say, You know, Mr. President, there's a chance to have fewer troops there. It looked like that might be the case until the violence started rising in Baghdad. And it spiked in June and July, as you know -- or increased in June and July. And so they've got a plan now; they've adapted. The enemy moved, and we will help the Iraqis move. So they're building a berm around the city to make it harder for people to come in with explosive devices, for example. They're working different neighborhoods inside of Baghdad to collect guns and bring people to -- into detention. They got a clear, build and hold strategy. The reason why there are not fewer troops there but are more -- you're right, it's gone from 135,000 to about 147,000, I think, or 140,000-something troops, is because George Casey felt he needed them to help the Iraqis achieve their objective. And that's the way I will continue to conduct the war. I'll listen to generals. Maybe it's not the politically expedient thing to do is to increase troops, coming into election. But we -- you can't make decisions based upon politics about how to win a war. And, you know, the fundamental question you have to ask -- and Martha knows what I'm about to say -- is, can the president trust his commanders on the ground to tell him what is necessary? That's really one of the questions you -- in other words, if you say, \\"I'm going to rely upon their judgment,\\" the next question is, how good is their judgment? Or is my judgment good enough to figure out whether or not they know what they're doing? And I'm going to tell you, I've got great confidence in General John Abizaid and General George Casey. These are extraordinary men who understand the difficulties of the task and understand there is a delicate relationship between self- sufficiency on the Iraqis' part and U.S. presence. And this is not a science, but an art form in a way, you know, to try to make sure that -- that a unity government is able to defend itself and at the same time not be totally reliant upon coalition forces to do the job for them. And the issue is complicated by the fact that there are still al Qaeda or Saddam remnants or, you know, militias that are still violent. And so to answer your question: The policy still holds. The stand up, stand down still holds, and so does the policy of me listening to our commanders to give me the judgment necessary for troop levels. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Earlier this week, you told a group of journalists that you thought the idea of sending special forces to Pakistan to hunt down bin Laden was a strategy that would not work. BUSH: Yes. QUESTION: Now recently, you've also... BUSH: Because, first of all, Pakistan is a sovereign nation. QUESTION: Well, recently, you've also described bin Laden as a sort of modern day Hitler or Mussolini. And I'm wondering why, if you can explain, why you think it's a bad idea to send more resources to hunt down bin Laden wherever he is. BUSH: We are, Richard. Thank you. Thanks for asking the question. They were asking me about -- somebody report -- well, you know, your special forces here. Pakistan -- if he is in Pakistan, which this person thought he might be who was asking me the question -- Pakistan's a sovereign nation. In order for us to send thousands of troops into a sovereign nation, we've got to be invited by the government of Pakistan. Secondly, the best way to find somebody who is hiding is to enhance your intelligence and to spend the resources necessary to do that. And then when you find him, you bring him to justice. And, you know, there is a kind of an urban myth here in Washington about how this administration hasn't stayed focused on Osama bin Laden. Forget it. It's convenient throw-away lines, you know, when people say that. We have been on the hunt, and we'll stay on the hunt until we bring him to justice. And we're doing it in a smart fashion, Richard, we are. And I'll look forward to talking to President Musharraf. Look, he doesn't like Al Qaida. They tried to kill him. And we've had a good record of bringing people to justice inside of Pakistan, because the Paks are in the lead. They know the stakes about dealing with a, you know, a violent form of ideological extremists. So we will continue on the hunt, and we've been effective about bringing to justice most of those who planned and plotted the 9/11 attacks, and we still got a lot of pressure on them. The best way to protect the homeland is to stay on the offense and keep pressure on them. Last question. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. It was reported earlier this week that in a meeting with conservative journalists, you said you'd seen changes in the culture you referred to as a third awakening. I wonder if you could tell us about what you meant by that, what led you to that conclusion, and do you see any contradictory evidence in the culture. BUSH: No, I said -- thanks -- I was just speculating that the culture might be changing. And I was talking about when you're involved with making decisions of historic nature you won't be around to see the effects of your decisions. And I said that, you know, when I work the rope lines, a lot of people come and say, Mr. President, I'm praying for you. A lot. As a matter of fact, it seems like a lot more now than when I was working rope lines in 1994. And I asked them to -- I was asking their opinion about whether or not there was a, you know, a third awakening, I called it. I just read a book on Abraham Lincoln, and his presidency was right around the time of what they called the second awakening. And I was curious to know whether or not these smart people felt like there was any historical parallels. I also said that I had run for office in the first time to change the culture. Herman and (inaudible) remember me saying, you know, the culture said if it feels good doing it, you got a problem, blame somebody else, to helping to work change a culture in which each of us are responsible for the decisions we make in life. In other words, usher in a responsibility era. And I reminded people that responsibility means, if you're a father, to love your child, or if you're corporate America, be honest with the taxpayers; if you're a citizen of this country, love your neighbor. And so I was wondering out loud with him. It seems like to me that something is happening in the religious life of America. But I'm not a very good focus group either. I'm encapsulated here. I'm able to see a lot of people. And, from my perspective, people are coming to say, I'm praying for you. And it's an uplifting part of being the president. It inspires me. And I'm grateful that a fellow citizen would say a prayer for me and Laura. Anyway, thank you all very much.

Assuming the so-called midlife crisis to be a fact, Mr. Brandes goes on to explain why it exists and to examine its legitimate and illegitimate foundations in biology, history and mythology. He discusses and dismisses most of the biological evidence for midlife crises, cites interesting and contradictory historical evidence from Dante to Montaigne to Erik Erikson, and catalogues at length the symbolic uses of the number from the 40 days of the Flood to the 40 days Jesus spent in the desert to ''Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.''

Designers on the calendar of men's-wear shows this season hail from Japan, Italy, Belgium, England, Holland, Austria and Spain. But here, there are no borders. Arguably the most French fashion for spring '94 was served up by the Japanese designer Kenzo, who sent out three of this city's top chefs in traditional chef's jackets made from the checked Provencal linen used for dish towels. Meanwhile, the most French fashion house, Hermes, showed raw silk Nehru jackets.   The couture capital that Christian Dior and Yves Saint Laurent built would seem a perfect breeding ground for spectacular men's-wear classics. But the masters have not been drawn to men's fashion. While the suits designed at the prestigious houses follow the colors and the softer structures of the season, it is not there that fashion news is made. Star of the Avante-Garde    That is left to Jean-Paul Gaultier, who has made Paris the capital of avant-garde men's wear, where others can flourish in his wake. \\"Gandhi meets Amadeus on Carnaby Street\\" was how Jon Weiser of Charivari dubbed this season's collection: Indian prints on T-shirts, Mozart-worthy long flared jackets, giant patchwork jeans. Every model wore a nose-to-ear chain. This season's innovations were a jacket with sewn-on pin-striped shirt-sleeves and a series of sarong-tied pants. In a nod to a troubled world, Mr. Gaultier started his show with a radio playing France's all-news radio station.

Malcolm Goldstein, in particular, in an excerpt from his new \\"Configurations  in Darkness,\\" used his violin as an instrument of percussion and even abrasion.  He started just over the line of conventional beauty, with an Arabic-tinged folk melody from Bosnia and Herzogovina, and carried the tune ever farther afield, imposing on it a tortured modern history to resemble that of its homeland. For long stretches, he based his fascinating scrawls and scratches on little more (sometimes less) than a pedal tone, but he wound his way back persuasively and movingly to something like the original melody.

The human life teeming through this sprawling portrait of Brazil's criminal class crowded within a notorious penitentiary exudes a throbbing flesh-and-blood intensity that's so compelling it's impossible to avert your eyes. Watching this messy epic is a little like being jammed into an un-air-conditioned subway car on a steamy summer night as it rattles through an urban wasteland: at any second, things could explode. And eventually they do. It is the 1980's, and the setting is São Paulo's real-life house of detention, which was torn down in 2002, a decade after a riot led to the massacre of 111 inmates by the police. The film is a splashy return to form by the celebrated director of ''Pixote'' and ''Kiss of the Spider Woman.'' In examining social ills, it interweaves multiple stories of the prisoners' lives as viewed by a doctor volunteering his services. Below its documentarylike sprawl, ''Carandiru'' is a hands-on movie passionately engaged in its characters' personal dramas.

In ''The Uses of Disorder,'' a nonfiction book published in 1970, he examines the opposite effect: how the development of personality in our country often frustrates the kind of housing, school or zoning planning that would enable heterogeneous groups to live comfortably together in New York City.   We have become victims, Mr. Sennett says, of what he calls an ideal of ''purified identity.'' This purification is more negative than positive, representing a refusal to disturb the complacency or security of the self by exposing it to contact with the ambiguous ''otherness'' of different ethnic, economic and cultural groups.  Purified identity resembles Rollo May's ''pseudo-innocence,'' an attempt to deny the threatening stranger who also lurks in the darker recesses of our own selves.

You rightly point out that the recent election for governor shows the island almost evenly divided on this issue.    Perhaps more important, though, is the realization in Puerto Rico over the last decade that the island's depressed economy is the priority issue. There is also a growing recognition that to make an informed decision about the future of their island - whether to remain a commonwealth, move to apply for statehood, or become independent - the people of Puerto Rico require much more knowledge about the conditions under which Congress would agree to change the island's current status.  The major economic issue in Puerto Rico in the modern era has been the development of a society that can usefully employ all of the people who are capable and desirous of working. Despite what some have called the ''economic miracle'' that has transformed the island into an urban, high-tech society, unemployment in Puerto Rico remains at over 20 percent.  It appears that in a search for better employment opportunities, Puerto Ricans who migrate to the States no longer make a long-term commitment to remain but move back and forth depending on the job market - a social phenomenon termed ''circular migration.'' The issue of employment for Puerto Ricans must therefore be addressed both on the island and on the mainland. Puerto Ricans in the States have an unemployment rate approaching that of blacks, so the unemployment problem in Puerto Rico will not simply be solved by migration to the States.

Sounds like an innocuous observation","excerpt":"in reality, those words are a sneaky salesman's way of asking a young person: ''Tell me, now, if there's somebody else you have to consult before buying.''   ''How'd you hear about us?'' According to Steve Salerno, in an article in Highwire, the national student magazine published in Lowell, Mass., the hidden meaning of that piece of sales language is: ''Were you recommended? If so, I can probably get away with charging you more.''   ''Have you been looking for (the product) for very long?'' That means: ''Do you have other price information I'm going to have to contend with, or are you a novice?'' The author also tells young people to keep an ear open for sales euphemisms. For example, no smooth salesman says, ''Let's sign the contract''; rather, the archly offhand words are Let's approve the agreement, or authorize the paperwork, or O.K. the forms.   While I had Highwire on the wire, I inquired about the latest teen-age talk. Are teen-agers still calling parents rents?

The rest is spent on a single category: residential construction. And more than two-thirds of this category consists of a building type that's so ordinary it's almost invisible -- the single-family house.   About one million new single-family houses are built annually across the country, the vast majority by merchant builders. Though there are currently about 120,000 individual builders in the United States, American housing is marked by uniformity rather than diversity.

However, he unwittingly falls prey to the myth he attempts to debunk. \\"Every year,\\" he states, \\"a Federal housing donation of close to $40 billion\\" -- in the form of tax abatements -- \\"is awarded to millions earning more than $50,000 annually.\\" He refers to this group as the \\"$50,000-plus neediest.\\"   Since when does a household of four, earning $50,000 annually have the same ability to afford housing, not to mention other of life's essentials, such as child care, as a similar household earning two to three times more? And why point to households earning as little as $50,000 annually as being somehow too wealthy to deserve tax abatements?   By implicitly lumping households earning $50,000 annually with those earning significantly more, Professor DeMott fails to acknowledge the vast differences in life style of the two groups. When the median price of a home in certain metropolitan areas has soared to close to $200,000, and when a year of full-time day care can cost as much as $12,000 a child, an annual income of $50,000 does not make a man rich.

For Kitty, who swished in Georgian finery into the Rivoli on Saturday, is a cat of the same general character as the more renowned Restoration courtesan. She is a saucy and buxom London hussy—politely labeled a guttersnipe—who ascends within the staggering space of two years to be the Duke of Malmunster's wife, dropping one rich but low-born husband (whom she married for his money) on the way, and finally achieves (after the duke's death) the love of a youthful, handsome lord.Also, like Amber, this Kitty accomplishes her amoral victories through a rather forward demonstration of her allegedly irresistible charms, and she stops not at marital insincerity—within the limits, of course, of the screen's production code. To be sure, she excites the bucks of London during the eighteenth-century reign of George III, while Amber was cutting her didoes a good hundred years before. But what's a mere difference in costumes? Kitty and Amber are sisters under their coiffures.However, the precedence of Kitty need not disturb the Amber hopes too much, for the character here presented is a rather flat and unbeguiling one. In the beginning, when Sir Hugh Marcy meets her as a model in Gainsborough's studio, there is promise of fireworks and excitement in her skullery-maid sassiness. But as soon as Sir Hugh starts to teach her a fine lady's manners and airs in order to advance his own fortunes through her contacts, her spirit grows dull. The contacts are made, Kitty prospers and Sir Hugh, a callous rake, does all right—but the plotting is purely mechanical and the characters are mostly stuffed costumes.This goes, at least, for Paulette Goddard as Kitty and Ray Milland as Sir Hugh. The former is pompous and posey, the latter is biasé and bored. Miss Goddard, except for one sequence in which she tries to learn the art of the fan, performs with a curious lack of humor and an excess of showgirl hauteur. And Mr. Milland, whose role as a peacock and deadbeat is slightly odious, wears his costumes very handsomely, but wearily lets it go at that.Constance Collier is excellent, however, in a small but incisive role as Sir Hugh's blowsy aunt, and Reginald Owen is amusing as the elderly duke. Indeed, through these two—and especially through the dim-witted character of the duke—Mitchell Leisen, the director, has captured the one trace of comment in the film: that is an acid tinge of mockery of the aristocratic class.Otherwise this picture is a compound of elegant costumes, exquisite sets—really museum replicas of Georgian interiors—extra-crowded tableaux, actors with Hollywood airs and a slightly-sullied Cinderella, whom Amber can fade with one wave.

The idea that the mind can influence the body's response to disease (and vice versa) has had a long and at times controversial history. In ''The Pursuit of Health,'' June Bingham, a writer, and Norman Tamarkin, a psychiatrist, travel two steps farther in the quest to determine ''why one person gets sick and another doesn't or why someone gets sick today and not tomorrow.'' To ''mind'' and ''body'' they add ''other people'' and ''the environment'' as factors that directly influence our state of well-being. They have constructed a model that integrates these four dimensions around a core, the ''intimate connector,'' that is the central force responsible for a patient's will to live or will to health. The authors cite examples of people who, against all odds and for reasons that defy clinical explanation, have survived an illness far beyond the expectations of their doctors. The book also includes six case histories that exemplify ways in which attention to dimensions other than the one causing the illness was the turning point in the patient's recovery. For example, a young woman who was suicidal (mind) is given a prescription for exercise and an enriched diet to improve her health (body) so she can begin to work on the weakened relationships (other people) that caused her illness in the first place. The message for physicians is that when examining patients, they should look well beyond the symptoms that brought the patient to them in the first place.

(Norton, $18.95.) Alzheimer's disease, believed to afflict over two million middle-aged and older Americans, has been called the silent epidemic. But in recent years this condition has been widely publicized, and the availability of information and other resources for patients' families has greatly increased. Among the latest contributions is this book by Donna Cohen, a professor of geriatrics in the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Carl Eisdorfer, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Miami School of Medicine, who for over 15 years have studied the disorder and worked with patients and their families. Intended mainly to assist families caring for members who have Alzheimer's disease, the book deals with psychological, logistical, biomedical, legal and financial issues. It does not shy from such sensitive topics as the sexuality of patients and their partners, the possibility of suicide among disease victims and the risk of serious depression in care givers. Material on the interaction of family members with patients and among themselves is a particular strength of the book. Almost without exception, the authors provide concrete advice without being dogmatic. Thus they present many guidelines (often in the convenient form of lists) and useful facts, even as they emphasize again and again, both explicitly and through many anecdotes about patients and their families, that every situation is different and no single right formula exists.

Of course, on certain religious feast days one can still find Peruvian Indians in the mountains in just such angel costumes (without the rifles), but their predecessors have been preserved in magnificent paintings, reproduced -- along with an astonishing array of art produced in oil, metals, wood and textiles for 300 years -- in CAMBIOS: The Spirit of Transformation in Spanish Colonial Art (Santa Barbara Museum of Art/University of New Mexico; cloth, $50; paper, $25). Two curators of a show organized by the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, Gabrielle Palmer and Donna Pierce, give overviews of art in the Viceroyalty of Peru (all of South America except Brazil) and the Viceroyalty of New Spain (Central America, Mexico and parts of the United States). But it is the descriptions of individual works that, taken together, fill one with wonder at the lavishness, vitality and great endurance of the artistic genius that flowed through the old Spanish empire, making the gold and gems Europe fought over seem tawdry in comparison. Mexican painters like Juan Correa and Miguel Cabrera certainly knew contemporary European standards, but their work blazes with light, passion and wisdom that express their own visions of the great civilization rising around them. And the anonymous casters and carvers of silver Peruvian incense burners in the forms of turkeys, peacocks and armadillos knew all that Cellini knew, and more. This book is not a heavy history, but a sweet breeze of inspiration that fills one with humility and delight, and perhaps some somber reflection on the blind arrogance of people who refer to these lands now as \\"third world.\\" D.
