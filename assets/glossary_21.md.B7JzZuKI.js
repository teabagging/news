The Week Ahead"},{"year":"1984","title":"Long-term interest rates closed yesterday at their highest levels since early August, as investors and speculators remained fearful of higher rates still to come and were reluctant buyers of Treasury notes and bonds.     The 12 percent Treasury bond due in 2013, which dropped more than a point in Monday's trading, declined by more than 1/4 point yesterday, and was traded late in the day at 98 9/32, to yield 12.21 percent. Earlier in the day, the price of the bellwether Treasury bond was firm, but dealers said investor buying was not strong and added that late selling in the futures market, plus disappointing investor demand for a $1 billion issue of five-year debentures of the Federal National Mortgage Association, led to lower prices for the bond issue.    Some of the caution shown by investors in long-term issues can be attributed to the recent increases in short-term rates, especially the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market, which is a benchmark for other short-term rates. Federal funds traded around 9 11/16 percent yesterday, down from an average of 9.81 percent Monday.

Although the electronics industry offers little hope of a battery that lasts forever, it is investing heavily in the development of small power cells that last far longer than those currently in wide use. In the next decade, many experts believe, most portable electronic devices will be equipped with batteries designed to last as long as the devices themselves.

Gardere's touchdown passes included two in a span of 53 seconds. Keith Cash caught a 5-yard scoring pass, his second of the game, with 12 minutes 42 seconds to play. After Stanley Richard intercepted a Matt Vogler pass, Gardere hit Mike Davis in stride with a 55-yard scoring strike.

In her new act, the singer even offers a word, saudades, (pronounced saw-DAJ) to describe that aura. It is a Portuguese term, she says, that denotes a nostalgia for something that may never have existed.   Ms. Marcovicci's new show revels in saudades, a mood that is very easy to feel in the cozy, oak-paneled music room of a hotel already wreathed in literary legend. Weaving quotations from E. B.

Once in a while, a good novel turns into an even better movie. Based on the first section of John Irving's ''Widow for One Year,'' this wistful romantic drama is about an unhappy couple in the Hamptons. Jeff Bridges gives a brilliant performance as Ted Cole, a self-involved, semi-alcoholic children's book author and illustrator. He and his wife, Marion (Kim Basinger, who seems exhausted from having been beautiful for so long), have never recovered from the deaths of their teenage sons, even though they went on to have a beautiful little girl (Elle Fanning, above, with Mr. Bridges). The marriage is falling apart just as a teenage boy (Jon Foster) arrives to be Ted's assistant for the summer. And, as it turns out, to have an affair with Marion. Tod Williams directed.    THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY (1954)  Sunday at 8 p.m. and Sunday/Early Monday at 1:30 a.m. on AMC.  This John Wayne disaster-flick prototype has been out of circulation for decades but is back in a newly restored print. Wayne (far left, with Claire Trevor and Robert Stack) plays an aging airline pilot, wracked with guilt over a fatal plane crash. He runs into trouble again, on a flight from Honolulu to San Francisco, but this time only he has the courage to save the day. Who knew that passengers in the 1950's had to give their names, birthplaces and ages when they checked in at the airport? It's certainly an efficient way to introduce the characters. William A. Wellman directed. Dimitri Tiomkin's Oscar-winning score is grand.    BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S (1961)  Wednesday at 8 p.m. on TCM.  That opening shot never gets old: the young Audrey Hepburn, as the blissfully eccentric Holly Golightly, in a black evening dress and a sky-high French twist, gazing serenely into the windows of Tiffany's Fifth Avenue store. Hepburn (right, with George Peppard, left, and Martin Balsam) may not have been Truman Capote's first choice (or second or 99th) to play the heroine of his novella, but to moviegoers she is the only Holly who counts. She lives in New York with a nameless cat","excerpt":"longs for her faraway brother, Fred, and a rich husband; and accepts more money from men than a nice girl should. Eventually she allows herself to fall in love with a young writer (Peppard), who, in Capote's version, shows every sign of being gay. Blake Edwards directed.    THE BIG RED ONE (1980)  Saturday at 8 p.m. on Spike.  This powerful small-scale drama about five foot soldiers in World War II is that rare animal: an almost cheerful war movie. Lee Marvin (left), Mark Hamill, Robert Carradine, Bobby Di Cicco and Kelly Ward play the deliberately ordinary soldiers, whom the film follows from the landing at Omaha Beach to the end in 1945. Samuel Fuller, who based the film on his own wartime experiences, wrote and directed.

Mr. Dunne's story is based on an actual murder case in which a suspect was a  nephew of Ethel Skakel Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy's widow. That took place in Connecticut 20 years ago. Mr. Dunne maintains that Thomas Skakel was never thoroughly questioned by the police because of his father's powerful influence.

A1    The United States military said it has cleared of any wrongdoing a commander who led a raid March 15 on a home in Ishaqi, north of Baghdad, that left as many as nine Iraqis dead and prompted the police to charge that American forces executed civilians.

It took 15 years of agitating, but finally it would pass, and New York City would extend basic civil rights protections to homosexuals in legislation that banned discrimination based on sexual preference in housing, employment and public accommodations. The City Council approved it 21 to 14, and many predicted that disaster would follow.

The screenwriter Caroline Thompson (\\"Edward Scissorhands,\\" \\"The Secret Garden\\"), making her directorial debut, takes a cue from Anna Sewell's well-loved 1877 novel (which is subtitled \\"The Autobiography  of a Horse\\") and goes well beyond that book's horse-centric point of view.         So Ms. Thompson affords her four-legged hero extreme sensitivity, especially  by horse standards. Black Beauty is heard cataloguing his feelings in exquisite  detail. With a thoroughness to rival David Copperfield's, he even begins his story at the moment of birth. Later on, he falls in love, dreams about his mother, rhapsodizes about oats and complains bitterly about wearing a harness with a bit.

The playwright does not primarily blame society for urban ills but individuals who victimize themselves through fear of retaliation or self-induced blindness. When people are faced with a threat, it is easy but also risky to turn one's back and walk away.   In this play on the main stage at the Long Wharf Theater, a prospering middle-class black man named Mickey is suddenly confronted with a senseless attack on his teen-age son. That sends him on a mind trek to his own boyhood in the Bronx in 1968. He believes that this was the year that the borough died. It was also, of course, the year that the Rev.

The Odds and the Woodies, two bands on a triple bill at the Grand on Wednesday night, happily look back to the Beatles, a band whose style is so regularly revived -- by the Raspberries in the early 1970's and Squeeze well into the 1980's, among many others -- that it's easy to forget how many different strands of music the Beatles pulled together and twisted. The trick is to recapture the relative innocence of the mid-1960's without sounding too naive or self-conscious.    Both the Odds and the Woodies write melodic, generally midtempo pop songs with unexpected chromatic twists and carefully placed bits of vocal harmony. But the Odds, from Vancouver, are far less archival. Drawing on Squeeze as much as on the Beatles, the band plays concise arrangements, often with bass, drums and guitar in crisp unison, their low-slung chords making plenty of room for the vocals. From both Squeeze and the Beatles, the Odds learned to match genial melodies to slightly barbed lyrics.

Nothing about the Requiem is obvious, and the conductor rarely let us get close enough to find out even that.   Though the Requiem is often referred to with great reverence as a musical last will and testament, it was left unfinished and was completed by Mozart's student Franz Xaver Sussmayer. It is extraordinarily formal, archaic and distant, full of Baroque mannerisms, fugal imitations, choral declarations.

Take an early trip out to the pyramids, where you can succumb to the implorations of the wily old camel drivers and, for about $2, ride into the desert on a Bedouin saddle mounted on a lumpy beast. It's a bit corny, but it's fun, and a picture of a grumpy camel rising to its feet with you aboard will be a perennial lesson in humility. The hotels range from places like the Nile Hilton, where a double costs about $60 a day and a single about $50, to stark pensions where the rate is under $10. A hotel room with air-conditioning is recommended. Most of the big hotels have a variety of restaurants and coffee shops. Cairo is not a gourmet's paradise, but there are decent restaurants - the Arabesque, Carroll's, Estoril and the expensive Swissair Chateau (about $50 dollars for two). A place called Felfela's in downtown Cairo serves traditional Egyptian food; a full meal with beverage runs about $5.
