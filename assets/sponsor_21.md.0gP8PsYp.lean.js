It wasn't easy. Like most Mallarme readers, Mr. Wilmarth had problems with the inscrutable texts. On a teaching job in California, he pored over the translations for several months. At first responding to the external images they conjured up, he finally discovered ''that the poems had a common denominator, Mallarme's own separateness.''   ''His imagination and reverie meant more to him than anything that was actually of the world,'' Mr. Wilmarth said.

A State Supreme Court justice issued an order on Wednesday barring the business from opening because of concerns over the dry-cleaning agent perchloroethylene. Another hearing is scheduled for Jan.  19 . . . GOING, GOING . . . : ABC No Rio, the Lower East Side performance space that has been fighting to remain at 156 Rivington Street, appears to be one step closer to eviction. A City Council committee rejected the avant-garde art group's proposal to develop low-income housing in the building. Instead, the Council agreed to turn over the building to Asian-Americans for Equality, an organization that plans to convert the building to apartments . . . EIGHT TREES, HOLD THE LIGHTS: It took five years, but neighborhood advocates have succeeded in bringing greenery to the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District. Local residents, joined by Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern, planted eight trees along West Broadway. The Grand-Canal Park Group had persuaded the Landmarks Preservation Commission to bend rules that bar street trees in the historic district. Foliage was never a part of the former manufacturing quarter's streetscape, the commission had argued . . . RESTAURANT WOE: Labor unrest at Chinatown's Silver Palace restaurant has been quelled, but troubles at the Jing Fong Restaurant on  Elizabeth Street are heating up. The Chinese Staff and Workers Association has announced plans for daily protests and a boycott at Jing Fong, Chinatown's largest eating place, which it says is openly violating labor laws. According to the State Attorney General, Jing Fong owes its employees $1.1 million in back wages and tips . . . SOUND OF SILENCE: A self-styled mosque at 247 West 99th Street has moved out after an out-of-court settlement with the landlord, the Red Apple Group. Neighbors complained that the mosque amplified calls to prayer, blared radios and sometimes hurled invectives.

SUITS FOR SITES TM Park Avenue Associates says its building at 315 Park Avenue South could go bankrupt because of a special state law canceling a nine-year lease there. So TM Park is suing to overturn the law, part of a plan to move the state optometry college from Park to CUNY's building  on 42d Street, while CUNY would go to the B. Altman building. Other new uncertainties in the plan: CUNY is looking at other sites, and retailers may be  interested in Altman's. . . . VOICE-MAIL DERAILED: As of noon last Monday, callers to the 24th Precinct's main telephone number got a human being, not the  precinct's unpopular voice-mail system. Eventually, anyway: one caller waited about 15 rings before giving up on a weekday afternoon. The voice-mail system, a departmental pilot program, was transferred to the 45th Precinct in the Bronx. . . . ON THE PLATE AT THE SILVER PALACE: The sprawling Chinatown restaurant, which filed for bankruptcy in January following a long labor dispute, may come under new management if its creditors and workers have their way. Last week, creditors and the 318 Restaurant Workers Union asked a United States Bankruptcy Judge to appoint a special trustee to operate the restaurant. A hearing is scheduled for  Nov. 22.
