The study found that college-educated officers were significantly less likely than officers with no college to receive civilian complaints for assaults on people or suspects, abuse of authority, discourteous behavior and religious or racial prejudice. For example, the statistics showed that 12 percent of the officers with some college had at least one complaint for unnecessary force, compared to 17.7 percent of the subjects with a high school-equivalency dip-loma.
