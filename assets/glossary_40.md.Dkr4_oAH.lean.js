Indeed, as the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, told Congress last week, \\"there is very little evidence throughout this economy of any degree of slowdown.\\" Mr. Greenspan, who only a little more than a year ago was complaining of powerful forces holding back the economy, added that \\"the 50-mile-an-hour headwinds have disappeared\\" and that the real worry today is inflation.

SUCCESS SURPRISES ITALY","excerpt":"People Cheered by the Sudden Drive to Bengazi"},{"year":"1993","title":"To control medical costs and provide secure coverage to all, President Clinton has proposed a vast restructuring of the health care system, to be phased in over several years. The proposal would use financial incentives to encourage consumers to join low-cost health maintenance organizations, and would push doctors, hospitals and insurers to join together in networks. The strategy is to make consumers conscious of the true cost of their care and, by fostering competition among plans, to force the plans to cut costs and offer better service. If competition does not drive down costs, mandatory ceilings on the growth of insurance premiums would aim to keep total spending in line with the growth of the economy. The Overseer A seven-member National Health Board, appointed by the President, would monitor state compliance and the functioning of health alliances, interpret the standard benefit package and make recommendations about new benefits to reflect changing technology and needs, and set regional medical spending ceilings. It would develop indicators of the quality of service and care offered by health plans and publicize the results to promote informed consumer choices. A committee would monitor drug prices, raising quesions to the pharmaceutical companies about those drugs it deems unreasonably expensive. The Payers EMPLOYERS Would pay the bulk of the cost. The plan requires them to pay at least 80 percent of the average cost of premiums in their region, and to support family coverage for married workers. EMPLOYEES Would contribute an average of 20 percent toward their own insurance premiums, plus any required deductibles or co-payments. SELF-EMPLOYED AND NON-WORKERS Would be required to buy insurance, paying the full cost of premiums, unless they qualify for government subsidies. The cost would be fully tax deductible. Currently, only 25 percent of the cost is tax deductible. GOVERNMENT Would subsidize costs for many small and low-wage businesses and for individuals (like part-time workers and the unemployed) who have incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line. Medicare payments would continue for the elderly and disabled. Medicaid would continue to pay for the poor, but through health alliances. LARGE CORPORATIONS Woudl have the option to negotiate directly with insurers for their employees' coverage, but would still be required to pay at least 80 percent of employees' premiums. The Brokers HEALTH ALLIANCES The core of the plan. Run by the states under Federal scrutiny, these regional purchasing groups would collect and distribute premiums, certify health plans and offer them to consumers, insure that average premiums grow no faster than Federally set limits, collect and publish data on performance of health plans and negotiate with local doctors and hospitals to set fees for service provided outside H.M.O.'s. ACCESS: All citizens and legal residents would be covered. COST: Alliances would determine a target range for average premiums charged by plans in its area. Plans would not be eligible if their charges were higher than the range. ELIGIBLE PLANS: Alliances would write a contract with any plan that met state requirements. OPTIONS: Alliances would offer a range of medical plans of three types: an H.M.O., a fee-for-service plan, or a combination of the two. Patients could not be turned away unless a plan is oversubscribed. QUALITY: Alliances would publish information to help consumers compare the service and the medical performance of various plans. SIZE: Alliance size would be based on population, so the number of alliances in each state would vary. Large cities would have one alliance. STRUCTURE: Alliance structure would be determined by states. Could function as nonprofit corporations or state agencies, but consumers and employers would have to be equally represented in the management of the alliance. CORPORATE ALLIANCES If these employers decided to negotiate directly with insurers and form their own alliances, they would still have to offer the guaranteed benefits package and a choice of plans, though their employeees might have fewer providers to choose from. The Options Most alliances would offer a large selection of plans, but all must include at least one fee-for-service option offering free choice of doctors. The administration estimates that the average plan cost would be $1,800 a year for an individual and $4,200 for a family, but costs would vary by region. Plans of any type would vary in prices","excerpt":"people choosing costlier ones would pay a higher share of premiums. Plans could offer supplemental policies covering items like extra dental or mental health benefits; employers could choose to pay for these or consumers could buy them with after-tax dollars. H.M.O. The least-expensive option. Patients sign up with a health maintenance organization and only consult doctors affiliated with that organization. Subscribers typically pay only $10 for an office visit. If they visit a doctor outside the plan, they pay 40 percent of the bill. Combination Plan The middle option. Patients sign up with a group for most of their care, but reserve the right to consult outside doctors by paying 20 percent of the fee for those visits. Fee For Service The most expensive option, offering the widest choice of doctors. Patients can see any doctor they choose, but must pay deductibles ($200 for an individual and $400 for a family and 20 percent of the cost of office visits and hospitalization, up to a limit of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family. The Benefits All Americans would be issued a \\"health security card\\" that would enable them to receive the guaranteed benefits listed below. Dental: Preventive care for children. Adult benefits phased in by 2000. Drugs: Prescriptions. Eye & Ear: Routine vision and hearing examinations; eyeglasses for children only. Extended Care: Nursing homes or rehabilitation centers (as an alternative to hospital stays). Maximum of 100 days each year. Home Care: As an alternative to hospitalization; re-evaluated every 60 days. Hospice Care: for terminally-ill people. Hospital Stays: Semi-private room; private rooms only when medically necessary. Mental Health: Limited psychotherapy; limited inpatient services and psychiatric hospital stays.

A Consumer's Guide: How Different Groups Would Be Affected Working, with good insurance Many employees would see little difference, especially if they have already joined an H.M.O., and some would have more plans to choose from. Workers opting for free choice of doctors would often pay more up front toward premiums and have higher costs as they received care. Companies would be required to pay 80 percent of average premium costs, but could pay more if they wished. If currently offered, company-sponsored benefits beyond those in the standard package remain tax-free to employee for 10 years. Working, uninsured Employers would be required to contribute and employees would be required to purchase coverage, paying 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium, less if they chose a cheaper one. Workers would receive subsidy toward their share, on a sliding scale, if family income is below 150 percent of the poverty line. (The poverty line in 1992 was $14,340 for a family of four; 150 percent of that is $21,500.) Nonworkers or Unemployed Those with little income would pay little to keep full coverage; those with unearned family income would contribute on a sliding scale, paying full cost of premium if income exceeds 250 percent of the poverty line.  Part-time workers Employers would contribute toward premiums for those working from 10 hours to 30 hours a week on a pro-rated basis. Depending on total family income from all sources and eligibility for subsidies, workers pay the remainder. In general, those who have purchased individual policies in the past would benefit from cheaper large-group rates. Self-employed Self-employed individuals would pay under a complex formula that treats them like a small business, potentially eligible for subsidies, and an employee. As contribution toward the employer share -- 80 percent of average premium cost -- they would pay from 3.5 percent to a maximum of 7.9 percent of business income, depending on income level. They would also pay employee's 20 percent share, or less if family income was below 150 percent of poverty. Combined payments would approach full cost of premium at income of about $30,000. All premium payments would be tax-deductible, compared to 25 percent now.  Two-earner families In most cases entire family would sign up for same plan, but spouses may be allowed to join different ones. Each of the two employers would contribute, and each earner, but the two earners together would not pay more than the normal family share -- 20 percent of the cost if they chose an average-priced premium. Whether most families would pay more or less than now depends on many factors. Household employee For those working more than 10 hours a week and considered an employee by Social Security, employer would make a contribution based on wages, ranging from 3.5 percent of annual wages under $12,000 to 7.9 percent of $24,000. Employees would pay the remainder with subsidies for families below 150 percent of the poverty line. Retiree, under 65 The Government would subsidize retirees not yet eligible for Medicare. If not covered by former employer or pension plan, they could get coverage through the alliance and pay only 20 percent of the cost of an average premium, as though they were employed. Part-time work or a spouse's earnings would alter the subsidies. Medicare recipient The elderly would continue to receive the same benefits, plus new prescription drug and home-care coverage. States have option of bringing Medicare beneficiaries into health alliance, but only if benefits equal or better current coverage and a fee-for-service plan is offered. Monthly premiums would rise, especially for affluent retirees. Once alliances are established, people turning 65 have option of remaining in former health plan, paying any difference between Medicare contribution and plan cost.  Medicaid recipients Poor people on Medicaid would receive mainstream medicine, signing up for a plan through the alliance. In most cases the Federal and state governments would make set payments to the health plan, rather than paying providers on a per-service basis with a fee schedule as in the past. Recipients could choose any plan with premium at or below the regional average without making additional payment.  Student Students attending school full-time in a distant location, but covered under their family's policy, would sign up for coverage through the alliance where they attend school. A portion of family and employer premium payments would be transferred from the home alliance to the alliance providing coverage.  Illegal immigrants Not eligible for coverage through the health alliances, but could still receive emergency and other care as they do now. A New Framework for Health Care"},{"year":"1993","title":"To control medical costs and provide secure coverage to all, President Clinton has proposed a vast restructuring of the health care system, to be phased in over several years. The proposal would use financial incentives to encourage consumers to join low-cost health maintenance organizations, and would push doctors, hospitals and insurers to join toether in networks. The strategy is to make consumers conscious of the ture cost of their care and, by fostering competition among plans, to force the plans to cut costs and offer better service. If competition does not drive down costs, mandatory ceilings on the growth of insurance premiums would aim to keep total spending in line with the growth of the economy. THE OVERSEER A seven-member National Health Board, appointed by the President, would monitor state compliance and the functioning of health alliances, interpret the standard benefit package and make recommendations about new benefits to reflect changing technology and needs, and set regional medical spending ceilings. It would develop indicators ofthe quality of service and care offered by health plans and publicize the results to promote informed consumer choices. A committee would monitor drug prices, raising questions to the pharmaceutical companies about those drugs it deems unreasonably expensive. THE PAYERS Employers: Would pay the bulk of the cost. The plan requires them to pay at least 80 percent of the average cost of premiums in thier region, and to support family coverage for married workers. Employee: Would contribute an average of 20 percent toward their own insurance premiums, plus any required deductibles or co-payments. Self-Employed and Nonworkers: Would be required to buy insurance, paying the full cost of premiums, unless they qualify for government subsidies. The cost would be fully tax deductible. Currently only 25 percent of the cost is tax deductible. Government: Would subsidize costs for many small and low-wage businesses and for individuals (like part-time workers and the unemployed) who have incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line. Medicare payments would continue for the elderly and disabled. Medicaid would continue to pay for the poor, but through health alliances. Large Corporations: Would have the option to negotiate directly with insurers for their employees' coverage, but would still be required to pay at least 80 percent of employees' premiums. THE BROKERS Health Alliances: The core of the plan. Run by the states under Federal scrutiny, these regional purchasing groups would collect and distribute premiums, certify health plans and offer them to consumers, insure that average premiums grow no faster than Federally set limits, collect and publish data on performance of health plans and negotiate with local doctors and hospitals to set fees for services provided outside H.M.O.'s Access: All citizens and legal resident would be covered. Cost: Alliances would determine a target range for average premiums charged by plans in its area. Plans would not be eligible if their charges were higher than the range. Eligible Plans: Alliances would write a contract with any plan that met state requirements. Options: Alliances would offer a range of medical plans of three types: an H.M.O., a fee-for-service plan, or a combination of the two. Patients could not be turned away unless a plan is overshubscribed. Quality: Allance would publich information to help consumers compare the service and the medical perfomance of various plans. Size: Alliance size would be based on population, so the number of alliances in each state would vary. Structure: Alliance structure would be determined by states. Could function as nonprofit corporations or state agencies, but consumers and employers would have to be equally represented in the management of the alliance Corporate Alliances: If these employers decided to negotiate directly with insurers and form their won alliances, they would still have to offer the guaranteed benefits package and a choice of plans, though their employees might have fewer providers to choose from. THE OPTIONS Most alliances would offer a large selection of plans, but all must include at least one fee-for-service options offering free choice of doctors. The administration estimates that the average plan cost would be $1,932 a year for an individual and $4,360 for a family, but costs would vary by region. Plans of any type would vary in price","excerpt":"people choosing costlier ones would pay a higher share of premiums. Plans could offer supplemental policies, covering items like extra dental or mental health benefits; employers could choose to pay for these or consumers could buy them with after-tax dollars. H.M.O.: The least-expensive option. Patients sign up with a health maintenance organization and only consult doctors affiliated with that organization. Subsribers typically pay only $10 for an office visit. If they visit a doctor outside the plan, they pay a share of the bill. Combination Plan: The middle option. Patients sign up with a group for most of their care, but reserve the right to consult outside doctors by paying 20 percent of the fee for those visits. Fee For Service: The most expensive option, offering the widest choice of doctors. Patients can see any doctor they choose, but must pay deductibles ($200 for an individual and $400 for a family) and 20 percent of the cost of office visits and hospitalization, up to a limit of $1,500 for an individual and $3,000 for a family. THE BENEFITS All Americans would be issued a \\"health security card\\" that would enable them to receive the guaranteed benefits listed below. Dental: Most care for children. Adult preventive benefits phased in by 2000. Drugs: Prescriptions Eye & Ear: Routing vision and hearing examinations; eyeglasses for children only. Extended Care: Nursing homes or rehabilitation centers (as an alternative to hospital stays). Maximum of 100 days each year. Home Care: As an alternative to hospitalization; re-evaluated every 60 days. Hospice Care: For terminally-ill people. Hospital Stays: Semi-private room; private rooms only when medically necessary. Mental Health: Limited psychotherapy; limited inpatient services and psychiatric hospital stays. Office Visits: Professional services, emergency care and other outpatient hospital services; laboratory tests and ambulance. Medical Equipment: Braces, artificial limbs or prosthetic devices, when equipment improves functional abilities or prevents futher deterioration. Outpatient Therapy: Physical, occupational or speech therapy to restore skills lost from illness or injury. Re-evaluated every 60 days. Preventive care: Immunizations, mammograms, Pap smears, prenatal care and cholesterol screening. Substance Abuse: Limited outpatient and inpatient services. The plan excludes services that are not \\"medically necessary or appropraite,\\" citing cosmetic orthodontia, hearing aids, contact lenses, sex-change surgery and in-vitro fertilization as examples of such services.

Non-Worker or Unemployed: Those with little income would pay little to keep full coverage; those with uneraned family income would contribute on a sliding scale, paying full cost if income exceeds 250 percent of the poverty line. Part-Time Worker: Employers would contribute toward premiums for those working from 10 hours to 30 hours a week on a prorated basis. Depending on total family income from all sources and eligibility for subsidies, workers pay the remainder. In general, those who have purchased individual policies in the past would benefit from cheaper large-group rates. Self-Employed: Self-employed individuals would pay under a complex formula that treats them like a small business, potentially eligible for subsidies, and an employee.

Employees would pay the remainder with subsidies for families below 150 percent of the poverty line. Early Retiree: Initially, early retirees not yet eligible for Medicare would have guaranteed access to insurance at community-wide rates. Beginning in 1998, the Government would pay 80 percent of the cost of an average premium for all but the most affluent people. Part-time work or a spouse's earning would alter this subsidy. Medicare Recipient: The elderly would continue to receive the same benefits, plus new prescription drug and home-care coverage. States have the option of bringing Medicare beneficiaries into health alliance, but only if benefits equal or are better than current coverage and a fee-for-service plan is offered.

Like Elvis's (late Vegas period) oversize belt buckle, Louis Armstrong's handkerchief, James Brown's conked kinks and the omnipresent scarf that Aerosmith's Steven Tyler clings to when he sings, Mr. Clinton's shoes, no matter which ones he wears, are a show-biz-hyped distillation and projection of his style. And what a style: from a pair of five-inch-high platform sneakers to feathered, mid-calf-length, hand-stitched trapper boots.   Mr. Clinton, a former hairdresser in Newark who likes to wear his hair these days in a freaked-out, funny fright wig of braids, tresses and coiled multicolored yarn, was recently quoted in Interview magazine as saying, \\"I can wear any style -- or have no style -- and it doesn't bother me.\\" WHY: Funk feeds the deep nostalgia of inner-city baby boomers and the insatiable hunger of members of the hip-hop generation, who've sampled songs like Mr. Clinton's \\"Atomic Dog,\\" \\"Flash Light\\" and \\"P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)\\" with abandon and reverence. And thus Mr. Clinton is high-stepping the pace of his almost-30-year recording career.   A resurgence of 1970's-era disco and funk music is also sweeping the nation, stirring a storm of interest and dollars in Mr. Clinton's various musical incarnations, including his solo act and his role as leader of the eccentric Parliament-Funkadelic funk mob. Re-releases of early albums are planned, as well as a major Clinton tour, record executives said. ADDITIONAL CLINTON PROPS: Funky eye wear, diapers, United States Army-surplus fatigues, chains, rings, wacky T-shirts, knit caps, broad-brimmed hats, capes, cloaks, face paint and, of course, his concert flying saucer, the Mothership. SHOE-IN: Mr. Clinton's ability to transform the ordinary -- like the pair of boxing shoes -- into a highly personalized statement \\"speaks to his strength as an artist,\\" said Susan Nininger, the Los Angeles-based costume designer who was the stylist on Mr. Clinton's \\"Smell My Finger\\" album shot and provided the shoes.   \\"I was basically asked to bring the wildest stuff I could find and he would be able to wear it,\\" she continued. \\"I let my imagination go and meld with his outrageousness, and it worked.\\" CLINTON'S STYLE CREDO: \\"Colors don't clash","excerpt":"people do,\\" from Mr. Clinton's new single, \\"Paint the White House Black.\\" Godfather Of Sole"},{"year":"1995","title":"TAKEOVERS The Day Chrysler Fever Broke Two weeks ago, Chrysler's stock soared -- simply because one man, Kirk Kerkorian, said he wanted to buy the company. Since then, the stock has done a tentative dance, with doubts creeping in about the deal but investors, remembering the power of Mr. Kerkorian's 10 percent stake, not quite ready to bail out. But last week the company lashed out at its uninvited suitor, saying it had no interest in \\"gambling with Chrysler's future\\" and brushing off Mr. Kerkorian's request for a tripling of the dividend (which would add over $100 million to Mr. Kerkorian's annual income). For investors, that seemed to settle it, as the stock fell $2.50 on Wednesday, close to its pre-hysteria level, before creeping up again by week's end. THE ECONOMY  Slowing to a Steady Walk  Surprise! Interest rates went up -- thanks to the Federal Reserve -- and people stopped buying so much stuff. At the end of last year, Americans were still spending big, and the economy grew at a fast 5.1 percent pace -- just the type of too-frantic growth the Fed wanted to head off. But in this year's first quarter, reality set in, wallets closed -- well, part way -- and economic growth slowed to a 2.8 percent rate, the laziest in two years. Keeping things going were corporations that made big investments in equipment and buildings. All this was apparently fine with the stock market, as the Dow industrials kept bumping along to new records.  MUTUAL FUNDS  Follow the Money Trail  Mutual funds are where the nation's money is, so their vital signs provide good indicators of what, in an economic sense, is going on. If, that is, you can make sense of those vital signs. Last week came word that cash levels in stock funds were down to 7 percent -- the lowest in well over a decade. What's cash for? Basically, redemptions and safety. But with money flowing in and stocks rising, fund managers seem worried about neither. Fund cash is often what powers the market, though, so is this thin wallet worrisome? Not as long as new cash keeps coming -- which it certainly did recently, going into retirement accounts before the dreaded April 17.  THE WORKPLACE  Those Vanishing Benefits  Most employees already know this, of course: companies are getting stingier with benefits. Workers are paying a bigger share of health coverage or being nudged into H.M.O.'s, and must take greater responsibility for retirement through 401(k)'s and the like. But now it's official. A report last week showed that benefit costs for the first quarter showed the smallest rise in eight years. For the past year, in fact, benefit costs rose no faster than overall compensation -- again, for the first time in eight years. The overall report \\"confirms that there's no inflation push from wages,\\" said Labor Secretary Reich. It also confirms that the days of the all-giving, kindly-uncle employer are vanishing fast.  ANTITRUST  One Microsoft, Indivisible  Soon, no doubt, there'll be a Government agency called the Microsoft Department, or at least a Microsoft Division at the Justice Department. The giant company seems a perennial Washington topic. Just last week Justice officials were defending Microsoft one minute against being called monopolistic and then going to court to block its acquisition of Intuit, maker of Quicken personal-finance software, saying this dominance could lead to higher prices and fewer choices for consumers. No inconsistency, the agency said -- different legal issues. And there's no truth, by the way, to rumors that Microsoft is planning to acquire the Justice Department. Just the mint. BANKING  A Human Teller? Naw!  In the old days, we'll tell our grandchildren (by e-mail, of course), you actually saw people at bank windows, talked to human beings on the phone, not multiple-choice recordings. They'll smile an indulgent smile, then log on to their sixth-grade math class. It's true, though. Until late April of '95, you could walk into any bank and hand a teller a deposit. But then First Chicago said you had to pay $3 for that honor (unless you had $2,500 stagnating in a checking account) if you could have used an A.T.M. instead. A teller transaction, you see, costs 6 to 12 times what an A.T.M. transaction does, and they had to watch all those pennies. Even though, in yet older days, the world somehow muddled through with -- brace yourselves -- no A.T.M.'s at all.  ORANGE COUNTY  Mr. Citron Takes His Lumps  \\"The dog ate my homework\\" may work for a young scholar, but for grown-ups, \\"the broker ate my lunch\\" goes only so far. When you're managing a $7.4 billion government fund, as Robert Citron was in Orange County, you're ultimately responsible. For a while, Mr. Citron insisted he was just a blushing victim when the county lost $1.7 billion, blaming Merrill Lynch for leading him astray, but last week that excuse crumbled when he pleaded guilty to felonies like misappropriating funds and misleading investors. He could get up to 14 years in prison. In other words, derivatives don't make money vanish","excerpt":"people do.  INNER CITY  Bodegas vs. Pathmark  You can't win. In some people's view, the inner city perpetuates poverty partly because a lack of fair-priced supermarkets forces residents to shop at high-priced bodegas. But when a plan emerged for a Pathmark in East Harlem, opponents cried out that the store would hurt bodega owners. The plan seemed doomed right up to the last minute, but then a City Councilman switched sides and the Manhattan Borough Board approved it, the lure of low prices and added jobs apparently winning the day.  TECHNOLOGY  High-Tech Coffee Break  Sometimes we seem to be rushing headlong into a world with all the high-tech stuff jumbled together -- television shows coming out of phones, phone calls coming out of computers, information coming from just about anywhere. But occasionally the world pauses on this mad dash, as when Bell Atlantic decided last week to rethink its idea of offering video services to three million phone customers. Even though the company was well along in the F.C.C. approval process, it said its executives needed to \\"to catch our breath.\\" So does this point, as some suggested, to mounting confusion in this whole pile-up of technologies? Or does Bell Atlantic just want, as it says, to hold out for better fiber-optic technology? Stay, uh, tuned.  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION  And the Sons Did Homework  Thursday was Take Our Daughters to Work Day, a jubilant little affirmative-action idea cooked up a few years ago by the Ms. Foundation. Nationwide, perhaps six million girls played hooky to get a glimpse of the way the adult world works -- or at least the way it works with six million rosy little souls playing hopscotch in the staid hallways of commerce. But \\"affirmative action\\" is a dirty word these days -- O.K., two words -- so the glee is now tempered with dissension. Why were boys left out? They get precious little chance to watch Dad -- and Mom -- work. Not to mention that if they saw women doing all sorts of jobs, a lesson might sink in. Then again, why shouldn't girls hog the spotlight for a day? Then again . . . oh, who knows. DIARY"},{"year":"1994","title":"CORPORATIONS do not occupy apartments","excerpt":"people do.

Mr. Andropov, the new Soviet party leader, served in the Soviet Embassy in Budapest from 1953 to 1957, initially as a second-rank official, then as Ambassador.   Those were troubled times, marked by growing unrest, by the 1956 uprising and by the installation of Janos Kadar as head of the Hungarian Communist Party.   So were the years that followed. Mr. Kadar began evolving his program of economic decentralization, and Mr. Andropov, by then back in Moscow, was largely responsible for allowing him to develop the program in his position overseeing the Central Committee's dealings with Eastern Europe. Hungarians Willing to Talk   Mr. Andropov's tenure in Hungary gives his background a special quality. No other top Soviet leader since Lenin has ever lived outside the Soviet Union.

Mr. Bush, driving a small Japanese car with a 4-by-5-inch camera in the passenger seat and a small photographic strobe in the back, pulls up beside other cars and photographs their drivers as they cruise along. Not surprisingly, some people feel threatened by this invasion of the semipublic-semiprivate space of their cars. One driver was so incensed that he chased Mr. Bush for miles and, when he caught up with him at a stoplight, grabbed the keys of his car and demanded that he hand over the film.    However questionable Mr. Bush's method may seem from the point of view of traffic safety, the pictures that he brings back, a selection of which are presented in \\"Andrew Bush: Vector Portraits\\" at the Lieberman & Saul Gallery in SoHo, are both funny and fascinating. With his unorthodox approach, Mr. Bush has found an effective way of recording an important aspect of contemporary culture. Frequently he catches people in the strange trance state that freeway driving induces or glancing idly at the cars around them. At the same time, his large color prints reveal the visual connections between the way people and their cars look, lending support to the idea that you are what you drive.

Manhattan CENTRAL PARK: THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN   This 840-acre park, of almost transcendental importance to New Yorkers, is often described as the first example of a deliberately planned urban park in America. Today, it is like an engine gathering steam, a model for the public-private partnership many hope will save the city's parks.   Lord Chatham's famous declaration that \\"parks are the lungs of London,\\" might have been written for Central Park, a swath of green where some 15 million people come to breathe each year. They come as individuals to sit on grass and benches, or to be part of any number of events, from the New York Marathon to Shakespeare in the Park.   It was just two decades ago, as New York lay mired in a fiscal straitjacket, that Central Park appeared to be dying. Erosion was gnawing away at the park's increasingly brown skin, and floods were commonplace. Garbage was picked up, but all other maintenance had virtually stopped. Even the 36 famed stone arches and bridges -- none identical -- were falling apart.   In truth, while the overall Parks Department work force was cut 23 percent during the fiscal crisis, compared with an average of 13 percent in other city agencies, the deterioration of Central Park was not as serious as at other, less famous parks.   Still, Central Park was Central Park, and in 1979, Mayor Edward I. Koch named the park's most vocal advocate, Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, the first administrator of a city park. There was no salary and no budget. Mr. Koch explained, \\"You know something about fund raising.\\"   As it turned out, people were chomping at the bit to save the park. In its first 10 years, the Conservancy raised more than $50 million, a pace that seems downright laggardly compared with its success so far in the 1990's: to whit, Richard Gilder, a Conservancy trustee, offered the group a $17 million gift, on the condition it raise $17 million from other donors, and that the city contribute $17 million. The city has said yes.   This is not to say everything is perfect, although Ms. Rogers beams with pleasure about the renovation of the long-neglected northern end of the park, Harlem Meer. Cedar Hill, where dogs run, needs to be re-done. Ball fields are badly compacted, and need major drainage repairs. Meadows need to be replanted. Paths need repair.   But the fact is that Central Park has been able to weather a cut in its maintenance staff to 91 from 138.    \\"What we've built here is a system that will insure there's a future for the park,\\" Ms. Rogers said. RIVERSIDE PARK: PROGRESS, BIT BY BIT    Henry Hudson described this riverside ribbon of green as \\"very pleasant, very high and bold.\\" Well, you can't change that. But in recent years, the park has grown dirtier, a bit more menacing. Homeless people make homes in bushes, and two weeks ago, a woman was attacked in the park and defended herself with an ice pick.   There has also been an insidious dialectic at work. When Robert Moses redid the park in the 1930's, he spent far less money on the northern part than on the south. Despite several current capital projects to perk up the north, this perception -- and some of the reality -- persists.   But even as the park's workforce has fallen from 54 to 24 over the last five years, new procedures have helped to lessen the sting. One reform was to cut back shrubs in which people could live, an action that has saved three staff hours a day in the middle section of the park.   Other changes have included asking the various City Council members representing sections adjoining the park to allocate money from their portion of the city's capital budget for specific projects.   Other money comes from the Riverside Park Fund and -- in dribs and drabs -- from the city. People also pay for their own projects. For example, except for one summer attendant, the tennis courts at 95th Street are now totally maintained and operated by the Riverside Clay Tennis Association.    The 91st Street playground is similar. Parents raised $120,000 and Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge threw in $70,000. That was enough to hire a landscape architect and begin the job. The first step was to enlarge the pits around the dying pin oaks. Then, the inner part of the playground -- whimsical hippopotamus statues that spray water -- was installed. Other phases will be done as more money is raised.   The other day, Diane Englander, a business consultant who lives at 90th Street and Riverside Drive, was at the playground with her son.   \\"It's getting nicer,\\" she said of the park she loves. \\"There are more flowers, more trees, more improvements to the playground.\\" HIGH BRIDGE PARK:  A PERENNIAL PROBLEM    High on the cliffs overlooking the Harlem River and the Bronx, High Bridge Park has long been an example of the trials of maintaining a park that is tremendously important to its neighborhood but a long way, physically and economically, from City Hall.   In the mid-80's, Mr. Stern had ordered a huge cleanup of the park. Dozens of abandoned cars, hundreds of tires, refrigerators, several dead dogs and a human body were found amid the tangled brush.    On a rainy day five years later, at his last public ceremony in the Koch administration, he returned to announce a $1.2 million restoration of the park's landmark, High Bridge Tower, originally used to equalize pressure in the Croton Aqueduct. An arsonist's blaze had wrecked much of it. A homeless man died in the fire.   Today, despite a much-needed lift from three very active Little Leagues, whose participants regularly scrub graffiti and clean litter, it has become more and more difficult to keep up. Debris cast down the steep hill includes old stoves and refrigerators, furniture, any manner of automobile parts and sometimes whole cars.   \\"A lot of people seem not to be in tune with recycling here,\\" said Milton Rivera, the park's supervisor. \\"To them, recycling is dumping.\\"   Attendance, particularly when the fine pool is open, is up sharply, but the park's staff has slipped from 24 to 12 over the last four years. Major pedestrian gates must be locked so people don't drive their cars into the park","excerpt":"people must walk in smaller entrances, a bit out of the way. But the big problem is safety, in a park that continues to fight a bitter war of attrition with drugs. It seems somehow fitting that one of the six playgrounds is named for a police officer, Michael J. Buczek, killed nearby in 1988.   So it was that Mr. Stern returned last week to the park within blocks of his boyhood home. He remembered a spring on the side of a cliff. He led a visitor up the steep hill, and, sure enough, pure water still trickled from the earth. But litter was everywhere. He saw clothing and other evidence of a homeless person living in the base of the refurbished -- and locked -- tower.   \\"We need a massive cleaning effort, a full-scale assault,\\" Mr. Stern said to Mr. Rivera, who ordered his workers to begin work immediately, to uproot hundreds of tires from the vines and weeds. They were joined by dozens scores of reinforcements from other parks.   \\"He's doing as well as he could,\\" thw Commissioner said. \\"Maybe he could do 10 percent more, but this needs 1,000 percent.\\" BATTERY PARK: 'A FORLORN WAY STATION'    Battery Park, the first green space in a city cluttered almost from the time the first Dutch settlers arrived in 1625, should be one of the plums of the city. It is more like a shriveled raisin at Manhattan's southern tip.   Some benches are broken, all need repainting. Where grass should be, there is dirt and litter. A sign with a map and guide is so smeared with graffiti it is unreadable. There are potholes on the asphalt where people line up for boats to the Statue of Liberty.   \\"Battery Park is marred by a flawed design, inadequate maintenance and neglected landmarks,\\" wrote a group of concerned citizens in the process of forming a Battery Park Conservancy. The park, they concluded, is \\"a forlorn way station.\\" Warrie Price, who is heading the initial efforts to organize the Conservancy, said most of the 375,000 people who work within walking distance of Battery Park -- and the 14,000 predominately new residents who live nearby -- avoid the park because of its dreary appearance. For the 2.5 million passing through to visit Ellis Island and the statue, she says it is an even less pleasant wait.    The Conservancy's first step has been to prepare an architectural plan for redoing the park. It would refurbish the green space, totally rebuild the promenade and perhaps combine the monuments in a \\"Heroes Walk.\\"   Ms. Price said financing for the $30 million effort seems possible, at least in increments. The National Park Service, which owns Castle Clinton, is interested in replacing the roof -- lost to Robert Moses's never-built bridge to Brooklyn -- and turning the old fort into a new visitor center. Some $2 million in Federal money has been promised to rebuild the seawall. A business improvement district being formed for the downtown area is intensely interested in the project. There is her nascent conservancy.   Ms. Price foresees shade trees over visitors waiting for the boats. She delights over such artistic touches as the dolphins at the base of the elegant lights that have been designed. \\"It's in the birthing stage,\\" she said. The Bronx PELHAM BAY PARK: BIG SPACES, BIG NEEDS   Pelham Bay Park is the city's largest park, and one of the richest in resources. Within its 2,764 acres lie the elegant Bartow-Pell Mansion and Revolutionary War historic sites, two 18-hole golf courses and -- the centerpiece -- Orchard Beach, called \\"The Riviera of New York\\" after its completion a half-century ago.   It is also a park in need of help.   \\"I have never seen the park in as bad a condition as it is now,\\" said Marc Hohenstein, a sales representative who heads an enthusiastic but poor volunteer group called Friends of Pelham Bay Park.   The administrator, Linda Dockeray, takes some issue with such a negative view, pointing to a number of ways in which the park is doing more with less. But she readily concedes the park has deteriorated since she grew up a quarter century ago within walking distance of the park. \\"It just takes so long to get something done,\\" she said.   Ms. Dockeray shows a visitor areas her 28-worker crew has not been able to get to -- broken benches to eroded trails. Debris from the storm of December 1992 has not been picked up. The Bronx Victory Column, a favored place for wedding pictures, is crumbling.   But it is Orchard Beach where the wear and tear most shows. This 1.1-mile engineering feat -- built mainly on landfill -- has a beach of white sand, two picnic areas and a 45-acre parking lot. On weekend days, more than 32,000 people congregate to catch some rays, eat some hot dogs and dance to Latin music -- though this year plans call for other kinds of music to be added.   The beach has not undergone basic improvements since opening in 1936. It needs more sand, and new bathrooms and recreation area that should have been finished by now are just getting underway because of problems with the first contractor. This will be followed by a $3 million first-stage refurbishing of the basic colonnade rising over the bath houses and refreshment stands. But the bathhouse, which Ms. Dockeray closed due to lack of staffing immediately upon taking her position in 1991, will remain closed. Brooklyn PROSPECT PARK:  DEFINITELY NOT SECOND FIDDLE   For better than a decade, once-dreary Prospect Park has been on a roll. The Prospect Park Alliance, far from being a demure country cousin to the Central Park Conservancy, has boldly seized on flamboyant, joyous strategies to return the park to the status defined by Robert Moses, \\"the immediate crown jewel of Brooklyn.\\" Among scores of other projects, the Alliance lovingly restored a turn-of-the-century carousel, and began a Halloween walk through the picturesque ravine that little children love to dread.   Both the Grand Army Plaza and Willink entrances are undergoing grand million-dollar restorations. The Lincoln Road Playground is being completely rebuilt. The refurbished zoo reopened last year.   The benefits to Park Slope and Windsor Terrace brownstone owners, among them higher property values, have been much remarked upon. But at least as important is what the park has come to mean to the poorer residents of neighborhoods like Crown Heights, Flatbush and Bedford Stuyvesant.   \\"Prospect Park plays a unique role for the the poor,\\" said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society and an Alliance board member for many years. \\"The utilization has just been going up by leaps and bounds. You just see enormous outpourings of people who create little spaces for themselves.\\"   They barbecue in a traditional style (now including Japanese and Korean variations, of course) that has become such a Prospect Park ritual that it has become unthinkable on the part of park bureaucrats to stop it. People play softball, soccer, volleyball, fish and dance to boom boxes on hot afternoons. On Sundays, African and Caribbean drummers gather in an eclectic symphony of pure rhythm.   As the Rollerbladers glide by, as picnickers parade toward the Long Meadow, which has been called the finest landscaped garden in America, something else is happening. It is deep and scary and ongoing. \\"We haven't had people managing our forests for the longest time,\\" said Tupper W. Thomas, the administrator. \\"We keep postponing all the things we can't postpone.\\"   The old virgin trees are largely gone. Their descendants -- the oaks, maples, tulip trees, which tried to carry on -- are being supplanted by mulberries and other newcomers. Erosion is intensifying.   \\"To take on something like this is just impossible with city money,\\" Ms. Thomas said. Accordingly, the Alliance has made the forests its priority. In case you needed to ask, a Woodlands Ball is planned. MACON PLAYGROUND:  A PEOPLE'S PLAYGROUND   This little playground in Bedford-Stuyvesant seems like a terrible place. Equipment has been broken or stolen, crack vials are visible in the dust and adults relax with beers and wine. A bathroom has been locked after becoming a haven for drugs and sex.   It is sad to think the happily playing children have nowhere else to go. But there is a gathering ray of hope on the horizon. Some neighborhood men have banded together to help the bedraggled playground at Tompkins Avenue and Macon Street.   \\"This is a classic New York City playground,\\" said Julius Spiegel, the Brooklyn Parks Commissioner, pointing to the handball and basketball courts, the checkers tables and seesaws. \\"But kids shouldn't have to play in glass.\\"   In 1988, a group of men in the neighborhood got together and decided to reclaim the park. They called themselves Black Men Who Give a Damn.   \\"For kids in the neighborhood, that's the focal point of their summer,\\" explained James Harris Jr., an insurance company employee who lives across the street from the park and started the ball rolling. \\"It was time we men took matters in our own hands. If we have to live there, we wanted to make sure there was a place we wanted to live in.\\"   Mr. Harris and his compatriots first received Parks Department permission effectively to take over the park, though basic garbage pickup and maintenance remains with the agency. They then mobilized the neighborhood for a full cleaning, and have periodically returned to scrub grafitti. They began to lock the park at night, and during days worked to exclude drug users and others they considered bad influences. \\"We did things the police can't,\\" Mr. Harris said.   They also began a basketball tournament geared specifically for boys and girls who aren't athletically gifted, as well as an annual block party for everyone in the neighborhood. They raise money with \\"oldies but goodies\\" parties and other means.   \\"We started as simple volunteers to the park,\\" Mr. Harris said. \\"What we're doing is buying stock in our children. When we get old who's going to put out the checkers for us?\\" Queens FLUSHING MEADOWS-CORONA PARK: STRUGGLING PHOENIX   Once these 1,255 acres on Flushing Bay were a vast dumping ground for ashes from the burning of garbage. In \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" F. Scott Fitzgerald called it \\"a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens.\\"   Then came two World's Fairs, and after the second in 1964, the park Robert Moses had pushed for three decades finally began to take shape. Today, what was once an ash pile is athletic fields, landscaped meadows, lakes, fountains, playgrounds, zoo, museums and stadiums.   But Flushing Meadows is caught in severe problems just as its dream of restoring its monuments and museums moves toward completion. It is scruffy, even dirty in some parts. The staff struggles to keep up. Popular play areas have been worn grassless, tailgaters from Shea Stadium in the park have seemingly never learned how to throw away an empty can, and many benches need to be refurbished.   Arguably, this is also the city's most cosmopolitan park in what is statistically the most cosmopolitan borough. It is possible for 86 languages to be spoken there on a busy weekend afternoon. Summertimes are one ethnic festival after another: the Colombian festival draws 300,000; the Ecuadorian, 100,000, the Korean, 100,000. There are Muslim prayer services and a dragon boat festival.   \\"People who don't have their own backyard use this as their own backyard,\\" said Estelle Cooper, the park administrator. \\"They have somewhere to go.\\"   Harold Sanchez began as a volunteer in the park and is now sports coordinator and field inspector. \\"I don't fool anybody and nobody fools me,\\" he said by way of introduction.   Mr. Sanchez solved one of the park's biggest problems. Soccer leagues had become violently anarchic, with officials shaking down teams to the tune of more than $40,000 for the right to use fields the city supplies free. And there was another problem on the six soccer fields, where 17 leagues, some with as many as 20 teams, sometimes fitfully shared space. \\"People were shooting each other,\\" he said.   Mr. Sanchez two years ago brought the teams into the regular organized leagues of New York State, providing insurance for players and spectators and opening up tournaments with teams elsewhere. The new leagues would not put up with the shakedown artists and self-styled landlords.   \\"Harold is an unsung hero of the Parks Department,\\" said Arne Abramowitz, Mrs. Cooper's predecessor.   For her part, the new administrator is scrambling to make up for a halving of her staff to 47. That means only four maintenance people are available on any given day. The money the long-time Republican loyalist is able to gather from party contributors helps, but is not enough, she says.   She makes her case for more city funds with typical Queens combativeness. \\"We're being cut so desperately and we get less money than Manhattan does anyway,\\" she said.

As Mr. Cadigan, in a voice-over narration, describes the ups and downs of his disease — he moves from depression and paranoia to full-blown psychotic episodes, eventually somewhat softened by new medications that come on the market — he illustrates his points with scenes from his own life of quiet desperation.

THERE are some things money can't buy and other things it tries to buy but shouldn't - elections, for example, or in an earlier day, salvation. But the sale of elections, like the sale of indulgences, usually brings a demand for reform. What is wrong with buying these things? And where else should money's writ not rule? How the good things in life should be distributed is the the subject of Michael Walzer's new book, ''Spheres of Justice,'' which offers an imaginative alternative to the current debate over distributive justice.   The debate is typically carried on between libertarians on the one hand and egalitarians on the other. Libertarians argue that money, the medium of free exchange, should buy whatever those who possess it want","excerpt":"people should be free to use their money as they choose.

It was the first night after Tet, the lunar new year, and although Communist attacks the night before had caused the official annual Tet cease-fire to be canceled, the city was full of visitors celebrating the holiday. Like the rest, Sau and his friends had come to town by bus or on foot, carrying holiday packages. But Nguyen Van Sau and the others were not in Saigon to celebrate. They were members of Sapper Battalion C-10 of the Vietcong and their packages were weapons.    Sau had grown up illiterate in Cu Chi Province, just outside the capital. In the National Liberation Front, he had learned to read and write, and had been instructed in the front's version of exalted patriotism. As a special honor, he was invited to join the Communist Party. And now he had been singled out again. The men and women of Sapper Battalion C-10 were going to attack the United States Embassy.     At around 2:45 A.M., their little convoy set out. It consisted of two vehicles: an old Peugeot van and a taxi of the same make, both familiar vehicles on Saigon streets. The embassy was a fortress, nearly new, a $2.5 million complex that fairly dominated downtown Saigon. Its key buildings featured shatterproof plexiglass, and the entire compound was surrounded by an eight-foot wall.    Shortly before 3 A.M., the guerrillas in the taxi opened fire on the military police post at the main entrance. The M.P.'s returned fire and slammed shut and padlocked the steel gate. The Vietcong in the van, which stopped around the corner, used an antitank explosive to breach the wall. In seconds a commando squad of about two dozen was pouring through it. The two M.P.'s turned to face them. The first American to die was Specialist 4 Charles L. Daniel of Durham, N.C. He and his partner, Pfc. William Sebast of Albany, fell defending their positions, and their refusal to yield or withdraw probably spoiled the attack.    U.S. reinforcements were soon brought to bear, and the battle for the embassy grounds went on through the night. By around 9 A.M., all of the attackers had been killed or captured. The American dead consisted of the two M.P.'s and one marine. The Communists had failed to gain entrance to a single building.    Up until that point in the war, nearly 20,000 Americans had died along with hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese. More than 58,000 Americans and an estimated four million Vietnamese -- soldiers and civilians -- would die before it was over.    During the early hours of Jan. 31, 1968, there was fierce fighting in Saigon and all over Vietnam. But the attack on the embassy, in its quixotic effrontery, was perhaps the engagement that most fascinated the world.   In January, I spent a few days in Saigon, which is now called Ho Chi Minh City, just as Sixth Avenue in New York is formally called the Avenue of the Americas. It was coming up on Tet and everyone was buying presents","excerpt":"people were carrying little potted tangerine trees and apricot flowers, and visitors from up north were carrying peach boughs and blossoms, which don't grow in the southern part of the country.    The town was booming as never before. Foreign businessmen, including plenty of Americans, were everywhere. On the roof of the Rex, the hotel that once was the American bachelor officers' quarters, tourists and local plutocrats were dining on frogs' legs. The old gourmet restaurants are gone, but new ones seem to be opening every day.    On what was the Rue Catinat before it was Tu Do Street, before it was Dong Khoi Street, antique porcelain and jewelry are for sale to prosperous buyers. Visitors can buy silk dresses, made to measure by shops whose employees will gladly stitch through the night to have the garments ready first thing in the morning.     Diners at the Rex can watch the streets below illuminated by Toshiba and Sony neon signs that turn night into day. A few old billboards enjoin Marxist morality -- one condemns bootlegging -- but the touts and the girls and the transvestites are all back in the same old places.     What would it be like to take a walk around town with Specialist Daniel, Private Sebast and Nguyen Van Sau and his comrades of C-10 one of these lovely holiday evenings, 27 years after the attack that killed them? Would they guess who had won the war in which they died? Surely the Americans would have thought it was their side. And Sau might be amazed at the fruits of the Communists' victory.    Vietnamese Communism was not going to threaten Durham, N.C., as the men who recruited young Daniel doubtless assured him it was. It was not even going to trouble Saigon all that long.    Nor was the earth about to rise on new foundations for Sau, although he might take some comfort in the new name for the G.I.s' old haunt, Tu Do Street.     Dong Khoi, formerly Tu Do, the street where you get the antique jewelry and porcelain, means Spontaneous Uprising -- presumably the one Sau and his friends waited all night in vain for in 1968. Although the uprising never came, they changed the street name anyhow. That's how politicians are.     Today, many a deal is in the making. In Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, new factories will soon make Wisk liquid soap and Sunlight detergent for the Vietnamese kitchen. And before long, there will be a new U.S. embassy in Hanoi.     How ironic it all is. Perhaps such a squandering of young lives ought to be consigned to the realm of private grief, reflecting more shame than glory on the causes served. Yet we find ourselves moved and inspired by the heroism of young people who do their duty, who serve with all the vigor of their youth, strength and courage. The political futility of their sacrifice gives it a poignancy that is somehow ennobling. Even the Hemingway of \\"A Farewell to Arms,\\" professing revulsion at the rhetoric of heroism, movingly employed it and became the high priest of martial virtue.    After a period of denial and ambiguity, the United States began erecting fitting monuments to the Americans who died in our futile war. Somehow we can't keep ourselves from honoring those who give their lives in the wars to which our shortsightedness and folly consign them. Yet we know that in every war lives are lost, meaninglessly, and that the cause behind their sacrifice is soon rendered irrelevant.     We have never succeeded in replacing proper conduct on the field of battle as the ultimate measure of courage and loyalty. We have not developed that \\"moral equivalent of war\\" that William James so wisely and impossibly called for. Knowing not a whit more than the ancient Greeks, we console ourselves as they did in catharsis, in stoic acceptance and tragic ritual. Our celebration of death in battle is, from a certain perspective, utterly irrational. Yet it is our only means of imposing some degree of meaning on war's meaningless destruction, the only way we have of facing the eternal ironies of history.

One such example that has attained a state of popularity in the early 80's is ''privatization.''

The critics of ''big government'' and supporters of privatization are reacting to what, indisputably, is a significant increase in the tax burden in recent decades. \\n\\n One form of the privatization movement is the call for ''user fees.''

If consumers can choose from amphetamines, marijuana, cocaine, heroin and barbiturates, only then can society say a drug is too terrible to be offered for sale. Government agencies, freed of prohibitionist cant, will gain credibility. Consumers, offered a choice of drugs, are unlikely to participate in the illegal market.   On the other hand, if crack is sold, it will never be popular. Crack's seeming ferocity comes from two properties: it makes the user high very quickly, and then almost immediately the high is gone, and the user crashes. The resultant anxiety fuels the desire for more crack. Very few, given a choice of other drugs, would buy crack.   The rise of magazines that educate people about drugs and places where drug users would socialize is a consummation devoutly to be wished for. Establishing user groups, publications and organizations supporting drug users means they become normal members of society.    Peer pressure can work to modify behavior and inhibit highly dangerous activities. Organizations could work to change hostile stereotypes of drug users and unduly expensive and destructive enforcement policies.   Drugs designed by doctors and pharmacologists will not be as dangerous as drugs made by criminals and amateurs, nor is the advice that is offered in a magazine likely to be as irresponsible as that offered on a street corner.   The fear that legal drug activity will lead to \\"a dramatic expansion of drug addiction\\" is no more real than the fear that giving lesbians and gays their rights would turn people away from heterosexuality.   After legalization, potent opposition to drug use will continue. Mothers will not encourage it, schools will not promote it. Addicts will still be vivid reminders of the dangers of abuse, but society, freed of the necessity of jailing hundreds of thousands, can afford treatment.   The surge of drug use in the 1960's and 70's would have stopped without the war on drugs. The convictions that led us to jog and reduce cholesterol would have turned people away from mind-altering chemicals without coercion. Heroin will always be highly dangerous, in its legal or illegal state","excerpt":"people who believe that its use will expand dramatically give Americans too little credit for common sense.

Like all F.S.A. photographers, Mrs. Wolcott was supposed to document both the need for aid to the rural poor and the success of the F.S.A. in providing that aid, and like all F.S.A. photographers she did this, so far as she could, in her own way. However, she came late to the program, when the emphasis had begun to shift from arguing the need for aid to celebrating the agency's achievements, and her reputation has rested primarily on a series of beautifully composed landscapes featuring fertile, well-tended farmlands. \\n\\n She took no internationally famous pictures of suffering people, such as Dorothea Lange's ''Migrant Mother'' and Arthur Rothstein's ''Dust Storm, Oklahoma.'' And though it now appears that she was as much a photographer of people as any of her better-known colleagues, her people tended to get filed away unseen. What was wanted at the F.S.A. were pictures that were basically optimistic, that showed a problem, but at the same time suggested that with a little help the problem could be solved.

When we first meet him in \\"The Human Factor,\\" Otto Preminger's film version of the Graham Greene novel, which has been adapted with extraordinary skill by Tom Stoppard, Maurice Castle seems still to be in charge of the various departments of his existence.He is a methodical man. He would never put something into a box marked Incoming when it was supposed to go into the one marked Outgoing. The attention Maurice Castle pays to details is that of an honorable, somewhat boring civil servant, which is what he appears to be. Yet something is not quite right.The opening sequences of \\"The Human Factor\\" are filled with gentle dread. Castle, a none-too-important functionary in the branch of British Intelligence that deals with African affairs, is called into his superior's office for a security check. Castle responds to the inquiry with good humor and a hint of impatience. It is, after all, his lunch hour and, in addition to eating, he'd planned to buy some cheese for his wife and some candy for his son, to whom he'd been disagreeable that morning. Castle is the sort of man who remains away from his desk at noon for no more than the prescribed hour, and this inquiry must be absorbed in that hour.In such fashion do Mr. Preminger and Mr. Stoppard, assisted by a splendid cast, introduce us to the world of Graham Greene's novel about a reluctant double agent, a fellow who has slipped into treason not for money or political principle, but for reasons that, tragically, confuse private and public loyalties.\\"The Human Factor,\\" which opens today at the Plaza, is a fascinating, slightly chilly picture — as well as one of the best Preminger films in years. It is so good, in so many ways, that I think it's possible to say that, with several exceptions, its weaknesses are more those of Mr. Greene than of Mr. Preminger and Mr. Stoppard.\\"The Human Factor\\" is not a conventional spy thriller though it uses a lot of the conventions, including secret agents, book stores that deal in things other than books, tapped phones, blackmail and murder. It's tone is consciously, calculatedly humdrum, shot through with dry wit and unexpected insights, much like Mr. Greene's prose. It's the story of a rather ordinary man who is approaching the safe end of his career, who loves his wife, a beautiful black African from South Africa, and his adopted son, and who must suddenly pay dearly for what were, we are told, nothing more than gestures of gratitude.It's also the story of Castle's associates in what's called \\"the firm.\\" These include his younger associate, Davis (Derek Jacobi), a 40-ish bachelor for whom life in the firm is as boring as it would be in a real-estate agency","excerpt":"Percival (Robert Morley), the firm's merrily murderous doctor; and Daintry (Richard Attenborough), the man in charge of investigating the firm's security leak.The movie's flow is that of a novel more than of a film. Toward the middle there is a long flashback to Castle's tour of duty in Africa where he met and fell in love with his wife, Sarah, played by Iman, who looks (and, unhappily, acts) like the stunning fashion model she is. And the end of the movie, which is pure Greene, does not work especially well, possibly because the film, which has been shot mostly on locations in England and Africa, suddenly shifts to a not-very-convincing studio mockup of a shabby Moscow apartment.I also have reservations about the \\"look\\" of the film in general, that is, about Mike Molloy's photography. One can't be sure whether the straitened camera movements and the occasional gaffes in lighting are attempts to make visual Castle's interior panic or whether it's just sloppy movie making.Though Iman is clearly out of her depth in this film, the others are superb. Mr. Williamson, Mr. Morley, Mr. Attenborough and Mr. Jacobi have never been better. John Gielgud comes on for one short scene and the still-beautiful Ann Todd makes a brief but effective appearance as Castle's stiff-backed mother.For this film Mr. Stoppard, the Czech-born English playwright (\\"Night and Day,\\" \\"Travesties,\\" etc.), has written another screenplay that should be studied by anyone interested in the problems of adapting for the screen novels of a more complex order than \\"Jaws.\\" As Nabokov's voice can be heard in every line that Mr. Stoppard wrote for his adaptation of \\"Despair\\" for R. W. Fassbinder, Mr. Greene's voice can be heard in \\"The Human Factor.\\" It's not a literal transcription, but it is so carefully done that I don't think one could be sure of Mr. Stoppard's ellipses and transpositions without putting the screenplay alongside the novel.

They had done so since the end of the Victorian era, with its fussy plantings of tropicals and annuals. Soon after the end of World War II, plant breeders working for the seed companies began to apply the same techniques to annuals that had been used so successfully in developing hybrid corn. As a result, burgeoning numbers of greatly improved annuals came on the market. Their performance was so outstanding that they displaced perennials from many gardens. \\n\\n With all their attributes, however, these improved annuals lacked the variety and charm available with perennials. Annuals tend toward a certain uniformity that may border on monotony unless planted with some degree of imagination. Perennials, on the other hand, by their very nature embody great variation in color, form, texture and season of bloom.

Three homeless people — an embittered alcoholic, a middle-aged transvestite and a teenage runaway — find an abandoned baby on Christmas Eve. As they try to reunite the foundling with her parents, they revisit their own unhappy lives, and travel through a city rendered with unbelievable precision and tinted with undeniable love. The potentially sticky sentiments of the story are balanced by a crazily inventive narrative and by Mr. Kon's cool, obsessively detailed visual style. At the end, the skyscrapers of Tokyo wriggle and dance to a Japanese-language techno version of Beethoven's &quot;Ode to Joy,&quot; which pretty much sums up this indescribable, unforgettable movie. — A.

Precise manipulations in the service of refining a space might be considered the most contemporary way to achieve a well-made room.   At first, an Upper East Side prewar apartment would hardly seem to need improvement. Yet Saladino felt that the grandeur of this one could use some embellishing. According to the designer, perfecting scale and proportion is the key to translating an empty space into an engagingly beautiful one. He enlarged the opening between the foyer and the living room, heightening the sense of ceremony. In the designer's opinion, the living room's narrow crown molding wasn't substantial enough. He added a second molding 10 inches below the first, filling the space between with silver leaf (oxidized so as not to look shiny new). The effect, says Saladino, is of \\"a wonderful belt of blurred color.\\" To disguise some unsightly beams in the wall, he devised niches for either side of the fireplace.
