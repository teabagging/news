His Fox Broadcasting, the notorious purveyor of tabloid news and shlock sitcoms, is undergoing some image adjustments. One of the more earnest efforts comes under the banner of \\"Hallmark Entertainment Presents,\\" which tonight at 8  makes its Fox debut with \\"Blue River,\\" a two-hour movie adapted from a novel by  Ethan Canin. It's a somewhat sluggish start for the project but nonetheless a relief from the steady Fox diet of alien visits and pointless biographies of Madonna or O. J. Simpson.         Edward Sellers (Nick Stahl) is an eye surgeon with a nice home, a nice wife and a nice young son. Then one day, his elder brother, Lawrence (Jerry O'Connell), a seedy derelict, knocks on the door. The brothers haven't seen each other in 15 years, and Edward is only too eager to get rid of Lawrence. The bulk of the story is a flashback that tells why.

Judge Julian Mack in the Federal Court yesterday, at the request of Mr. Morosco as plaintiff, adjourned hearing on an injunction application until June 1.Miss Nichols, whose play is still running with two companies in San Francisco and Los Angeles—ten weeks in the latter city alone—organized the New York production on her own account, contending that Mr. Morosco's option had been too long delayed. She feared, in effect, that \\"Abie's Irish Rose\\" might be mistaken for a mere California poppy if it were much longer withheld from Broadway.An \\"all-star\\" cast was billed in the piece under Miss Nichols's own direction. The veteran Mathilde Cottrelly was among the players last night, as were also Marie Carroll, John Cope, Alfred Weisman, Bernard Gorcey, Howard Lang, Harry Bradley, and, as Abie himself. Robert Williams.Why the play must sooner or later have been meant for New York was fairly easy to see when the curtain rose on old Solomon Levy's big apartment in the Bronx. It was far more clear when the last curtain fell on a Christmas Eve in the thrice-married Abie's and Rosemary's tiny flat \\" one year later.\\" Fell, for instance, on Mme. Cottrelly as the kindly Jewish neighbor, cooking, against her will, a ham","excerpt":"on John Cope as the Irish grandfather and Alfred Weisman as the Jew who also \\"wanted grandchildren\\"—as Mr. Gorceley had said, he \\"always talked wholesale\\"—and finally on Harry Bradley and Howard Lang as the priest and the rabbi, and on \\"the family.\\"Abie was a Romeo, heir to riches in New York, but with the ghetto in his blood; Rose, a Juliet, with the blarney, an heiress in California. This Abie and Rose had met \\"over there\\" in France in the war: had been \\"merried good and tight by a nice little Methodist minister,\\" and, when cast off as \\"unwelcome strangers,\\" just lived and loved, \\"not wisely, but well.\\" Perhaps this Irish Rose is a hybrid, but handsome Abie, too, was a bit of a Virginia rambler.A highly sophisticated Summer audience took the little comedy very heartily, laughing uproariously at its juggling with some fundamental things in human life and at some others, not so fundamental, but deeply cherished, as lifelong feelings are wont to be. The New York scenes sagged on the lines in the play's first act as did the Brooklyn Bridge when the cables were being strung. The Irish, in the person of big John Cope, got the laughs going at the interrupted wedding at old Levy's.Miss Marie Carroll's Rosemary Murphy-Levy, with a \\"Peg o' My Heart\\" brogue, was girlish and charming as she walked with her bridesmaids and flower girl, a picture from her forgotten days in \\"Oh Boy\\" or \\"Oh Lady, Lady\\" down at the Princess. Robert Williams, too, who told everybody \\"You'll like her; she's a great girl,\\" was himself a fine, likable lad as Abie Levy, who \\"wasn't marrying a religion.\\" It wasn't orange-blossom time, so the knot was tied under \\"real California navy oranges.\\" Small wonder when Mr. Cope exclaimed, \\"Good God, is she marrying an A. P. A.?\\"The play has its little sermon that earned one of the heartiest bits of applause last night. Priest and rabbi, it appeared, also had met \\"over there.\\" \\"I gave the last rites to many Jewish boys,\\" said the fighting chaplain. \\"And I to many of your Catholic lads,\\" the Jewish chaplain replied. \\"We're all on the same road, I guess, even though we do travel by different trains.\\"It takes two to make a quarrel, family or otherwise, fathers or sons. And to make that quarrel up, it takes two—but that would be telling. Rosebuds and ramblers never grow singly. And as the good priest said at last, \\"Sure, Abie's a great boy.\\" personally, we hope to be present at little Rebecca Rachel and Patrick Joseph Levy's second birthday, if not their Hudson-Fulton centennial. \\"ABIE'S IRISH ROSE\\" FUNNY.; Anne Nichols's Little Human Comedy Heartily Received at Fulton."},{"year":"1963","title":"C L Sulzberger on efficiency of transition","excerpt":"on Johnson Adm as joining ranks of many caretaker govts in Western world Foreign Affairs; Caretaker for All the West Keeping Calm"},{"year":"1956","title":"Comment on Dem record as product of Johnson and Rayburn","excerpt":"on Johnson belief that voters will approve of Dems as 'responsible opposition'; on Dems efforts to show they advance liberal legis over Repub opposition DEMOCRATS SHAPE THEIR ISSUES; Moderate Line Taken By Congressmen Texans the Leaders Week's Events 'General' Claims"},{"year":"1967","title":"J Reston on Johnson Budget Message reflecting power and sweep of US interests and responsibilities in world","excerpt":"on Johnson putting priority on combating aggression anywhere Washington: Johnson's Military Priority"},{"year":"1963","title":"Reston on permanence of Govt","excerpt":"on Johnson task to shape own team, possibly composed of Kennedy Cabinet and personal aides plus Johnson assocs allied with New Deal Washington; Nobody Can Assassinate a Government A Stable Situation Foreign and Security Affairs The Press Problem"},{"year":"1959","title":"Comment on closing days of session as contest between personally popular lame-duck Pres and Cong seeking to create distinct image","excerpt":"on Johnson, Rayburn efforts to outdo Eisenhower in moderation PRESIDENT FAR AHEAD IN LEGISLATIVE DUEL; His Ability to Impose His Views Unusual for Lame Duck Leader"},{"year":"1953","title":"EVER since double-sided records were introduced -- how many years ago? -- record collectors, a notably critical lot, intermittently have made long complaints about couplings.

Filled with musicians who play with urgency and just enough clinical technique, Mastodon is hyperliterate in metal's past, but the literacy comes out in jump-cuts; its music doesn't stay still long enough to ape any particular style. It's also a ferocious and unpretentious live band. The bill includes Converge, an often very good band from Massachusetts, and the Bronx, which is actually from Southern California. Friday at 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 388-0300; $15, $17 at the door.

For this latest English importation, obviously made long before the fall of the Maginot Line, is undoubtedly one of the giddiest spy melodramas of the season. Blithely it defies several rules of dramatic grammar","excerpt":"on one coincidence it piles a score and, if authors and director were brought to book on all its implausibilities, the sentence should be severe. But, at the risk of encouraging anarchy, let's wink at the facts. For, preposterous as it is, \\"Missing Ten Days\\" is rattling good fun.Briefly, it is the account of an English aviator who is brought to his senses from a ten-day spell of amnesia with only an urgent feminine note as clue to his activities during the interval. Gradually he is drawn back into his unknown role by strange accomplices; he discovers the fantastic truth that as chauffeur to the family of a French officer, he has been in league with agents spying on the Maginot fortress. He also has made great progress with the kitchen maids. Fate is uncannily kind in revealing his household duties when he tries to continue the deception. And certainly it is tempting the angels, even in melodrama, when he finally saves the fortress from a bomb plot by racing through a succession of the fort's machine-gun barricades. Either that, or an ugly slur on the marksmanship of the French Army.With the most disarming manner in the world the story dances ahead, dropping innumerable innuendoes but rather fewer essential clues than is cricket. But when the idea is daring, the villains sinister, the hero witty and the stakes high, why cavil at inconsistencies? We don't even care that the supporting performances are less than perfect, because Rex Harrison's is. Polished and impeccable in any crisis, Mr. Harrison cuts through this adventure with rapier lightness. A tall yarn? Admitted. But entertaining? Most decidedly. Cause enough; case dismissed.

Mr. Sennett and Mr. Langdon do their parts in this nice mile of fun. Mr. Sennett, who failed as a blacksmith and amassed millions as a maker of film humor, deserves no little credit for the hilarious situations in this picture. And Mr. Langdon is to be congratulated on a generous supply of sad smiles and wide-eyed effects.Sometimes the wit in this mirthful piece is as appealing as the sound of a well hit anvil","excerpt":"on other occasions it is as if the hammer had missed its mark or struck a log of wood.The story of this comedy is credited to Arthur Ripley and Frank Capra. It is a series of gags that are wonderfully suitable to Mr. Langdon's genius as a screen clown. Possibly the best effect of all in this current venture, which was produced several years ago, is where the wistful Harry gazes into a shop window and visualizes his own offspring, impersonated by himself. The child Langdon is beheld seated in a baby carriage, while its would-be father is looking dreamily through the window. The eyes are, of course, those of the father, and so is the queer little mouth. The actions of the infant have evidently been inherited from the father.Another splendid episode is where Harry Howells, impersonated, of course, by Mr. Langdon, decides to answer a fire call. After informing the owner of the charming voice over the telephone that he will tell the boys about the fire when they return from the blaze they are at that moment fighting, Harry goes below and pats his knee to make the fire horses come out. The animals ignore him, but when he dons a fireman's helmet they immediately respond. Thereafter, as one might imagine, the incidents are uproarious, for Harry knows as much about running a fire engine as he does about training the gung of a battleship.Mr. Langdon is at his best in this humorous piece of work. The heroine is impersonated by Natalie Kingston, who, while she does not appreciate Harry's wisdom, is attractive.No sooner has the audience regained its composure after laughing at the incidents in this film than Will Rogers's travelogue, \\"In Paris,\\" is presented. This is the third of the Will Rogers specialties in travel pictures, and it is far and away the merriest. The captions, as in the other two subjects, were written by Mr. Rogers. Here our guide sticks on a mustache and steers you around the gay French capital, making his inimitable comments as he goes through the various sections of the city. He hazards that the Latin quarter is a place where they don't speak Latin and where quarters are rare. He comes to the Tuillerie Gardens, and points out that \\"the thing spouting in the distance is a fountain.\\" He adds that if you see anything spouting in America it is a Senator. He has his own way of showing that the Mona Lisa is smiling at one of the French Kings, and he depicts and comments in his original fashion on the Venus de Milo Aphrodite and the Winged Victory.

The truth is, the place where Mrs. Hartford often sees, and hears, Mr. Horowitz is at her bank on Madison Avenue in the 50's, when both of them happen to be on line to get money from the cash machine.

They reside in an apartment adjacent to the Sax-Rhonia fraternity house. During an expedition to the Cologne Carnival one of the girls, whose name is Lore, meets Hans Waldorf, a new member of the Sax-Rhonia club. Lore and Hans are attracted to each other, but the girl decides to disappear because she thinks it would never do for her to fall in love with the young man, as he is the son of an immensely rich industrialist.Hans does not know that Lore lives next door to the clubhouse. In course of time he meets her again at a fraternity dinner, at which Lore and her three girl friends have beer called upon to appear as professional musicians. They have chosen to seek work as entertainers in order to make enough money to continue their studies.Hans's father is highly displeased that a humble maiden should seek to wed his son, and he decides to discourage the alliance. He calls on Lore and asks her to promise never to see his son again. He writes out an agreement on the back of one of Lore's examination papers, but she refuses to look at it, declaring that the father ought to be satisfied with her refusal to marry his son.Herr Waldorf, however, soon changes his mind concerning the girl, and there is a pleasing surprise for both Lore and Hans.Gretl Berndt impersonates Lore and Werner Fuetterer plays Hans.On Other Screens.\\"Wicked,\\" based on a story by Adela Rogers St. John, with Elissa Landi and Victor McLaglen, is at the Roxy.The screen offering at the Paramount and the Brooklyn Paramount is \\"The Mad Parade,\\" with Evelyn Brent and Lilyan Tashman.\\"The Squaw Man,\\" an adaptation of the play, with Lupe Velez and Warner Baxter, is at the Capitol.At the Mayfair the feature is \\"Fifty Fathoms Deep,\\" with Jack Holt, Loretta Sayers and Richard Cromwell.\\"Pagan Lady,\\" from the stage play by William DuBois, with Evelyn Brent and Conrad Nagel, will be on view beginning tomorrow at the Broadway.\\"Karamazov,\\" a German dialogue film, with Fritz Kortner and Anna Sten, will be presented this evening at the Tobis-Vanderbilt Theatre.At the Cameo the feature beginning tomorrow will be \\"Rubicon,\\" a Russian silent film.\\"Street Scene,\\" with Sylvia Sidney, remains at the Rivoli.The Eighth Street Playhouse is showing \\"Der Hampelmann,\\" a German dialogue film.\\"Side Show,\\" with Charles Butterworth, is at the Strand.\\"Five Star Final,\\" with Edward G.

THE SCREEN","excerpt":"On Other Screens."},{"year":"1931","title":"A Mexican Robin Hood. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"On Other Screens."},{"year":"1931","title":"There is that in the wind blowing Hollywood's vernal effusions Broadway-ward which suggests that the beer and crime trend in the cinema has passed its peak. The newest evidence of the decline along the thug melodrama front is \\"The Good Bad Girl,\\" Columbia's contribution to the gangster exhibits, which piled into the Globe yesterday. Its aim is to turn the searchlight on the hoodlum's girl to tell the story of the women who sit at home and knit alibis and such things while the machine gun heroes are at their labors. It accomplishes this purpose with all the reality in story and naturalness in dialogue of a musical comedy libretto.It all starts when Marcia, mistress of a gang leader named Tyler, announces that she is through with the racket, adding that she wants \\"to get married, to have a home of my own, live decently, have children.\\" * * * Tyler's answer to this is that \\"there's only one way out for either of us—feet first.\\" * * * Besides, Tyler has killed his enemy and needs Marcia's testimony that he was with her at the time.After that, matters go forward inexorably along the beaten path. Marcia's marriage into a wealthy family strikes a snag when the papers print her picture as the \\"missing gunman's girl.\\" She is driven away, has a child, is threatened by Tyler's henchman and is finally taken back by her husband, who, we are given to understand, loved her all the time, even though he had curious methods of illustrating his affection.All this has been competently produced and there are interesting scenes along the way, as the apprehension of Tyler in a Philadelphia hotel and his escape from prison. But the dialogue is hackwork and the effect is generally tedious. The most amusing line is spoken by Marie Prevost, in response to information that Tyler is hiding in Philadelphia. \\"Nobody goes to Philadelphia unless they have to,\\" she says naïvely.Mae Clarke, who has already proved her qualities as an actress of intelligence and restraint, delivers a characteristically good performance in the rôle of Marcia. The rest of the cast is mediocre or worse. James Hall appears as the respectable husband, Robert Ellis as Tyler and Nance O'Neil and Edmund Breese as the wealthy parents.On Other Screens.\\"Six Cylinder Love,\\" based on the play of the same name, with Spencer Tracy, Sidney Fox and Edward Everett Horton, is at the Roxy.The screen offering at the Capitol is \\"It's a Wise Child,\\" with Marion Davies.\\"Up Pops the Devil,\\" based on the play of the same name, with Carole Lombard and Richard Gallagher, is at the Paramount.The Warners' Strand and the Brooklyn Strand is showing \\"The Public Enemy,\\" with James Cagney.\\"Monsters of the Deep,\\" a silent picture, with a synchronized lecture, is at the Cameo.At the Fifth Avenue Playhouse the feature beginning tomorrow will be \\"Jede Frau Hat Etwas,\\" a German dialogue film.\\"Indiscreet,\\" with Gloria Swanson, remains at the Rialto.At the Hippodrome the feature is \\"Gun Smoke,\\" with Richard Arlen.\\"Die Forsterchristl,\\" a German dialogue film, continues at the Belmont.At the Warners' Beacon the feature is \\"The Millionaire,\\" with George Arliss.\\"Liebeswalzer,\\" a German language musical film, continues for another week at the Eighth Street Playhouse.At the Brooklyn Paramount the screen attraction is \\"Tarnished Lady,\\" with Tallulah Bankhead.\\"Don't Bet on Women,\\" with Edmund Lowe, is at the Little Picture House until Sunday.The Fox Theatre in Brooklyn is showing \\"Young Sinners,\\" with Thomas Meighan.\\"The Beggar's Opera,\\" a German audible film, with Rudolph Forster and Carola Neher, is at the Warners' Theatre.At Loew's State, Paradise, Metropolitan and Valencia Theatres the feature will be \\"The Devil to Pay.\\"\\"Zwei Herzen im ¾ Takt\\" continues at the Europa.\\"Tabu\\" remains at the Central Park.

Attempts to make the retreat even more appealing tend to become an avocation.\\" -- House Beautiful, July 1994   It was not without a little effort that publishing executive Mark B. and his wife, publicist Dodi L., converted a barn they found in Yuma, Ariz., into the guest cottage of their summer home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. While preparing to drag the structure 2,225 miles to its new location on the Hudson River, the couple decided it was important to transport the entire Yuma site -- including the barn's dirt floors. \\"People do faux this and faux that,\\" Dodi explains. \\"But you can't fake dirt.\\"   Indeed, authenticity is the prevailing ethos of the couple's second home. Birds' nests found in the barn's rafters have been stuffed into feed bags to create extravagant, squashy throw pillows","excerpt":"on pegs above the bedrooms' straw pallets hang pieces of Amish clothing -- overalls, simple shifts, mobcaps -- that Mark and Dodi hope guests will don as sleepwear.   If friends and family have been reluctant to visit so far, that hasn't discouraged Mark and Dodi. \\"They'll come around,\\" says Mark, using paint stripper to remove a thick crust of floor dirt that has formed on the coffee table. \\"In the meantime, we're keeping very busy.\\"   EVER SINCE ROBERTA S. STARTED HER SUMMER consultancy business two years ago, she has been living year round in the Litchfield, Conn., Colonial where she previously only summered. Summer consultancy? The phrase, coined by Roberta, is an attempt to give name to those myriad summer-house-related services the 39-year-old caterer and former actress provides to second homeowners and renters in the historic Litchfield area.   \\"To me,\\" says Roberta, whose piercing intensity and penchant for wearing military fatigues belies her diminutive stature, \\"summer is not a season. It's a process. It's a series of choices. Do I choose to endure the insect population? Do I choose to get stuck in Friday evening traffic on the Saw Mill River Parkway? These sorts of questions fascinate me.\\"   Roberta's new book, \\"Summer Is Not a Season, It's a Process. It's a Series of Choices,\\" will be in bookstores this month. Extolling the virtues of preparedness in all situations, \\"Summer\\" is a compendium of sage observations and pointers for gracious summer-home living: \\"Think of fresh corn like cut wood: have it delivered.\\" \\"Lemonade is not about lemons. It's about sunshine.\\" \\"Don't let a child mope indoors because he can't find his snorkeling mask: give him a plastic bag and a large rubber band.\\"   While Roberta shows us her garden of infant vegetables -- tiny eggplant and tiny zucchini she plans to export to Manhattan \\"for diners with weak knife skills\\" -- a squawking sound is emitted by the walkie-talkie hanging from her belt. It is Roberta's assistant, Zoe, calling from one of the three houses Roberta is working on. They have a loud, urgent conversation. Finally, Roberta blurts out: \\"I have to go to one of my sites. Someone has made a bad choice.\\"   WHEN INSURANCE SALESMAN JACK B. AND TWO of his fishing buddies first entered the Adirondack lodge Jack bought two years ago, a strange odor emanated from therein. \\"We knew exactly what it was,\\" says Jack, pointing to a wall formerly bedecked with mounted elk heads. \\"It was moldering elk.\\"   The three men removed the heads from the wall. But suddenly the lodge seemed less . . . authentic. So Jack did what only a true outdoorsman would do -- he turned seven of the lodge's rooms into living quarters for live elk. On this balmy late-summer weekend, the inhabitants of the lodge's bedrooms are, as we move from east to west: Jack and his wife, Paula; an elk; an elk; Jack and Paula's daughter, Steff; an elk; Jack's fishing buddy Eddie; an elk; an elk; Jack and Paula's son, Joseph, and an elk; an elk; an elk; and the family's au pair, Elke.   \\"You know what this whole thing reminds me of?\\" says Jack. \\"You know when you're looking for an apartment in the classifieds and the abbreviation for 'eat-in kitchen' is written EIK, and you wonder, 'How the hell did an elk end up in someone's apartment?' \\" He pauses. \\"Now I know.\\"   ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE MASON F. AND cosmetics counselor Eduardo M. are eschewing the yearly flight from metropolis to country idyll this summer and are opting for something more original: they are spending all their weekends in their SoHo apartment. How will they transcend the irritations of the urban summer? Explains Eduardo: \\"I have translated the 26 quintessential summer experiences into a series of sprays and lotions.\\"   A recent Saturday afternoon found the two men dressed in nubby, bunny-type sleeping garments, hovering expectantly near a floor-to-ceiling bookshelf on which are tidily arranged varying types of glass bottles, all bearing handwritten labels -- \\"Wicker Picnic Basket,\\" \\"Kite on the Beach,\\" \\"Unflattering Celebrity Biography.\\"   What is in the lotions and sprays? \\"They're all over-the-counter products,\\" Eduardo says somewhat mysteriously from the bookshelf. Are all the Experiences different from one another? \\"Yes. Each is unique and specifically chosen for its ability to evoke an aspect of summer.\\" Are any of them lighter fluid? \\"Not one of them is lighter fluid.\\"   Eduardo emerges from the bookshelf area with a brown apothecary jar. Unscrewing the cap, he dips a cotton pad into the bottle, which is marked \\"Lawn Darts.\\" Upon contact of the pad with his forehead, Mason emits a startled whimper evocative of vehicular tragedy. \\"Oh lovely,\\" he says, finally. \\"Light and buoyant. Playful. Almost . . . almost summery.\\" No Bad Summers"},{"year":"1992","title":"STANDING at the northern end of the Parnell Bridge in Cork, you could be in one of the grandest capitals of Europe.

Across the river -- the South Channel of the Lee -- stands the symmetrical City Hall, a structure of the same period, its classical limestone facade and dome mirrored in the calm silvery water.\\n\\nBut what is equally essential to the true character of the second largest city of Ireland (population 138,000) is the sight of a vast and lumbering grain storage building off to the left of City Hall, and the view of the wooded hills that ascend in the distance behind it. And look to any of the Doric porticos and you will find the gable ends of mill and warehouse buildings.

This is partly because the theory, which assumes that people assimilate all available information and figure out what it implies for the future, appears to have profoundly conservative implications for economic policy.   For if people understand and anticipate what government is doing - for instance, in trying to accelerate economic growth by speeding up the increase in the money supply - workers will increase their wage demands and businesses will raise prices, to protect themselves against future inflation, thus negating the Government's intention of increasing real growth.     Yet the theory of rational expectations, whatever its policy implications, represents a bold extension of what conventional economists had assumed all along: that people behave rationally - with rationality defined as actions to serve their self-interest.

TOP STORY  NEW ERA IN RUSSIAN PARTY POLITICS? The Russian Party of Life has had its first significant win over the party of power, United Russia, the major newspapers reported. Voters in Samara on Sunday elected Viktor Tarkhov, the leader of the local branch of the Party of Life, as mayor of Samara, unseating the current mayor from United Russia. Kommersant wrote that the victory represents the first real step in the development of the Kremlin's new offspring, the Party of Life, as the ''second party of power.'' Izvestia went further, saying that it was evidence of the evolvement of a two-party system in Russia. True, this development does not resemble classic democracy, the newspaper added, given that both parties support the president and fight exclusively amongst themselves.     Nevertheless, Nezavisimaya Gazeta wrote, ousting the party of power in one of the largest cities in the Volga region will have huge psychological effects. The victory shows that someone can have a political career and win a significant elected position without the support of United Russia, Kommersant said.      Opinions differed on the reason for United Russia's loss. Kommersant quoted some observers who blamed the defeat on a series of scandals that had plagued the party's Samara branch for some six months. Other experts pointed to the backing of Mr. Tarkhov by major businessmen as the reason for his electoral success, the newspaper reported. Election observers and representatives from both parties admitted that the vote was more about the personality of the candidates than a battle between parties, the newspapers wrote. Many United Russia members in Samara objected to the party's choice of candidate in the mayoral elections, Nezavisimaya Gazeta said.      Initially, United Russia claimed voter fraud, vowing to challenge the election results in court, Kommersant wrote. But, after the Kremlin officially sanctioned the results, the party reversed itself. A representative from the Central Elections Commission said his agency had recorded no significant instances of violations, Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported.    IN OTHER NEWS    KOMMERSANT  PAVLOVSKY BANNED FROM UKRAINE: The Ukrainian security service (SBU) on Monday declared Gleb Pavlovsky, a Russian political scientist, persona non grata for activities contravening the national interests of Ukraine. Mr. Pavlovsky was one of the leading ideologues in Viktor F. Yanukovich's 2004 presidential campaign, and had a hand in the creation of Russian-focused nongovernmental organization in Kiev in 2004. Mr. Pavlovsky had no comment on the announcement. A representative from Mr. Yanukovich's Party of Regions denounced the action, while a member of Yulia V. Tymoshenko's opposition bloc praised it.    GAZETA  OPPOSITION DENIED REGISTRATION: The Federal Registration Service rejected the Russian People's Democratic Union's bid for registration on Monday. A spokeswoman for the agency said that the Union, headed by Mikhail M. Kasyanov, a former prime minister under President Vladimir V. Putin, had failed to file its documents correctly","excerpt":"on registration forms the organization identified itself both as a ''movement'' and a ''union.'' A representative from the Union said political motivations were behind the denial.    IZVESTIA  SOLDIER SOLD INTO SLAVERY: The military prosecutor's office in the Chita region opened a criminal case this weekend against a local colonel for selling a soldier under his command as a servant to a businessman. The soldier, Efreitor Rudenko, was found in a ditch on Aug. 18 after being hit by a car, according to the official version of the story. He had worked, unpaid, for the businessman for the previous two months, digging up piping close to the highway. After the accident, Mr. Rudenko lost a leg, an eye and spent 13 days in a coma.    NEW IZVESTIA  RUSSIA'S MUSLIMS CELEBRATE END OF RAMADAN: In his address to Russia's Muslims on the occasion of the end of Ramadan, President Putin expressed hope that the country's Muslim community would work to strengthen the harmony between the citizens of Russia.

He graduated from City College in 1937 at a time when it was considered the ''common man's Harvard.'' Awarded a scholarship, he went on to attend Harvard Law and graduated in 1940. His reverence for Harvard was deep, reinforcing his conviction that mankind is capable of profound good. Less than a year after graduation, and ten days before the attack on Pearl Harbor, he began his airforce training. For his service in the Pacific arena, he received the Bronze Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross and a citation from General MacArthur. Following the war, his love of flying led him to serve as traffic manager for Empire Airlines. Ultimately, he returned to the practice of law, becoming legal counsel to the Foreign Press Association. Always driven by his concern for humanitarian causes throughout the world, his exemplary international career as a corporate lawyer was often combined with his pursuit of equality and justice on a global scale. Most notably, he successfully argued one of the first of many cases arising from the Iran hostage situation before the World Court at the Hague. Everett's lifetime of varied experience reflects a curious and extremely facile mind. His passions were expressed on land by a competitive game of tennis","excerpt":"on sea as a skilled sailor; and in air as a private pilot. His incisive intellect and wit were a testament to a many-faceted personality. A fabulous raconteur, he held any audience spellbound. In simple words, he was a man larger than life. As such, he took the phrase ''go forth and multiply'' seriously. He is predeceased by his brother, Dr. Sanford H. Eisenberg, and his brother-in-law, Dr. Harold Diner. Four years ago, he lost the true love of his life, Viviane Eisenberg, the former Viviane Tubiana, past prima donna of Le Theatre National de L'Opera Comique. Additionally, two other mates have played important roles: the mother of his daughters, Hermione Sakolsky, and his current soul-mate, Kay Peck. Everett is lovingly remembered by his children, Amy Thor and Deborah HowlandMurray, son-in-law David Murray and his younger sister, Sydelle Diner. He was thrilled by his role as grandpa to seven grandchildren and 73/4 great grandchildren. A global cadre of nieces, nephews and cousins will miss him dearly. In his memory, and with regard to his respect for individual free will, contributions may be made to any cause that promotes the ideals by which he lived. Had he survived, he would surely have lent his help to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and to do so would also be a fitting memorial.

But the presence of Mr. Flanigan assures that such old Freshmen favorites as \\"It's a Blue World\\" and \\"Day In, Day Out\\" are still performed with the group's original harmonic flair, even though there has been a fifth Freshman for several years. At Fat Tuesday's, which has been a regular stop on Freshmen tours for more than 10 years, they will go on tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10 and midnight","excerpt":"on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M.

Blossom Dearie, the singer and pianist whose voice is an astonishing mixture of little-girl innocence and dark throatiness, has been playing twilight performances at the Ballroom off and on since 1984. Originally they were a winter series, but now she has become a summertime attraction, playing Fridays and Saturdays at 6:30 P.M. Her repertory is a very special mixture of sophisticated wit and nimble rhythm created partly by such old hands as Cole Porter and Noel Coward but leaning more toward contemporary songwriters: Dave Frishberg, John Wallowitch and Miss Dearie herself. Accompanied by the bassist Ray Kilday, she plays a single extended set at 6:30 P.M. today and tomorrow. There is a $15 music charge and a two-drink minimum.

The master drummer Andrew Cyrille tends to play on the walls and on the floors and on his body and on whatever else is accessible. This rare and overdue engagement will feature him with an exceptional group: the trumpeter Hannibal Peterson, the saxophonist Oliver Lake, the bassist Reggie Workman and the pianist Steve Colson. It will be a workshop on the value of the progressive in jazz for the last 25 years. Shows tonight and tomorrow are at 9 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.; on Sunday there is no third set.

The young tenor saxophonist Antoine Roney looks like Sonny Rollins, sounds a bit like John Coltrane and plays in a room that could have been designed for a Spike Lee movie. As if that weren't enough, this show gives listeners a chance to pick up on one of the promising young heavyweights of the tenor saxophone, a field increasingly crowded with the real item.

Mr. Willis is one of the most imposing pianists of his generation, somebody at ease in all sorts of contexts, from be-bop and Latin to more exploratory music. He'll be backed by one of jazz's great rhythm sections: Buster Williams on bass and Ben Riley on drums.

It's hard to find a more fruitful meditation on American music than in the compositions of the guitarist Bill Frisell. Mixing rock and country with jazz and blues, he's found what connects them: improvisation and a sense of play. Unlike other pastichists, who tend to duck passion, Mr. Frisell plays up the pleasure in the music, and also takes on another often-avoided subject, tenderness. His band now includes the clarinetist Don Byron, and the group has become extraordinary. Shows tonight and tomorrow are at 9:30, 11 P.M. and 1 A.M.","excerpt":"on Sunday at 9:30 and 11.

Recorded in 1988 but released only recently, \\"Tenor Tribute\\" captures a performance in Germany that, despite some rhythm-section problems, bristles with ideas and oddities that might not be heard on an album recorded in a studio. For one, Joe Henderson, playing as well as ever, changes a few standards; when he and Jimmy Heath trade fours on \\"Steeple Chase,\\" they draw blood in a way that would rarely have happened in a studio. For another, Arnett Cobb turns each solo into a series of leers and sighs full of slides and bent notes, while Jimmy Heath, mixing be-bop and a more modern language, constructs precise idea-heavy improvisations.

But Robyn Hitchcock, who emerged in the late 1970s with the Soft Boys, one of the brainier but least punk of the punk-era British bands, has an irrepressible jabberwocky side. A gifted writer who has studied hard at the books of Bob Dylan and John Lennon, Mr. Hitchcock, above, sounds the freest at his most whimsical: ''I feel like a three-legged chinchilla/Standing on a table so wide I can't see over the side'' goes one typically inspired non sequitur on his new album, ''Olé! Tarantula'' (Yep Roc). And in front of an audience he is a hilarious monologuist-improviser, following themes as they bubble unpredictably through his brain, a process documented in Jonathan Demme's 1998 film ''Storefront Hitchcock.'' All the more surprising, then, when he turns serious: one new song, ''N.Y. Doll,'' is a spare, poignant elegy for Arthur Kane, the former New York Dolls bassist, who became a Mormon librarian and briefly played with the reunited group two years ago before he died of leukemia. ''I was really something on the map that never ends,'' Mr. Hitchcock sings from Mr. Kane's point of view, linking the eternities of religion and rock 'n' roll.

When the current show at Michael's Pub opened on June 2, it was called simply \\"A New Orleans Food and Jazz Festival\\" and the members of the seven-piece band that played tunes and styles associated with New Orleans were not individually identified. But the 80-year-old trumpet player Bill Dillard proved to be such a charmer with his warm, lyrical performances, his gentle and provocative singing and his personal memories of Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton that he has now been raised to well-deserved star billing. The band also includes such idiomatically New Orleans instruments as tuba (Dave Bargeron), banjo (Eddy Davis) and clarinet (Orange Kellin) as well as the pianist Terry Waldo, the trombonist Tom Artin and the drummer Chuck Spies.

Tonight's show pairs the Four Stars, from Zaire and based in Paris, with System Band, from Haiti but long based in New York City.

But for many, and especially those Roman Catholics who build the Trident submarines at the Electric Boat shipyard 20 miles south in Groton, that all changed last week, with the overwhelming passage of the bishops' pastoral letter.   The letter called on Roman Catholics and ''all men and women of good will'' to make peace-making their most important spiritual and worldly goal.

But Robert Snyder's excellent 1969 documentary, \\"The Henry Miller Odyssey,\\" illustrates that Mr. Miller has far more to offer a contemporary audience than his sexual politics (which aren't reflected in this movie). The film is playing today and tomorrow at the First Avenue Screening Room. Don't miss it—if you care at all about writers or writing, it will ralse your morale.In many fascinating flashbacks, the movie details a writer's apprenticeship on the road from Brooklyn to Big Sur, while Mr. Miller narrates in his hoarse, nasal voice. In high school, he volunteered that his vocation might be clowning—an impulse that's recalled when we see him (aged 78) laughing at his own long, rubbery face in a mirror. Early on, he worked in his father's tailor's shop, then became the employment manager of Western Union, and edited the catalogue of a mail-order house. Then he quit all jobs to write: \\"I walked up Broadway feeling like the happiest man on earth\\"—since he planned to be his own boss forever. \\"Then began 10 years of misery\\"—when he doubted his ability and couldn't sell his work—followed by the exhilaration of Paris, \\"where I found my voice,\\" which surfaced in \\"Tropic of Cancer.\\"Although Mr. Miller scorns all conventional work and celebrates play, a sense of his own enormous industry surges through the film. He also exults over the freedom that youthful poverty can give a writer—while the camera ogles windows full of succulent French food that he couldn't afford in the thirties. It was invigorating to have \\"no crutch of any kind,\\" to learn to be \\"a bird of prey, an animal.\\" Though he stresses his lifelong interest in the occult, his worship of the arts, and his studies of dreams, his romanticism is usually cut with comedy—it's rather as though Huck Finn had been an urban esthete.The movie jumps most skillfully between past and present, between California and France. At one moment, the writer is treading water and talking about his mother, who consulted him (aged 4) about having a wart removed. She got blood poisoning and blamed him for it—for which he never forgave her. Soon, he's cheerfully discussing suicide with Lawrence Durrell. Both agree that it was much more tempting when they were young.There are fond visits with his old friends, including Anais Nin. He also reads a very moving passage about a favorite relative, an aunt who lost her mind. As an adolescent, he had to take her to the asylum","excerpt":"on that journey, she saw blue and green cows, whose names she knew. His rage at the society that insisted on confining her sounds like fuel for his future rebellions.In the last shot, Mr. Miller vanishes on a bicycle. All in all, he has some of the gaiety that Yeats attributed to sages, and it's a privilege to see it on the screen.

After attending public schools in the Bronx, he graduated from Reed College in Portland, Oregon in 1950, and then did post-graduate work in economics at Columbia University. He was an Associate Editor at Barron's before he began his career in the investment business at Shearson Hammill Co. in 1956. There, he was the Director of Research, 1962-69, and Executive Vice President of their Investment Division, 1965-70. In 1970, he co-founded Cumberland Associates, an investment management company in New York. He retired as a Managing partner from that firm in 1982, remaining a special limited partner.

Unfortunately, for many that is precisely the case. However, by stating that there are 500 million square feet of empty office space (which may be accurate by just adding up the vacant space) and having an esteemed investment banking institution like Salomon Brothers state that there is a 10-year supply of office space already built is very misleading for the following reasons:   When analyzing office space, it is important to segment the market and determine into which niche a particular space or building falls. For example, despite the fact that there are 30 million square feet of vacant office space in Manhattan, a tenant looking for 200,000 square feet of prime office space in the Grand Central area within the next 18 to 24 months will find just five choices, all of which are very different from one another.   Tenants will generally develop initial interest in office space based upon location. It is not logical to assume that a tenant who wants to be on the East Side of Manhattan, for example, is interested in the fact that there may be numerous vacant buildings in other locations. Location is the essence of real estate.   Size distribution of office space is equally important. By way of extreme example, 20 5,000-square-foot floors, equaling 100,000 square feet, do not directly compete with four floors of 25,000 square feet also equaling 100,000 square feet. This is a very obvious fact that is often overlooked when broad statistics are quoted.

Bergmann argues, we must look at the most extreme figures of an age. This is from \\"The Anatomy of Loving: The Story of Man's Quest to Know What Love Is\\" (Fawcett Columbine, paper).    In every era there live outstanding men or women who for future generations exemplify the period in which they live. Not that they are in any way typical of the people of their period","excerpt":"on the contrary, they exemplify the age because in them and in their lives what was alive in the period has come out in a fine excess. When I think of love in the nineteenth century . . . I think of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. . . . Young Shelley writes about love with indignation: \\"Not even the intercourse of the sexes is exempt from the despotism of positive institution. Law pretends even to govern the indisciplinable wanderings of passion, to put fetters on the clearest deductions of reason, and, by appeals to the will, to subdue the involuntary affections of our nature. . . . Love withers under constraint: its very essence is liberty: it is compatible neither with obedience, jealousy, nor fear: it is there most pure, perfect, and unlimited, where its votaries live in confidence, equality, and unreserve.\\"   Peace for the Gods      This letter, written in A.D. 384 by the Roman senator Symmachus (who was a pagan) to the Christian Emperor Valentinian II, pleading for the continuation of pagan ceremonies, catches as no summary can the emotions surrounding the decline of one faith and the rise of another. This is from \\"Roman Letters: History From a Personal Point of View\\" by Finley Hooper and Matthew Schwartz (Wayne State University, paper).      Man's reason moves entirely in the dark; his knowledge of divine influences can be drawn from no better source than from the recollection and the evidences of good fortune received from them. If long passage of time lends validity to religious observances, we ought to keep faith with so many centuries, we ought to follow our forefathers who followed their forefathers and were blessed in so doing. . . . And so we ask for peace for the gods of our fathers, for the gods of our native land. It is reasonable that whatever each of us worships is really to be considered one and the same. We gaze up at the same stars, the sky covers us all, the same universe compasses us. What does it matter what practical system we adopt in our search for the truth? Not by one avenue only can we arrive at so tremendous a secret.   Our Celestial Birthright      In 1829 Thomas Carlyle used the French Revolution as an example in a still timely denunciation of the idea that human nature could be plumbed, charted and controlled. This excerpt from \\"Signs of the Times\\" is included in \\"The Oxford Book of Essays,\\" edited by John Gross (Oxford University).     It was a struggle . . . for the infinite, divine nature of Right, of Freedom, of Country. Thus does man, in every age, vindicate, consciously or unconsciously, his celestial birthright. Thus does Nature hold on her wondrous, unquestionable course; and all our systems and theories are but so many froth-eddies or sand-banks, which from time to time she casts up, and washes away. When we can drain the Ocean into mill-ponds, and bottle-up the Force of Gravity, to be sold by retail, in gas jars; then may we hope to comprehend the infinitudes of man's soul under formulas of Profit and Loss; and rule over this too, as over a patent engine, by checks, and valves, and balances. . . . For man is not the creature and product of Mechanism; but, in a far truer sense, its creator and producer: it is the noble People that makes the noble Government; rather than conversely.   Elegant, Eloquent Bones      Delta Willis's experiences covering an expedition searching for the bones of our ancient ancestors moved her to write this defense of the uncelebrated human skeleton. This is from \\"The Hominid Gang: Behind the Scenes in the Search for Human Origins\\" (Penguin, paper).      Bones are what the dog buries, what rattles in closets. . . . They symbolize death and Halloween, poison and pirates. In this search, bones impart elegance and malleability, the awe for their growth and form reflected by the names given them. . . . The human skull rests on the summit of the vertebrae and is divided into two parts, the cranium and the face. There are fourteen bones to the face and eight to the cranium. The cranium, derived from the word \\"helmet,\\" is described in the bible of bones,    Gray's Anatomy   , as \\"a case for the accommodation and protection of the brain.\\" A lower jaw is a mandible, the upper jaw a maxilla. Given these names, bones take on eloquence and life.   The Invisible Legacy      Frederick Turner reminds us that a view of our most ancient past based only on artifacts is bound to be misleading. This is from \\"Rebirth of Value: Meditations on Beauty, Ecology, Religion, and Education\\" (State University of New York, paper).     Archeologists until recently gave us a picture of human prehistory which was almost entirely male-centered, not because they were chauvinists, but because the prehistoric men had entrusted their being to durable artifacts that can be dug up and displayed in a museum, or stand for many ages, like a pyramid. The women wove things, or sewed them in leather, or cultivated crops which do not leave hard bones for archeologists to find. A wiser paleoanthropology now tells us that the women were the culture-bearers, and they left a much more durable and complete legacy: us. Might not the durability of written wisdom be deceptive in some ways, like the archeological record? Is it not love that left a more lasting imprint, because it is an imprint that continues to change and grow?

The project began when Jon Yanofsky, executive director of the Paramount Center for the Arts in Peekskill, N.Y., asked Mr. Douglas if he would like to write and perform some film scores in conjunction with a grant the center had received.

They were shut out for the first two periods, 4-0, before they began to scurry about like a wild bunch, pouncing on loose pucks and pushing opposing defenseman away from the goal, which is how they must play to excel. RANGERS' RALLY FAILS AGAINST PENGUINS"},{"year":"2006","title":"The pianist Taylor Eigsti fits the textbook definition of a jazz prodigy: his first professional experience came at age 8, when he opened a concert for his mentor, the pianist David Benoit. Now 21, Mr. Eigsti, above, has made measurable steps toward artistic adulthood, including his first album on a prominent label (Concord) and his first booking at the Blue Note (next week). The album, ''Lucky to Be Me,'' puts him in the driver's seat of two serious rhythm sections -- including the one that he's touring with, comprising James Genus on bass and Billy Kilson on drums -- and in dialogue with the 18-year-old guitarist Julian Lage, another celebrated prodigy from Northern California and, not coincidentally, one of Mr. Eigsti's best friends. Perhaps as expected, the music is uneven. But the results make a fascinating study regardless, partly because Mr. Eigsti hails from a generation that has absorbed the last wave of new arrivals (like Brad Mehldau) right alongside earlier precursors (like Ahmad Jamal). His furious arrangement of John Coltrane's ''Giant Steps,'' for instance, strongly suggests the early-1990's youngblood Jacky Terrasson Trio","excerpt":"on the next track, a sunny original called ''Get Your Hopes Up,'' his fluidly improvised lines reveal the influence of Mr. Mehldau.

Thus the explosion of the brand. (When I was in Mexico City a few months ago, you couldn’t throw a Dos Equis without hitting a massive Ed Hardy billboard.) On the other hand, were your parents familiar with the depth of Hardy’s artistry, they might applaud your investment acumen. Hardy’s tattoo apprenticeship was apparently carried out while earning a San Francisco Art Institute B.F.A. in printmaking. He studied traditional Japanese tattoo art in Japan, and his strange work became strangely beautiful and substantive. He has with his wife written, edited and published numerous books on alternative art while curating gallery and nonprofit exhibitions, and is a frequent museum and university lecturer. Hardy mentors younger tattoo artists, though he is reputed to have now turned his focus to printmaking, drawing and painting. So you probably couldn’t get a real Hardy tattoo even if you wanted one. Still, he created real art. Enter fashion. The flamboyantly French and ardently litigious fashion designer Christian Audigier acquired the rights to commercialize Hardy’s art by plastering it on everything from hoodies to ball caps to leather jackets, and the bottom of the official Web shop of Audigier’s Hardy-exploitation wear has a list of registered trademarks as long as your arm. You can’t get a Hardy tattoo, but you can buy the T-shirt. More axiomatic still are the perfumes. Oh, but you saw that coming a mile away. Audigier has creative-directed two pairs — a feminine and a masculine each — and one wonders if Hardy smelled them before they left the factory. I realize these things are critic-proof (Macy’s can’t keep them on the shelves), but here we go. Take Audigier’s most recent launches, in December of 2008: Love & Luck for Women and Love & Luck for Men. For the feminine, Adriana Medina has created a very nice copy of Olivier Cresp’s Light Blue (the feminine) for Dolce & Gabbana, simply lowering the volume almost to zero on the green apple (which is what makes Light Blue so good) and substituting a very light, rather diaphanous spice. It’s a nice scent, not a full-fledged perfume as much as a well-executed initial sketch, but this works perfectly for Hardy’s demographic: mass-market teenagers. It precisely gives the perception of wearing scent without actually wearing much. It’s also the best of the four. (It has decent persistence on skin","excerpt":"on the other hand, it diffuses like lead.) Love & Luck for Men, by Olivier Gillotin, is equally perfect: the masculine cliché of deodorant soap, aluminum and synthetic spice. Mennen Speed Stick on 17-year-old. Commercially savvy and of no interest at all. Good persistence, sadly. Ed Hardy for Men, the original masculine that debuted 11 months prior, is Gillotin doing another version of the masculine cliché: subtract some of the aluminum et voilà. That leaves its mate, the original Ed Hardy for Women. Which is fake strawberry. Like, the stuff used in Jolly Ranchers. This isn’t even a realist school of perfumery because it’s not perfumery at all. Perfumers and flavorists share many raw materials (a lot of the things in your Diors and Laurens are food grade), and what Audigier has bottled, you can find in the cake mix aisle at D’Agostino. I say Audigier advisedly. Technically, this sugary elixir is attributed to a perfumer, Caroline Sabas. To say that her prodigious talents are wasted here is to misunderstand entirely the marketing premise. Obviously Audigier wanted fake strawberry, and that’s what Sabas gave him. (It’s nice as far as fake strawberry goes, incidentally — probably Sabas’s contribution.) And if you’re wearing your awesome Ed Hardy T-shirt, size small, you’ll probably buy a bottle because the packaging design matches. But it’s not good. Not strangely beautiful. And not substantive.

The movie, which was filmed in Jamaic, is about mercenaries in the Congo who go by train to rescue some diamonds, refugees and Yvette Mimieux from the rebel Simba. It did not seem to me very plausible. There is a lot of carnage on every side, in contexts that will probably infuriate anyone who scrutinizes movies for their politics. (There is none of the liberal idealization of people who, through lack of technology, kill more personally and less efficiently than we do","excerpt":"on the other hand, there were signs of sympathy with colonial aspirations and pacific longings for nonviolence.) The end of the film is a little stroke of plotting lunacy, which seems to reflect the movie's standoff ambiguity about what it thinks.But the direction, by Jack Cardiff, who did \\"Sons and Lovers,\\" is sporadically interesting. There are scenes—of a black, cigar-chomping engineer starting a train at dawn, of warfare, of the refugees at the mercy of the rebels—that don't look like anybody else's scenes. They might be at some point of comedy and menace where \\"Heart of Darkness\\" and \\"Scoop\\" converge. Jim Brown, of football and \\"The Dirty Dozen,\\" is quite good in short speeches, but when he has long lines that are silly or hard to take—as when he has to explain that for him being a mercenary in the Congo is like Bunker Hill—he begins to sound embarrassed and artificial.Rod Taylor clearly has a fine time as a tough, nononsense guy who finally reveals his gentle heart by running amok, slaughtering a German murderer to avenge Brown and then, and this is the plot stroke, turning himself in for court martial. Yvette Mimieux, who mostly pine about for him, is O.K. and Calvin Lockhart has a serene and deadly walk-on as the Congolese president. The film is basically low grade. It seems to have more than its quota of violence about the head (heads held under advancing engine wheels and so on) and yet, at moments, it rises far above itself and becomes worth seeing and almost fine.

The case arose out of a class-action suit brought by poor black residents against the town under the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964.

One exception to this rule is the Bose Corporation of Framingham, Mass., where the rigorous separation of high-fidelity from the lesser breeds is now being challenged. Under the direction of Dr. Amar Bose, a professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the company has gained a reputation for refreshing unorthodoxy.

The affected section follows. (The complete article can also be found online at nytimes.com/arts.)    Yet beyond the obvious marketing value, the Leipzig assembly plant is a sophisticated attempt at social engineering. By creating a fluid work environment in which management, engineers, autoworkers and cars seem intertwined, Ms. Hadid is seeking to break down the hierarchies that have defined the traditional factory. In this world, information flows freely and man and machine live in blissful harmony. And while the sight of glistening black and silver coupes gliding through the air may seem a sci-fi horror to some, it is sure to enchant car fanatics.    In many ways, the plant's site on the city's outskirts harks back to old-style Modernism. Even before Ms. Hadid was hired, a team of bulldozers was leveling the area, once farmland, to make room for a vast factory complex -- an approach more in keeping with the tabula rasa planning of the postwar years than with the eco-friendly approaches of today.     The three main factory buildings -- body shop, paint shop and assembly plant -- are housed in big prefabricated corrugated metal sheds, generic staples of the industrial landscape. But Ms. Hadid subverts the sequential order of the manufacturing process by having each car loop back through her central building, where autoworkers and engineers can survey their work and, when needed, reconfigure the assembly process.    This is ideal territory for this architect. Ever since her student days in the 1970's at the Architectural Association in London, she has been drawn to the vast scale of infrastructure: industrial dams, ribbons of highways, gargantuan urban high-rises. In her 1983 proposal for the Peak, an unbuilt country club in Hong Kong that made her an instant cult figure in architectural circles, buildings resembling big concrete beams looked as if they were about to splinter off into space.    Here, all of that feverish energy has been packed inside. Like the surrounding factory buildings, the central structure is wrapped in a taut corrugated-metal skin, but with the corners slightly curved to give it a sleek, contoured look. A bridgelike office structure splits off from the central building and joins two of the factory sheds, framing a small entry courtyard. Supported on massive concrete columns shaped like fins, the office area is engineered like a segment of elevated freeway.    But the most dynamic structure here has yet to be built: a low, sloping showroom that will one day be the entrance point for the complex. Arriving from the Autobahn, visitors will slow down to turn past the showroom, then hurtle across a sprawling parking lot set diagonally to the main building. Once they park, they must slip under the office bridge to reach the main entrance, as if they were ricocheting between the buildings.    Inside the central building, the first thing that strikes you is the immense scale. Offices are organized as a series of concrete terraces that seem to cascade from one end. A towering stairway sweeps up to a balcony of offices along one side of the room","excerpt":"on the other side, the terraces are linked by a long, narrow ramp.

The first part of the film tenderly hovers over these two—the cool, withdrawn girl and the equally stoical old peasant (excellently played by Vera Kuznetsova) who obviously loves her daughter.But the main concern is the manual energy in the background — a small group of families briskly united in such endeavors as produce gathering, competitive harvesting and building, under a soft-spoken chairman, Valentin Zubkov. Unrequited mother love is unceremoniously shelved for the case of the stolen cucumbers, one of the few dramatic \\"highlights\\" in the picture.One woman, a young field worker, is caught red-handed with a handful of the vegetables, fresh off the vine. Another one, a giggly blonde, scandalously filches a small flour sack and gets hauled in by the ear. Is this supposed to be evil, or plain hunger?Actually, the film's best performer and most likable person is the cucumber culprit, spiritedly played by Nonna Mordyukova, a strapping, incisive actress we'd like to see more of. Her confession of love to the chairman—the strongest emotional scene—is something to see and hear.As for little Miss Marchenko, obliquely involved in the foregoing, she eventually drops her urban glaciality for rustic appreciation. Small wonder, with the picture's pastoral photographic flavor of fresh milk, new-mown hay and sunlit rivers.

Half an hour out of Zurich, the rail traveler cannot help noticing the huge, opaque glass cube that, according to the time of the day and the weather, changes its tints from turquoise to aquamarine to sapphire. With its elusive hues it is an emblem of Zug's fiscal permissiveness.    The Glass House, as the structure is locally known, is the headquarters of Marc Rich, the international commodities broker and financier who years ago won notoriety as the central figure in a tax evasion case in New York. In 1983, Mr. Rich fled prosecution by Rudolph W. Giuliani, then United States Attorney, heading for the little Swiss lakeside town with the short name. Mr. Rich later agreed to pay $113 million to the United States Government.   Mr. Rich, who is Belgian, is doing nicely in Zug. A signboard in the marble lobby of his seven-story glass-and-steel building lists a cluster of his companies under the overall heading Marc Rich & Company (Holding). He is not the only foreign entrepreneur who has found a snug refuge in a place where one has to drive only a few minutes to see dappled cows grazing on fat pastures.   All around the freestanding Glass House, facing the Zug railroad station, and the huge, covered shopping mall behind it, other multinational corporations are ensconced in modern office buildings. The Nutrasweet food concern, the Lego toy and hobby materials manufacturer, and several international financial services organizations are among them. The shopping center houses elegant outposts of the Bally and Bata shoe firms and deluxe watchmakers', jewelers', gourmet food, wine and flower shops.    Yet this is a town with a split personality. Rail passengers on their way to Lucerne or the St. Gotthard Pass, to Lugano or Milan would never guess that Zug is also a charming ancient town and an architectural jewel, set between a wooded mountain and a butterfly-shaped lake. Right after the station of Zug the train is swallowed by a tunnel skirting the old neighborhoods, and it emerges on the outskirts of the town where only modern housing amid neat gardens can be seen.   \\"Zug is not only a tax paradise,\\" said an executive of an American company that recently set up its European center in the town of 22,000 population. \\"It comes close to an Eden of creature comforts. It's provincial in a nice way. If you want a metropolis, Zurich is only 18 miles distant. Here, the air is good, there is a pretty lake promenade; you get freshly caught fish; you can ride up the mountain in a cable car to get a stunning view of Alpine peaks; there is no hassle in this place. Small wonder that Margaret Thatcher likes to come here for relaxation.\\"    To see an older, more authentic Zug, leave the big-business colony around the Glass House and the railroad station behind, and stroll along Alpenstrasse and Bahnhofstrasse southward. In five minutes you reach a large rectangular square, Postplatz, with a monumental, domed post office at its east side. Diagonally across the square is a sober edifice, the Cantonal Government building. It rules over an area about the size of Brooklyn, including the town, ten nearby villages, big and small farms, a few hills and a slice of the lake.   American residents call the canton of Zug the Rhode Island of Switzerland; it wields broad legislative and administrative powers in a small space. Zug some time ago embarked on a policy of low taxation, whence the influx of Swiss and foreign corporations. Many of their executives don't bother to commute to Zurich, preferring to live in a village on the lake, Walchwil, south of Zug. Thus Walchwil has lately developed into a Swiss counterpart of Scarsdale, N.Y., or New Canaan, Conn. Throughout the small canton, rents are high by Swiss standards -- $1,300 to $1,800 a month for a modern two-bedroom apartment.   Zug's hospitable climate has given rise to diverse local ventures, as was recently exemplified by an advertisement in The International Herald Tribune: \\"Swiss woman, 32, living in the fiscal paradise of Zug, Switzerland, seeks someone to become a Swiss resident or for business matters.\\" The notice appeared under the catchline International Partnership Ltd., with a Zug post office box address supplied.   Visitors proceed from Postplatz on Neustrasse, the town's main shopping street, and in another five minutes find themselves in old Zug. Its center is Kolinplatz, a sloping, irregular square surrounded by ancient, timber-framed houses, some of them frescoed. The square is named after Peter Kolin, a local hero who held Zug's flag aloft during the battle of Aredo (near Bellinzona, south of the St. Gotthard Pass) in A.D. 1422 until he was felled, as were many other Swiss soldiers in a desperate fight against an overpowering force of 24,000 mercenaries from the Duchy of Milan.   An octagonal stone fountain graces the square in front of the old Hotel Zum Ochsen (at the Sign of the Ox). Goethe and other famous travelers were guests here at one time or another.   The Zytturm (Time Tower) at the west side of Kolin Square is Zug's pride and prime landmark. It is a stout structure carrying a large clock above an dial with the signs of the zodiac. The steep roof is covered with tiles in blue and white -- the canton's colors -- and crowned with a bellhouse ending in a lofty needle.   Walking down Fischmarkt (Fish Market) past the clocktower you pass two curving streets, Ober-Altstadt and Unter-Altstadt (upper and lower Old Town). Both streets are lined with narrow, ancient houses painted in green, red or white, most of them with their second and upper floors overhanging, some with their timber framework showing. The streets convey a strong sense of coziness in a uniformly urban neighborhood. Few examples of medieval and Renaissance middle-class architecture of such purity are to be found anywhere. Ober-Altstadt and Unter-Altstadt are no museum; they are inhabited and alive.   A THIRD street, lower than the two and parallel to them, collapsed into the lake in a landslide in 1435. Today the lake shore is a pleasant promenade bordered with gnarled old trees. It looks out on the flat western shore of the lake, which is up to two and a half miles wide and, to the south, on Mount Rigi near Lucerne.   The lake, eight miles long and at one point 636 feet deep, is rich in fish. Felche (whitefish) is listed on about every local restaurant menu. Ships sail from Zug to Walchwil and other lakeside places several times a day, and conduct lake cruises.   Returning to Kolin Square from the shore promenade, walk to St. Oswaldsgasse, to your right behind the Hotel Zum Ochsen. Look for No. 19. The heraldic and allegorical scenes on that stately 16th-century building were painted by the Baroque artist Johannes Branderburg, as a plaque explains. A few steps further rises St. Oswald's, an imposing late-Gothic church built between 1478 and 1515 by the architect Hans Felder, who also worked in Zurich. Elaborately carved choir stalls in the interior are noteworthy.   A large church, St. Michael's, erected in the neo-Gothic style in 1902, stands on a steep slope higher up. Nearby are remnants of Zug's medieval fortifications, a gunpowder tower and a castle.   Easy paths lead up, across forests, to the flat top of the 3,255-foot-high Zugerberg (Zug Mountain). Visitors who shun the one-to-two-hour climb may reach the summit in 20 minutes by bus from Zug railroad station to the southern suburb of Schoenegg, and from there in the red cars of a cable railway. The bus-and-cable-car company operates a chaletlike small hotel on the mountain, with a restaurant on a panoramic terrace. The view is famous: Lake Zug and parts of Lake Lucerne are visible in the foreground, framed by Mount Pilatus and Mount Rigi; the Jungfrau, the Eiger, the Finsterahorn and other Alpine giants to the south form a majestic backdrop. THE ATTRACTIONS OF ZUG   Frequent trains to leave from Zurich for the half-hour trip to Zug. A round-trip ticket is $10.25 (at 1.3 Swiss francs to the dollar) in second class, and $16.65 in first.

Christie's in London was to auction 18 early 20th-century objects by the British architect Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens at a decorative-arts sale next Wednesday. \\"This is the largest group of Lutyens furnishings to be auctioned in recent years,\\" Tatiana Marsden, a Christie's specialist in 20th-century decorative arts, said on Monday by telephone from London. On Tuesday, Miss Marsden called again to say one of the three owners of the tables, chairs and lighting fixtures designed by Lutyens (pronounced LUTCH-ens) had withdrawn nine objects from the sale because of \\"a difference of opinion with the vendor.\\" The nine pieces originally were designed for Reuters's London offices. The nature of the disagreement and the seller's identity were not revealed by Christie's.    The catalogue of Christie's sale includes Lutyens's modern furniture and lighting in both Neo-Gothic and Neo-Classical styling, all commissioned in the 1920's and 30's by three British clients. Several of the architect's design signatures are visible on the vertically grooved square columns forming the base of a table","excerpt":"on the outsized ovals framing the backs and seats of chairs, and on the carved bells appearing at the tops of chair legs.    Lutyens (1869-1944) first explored the Neo-Gothic idiom at the turn of the century, reviving it for the teak furniture he designed in 1939 to furnish the boardroom of Reuters's new Fleet Street offices. The sale was to include Reuters's furniture -- eight green leather armchairs with squared legs offered as a set, with a presale estimate of $7,800 to $11,700, and a five-foot-long rectangular teak table on a weighty six-column base ($9,750 to $13,650). The owner of the Reuters pieces acquired them in the 1970's when the boardroom was modernized.   Lutyens's Neo-Classical version of Art Deco was used for a 1930 waiting room of a London-based bathroom-fittings manufacturer, Messrs. Crane Bennett. The sleekly styled furniture in a caramel-colored finish includes a corner writing table ($15,600 to $19,500) and two oval armchairs and two oval stools, each decorated with carved bells at the tops of their turned legs. The chairs and stools are being sold as two sets, each including one chair and one stool. They are expected to bring $7,800 to $11,700 for each set. The scarcest of Lutyens's designs, Miss Marsden said, is the bell furniture. \\"They are extremely rare,\\" she said. \\"Most of the bell furniture stayed in India.\\" The bell images, she said, repeat those Lutyens used architecturally in his design for the Governor's Palace in New Delhi.   Lutyens's most advanced designs are his hanging lighting fixtures, each comprising a disklike shade in blue glass embellished with clusters of blue glass beads the size of flower bulbs. Designed in 1923 for the corridors of Gledstone Hall in Yorkshire, the hanging lights anticipate the 1970's Italian Modern hanging lamps shaded by blue glass disks. The Lutyens hanging lights are being sold as pairs, each with a presale estimate of $4,875 to $6,825.    Another offbeat offering, a grouping of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's silver-plated knives, forks and spoons, was designed in 1906 for Miss Cranston's Ingram Street tea rooms in Glasgow. Each of Mackintosh's six place settings includes seven pieces -- two knives with black plastic handles and two forks and three spoons with trefoil-shaped handles. The flatware is expected to bring $11,700 to $15,600.  1,000 Porcelain Pieces     Elizabeth Parke Firestone collected 18th-century French porcelain, silver, paintings and furniture from about 1940 to 1970. She shopped in Paris, London and New York for the rare, offbeat and charming objects that filled her homes in Akron and Newport. At her death last October at the age of 93, the widow of the industrialist Harvey S. Firestone Jr. left one of the finest holdings in French decorative arts, most of which are to be auctioned on March 21 to 23 in a sale at Christie's in New York, expected to bring $7.85 million to $11.22 million.    Mrs. Firestone's French porcelains collection is among the most impressive in private hands in this country. The collection includes more than 1,000 pieces of biscuit and decorated porcelains divided into 468 lots of chalk white figures, flower-embellished platters, tureens and tea cups and a Sevres billiard marker dated 1786. Snuff boxes take the form of animals, birds, fruit, vegetables, nuts, fish, shells and houses. Most of the porcelains -- including a fierce 1740 Chantilly study of a fox or a wolf -- were kept at the Firestones' sprawling, Romanesque-style cottage at Newport. Christie's estimates this part of the collection will total $2 million to $3 million.    \\"There has not been a sale of French porcelains like this one since I've been in the auction business,\\" said Hugo Morley-Fletcher, a porcelain specialist who came to Christie's in London 28 years ago. He said that among the many objects in the sale that are the only known examples of their type is a silver-mounted, house-shaped Mennecy snuff box, a miniature yellow stone mansion with glazed windows and a pitched roof, less than three inches wide. The presale estimate is $4,000 to $6,000. Another one-of-a-kind item is a Chantilly figure of a snarling fox or wolf, depicted upright on its haunches ($20,000 to $40,000). \\"I am sure it's a wolf, not a fox,\\" Mr. Morley-Fletcher said. \\"Whatever it is, it has great ferocity.\\"   \\"This collection represents 18th-century French taste,\\" he said. \\"I met Mrs. Firestone last year and asked her to tell me how she collected these porcelains. She told me, 'I used to go to Paris with my husband and when he went to do business I went shopping.' She bought what she liked and came home with some very enchanting things. She knew a lot about it. And when you look at the collection, you see it wasn't bought with a big checkbook, it was bought by someone who really knew what she was doing and enjoyed and understood it.\\" Cut-Glass Extravaganza     A Victorian crystal and mirrored center table -- the sort of glittering cut-glass spectacle that Indian maharajahs bought to furnish their late 19th-century palaces -- is to be auctioned at 2 P.M. next Thursday at Sotheby's in New York. The cut-glass octagonal extravaganza on four baluster legs was made after 1860 by F. & C. Osler of Birmingham, England, a producer that had exhibited in 1851 at the Great Exhibition in London at the Crystal Palace, the fair where glass furniture was popularized.   \\"I've never before seen a center table like this one,\\" said Elaine Whitmire, Sotheby's specialist in this field. Mrs. Whitmire said since that it is the first she has seen, she is uncertain whether the mirrored top is original to the table. The presale estimate is $20,000 to $30,000.

Let no man be so proud    And confident,    15To think he is allowed    A little tent    Pitched in a meadow    Of sun and shadow    All his own.    Joy may be shy, unique,    21Friendly to a few,    Sorrow never scorned     to speak    To any who    Were false or true.    26Your every grief    Like a blade    Shining and unsheathed    Must strike me down.    Of bitter aloes wreathed,    31My sorrow must be laid    On your head like a crown.    -- COUNTEE CULLEN          1.Which of the following best describes the nature of the poem as a whole?      a.

Permanently        One day the Nouns were clustered in the street.       An Adjective walked by, with her dark beauty.      The Nouns were struck, moved, changed.      The next day a Verb drove up, and created the Sentence.      5 Each Sentence says one thing -- for example, ''Although it was a dark rainy day when the Adjective walked by, I shall remember the pure and sweet expression on her face until the day I perish from the green, effective earth.''      Or, ''Will you please close the window, Andrew?''      Or, for example, ''Thank you, the pink pot of flowers on the window sill has changed color recently to a light yellow, due to the heat from the boiler factory which exists nearby.''      In the springtime the Sentences and the Nouns lay silently on the grass.      A lonely Conjunction here and there would call, ''And! But!''      10 But the Adjective did not emerge.      As the Adjective is lost in the sentence,       So I am lost in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat --       You have enchanted me with a single kiss      Which can never be undone      Until the destruction of language. -- KENNETH KOCH     1.Which of the following best describes the nature of the poem as a whole?    a.

QUIZ ANSWERS       The G.E.D. exams, which lead to a high-school equivalency diploma, measure knowledge in social studies, science, mathematics, writing and reading. In addition to a poem like ''Any Human to Another,'' the reading test asks students to interpret a piece of drama. Up to half of the SAT subject test in literature, from which ''Permanently'' is taken, is devoted to the dissection of poetry. Many colleges use the subject test results for admissions decisions.

Before forming the group four years ago, Perry Farrell had built up a large fan  base as the leader of the alternative-rock stalwarts Jane's Addiction and a founder of the Lollapalooza traveling festival. But Porno for Pyros' self-titled debut recording was feeble, with Mr. Farrell's high-pitched voice wailing over the most generic of rock backdrops. On its new album, \\"Good God's Urge\\" (Warner  Brothers) the music gets atmospheric, experimental and interesting. In concert it became clear that the band was pioneering a stylistic mish-mash all its own:  spiritual glam-rock.         Mr. Farrell emerged onstage drinking a bottle of wine, dressed in a lei, Mardi Gras beads, peacock feathers and various talismans, and made up with eyeliner and a red mark of consecration on his forehead. He was a mixture of retro hippie, New Age guru and Jimmy Buffett tourist. In his lyrics and speeches, he talked of spirituality, female energy, tropical islands and the environment as the music merged ambient dance music with 70's rock. The former bassist for the punk band the Minutemen, Mike Watt, dressed as a Druid, added a  slowly shifting bottom end to a music made up of atmospheric sounds, scraped guitar strings and riffs, Bjork-like backing vocals and, occasionally, Mr. Farrell's harmonica blasting.

Filmed in inky black-and-white, it traces the peripatetic movements of Sandor Gaspar (Miroslaw Baka), a grim young man who shuttles between a crude country cabin and a bare city apartment with his daughter, Rebecca (Zsofi Baji). From Sandor's phone calls to characters who remain mostly off screen, it is obvious that he is desperate for money. And with his sharp, vulpine features and air of generalized furtiveness, he stirs up suspicion and hostility wherever he goes.

Mirella Freni's Mimi, at once a passionate young woman and a timid little girl, is exquisite. Adriana Martino's Musetta is a swinger. Their lovers, Gianni Raimondi as Rodolfo and Rolando Panerai as Marcello have the zest (if not the waistlines) of Boy Scouts bucking for merit badges.The picture does not pertend to be a movie in the sense that, say, \\"La Dolce Vita\\" is a movie. But those expecting a stiff Technicolor tintype of a staged performance will be pleasantly surprised.Franco Zeffirelli, the director, uses his camera to clarify points sometimes obscure in live performances (the key-dropping business in the first act, for example). During the riotous Cafe Momus scene, Mr. Zeffirelli's camera even provides a kind of visual obbligato to Puccini's music. The director gives us an amplification rather than a literal transcription of a live performance.Best of all he gives us plenty of closeups of Miss Freni. The rest of the cast has a tendency to mug. Miss Freni knows the art of the small gesture—the elfin smile that vanishes almost before it is there, the shy glance simultaneously issued and retracted.Such effects bring us closer to Mimi, emotionally as well as physically, than we can possibly come at, for example, the Metropolitan Opera House (where she and Mr. Raimondi are singing their roles this fall). The encounter is a deeply affecting one. Even if this were a silent film Miss Freni's performance would make it one worth seeing.There are times when spectactors may find themselves wishing it were a silent film. One has no argument with what went into the microphones when Herbert von Karajan, the conductor, and the cast recorded the soundtrack in the Munich Opera. House last summer. (They filmed the action later in a Milan movie studio.) The tempos are right, the style idiomatic and the supporting singers and the stars, so far as one can tell, are in glorious voice.But Warner Brothers's \\"New High Fidelity Sound\\" is a disappointment. Even at a normal volume, the sound would be edgy and over-brilliant. At the volume the studio selected for a press preview, the sound was gross. One stumbled out feeling he had been run over by an opera—which is not the same as being swept away.Besides eliminating vocal warmth and intimacy—and \\"La Bohéme\\" needs both—the magnification emphasizes flaws in balance and synchronization that might otherwise escape notice. Particularly jarring are the disparities between an actor's distance from the camera and his distance from the microphone.

In fact, he will even show you that a menu-stuffed mailbox is hiding an old newspaper or two. He will also point out the silver chopsticks in the display case (Chinese legend has it that silver chopsticks turn black if the food is poisoned), the eight-foot chopsticks his father made and the 100-pound bag of rice that drops when the front door opens. Most young visitors will probably stare at the video depicting Chinatown restaurant delivery boys. Take note of the life-size dummy on the bicycle in the window and be relieved that the paper dragon overhead is not within puffing distance. Don't forget to create your own adage for the fortune-cookie contest: the prize is a dim sum dinner with Mr. Spiller. The Franklin Furnace Archive, which was originally a ship chandler's warehouse, is open from noon to 6 P.M. today and tomorrow.  'Luck of the Draw'  Belvedere Castle Central Park West 79th Street, south of the Great Lawn (212) 772-0210 Recommended ages: 5 to 11 Tomorrow     A leprechaun straight out of an Irish folk tale will reveal a buried crock of gold, if you can catch him.  Tomorrow, amid your myriad chores, that may be the easiest task you and your children can accomplish. All you have to do is show up at Belvedere Castle at Central Park. There you'll meet a tall masked leprechaun with red hair and a beard who will lead you through the Ramble. In the clusters of rocks and trees, you will be taken on a scavenger hunt with clues in the forms of drawings by the leprechaun. Rainbow or no rainbow, he will also lead you straight to the pot of gold. The jaunt starts at 1 P.M. at the castle, and takes about an hour and a half. Children and parents should be dressed warmly in whatever color they wish. Reservations must be made.  Children's Movie Matinee  Louis Abrons Art Center Henry Street Settlement 466 Grand Street Manhattan (212) 598-0400 Recommended ages: 3 to 8 Tomorrow     Is it possible that a movie made in 1956 that takes place in a foreign city and has virtually no dialogue can still enchant children? Well, yes, if it's French and it happens to be \\"The Red Balloon.\\" This 30-minute tale of a young boy who befriends a balloon is bound to elicit a strong rapport with a young audience. The allegorical nature of the balloon itself, with it hovering near the boy like a guardian angel, is so subtle that young viewers don't even question the balloon's miraculous ability to evade thieving bullies and imperious adults. What is not at all subtle is that the balloon is faithful and loving, that it remains close by even when its own existence is threatened. When the balloon meets its fate, the boding of a sad ending blows away as the boy and his newfound colorful comrades float high above the slate-gray rooftops of Paris. The second film on the bill, \\"Sand Castle,\\" takes place, of course, on a beach, where sand creatures build a castle together just in time to shelter them from a storm. Admission to the 2 P.M. matinee is $3 for adults and $2 for children. Strollers may be parked in an anteroom to the theater, which is grandly old-fashioned with a balcony. Free popcorn is to be given out. The M14 bus, which begins at Hudson and 14th Streets, can deposit you right at the Henry Street Settlement, on the other side of town.  Cnoc Grafton  50 Macdougal Street Manhattan (212) 529-6652 Recommended ages: 6 months to 7 years    Cnoc Grafton is Gaelic for Hill Grafton, an incantatory spot in Tipperary, Ireland, that inspired the impish clothing Elan Bahk and Nikki Nichols design to sell at their winsome boutique on this quiet street. Children (and their parents) may get a kick out of seeing yet another realm of children's clothes, as conceived in Manhattan. The decidedly stylish but comfortable cotton-and-Lycra leggings, tunics and vests are a bold stroke in the store's white Minimalist decor that includes a lichen-green velvet Victorian sofa. The colors of the clothing -- plenty of black cut with swaths of orange and chartreuse, with wide-eyed zippers and stripes -- remind browsers that they are in SoHo, and not anywhere near shamrocks or bogs, though moss is growing in the windows. Junior art dealers and artists in the making can take notes on how they will need to dress at their gallery openings come the turn of the century. The boutique is open 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. Tuesday through Sunday.  Washington Square Park  Fifth Avenue at Washington Square North Recommended ages: 2 and up     This eight-acre park, renowned for its counterculture insouciance, is an entertaining place to take children, if not for its playgrounds alone. Some of the children's equipment was bought by the Friends of Washington Square Park, after the group consulted neighborhood mothers. The group was also responsible for the tree labels that identify the 50 varieties throughout the park. In the northeast corner is the largest of the three playgrounds, where beginner, intermediate and advanced slides share their fenced-in space with a large jungle-gym dome, a sand pit and swings for babies and toddlers. At the northwestern edge, there is a smaller playground with baby swings and a sand pit","excerpt":"on the southern side, there are three asphalt hills to challenge young bicyclists, skateboarders and mountain climbers. And as most parents of toddlers know, pigeons are a cheap source of amusement: just carry along a bag of bread crumbs. The park also attracts street performers and unself-conscious roller skaters. On a recent Sunday, a performer was balancing a fiery torch on his nose; gusts of wind made his act a little more amazing than he expected.  The park is closed from midnight to 6 A.M.  Art Documentaries  Uris Auditorium Metropolitan Museum of Art (212) 570-3711 Recommended ages: 10 and up Tomorrow    In the Metropolitan Museum's Focus on Women Artists series, three films may offer just the right dose of inspiration and accessibility to young artists with discerning adventurous eyes. Two are about photographers, Imogen Cunningham and Laura Gilpin, who forged paths for themselves over at least 60 years. Cunningham possessed an optimistic pioneer spirit; she was born in Oregon and started delving into her art as early as 1901, taking nature pictures at the beginning and portraits of celebrities later on. Cunningham captured her native Southwest, where she spent most of her life photographing the Navajos and the region, including its vast skies with puffy clouds. Her first camera was a Brownie, given to her on her 12th birthday; Cunningham first started working in a shed her father built. The final film, \\"Maria of the Pueblos,\\" depicts Maria Martinez of San Ildefonso, N.M., demonstrating the art of crafting iridescent black pottery, a process she came upon by accident as she fired her red clay and it turned to black. The films, which require tickets that must be bought a half-hour before the shows begin, are at 4 and 6:30 P.M. The admission is $6 for adults and $3 for children.

''Classic'' and ''in good taste'' are more like it -- the kind of place where you could confidently send your parents. But, in an effort to compete with more fashion-forward hotels, the company has recently been updating properties, like the Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel and Spa, which finished a $19 million revamp in January. Though crystal chandeliers and oil paintings of corseted aristocrats line the hallways, the 292 rooms in its horseshoe-shaped main building, completed in 1907, have new furnishings and flat-screen televisions, while the lobby lounge is now furnished with brown leather couches and leopard-print throw pillows. And the staff seems to have retired the standard Ritz catchphrase, ''my pleasure,'' and replaced it with the more-relaxed ''no problem.''    LOCATION -- The hotel is set in a wealthy residential community lined with elegant homes. It's about two miles from the restaurants and shops in historic Old Town Pasadena and 10 miles from downtown Los Angeles.    THE SCENE -- My husband and I checked in during a television convention in July when producers in power suits and television talent, ranging from the cast of HBO's ''Entourage'' to costumed super-heroes, stalked the hallways.    THE ROOMS -- Our deluxe king (No. 549) was located in a curve of the main building. Two other complexes, one with balconies that face the pool and another tucked behind it in a more secluded spot, offer a combination of deluxe rooms and suites. There are also eight cottages scattered throughout the property. Our room, near the elevators, was a long rectangle in various shades of beige with blue and gold accents. Two plush armchairs sat at one end and a modest desk equipped with high-speed Internet access was at the other. From the windows we could peek out at the pool or gaze beyond the red-tiled roof of the hotel to the San Gabriel Mountains.    AMENITIES -- The Olympic-size pool was disappointing. Its small seating area was packed three rows deep with lounge chairs and umbrellas, and it was situated just outside a restaurant, putting bathers on display. The hot tub, in a separate, shady grotto, was more inviting. There is also a good-size spa in a separate building that is worth a visit. Use of its fitness center and separate men's and women's whirlpools, steam and sauna rooms are free to guests. So is the coffee, tea and fruit that are laid out every morning.    THE SERVICE  -- Mixed. We were seated quickly and waited on attentively at the Terrace Restaurant. But the business center was rarely staffed, and perhaps because Internet service was free there, guests lingered on the three available computers, causing lines to form. The hotel plans to add a $5 fee for every 10 minutes on the Internet later this month. (A hotel spokeswoman said the attendant at the gift shop, across from the business center, is supposed to staff both stations.)    ROOM SERVICE -- Breakfast -- one egg, over easy, with sourdough toast, turkey sausage and a pot of coffee -- arrived in less than 20 minutes. Cost: $27.22, including a $4.50 in-room dining charge and 18 percent service charge. When we got the munchies around midnight, however, our chicken quesadilla never arrived. When we called room service, about 45 minutes later, to check on it, an employee apologized and said they had sent it to the wrong room. By that time we were too tired to eat and so declined the offer of a new order.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- The hotel is working on a balance between formal opulence and casual chic. Some touches, like the painstakingly placed green apples at the check-in desk, are style clichés borrowed from boutique hotels. But the high-quality Ritz service is still largely intact. Rates start at $399 for a deluxe room and $495 for cottage suites.

And so, one by one or in groups, Barnum's \\"curiosities\\" made their way to the photography studio of Mathew B. Brady, whose business had prospered partly from Barnum's patronage. In 1863, Barnum helped Brady obtain the largest single order of his career: official pictures for Tom Thumb's wedding.

Combat\\" and \\"Secret Hearts\\" (\\"I don't care! I'd rather sink -- than call Brad for help!\\"), not even his most ardent admirers could have predicted how rich a creative vein he had tapped. Everyone saw at the time -- how could they have seen otherwise? -- the giant pin that was Mr. Lichtenstein's art aimed at the hot-air balloon of Abstract Expressionism. He was regarded as a saboteur and a provocateur, but how far could he go with those big, cartoonish spoofs?   Very far, it turns out. So far, in fact, that the end is still not in sight. What makes the gigantic Roy Lichtenstein retrospective opening today at the Guggenheim Museum so particularly remarkable is this almost miraculous sense of unfolding possibilities. Ideas tumble out of his work like circus clowns out of a Volkswagen. By the time you reach the top of the museum's ramp you may well wonder how the same artist who in 1961 was cribbing from an advertisement for Mount Airy Lodge in the Poconos to come up with an image of a girl holding a beach ball could have conceived in the 1980's and early 90's vast compositions that seamlessly weave references to Picasso and Magritte, the Futurists and Expressionists, not to say to Mr. Lichtenstein himself.

Indie in spirit, that is: these days the band records for Sony, which released this group's ''Good News for People Who Love Bad News'' in 2004. That album turned the band members into very unlikely pop stars. Isaac Brock discovered that his snarled lyrics sounded a bit sweeter when they were delivered over buoyant bass lines. And with ''Float On,'' Modest Mouse scored a bona fide rock hit. Still, it has never really been clear how -- or why -- this great but ornery band made such a lovable album.    Will Mr. Brock and his band mates try for another one? Will they make an album that pleases old fans and alienates new ones? Or vice versa? Listeners will find out ''early next year'': according to the band's Web site, modestmousemusic.com, that's when Modest Mouse will release the long-awaited follow-up, ''We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank.'' (The release date had previously been announced as Dec. 19.)    This week Modest Mouse comes to New York to give fans a preview in five sold-out shows at three clubs.

Offscreen, it is a continuation of the Cinderella tale that began in 1982 when the director Susan Seidelman attracted widespread praise with her independently financed, $80,000 first feature, ''Smithereens,'' about a young woman's adventures in the East Village.   ''Desperately Seeking Susan,'' her second film, was made for Orion Pictures and brought her talent for idiosyncratic comedy intact into the mainstream of American movie-making.

But why continue? The case for what is amiss virtually makes itself.   Note first, though, what is not wrong with this frenzy of celebration. It is not that too much time is spent gadding about: if Mary and Joseph were on the road, as it were, for the first Nativity, we hardly do ill to celebrate by going from house to house. Nor is it that we are too unspiritual: if the Holy Child came into the world in the back of a barn, it seems plain that the secular is at least as much His cup of tea as the sacred.   What is wrong is not the presence in our festivities of too much that is material but the absence from them of food that matters sufficiently. Our mistake is to have acquiesced in the cocktail party as the paradigm of Christmas celebration: this is not a holiday that should be commemorated by standing on one foot and munching stuffed mushrooms, crudites and miniature quiches. The holidays cry out for serious food for serious consumption by serious eaters - all in the name of a serious banishing of chic solemnity from our midst.
