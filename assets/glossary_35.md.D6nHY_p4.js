Adapted from a play by Rene-Daniel DuBois, it follows the interrogation of Yves (Roy Dupuis), a 22-year-old male prostitute in Montreal, several days after he has murdered his lover on a steamy July night.    The inspector (Jacques Godin) who does the grilling specializes in dealing with hustlers. His interrogation, in the library of a judge who is one of the prostitute's clients, is a strident, often confusing cat-and-mouse game. Because Yves has already admitted to the homicide, the goal isn't to extract a confession but to reconstruct the events surrounding the crime and to determine the motive.

For 15 years, Mary had been a mainstay of NRDC bringing her great energy, passion, abilities, and forceful personality to its environmental mission and its institutional health. Mary was a person who made things happen; she had a telling impact on NRDC's people and programs and was a doughty fighter in many vital environmental battles. She faced her own arduous and draining battle against cancer with courage and without complaint-maintaining her scrappiness, her sense of humor and her love of life. Despite the many setbacks she faced throughout her struggle against disease, Mary was always fully engaged with life.

In this, her first American production, Pola Negri throws her whole soul into the part of the conscienceless flirt with such art and zest that minor deficiencies of the film and story are entirely swamped by the interest and suspense she creates.Her face is beautiful one second, filled with hate the next: her eyes glow with deep affection and suddenly sparkle with fiery anger. She is good, and then wicked","excerpt":"loving, and then the ruthless vampire. Her acting is made all the more compelling by her lithe and sinuous movements, which set off to the fullest extent the beauty of her expensive gowns. And never for an instant is she awkward with her long-fingered hands. There may have been other vampires of the screen, but none possessed all the art of Pola Negri.The story is rather worn since the production of \\"The Sheik,\\" but is, nevertheless, interestingly done, in spite of the cramped scene of Venice and liberties taken with the book.In Venice Pola appears as Mrs. Ruby Chepstow, hampered obviously by a husband, but receiving admiring looks from all sides, until she finally reciprocates one of the glances with a meaning raising of her languid, dark eyes. Her husband discovers the flirtation and accidentally kills the admirer and is himself convicted, it is taken for granted, of manslaughter. So the Bella Donna of the Carnival of Venice hies to London and poverty.Beauty will out, though, for in the office of Dr. Isaacson Bella Donna meets Nigel Armine, played by Conrad Nagel, whose heart goes out to her at the first meeting. So Bella Donna wins a husband from the doctor's daughter, Patricia (Lois Wilson) and the happy couple decide to spend their honeymoon on the Nile.The scenes that follow give Pola Negri every opportunity to display her ability as a pantomomist and to show herself as a beautiful woman. She is charming as the happy bride, filled with the idea that soon her husband will be Lord Harwich. Soon, however, temptation is flung in her path, by the appearance of Mahmoud Baroudi, dark skinned and wealthy. With an eye for the lithe, fair-skinned beauty of Mrs. Armine, he insists on the couple living part of the time in his Nile Villa, near to which there is a houseboat, and in the offing the luxurious incense smelling tent of the slow moving Baroudi.Bella Donna is not blind to the deep looks of Baroudi. In fact, according to Pola's interpretation, it was something to be expected. Life would have been very dull in the desert with just a husband. She wanted adventure, and this man Baroudi had been put before her by the genii of mesalliances. So when one night her husband goes forth to shoot a bothering jackal, Bella Donna, in riding togs, finds herself suddenly in the arms of the admiring Baroudi.In a spirit of deviltry she changes into a native costume, which is decidedly becoming to Pola Negri. Baroudi is entranced, fascinated and falls at her feet in admiration. By the time her husband returns she has again donned her riding clothes.Then she learns through the newspapers that Lord Harwich's wife has presented him with twins, which causes her to want to get rid of her husband. Urged by Baroudi, she administers slow poison to Nigel, which is discovered, in time to prevent Nigel's death, by Dr. Isaacson, who hastened to Egypt on learning that his friend was ill.Bella Donna decides to go to her paramour for good, but when she enters his tent she discovers him with a fair-faired woman. Lastly, Bella Donna, still beautiful, staggers out into the desert, and not far away is a panther sluggishly creeping toward her.Conway Tearle plays the part of Baroudi commendably, but he is a trifle heavy of face for such a type Claude King as Dr. Isaacson was satisfactory, and Lois Wilson as his demure daughter was good.

First, very little if any low-level waste is life-threatening. Most of it is handled hands-on by personnel working in nuclear power plants, hospitals and so on. Nuclear plant workers are permitted to receive a radiation dose many times more than that permitted the general public. To my knowledge, no credible study has indicated that this still rather low level of radiation exposure of nuclear plant workers causes any significant adverse health effect. That is based upon the operation of more than 100 nuclear plants in the United States for in excess of 1,200 reactor-operation years with a close check on the health of workers.   Considering the relatively low risk from this waste, the technology for low-level radioactive waste burial grounds provides a very high degree of safety for the general public.

So the picture, for all the new narration by the Thomases, pere et fils, is more of an ethnological record than it is a contemporary document.We say this because in the meantime—that is, since the trip and the film were made—Tibet has been taken by the Chinese Communists and its borders have been rigidly closed. What goes on there now in its strange cities and behind its great lamasery walls is almost as mystic and impenetrable as was the region in the centuries gone by.Even so, this picture, which the Thomases shot themselves with hand cameras, is a fascinating scan of a far country that has changed little in hundreds of years, and its full views of the famous Dalai Lama and his Buddhist monks and counselors are vastly rare. These glimpses alone comprise a record that is invaluable.To be sure, more time is taken, in the seventy-five minutes of the film, recounting the hardships of the journey into Tibet than is comfortable. The struggle of men and mules and porters over rough Himalayan mountain trails become just a wee bit monotonous after fifteen minutes or so.But once Tibet is penetrated and its strange cities and peoples come into view, the whole thing becomes engrossing and the time speeds by swiftly. Striking, indeed, are the pictures of the handsome costumes the wealthier and nobler people wear and of the beautiful paintings and jewel work that these supposedly primitive people do.Most exciting, however, are the panoramas of the \\"forbidden city\\" of Lhasa as it is reached, of the great Potala (or grand lamasery) rising above it and of the weird court of Buddhists that resides within. The yellow-robed monks in their red hats and the maroon-robed monks in their heavy hoods parade in curious formations, and there is one sequence recounting a festival of whirling dancers and pantomimists that could be right out of the Middle Ages.And, finally, the views of the Dalai Lama, a 15-year-old boy at the time, are fascinating and awesome—he being a strangely ageless looking lad, attended by elderly cabinet counselors, amid regal trappings and brilliant flowers.The fact that the film gives evidence of having been shot more or less on the wing is no particular detraction. It is strictly a straight travelogue, obviously made under conditions that did not permit perfection at all times. And the fact that the latter part of it is a rather long account of getting the elder Thomas out of the country after his hip had been shattered may be laid to the natural absorption of the travelers in their own affairs.For the part that is little known, \\"Out of This World\\" is a captivating film.

For homeowners with mortgages negotiated in recent years, this offers an opportunity to refinance. Getting the most out of refinancing depends not only on the lower rate but also on how long an owner plans to stay in a house. For those planning on staying three years or less, the rule of thumb is that a new mortgage rate should be at least 2 percentage points below the old rate in order to realize a benefit from the new closing costs. Homeowners expecting to stay at least six years need a rate at least one percentage point lower than their current rate to recover closing costs. Here are the national average rates this week for the most popular mortgages compared to rates a year ago.

At No. 1 last week, displacing the 14-week run of Whitney Houston's eponymous debut album, stood ''Control'' (A & M 5106","excerpt":"LP, cassette, compact disk), by 20-year-old Janet Jackson. The third album by the youngest member of the Jackson family clan is a finely polished, dance-pop record that has sold 1.5 million copies in four months.

Patti La Belle's ''Winner in You'' (MCA 5737; LP, cassette), which has sold 900,000 albums in just seven weeks, ranked second on last week's chart. This sentimental blockbuster of a record is the culmination of a nine-year solo career following the breakup of the rock-soul trio Labelle. Its success proves that old-fashioned, rock-soul belting still has a vital place in pop.

''In the summer of 1984, a friend of mine gave me a tape of 'township jive,' the street music of Soweto, South Africa. It was a happy instrumental music that reminded me of 1950's rhythm and blues, which I have always loved. By the end of the summer I was scat-singing melodies over the tracks. I thought that the group, whoever it was, would be interesting to record with. And so I went on a search to find out who they were and where they came from.''

It was after seeing Ms. Stratas portray Jenny in the Metropolitan Opera's 1979 production of ''The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny'' that Ms. Lenya handed her the crown. But Ms. Stratas is a vastly different sort of singer from Lotte Lenya.
