Unlike Nassau County, Suffolk residents are fortunate that they will have the ability this November to alter their political landscape for years to come.   Locally, I am convinced term limitations is a way of diffusing the egregious and far-reaching powers enjoyed by the Democratic and Republican Parties on Long Island. For instance, this issue will in part deal with the concomitant problem of patronage and self-appointment politics, which continues to hinder good government both in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.   Yet, I feel compelled to answer some critics on this issue. Brookhaven Town Councilmembers Joseph Macchia and Patricia Strebel, both Republicans, feel that once term limits are imposed the citizenry would lose \\"very talented and effective legislators.\\" This argument is completely disingenuous, since it has been a common view promulgated by politicians who seemingly feel they are politically indispensable.   Secondly, Secretary of State Gail S. Shaffer, a Democrat, sees the import of \\"experienced\\" legislators. The word \\"experience\\" in politics is probably the most overrated and overused concept, but nevertheless impacts on the mind of the voter. For any politician touting his experience during re-election time it is often a win-win scenario. Here is a clear example of an institutional problem which could only be rectified by mandating limits on legislative tenure. So called \\"experience\\" politicians, like 10-year incumbent Mario M. Cuomo, have failed miserably in reaching budget decisions, improving transportation, providing decent education, or deterring crime. Ms. Shaffer fails to understand what historian Daniel Boorstein poignantly understood","excerpt":"legislators must be kept to the \\"amateur spirit.\\"   Term limitations, or as Jefferson called it, \\"rotation of public service,\\" has three advantages. First, rotation provides an opportunity for a greater number of individuals to serve in government. Second, it serves as a check on tyranny and selfish political power. But most importantly the Founding Fathers believed that rotation both facilitates and affirms the experimental connection that must exist between the representatives and represented.   Perhaps term limits is a movement of emotion and simplicity, as Professor Cover suggests. But what politicians and academicians fail to understand is that simplicity and common sense can indeed yield profound political, social, and economic change. THOMAS R.

The island nation had no full-time orchestra until the founding of the Iceland Symphony in 1950. It might not seem possible for such a remote place to have cultivated a first-class orchestra in so little time, but the Iceland Symphony,  under the direction of Osmo Vanska, defied expectations with a sensational Carnegie Hall debut on Tuesday night.         Part of the fascination of the program came from the presence of Leifs's own  bizarre, beguiling music. He was born in 1899 and spent his early career in Germany, but his works drew on Icelandic folk music from the start. With its organumlike bass lines in parallel fifths and grinding intervals of the tritone, the native idiom supplied a stark, austere vocabulary","excerpt":"Leifs added his own idiosyncratic touches, including dark, weird orchestration and brutal percussion.

Works by two of Iceland's leading   composers, Jon Leifs and Pall Is&#243;lfsson, are   appropriately combined on this  disk with an American symphony commissioned for the Iceland Symphony's 1962 &#8208; 63 season. Leifs, born in 1899, represents the folklorist who incorporates native music into his work. These include &#8220;rimur&#8221; (traditional tunes) and a style of singing called &#8220;tvis&#246;ngur,&#8221; a persistence of the organum of the Middle Ages into current performance, Is&#243;lfsson, born in 1893, is an organist&#8208;composer, who  reflects the Lutheran Churchbackground of much Icelandic music. Long interested in Icelandic culture, as he has been in those of other peoples, Cowell combines in his symphony the local traditional styles, 12-tone techniques and an attempt to evoke the Icelandic landscape. The samples of these composers&#8217; works here include an overture primitive  in sound and rhythm and spare in harmony, an old&#8208;fashioned but well&#8208;made passacaglia and an effective symphony  that seems to  have a little bit of everything in it.

Then, in rivetingly energized performances of several Strayhorn songs topped off with a fiery rendition of \\"Stormy Weather,\\" she brought the audience to its feet. It was an accomplishment that few performers could have carried off at any age, let alone at 75.    Her first meeting with Strayhorn was in 1942 in California, she recalled. She was sitting in a theater feeling lonely when she was approached by \\"a beautiful brown boy in big horn-rimmed glasses, who looked like a lovely brown owl.\\" He had been sent over by Ellington to see if she wanted something from the refreshment stand.

The song's narrator is a performer who acknowledges with great bitterness the cost of a selfishly squandered youth.

WADE UPHELD    The Supreme Court, in a narrow and anguished decision, reaffirmed what it called the \\"essence\\" of the constitutional right to abortion while at the same time permitting some new state restrictions.  A1  Excerpts from the opinions in the abortion case.  A16  RULING A RELIEF FOR BUSH    The abortion ruling took the edge off a recurring nightmare for President Bush's re-election campaign. But if Bush opponents are right about the potency of the abortion issue, it will continue to haunt him.  A1  UNITED IN NEGATIVE REACTION    Even before they had read the decision, advocates of abortion rights and their opponents sallied forth to shape public opinion on it. They were agreed on one matter: they did not like it.  A15  A GO-AHEAD FOR THE STATES    The Court ruling guarantees many more years of legislation and litigation over how far states may go to restrict abortion, experts said.

But the Mendozas are determined to stay in their refuge from the cities.  A14  The San Andreas fault may be spreading, experts said.  A14  RISING BY CUTTING REGULATIONS    At the age of 34, David M.

Occasionally the festival has expanded into theater songs, but on Thursday evening at the Greenwich House School of Music, 46 Barrow Street, it inched toward rock-and-roll with \\"Ticket to Ride,\\" a program of 29 songs by John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison, in arrangements by Steven Blier, a pianist and one of the festival's directors.     Classical musicians dabbling in Beatles tunes is nothing new. The avant-garde composer Luciano Berio arranged some of the group's songs in 1966, and other composers -- John Cage, Toru Takemitsu and Leo Brouwer among them -- have followed suit more recently. In the 1960's, Leonard Bernstein suggested that the Beatles were our age's Schubert. And in what is said to be his final interview, published in the current Rolling Stone, he described them as \\"the best songwriters since Gershwin.\\"   Thursday's performance leaned closer to the Gershwin comparison. Marsha Hunter, a soprano, and Brian Kent, a lyric baritone -- two strong, colorful singers -- began with duet versions of \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and \\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\\" that sounded as if they had been lifted from 1950's vintage Broadway musicals.    Miss Hunter, in her solo songs, took the theatrical conceit to extremes. In \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" she jettisoned the subtle understatement of Lennon's original vocal and undercut the lyrics by stressing the phrase endings. And during her frenzied, overacted reading of Lennon's \\"You Can't Do That,\\" one could not help thinking how vastly at odds her conception was with the Beatles' spirit. Lennon, in particular, loathed the musical theater.     That said, it was astonishing how well most of the songs adapted to a style so foreign to them, and if there was one thing this program showed, it was how resilient and witty this music is. For the program included the melodic perennials -- \\"Yesterday,\\" \\"I Will,\\" \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"In My Life\\" among them. But there were also oddities like \\"Drive My Car,\\" the aphoristic \\"Her Majesty\\" and Mr. Harrison's \\"Piggies\\" and \\"Taxman,\\" which were offered as prophetic looks at the 1980's and 90's.    Except for the few that drifted into a theater style, Mr. Blier's arrangements were exquisite. His piano accompaniments were often freely embellished, but they also embodied the harmonies and counterpoint one hears on the Beatles' disks. And at their best they even suggested the group's instrumental textures.    For several of the songs, the singers and Mr. Blier were joined by Mark Stewart, a cellist. Mr. Stewart also played guitar in his own witty, jazz-tinged arrangement of \\"Love Me Do.\\" And in an unaccompanied quodlibet, Mr. Kent played air guitar and sang the riff from \\"Day Tripper\\" while Miss Hunter sang \\"Ticket to Ride.\\"   The program is to be repeated today at 5 P.M.

His most recent album, \\"Circus\\" (Virgin), has sold only 285,000 copies, a small amount in comparison with the 1.9 million sales of his last record, \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\" One reason for this slip is that Mr. Kravitz is a self-made anachronism: in an era when rap, alternative rock and computer-programmed rhythm-and-blues dominate the charts, Mr. Kravitz remains stuck in the 1960's, rarely deviating from the musical riffs, verbal messages, hippie fashion and even the musical equipment of the decade.
