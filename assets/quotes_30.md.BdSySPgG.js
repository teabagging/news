A series of beautiful scenes, mansions, apartments and automobiles make it even more supercilious.The play opens with the revolution in Russia when the armed peasantry swoop down upon the residence of General Svirski and his beautiful wife. There is a cut-in for a moment when we are able to see that the wife does not love the general—and does in fact love some one entirely different. The irate husband hears of this and so shoots the poor, harmless boy.Now we go to the Riviera, into atmosphere quite as ornate, where the wife suddenly finds another lad she loves. He looks very much like the one in Petrograd, which may explain matters, and is just as silly. The husband again steps forward, and is about to shoot Lothario No. 2 when he quietly dies. The beautiful wife and the handsome youngster clasp hands and march into the rosy future together. Their happiness is not to be envied for she is about twenty years older than he.All of the characters in this amazing bit of melancholia overact. They face the camera and register sorrow, then they walk slowly away, wringing their hands in bitter disillusionment. When they smile it is with a hundred feet of lacrymose wistfulness.

And that's what you get in large slices in the French film, \\"The Eternal Return,\\" a so-called modern version of the Tristan and Isolde legend, which came to the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse on Saturday.Starting out rather grotesquely in a cold and forbidding chateau inhabited by several odd characters, including a cretinous child, this tale of a young fellow's passion for his uncle's lonely-hearts wife proceeds with morose determination to become completely bizarre and absurd. Love potions, jealous malevolence and an old-op'ry house deathbed scene are among the theatrical gimcrackeries that have been employed in it. Charity toward all this fustian is not improved one whit by knowledge that the script was written by the French poet-playwright, Jean Cocteau.Neither is admiration or credibility inspired by the tastelessly glamour-glazed performance of Jean Marais in the leading role. Posturing before the camera with the manners of a dimpled female star, M. Marais gives a curious exhibition of the love-torments of an anguished man. It is hard to recognize him as the gentle monster of the current \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\" And very little passion or persuasion is evident in the frigid attitude of Madeleine Sologne, a wraith-like lady who plays the counterpart of Isolde. Jean Murat is ridiculously stony as cuckolded Uncle Marc, and a dwarf by the name of Pieral is just plain ghastly as the cretinous child.Jean Delannoy's direction is painfully pompous and slow, and a few snatches of music by Georges Auric, scattered hither and yon, are meek and vain.

But the wit itself is so artless and the picture is so extensively cut, for good and respectable reasons, that all you will now see on the screen is some rather crude French clowning in a virtually meaningless farce.As originally made from a novel by Gabriel Chevallier, this picture told of the confusions in a pre-war French wine-country town when the radical citizens in the community had a public convenience erected in the town square. Dignified citizens were outraged, the local clergy were embarrassed no end and a national political crisis hung by a thread of red tape. Finally, the crisis was averted by an order from the President of France, supporting republicanism and the continuation of the local \\"monument.\\"But in this carefully truncated version, the whole cause of the crisis is so removed from observation—or even comprehension—that it is difficult to understand why all the shouting and arm-waving, not to mention the lofty outrage of the elderly ladies of the community who look but never see anything. And likewise the incidental amours of the younger elements have been so swiftly veiled that only a broad imagination will gather any evidence from them.So what? The joke is so unsubtle, the humor is so completely coarse and the acting and direction are so preposterous that no regrettable damage has been done. In a large cast of uninhibited farceurs, Max Dalban and Brochard come fairly close to the better traditions of French acting, but that is the best to be said. The script and Pierre Chenal's direction flounder all over the lot.Call this a smoking-room story, very vaugely and clumsily told.

Despite the softening of the art market and continued gallery closings, at least a dozen new galleries and exhibition spaces, ranging from blue-chip to no-frills, have opened in the area this fall. Everything from painting and sculpture to throw-away Xerox art is to be found in them, and the extremes in art can cause an invigorating kind of mental whiplash.   The top of the line is the austere, generously proportioned new downtown gallery of the uptown dealer Larry Gagosian, recently opened on Wooster Street near Prince Street. Then there are the low-budget efforts that reflect young artists and their supporters taking things into their own hands, often with art proudly displayed in raw or nearly raw exhibition spaces. While sales are still a goal in these ventures, they stand in sharp contrast to the scores of over-designed galleries that framed so much 80's art.

Its narrative, a Vernesque romance by Thea von Harbou, is sufficiently negligible, but its delineation of the amazing experiences which await the first visitors from the earth is graphically presented. Professor Hermann Oberth, Hungarian pioneer in space-rocket flight experiments, collaborated with Fritz Lang in the production. On its scientific side the film suffers from a tantalizing incompleteness, an unfortunate genuflection to popular ignorance.The huge rocket, life dream of a bewhiskered professor, flies through space like a falling star, attaining a speed of twelve kilometers per second. Inside, strapped down and writhing from the pressure, are the professor, two young scientists, the girl for whose love they are rivals, a disagreeable representative of the flight's backers, and a stowaway boy. The rocket is fitted with elaborate control mechanisms and interplanetary navigating instruments which literally cry for an explanation of their functions.At a point where the gravity forces of the earth and the moon cancel each other, 220,000 miles from the start, the travelers weigh nothing and have to use arm and foot straps to keep from floating to the ceiling. There they enjoy scenes of the sun rising from behind the distant earth and watch the gray, pock-marked moon drawing near. Once within the area of lunar gravity, the pilot reverses the propulsion forces of the explosions in the tail of the rocket and the craft plops into the snowy surface of the desolate planet.From this point the romance gathers force. The professor discovers gold in one of the eerie caverns and is lost in a crevasse. Crazed by the discovery, the agent runs amuck and is finally shot by one of the others, but not before he has put a bullet through the oxygen tank. This means that one of the two remaining men must stay behind. Lots are drawn, but true love wins the day, the girl and the man she loves remaining to die on the sunless wastes. The German cast is excellent and the photography often striking.

And for a time the conflict seems even bolder and more urgent, as significantly photographed in the insular ruggedness of a backward mountain hamlet.However, the new \\"Don,\\" interpreted by Camillo (!) Pilotto, is a far cry from Fernandel's priestly firebrand. Both he and the Mayor, previously a Communist thorn, are now sideline spectators of the clash and subsequent romance between a galvanized \\"advanced\\" teacher from afar and the proud village ne'er-do-well. Egged on by the lady's loud sensibilities, the entire populace disrupts over the immediate issue, construction of a dam with outside grafted financing.Until the hero grudgingly allows himself to be taught to read, in one nice sequence among many, the film is all it should be—candid, warm and amusingly perceptive. The incidents move with brisk persuasion and the focal romance seems as sound as the underscoring plea for human communicability and enlightenment.Vivi Gioi and Adriano Rimoldi make excellent melting opponents, and Mr. Pilotto and the others provide a picturesque, credible gallery of hill folk.Sadly, the last quarter of the footage, abruptly strewn with fuzzy sociological symbols, folds like an accordion. Mr. Rimoldi bolts for the city (Milan), becomes vaguely involved in a vaguely defined strike. Miss Gioi joins him for an ecstatic liaison, but the two quarrel and return home separately.The story ends on a dank, stark and inconclusive note of retribution (vague again), as the pregnant, disillusioned teacher claims her dying lover after a cliff accident.
