As to the second part of Rockefeller's youthful musing - ''probably a very fine one'' - it is less easy to be certain. Samuel E.  Bleecker is quite certain, however, and the point of his new book is to tell us that ''a very fine one'' is what Nelson Rockefeller became, if not in the literal sense of being a gifted designer himself, then in the more general sense of being one of the great patrons of architecture of modern times.

Mr. Guy brought two things to the show: a sense of play, or wit, and a sound that, as a product of blues culture, is almost lost. The play came out in his abrupt transitions, in which he played in one register, then suddenly jumped into the next, as if the needle on a record had skipped. And it came in his tricks, rubbing the strings with his sleeve or bending notes a handful of different ways or pulling the strings and letting them snap, all creating a vocabulary of industrial sounds: whooshing and grinding and pounding. Mr. Guy was sculpturing aural metal, having his guitar and its electricity move beyond notes into the realm of sound. And he clearly took pleasure in it.

As the music swirls, that rock too lowers, the lighting shifts slightly and in the rear Valhalla can be discerned, engulfed in flames. It is an intelligent and compact solution to Wagner's attempts to show all three regions of his universe in the score's final pages.  The performance of the Met's first \\"Ring\\" cycle this season, which ended on Saturday afternoon after three previous Saturday matinees, seemed to combine that final scene's mixture of clunky artifice and supple grandeur throughout its 17 hours.

O. S. Iceberg,\\" Carl Laemmle's present offering at the Criterion, several stirring glimpses of polar bears and one interlude in which two of these animals battle with each other for a seal's carcass.It is a lusty melodrama of the frozen wilds and as such it is lurid, and frequently the suspense is drawn out to the snapping point. Nevertheless, it is filled with flashes of the majestic walls of ice, and in one episode the explorers dart over the snow and ice on skis in the most expert fashion.The picture gives a fine conception of the curious formations both of the glaciers and icebergs. The members of the fiction expedition are beheld sufferng from hunger, one of them named John Dragan going mad and causing the death of a companion. There are several grim ideas in the film, which was produced in Greenland under the supervision of Dr. Arnold Fanck, who is also responsible for the story. The actual director of the production was Tay Garnett.Among the principals are Gibson Gowland, who plays Dragan","excerpt":"Rod La Rocque, who acts Dr. Carl Lawrence, the head of the expedition; Walter Riml, an Austrian, and Leni Riefenstahl, a German actress, who portrays Lawrence's wife.The opening episode reveals the characters at a dinner, discussing the expedition, which is to go in search of an exploring party that has not been heard from for a year. Soon afterward the Lawrence expedition is seen amid the snow and ice, and for most of the narrative Lawrence is a victim of exhaustion and privation. He leaves his companions to look for the missing men of months ago and is subsequently found by his colleagues.There is a good deal of realism about the picture. One almost senses the cold, with the characters sleeping in great fur coats within ice walls, and glad of even this protection. There is the whining and yelping of the dogs and during a lengthy sequence one of the courageous men undertakes to swim to an Eskimo village to get help. He wears his clothes, even boots studded with big nails, but he manages to get through the water at a pace which is rather startling.Mrs. Lawrence comes out in search of her husband's party at one juncture and a good deal of time is monopolized with views of her plane darting here and there over the glaciers and icebergs until she eventually crashes and her airplans bursts into flames.In a climactic episode the Eskimos are seen preparing to go to the rescue of Lawrence and the survivors of the party. The way in which the Eskimos dart forth in scores of kyacks is one of the outstanding effects in the film.Mr. Gowland gives a splendid performance as the maddened explorer, Dragan. He has murder in his heart at one time and later evidently thinks of killing one of the dogs for food. Rod La Rocque does quite well as Lawrence and Leni Riefenstahl is acceptable as Mrs. Lawrence. It is, however, a picture in which nature outshines both the players and the story.

He avoided the stereotypes that settled onto many other black New York choreographers in his time, becoming as well known for his abstract pieces as for dances that drew on the experiences of black Americans. The Rod Rodgers Dance Company will pay tribute to his quiet legacy with ''Don't Tell Me Who I Am,'' a mini-retrospective that begins a four-day engagement on Thursday at La MaMa in the East Village. The program will include a new work by Sean Curran, a longtime friend, and an homage by Kayoko Sakoh, a company member.     ''He was a political activist, dating back before the 60's,'' said Kim Grier, the company's artistic director. ''This is one of the reasons his company came about. He felt that he wanted to create a company and have a voice. He felt an individual should be able to explore creation from his own experience, his own personal heritage.'' The program's title comes from a 1968 essay by Rodgers in Negro Digest, in which he wrote: ''It is simply a question of what takes precedence in the creative act: my total living experience, or those experiences which I consider particularly relevant to my blackness.''

Cantor, who have lent it to the museum, and I am bound to say that its appearance in New York amply justifies my apprehensions. ''The Gates of Hell'' is just as odious as ever it was - the more so, in fact, for being flanked, as Rodin himself wished, by the two standing figures that do so notable a disservice to our first father, Adam, and our first mother, Eve.   As a work of art, ''The Gates of Hell'' is chaotic, incoherent and misconceived. In terms of its message - and Rodin here is nothing if not a moralist - it is an unsavory mixture of fear, sadism, guilt, sexism and superstition. In the late 19th century all this might have passed as a failed masterpiece. But ours is another kind of century.  Hell has been here on earth. It may be here again, moreover.

New Yorkers who want a taste of the concert can catch Orchestra Baobab at Zankel Hall on Thursday night.    Stalin's Secret Hitler Book To Be Published      A secret biography of Hitler that was commissioned by Stalin is to be published in Germany later this month, the book's British publisher said on Friday. The biography was presented to the Stalin in December 1949, in an edition of one, and was stored in his personal archive, where it was discovered by a German historian, Matthias Uhl, last year. It is to be published by Lubbe in Germany and by John Murray Publishers in Britain in November.    Director Says 'The Hobbit' Is at Least 4 Years Away      Peter Jackson has said that it would be at least four years before he could begin a film adaptation of ''The Hobbit.'' Mr. Jackson, left, on a break from filming a remake of ''King Kong'' in New Zealand to visit a ''Lord of the Rings'' exhibition in Sydney, Australia, said there was a desire to make the film, but lengthy negotiations were required, the BBC reported. ''I think it's going to be a lot of lawyers sitting in a room trying to thrash out a deal before it will ever happen,'' Mr. Jackson said. The rights to J.R.R. Tolkien's classic ''The Hobbit,'' whose story predates that of ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy, are split between two film studios.    Author Chosen For 'Peter Pan' Sequel      An award-winning British children's book author has been chosen to write the official sequel to J.M. Barrie's ''Peter Pan.'' Geraldine McCaughrean, 53, who has won the prestigious Whitbread Children's Book of the Year award three times, was selected by the London hospital that owns the copyright to ''Peter Pan,'' The Associated Press reported. The new work, to be called ''Captain Hook,'' will feature the original characters, including the boy who never grew up, the pirate Hook, Wendy, Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys. Ms. McCaughrean was chosen from a number of authors who submitted synopses and sample chapters to Great Ormond Street Hospital, which was willed the copyright and royalties to ''Peter Pan'' by Barrie, when he died in 1937. No publication date was announced, but the copyright expires in 2007.    Actress Injured In 'Sweet Charity' Tryout      Christina Applegate broke her foot on Friday in Chicago in a pre-Broadway performance of ''Sweet Charity,'' which is to begin previews at the Al Hirschfeld Theater on West 45th Street on April 4. Ms. Applegate, above right, injured her foot near the beginning of the performance and continued for about 20 minutes before being replaced by an understudy, representatives of the show said. She will miss the remainder of the Chicago run -- the second of three pre-Broadway engagements -- as well as performances in Boston later this month. But her doctors are optimistic that she will be able to return to the show in time for its Broadway previews, the statement said.    Music: New CD's in Release      The legendary gospel group Blind Boys of Alabama lost a founding member last week when the baritone George Scott, who had been with the group since its beginning in 1939, died on Wednesday at 75. This puts the group's future in doubt, but its astonishing recent comeback may continue at least for a while, with the release tomorrow of ''Atom Bomb.'' Since the group signed with Peter Gabriel's Real World label in 2001, it has enjoyed an upsurge in sales and won three Grammy Awards. ... Other pop releases this week include ''Employment'' (Universal), the much anticipated debut album by the British punk band Kaiser Chiefs; ''Nolita'' (Blue Note), the second American album by the Israeli-born singer-songwriter Keren Ann; and the R&B singer Brooke Valentine's ''Chain Letter'' (Virgin). Two attractive box sets of classical piano music will be released tomorrow by Philips: a six-CD set of Stephen Kovacevich playing Beethoven and an eight-CD set of Mitsuko Uchida playing Schubert.    Gift to Design Museum      The Museum of Arts and Design in New York has been given 40 major works in ceramics and glass by leading 20th-century artists, including Dale Chihuly, William Morris, Stanislav Libensky, Robert Arneson, Mary Shaffer and Lino Tagliapietra. The items, donated by Simona and Jerome Chazen, collectors long associated with the museum, will join others from the Chazens' collection in a new exhibition, ''Dual Vision'' at the museum, 40 West 53rd Street in Manhattan, from May 26 to Sept. 11. In 2003, the Chazens donated $12 million in support of the museum's new building, opening in 2007 at Columbus Circle.    Footnote      The S.E.M. Ensemble, the long-running avant-garde orchestra led by Petr Kotik, celebrates its 35th anniversary tonight with a concert at Zankel Hall featuring two premieres.
