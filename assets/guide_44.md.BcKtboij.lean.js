Loaded to the gunwales with the studio's eager young singing and dancing talent, who do justice to some noted tunes, it nevertheless emerges as a routine treatment of the transparent romantic complications of a trio of gobs on shore leave. Producers and sailors have been known to be more inventive.While \\"Hit the Deck\\" obviously is not a new work—it graced the Broadway boards in 1927 and R. K. O. turned it into a Technicolor musical three years later—it apparently has not improved with age.In this instance, a chief boatswain's mate, who is not quite ready to marry his lady-love after six years of courtship, and his two buddies are seen scurrying all over San Francisco to avoid the long arm of the shore patrol. The reason? Our three bluejackets have assaulted a playboy actor who, they think, was about to seduce the nubile sister of one of the boys. To add to the involvements, she happens to be an admiral's daughter, her sailor brother is yearning for an appointment to Annapolis, and the escapade would ruin his good record and chances. Get it?If this framework is fragile, then the energetic capers and warbling of the principals is solid. One doesn't need a keen ear for music to appreciate \\"Hallelujah\\" as harmonized by Tony Martin, Vic Damone and Russ Tamblyn. \\"I Know That You Know\\" and \\"Sometimes I'm Happy\\" never sounded more cheerful than when they are crooned by Jane Powell and Mr. Damone. Mr. Martin's baritone is romantically right for \\"More Than You Know.\\" And Kay Armen, who gives ample and colorful voice to \\"Ciribiribin,\\" gets a fine assist from Debbie Reynolds, Miss Powell and the Messrs. Martin, Damone and Tamblyn.As a night club's leading dancing doll, Ann Miller, the lady who has not been able to capture Tony Martin, the man of her dreams, torridly undulates to the boogie beat of \\"Lady From the Bayou.\\" And she also earns her keep in a fast, rattling climactic tap routine. Miss Reynolds, a hoofer in a show coincidentally called \\"Hit the Deck,\\" and Russ Tamblyn put a professional polish on the film's outstanding dance number—a supercharged, syncopated dash through the \\"horrors\\" of an amusement park fun house. Mr. Tamblyn plays the sailor-brother of Miss Powell, the cause of it all.Producer Joe Pasternak, an old hand at this game, and Roy Rowland, his director, have given their cast plenty of room and natural appearances by filming the musical high jinks in color and CinemaScope proportions.And they have filled it with amour, too: The blonde, doll-like and charming Miss Powell is loved mightily by Vic Damone and Walter Pidgeon, her bumbling admiral-father. Naturally, Mr. Martin finally says yes to Miss Miller, and there is no reason why the cute and curly Mr. Tamblyn should not fall for the equally cute and beaming Miss Reynolds. Even Miss Armen, playing the widowed mother of Mr. Damone, gets her man—J. Carrol Naish.Love and music are not enough. Although these gobs and girls \\"Hit the Deck\\" amiably and willingly, it is rarely a laughing matter. Their vehicle is not an imaginative creation. It seems to be jury-rigged and lacking in buoyancy.Featured on the Music Hall's stage are the Rockettes, the Glee Club, Anthony Mordente, Patricia Rayney, The Novellos, Bruce Sidlinger and Mitchell Gregg.

In neither case had it always been so. The popularity of Mahler's huge symphonies and the widening appeal of Bruckner's sprang in large measure from a common source: the vast intellectual embrace and deep humanity of Walter.         Yet as this German-born conductor helped define Mahler and Bruckner in the minds of music lovers, not even those composers' grand-scaled works could define him. The range of Walter's affinities, of his artistic empathy and interpretive  originality, extended from Haydn and Mozart through Beethoven and Schubert to Brahms and Wagner. His musical authority was nothing short of pan-Germanic.

First there is the master of the touching melody, the maker of soft modal cadences redolent of long ago and far away and ruefully nostalgic for both. Then there is Ravel the genius of contrivance, delicate manipulator of instrumental color, master of the coup de theatre.         How the first Ravel can become the second was demonstrated at the beginning of this Avery Fisher Hall event. \\"Le Tombeau de Couperin\\" began as a dignified and austere piano suite, a revisiting of the late Baroque. The orchestrated version, using four of the original's six movements, turns black-and-white rectitude into something just short of gaudiness. Splendid in his cleverness, ever on the lookout for the attention-getting accessory, Ravel is the interior decorator who creates rooms so unnaturally elegant that few would feel comfortable living in them.

But they were also impressively authoritative, given the relative inexperience of the choreographer and her performers, all recent graduates of the University of Michigan who trained with Peter Sparling, a former Martha Graham dancer. There wasn't an inexpert moment in the program. Ms. Palazzola is clearly a very promising artist.   Each of the dances was short, mostly with pristine black, white or gray dance clothes for costumes. Three dances were performed in silence. Clear and simple without being spare, the choreography was often a matter of unadorned walks, thrusting arms, kneeling and bodies curling to wrap around each other.

More than 50 paintings and prints by Winslow Homer, James E. Buttersworth, Antonio Jacobsen, Fitz Hugh Lane and other artists illustrate two centuries of change in the design of sailing vessels and yachts. They are embellished by photographs and models of some of the more significant ships, and more than 100 marine-related objects. Four sections of the exhibition will cover warships and battle scenes, clipper ships, whaling and fishing vessels, and racing yachts and cruising vessels.    Among the lenders to the exhibit are Mystic Seaport, the United States Naval Academy, the Smith College Museum of Art, the Peabody Essex Museum and 15 yacht clubs in Fairfield and Westchester Counties. Ship models and trophies from the Indian Harbor Yacht Club in Greenwich will be on display.     Among the special events planned in conjunction with the exhibition is a dinner-lecture series with James Taylor from the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England","excerpt":"Revell Carr from the Mystic Seaport Museum, and Peter Neill from the South Street Seaport Museum in Manhattan.    The exhibition will remain open through July 13, Tuesday through Saturday from 10 to 5, Sunday from 1 to 5. Admission is $3.50, $2.50 for people 65 and older, and children 5 through 12 years of age.

SONTAG AT YALE      Susan Sontag will present a lecture entitled ''The Art of Fiction: A Reading'' on Tuesday at 4:30 in the Whitney Humanities Center, 53 Wall Street on the Yale campus, followed at 8:30 P.M. with an informal conversational session at Ezra Stiles College, 9 Tower Parkway. Both events are open to the public free of charge.     OLD LYME ARTISTS      A collection of paintings by members of Old Lyme's turn-of-the-century artists' colony are preserved in the Florence Griswold Museum, a historic landmark that was then a summer boarding house for the American Impressionists.    Through June 20 the stately yellow and white building will house an exhibition of landscape paintings that depict scenes in a five-acre contiguous parcel that the museum is in the process of acquiring.     The museum, at 96 Lyme Street, is also the headquarters of the Lyme Historical Society and is open Wednesday through Sunday from 1 to 5. Admission is $4, $3 for older people and students, free to children under 12. The number is 860-434-5542 for more information.     PETERS AT FAIRFIELD      A concert of light operatic classics will be performed by Roberta Peters next Saturday at 7:30 in the Quick Center for the Arts at Fairfield University. The event is a benefit for the Children's Community Day Care Center. Ms. Peters, of the Metropolitan Opera Company, has in recent years been a musical ambassador to Russia, where she was the first American to receive the Bolshoi Medal, and to China, where she gave recitals and conducted master classes.    Tickets are priced from $25 to $75 and may be reserved by calling 203-254-4242.     ART BY LEAR      Donald Gallup, former curator of the Yale Collection of American Literature at the Beinecke Library, has given the university his collection of the works of Edward Lear. It is housed in the Yale Center for British Art, and until it is formally exhibited in 2000 it may be seen by scholars who must call 203-432-2800 to arrange an appointment.    Lear is more familiar as the author of verses like ''The Owl and The Pussycat'' than for his skill as a painter, illustrator and draftsman. This collection contains 7 oil paintings, 2 oil studies, 362 drawings, 30 prints, 10 autograph letters and additional manuscripts and printed matter.    Among the works are drawings of the Lake District in England from the 1830's, works in oil of Corfu and sites in India, Italy and Egypt, and illustrations for a tract on parrots. His documentations of landscapes  are now considered invaluable.     WEAVERS' ART      A juried exhibition of handwoven rugs, wall hangings, baskets, tapestries, bobbin lace, off-loom weaving and other prime examples of the weavers' art are on view and for sale at the Lyme Art Association in Old Lyme through Saturday.    A special feature of the show, held every other year by the Handweavers Guild of Connecticut, is the work of Helena Hernmark, whose tapestries are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago and the museum of the Rhode Island School of Design, among others.     Visiting hours are Tuesday through Friday from noon to 4:30 and today and Saturday from 1 to 4:30. Admission is $2 and the number for more information is 203-434-7802.     FORESTS' FUTURE      Scientists, researchers, land planners and forest managers will present their varied perspectives on the future of America's Northeastern forests during a symposium to be held next Saturday from 8 to 5:30 at Connecticut College in New London.    Sponsored by the college's Center for Conservation Biology and Environmental Studies and the Connecticut Forest and Parks Association, the event is open to the public for a fee of $25, including Continental breakfast and lunch. An additional $25 will cover attendance at an evening reception, dinner and keynote address.    Robert Askins, professor of zoology at the college, says ''many new developments, from the introduction of new pathogens to acid raid and new construction projects, will take an enormous toll on our forests.''     The number is 860-4390-5021 for reservation, directions or more information.     BOGART BIOGRAPHY      ''Bogart,'' a new biography of the actor, was written by two authors who never met him. One of them, Eric Lax, will discuss the book today at 2 P.M. at the R. J. Julia bookstore, 768 Post Road in Madison.    Mr. Lax took over the writing of ''Bogart'' after Ann M. Sperber, author of ''Murrow: His Life and Times,'' had spent seven years compiling a massive archive of material. Ms. Sperber died in 1994. Mr. Lax is known for ''Woody Allen,'' a 1991 best-seller.    Also at the bookstore, Sydney Eddison, author of ''The Self-Taught Gardener: Lessons from a Country Garden'' and other books and articles on gardening, will give a talk on Thursday at 7 P.M. for beginners and experienced home gardeners alike.

In 1978, Congress deregulated the airlines to allow a natural formation of highly competitive industry, encourage new entrants, create jobs, increase airline efficiency, hold down costs and make it cheaper to fly. What you call consolidation, and I term creeping monopolization, has halted entry by new carriers and sabotaged established carriers in deregulation and entrants (of the 14 relatively alarge new airlines estabished since 1978 only America West survives). The industry is losing jobs -- 150,000 in the last four years. Productivity and profits among the three major carriers are low and sinking lower","excerpt":"revenues are not keeping up with costs.    I think readers will recognize that we need more competition, not less. I would also take issue with the following areas in your assessment:    *To hold up Southwest Airlines as the little engine that could paints an incomplete picture. Southwest has indeed achieved one of the lowest cost structures in the industry, a record America West has matched. But neither America West nor any other airline has the leegislatively mandated advantage Congress gave Southwest in 1978, with the Wright amendment.    Southwest profits significantly from the monopoly it has created at Dallas Love Field. Its fares in the Texas market are considerably higher, compared with those elsewhere in its system (particularly on routes also served by America West.) With artificially high profits from Texas passengers, this \\"special advantage\\" as you call it, contributes roughly $75 million to the bottom line annually and allows Southwest to subsidize its operation in markets where it competes with other carriers or loses money. Without this legislative monopoly, Southwest would be losing money like everyone else.    Southwest has driven ticket prices on competitive routes way below cost. The carrier will continue to subsidize predatory pricing conditions in other markets as long as it holds onto its monoppoly at Love Field.    * Rapid growth has been cited by many as a major contributor to the downfall or financial problems of a number of airlines, including America West. But America West, like Southwest and others, found that the only way for the smaller lines to survive was to grow beyond our original market niches. The more sucessful we were with new routes and new markets, the fiercer the competition was to grow or be swallowed up.    * The competitive advantages conferred on the Big Three -- American, United and Delta -- by frequent-flier programs, computerized reservations systems and landing slots are hardly water over the dam.    The proprietary Sabre and Apollo computerized reservations systems contribute $400 million annually to the bottom line for American and United, and offset losses from ticket sales. America West alone contributes more then $3 million a month to revenue transfers. Add to that the booking advantages and incentives built into the system, and you have an overwhelming cost advantage, a formidable barrier to entry and a dangerous concentration of air traffic in the hands of a few carriers.    * The argument that competition among relatively few airlines will keep prices in line with costs is folly. It hasn't happened yet -- performance and profitability are down, and prices in no way reflect costs -- nor is there any indication from the United States oil and gas, automobile and steel industries that it will. Industrial consolidation has meant a market closed to innovation, job creation, productivity and fair pricing.    * Optimism about new entrants is misplaced. Of the 14 large airlines formed after deregulation in 1978 only America West survives, and it operates in Chapter 11. Sure, the industry makes room for new entrants, but it penalizes those that become too big, too successful or too aggressive. By restricting access to airports, the large airlines quash those entrants who attempt to compete on the more popular routes.    Monopolies represent and protect inefficient industries. Unless the Government uses its antitrust powers to preserve the airline industry's competitive integrity, the result will be even less efficiency, higher fares, fewer passengers, and, ultimately, re-regulation. And that's something no one wants. EDWARD R.

In \\"Spike Heels,\\" a new comedy at the Second Stage, a young writer named Theresa Rebeck wonders if the beloved old gags of that era might be dusted off for retrograde fun even as the sexual roles are given a modern reversal. Her heroine is the smart cookie of the piece. It's the men's turn to be the virgins and tramps.   The idea is wicked and promising, but the execution is a letdown despite a sexy cast that features Saundra Santiago, Kevin Bacon and Tony Goldwyn as its principal triangle. The problem is not Ms. Rebeck's feminist agenda or her plot. As the working-class Georgie, the Boston secretary played by Ms. Santiago, bounces between her decent, bookish, chaste downstairs neighbor (Mr. Goldwyn, in the Tony Randall, Tom Ewell or Jack Lemmon role) and the slick lawyer who is her boss (Mr. Bacon, in the Rock Hudson or Fred MacMurray role), the complications are no less amusing for being familiar. And Georgie's highly developed sense of self-esteem is just the contemporary wild card to keep Ms. Rebeck's permutations on the vintage comic formulas from reaching predictable resolutions.

Byrd, has been assembled out of official footage by Metro. Under the title \\"The Secret Land,\\" this 71-minute compilation was released here yesterday in several Loew neighborhood theatres.Except for occasional grandiloquence in the commentary and a few conspicuous shots in one of the dramatic episodes which appear to have been staged, this record of the three-phase expedition is a good, straight piece of factual reporting, thorough in its comprehensions and pictorial beyond words.The account begins with the mapping of the expedition, called \\"Operation Highjump,\\" in Washington and scenes of the assembly in several ports of the vessels and equipment to be used. The excitement begins with the record of the passage of the main body of ships through the ice pack approaching the Ross Sea, when some of the vessels became ice-bound and the Coast Guard ice-breaker Northwind set them free.Scenes of the establishment of the main base at Little America are conventional but interesting, lightened by touches of humor, and the sequence showing the arrival of Admiral Byrd and his complement of large exploring airplanes, flown from a carrier off the ice pack, is exciting. Many amusing and venturesome episodes are included prior to the climactic sequences of the film recounting mishaps, one of them tragic, which happened to the exploring planes.The extent of the operation and their geographical importance are graphically explained on excellent animated color maps and the narration of the commentary is capably handled by Robert Montgomery, Robert Taylor and Van Heflin.

More anecdotal than dramatic, the play, at the Manhattan Theater Club, is enhanced by the contribution of the cast, under the direction of John Tillinger. Basically the work is an overlapping slice of life about two disparate wives in contrasting but equally disastrous marriages. They are driven to the same end: a severe state of depression. Each case is in the nature of a case history, with the playwright diagnosing the illness and offering a litany of causes without fully investigating the roots of the shared problem or the marriages themselves. In each story, the husband would seem to bear much of the responsibility for his wife's depression.    In an earlier, 20-minute version of the play at the Ensemble Studio Theater, the emphasis was on the husbands, a prosperous local businessman and a carpenter living below his social class. They met in the waiting room of a state mental hospital and gradually revealed their differences (and the similarity of their wives' ailments). The expanded version, which opened last night and will be presented in a different production in London next week, runs barely more than one hour. It abbreviates the waiting room scene and reduces the dramatic buildup of the male conflict. Then it shifts to the women, who are nervously postponing the moment they will face their husbands.
