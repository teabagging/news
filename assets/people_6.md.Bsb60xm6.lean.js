Vandercook's novel, \\"Murder in Trinidad,\\" is easily one of the best films that have been shown at the Mayfair in months. With all due respect to the author's share of the work, it should be stated that the shadow melodrama is very fortunate in having such a restrained and efficient player as Mr. Bruce in the leading rôle.Mr. Bruce acts Bertram Lynch, a cool British sleuth, who arrives at Port of Spain to track down the smugglers of diamonds. He is first perceived with a monkey on his shoulder and as he converses with the Governor of Trinidad and members of the Governor's staff, this remarkable sleuth surprises them, both by his casual manner and his habit of eating peanuts. Colonel Cassell, who had been unsuccessful in finding any clue to the smugglers, is evidently disgruntled that a man of Lynch's type has been sent over, at the instance of the Governor, to take full charge of the investigation. But in a few minutes Lynch reveals his powers of observation and, although he appears slothful, he displays eventually no little energy in pursuing his quarry.Lynch's tactics occasionally are not unlike those of that old master, Sherlock Holmes. He keeps most of his deductions to himself and now and again his monkey shows considerable intelligence by giving a warning cry. This search for the smuggling gentry is by no means all beer and skittles, for soon after Lynch sets foot in Port of Spain, he narrowly escapes being killed by a dagger thrown by some individual who flees through the shrubbery. Then his assistant, who had preceded him to Trinidad, is stabbed to death.The excitement is sustained by the murder of the Governor and the strange disappearance of Colonel Cassell and his daughter, Joan. Lynch and the Governor's son, Gregory Bronson, posing as fugitives from justice, bribe a villainous black man to guide them to a safe retreat in the Caroni swamps. Even this hazardous journey might not have led to the apprehension of the leading individual in the smuggling ring, had not Lynch resorted to a clever ruse.It is a lurid enough piece of work, but one that is distinguished by Mr. Bruce's compelling portrayal. Heather Angel and Douglas Walton figure as the romantic couple. J. Carrol Naish is effective in one of the sinister rôles. Others who do well by this offering are Murray Kinnell, Victor Jory and Claude King. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Nigel Bruce as a Cool British Sleuth in a Film Version of the Novel, \\"Murder in Trinidad.\\""},{"year":"1946","title":"There is not a great deal of difference between one Sherlock Holmes film and the next, but the little there is weighs in favor of \\"Terror by Night,\\" which came to the Rialto yesterday. That is because this episode in the famous detective's career is told in a tight continuity and with flavorsome atmosphere. On a train bound from London to Edinburgh, Mr. Holmes—Basil Rathbone, of course—is confronted with a baffling diamond robbery and the murder of the owner of the gem. And, all within the time of the journey, he examines several suspects on the train, masters a couple of violent encounters and nabs the guilty one. Obviously, Hitchcock's \\"The Lady Vanishes\\" inspired the author of the script, but that's not a bad inspiration. And the action has been handled well. Mr. Rathbone is silky smooth, as usual","excerpt":"Nigel Bruce plays Dr. Watson blimpishly, and a good cast of Universal actors are passengers aboard the train. THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1950","title":"After much travail, a labor that began in August, 1946, with the expenditure of much moneys and the required amount of tub-thumping, \\"Vendetta,\\" Howard Hughes' film version of \\"Colomba,\\" the French novel by Prosper Merimee, yesterday finally reached the screen of the Globe. In between that distant past and the present, Preston Sturges, who originally adapted and directed the work, disagreed on policy with the producer and the pair ended their association. Since then changes have been made and the credits now list Mel Ferrer as director, with W. R. Burnett and Peter O'Crotty as scenarist and adaptor, respectively.It would be comforting to report during this holiday season that all this effort has paid dividends. But the sad opinion from this corner is that \\"Vendetta\\" is a garrulous, slow and obvious period piece, weighed down by a profusion of exotic accents, undistinguished dialogue and unconvincing play acting. Mr. Hughes' troupe, however, has been set against a background of the wild, Corsican countryside, which does give the picture an atmosphere of suspenseful authenticity.This, however, is dissipated by lines as ancient as \\"they went thataway\\" and a yarn, which might have had impact in Merimee's day but is singularly static as unfolded on the Globe's screen. Beginning ominously with an off-screen narrator's voice intoning a definition of \\"Vendetta\\" to be \\"the obligation and duty to seek revenge,\\" the tale proceeds at dirge pace to disclose that the head of Della Rabbia clan is murdered by the Barracini family.Thereafter the comely Colomba Della Rabbia, seeking revenge in the face of a trumped-up legal vindication of the murderers, recalls her brother from France. That lad, a soldier with ten years of service behind him and a believer in due process of law, is finally won over to his vengeful sister's point of view over the entreaties of his newly-found love, a dignified English beauty. But the price of vengeance is high and though the murderers are shot down according to ancient Corsican custom, the lovely Colomba also dies a bloody death at the hands of her enemies.As the dark-haired and beauteous Colomba bent on removing the stain from the family escutcheon via the most direct means, Faith Domergue, the heralded newcomer, is less than a fiery heroine. But despite the flamboyant lines that are her lot, the attractive Miss Domergue does occasionally contribute genuine emotional acting to the proceedings. Donald Buka, as the well-born bandit who helps her, and George Dolenz, as the brother she loves to distraction, also are presented as newcomers, although both have appeared in films before. They, it must be noted, are trying valiantly continuously but their efforts are stiff and unreal.And, adequate is the word for Hillary Brooke, as the lady to whom the brother loses his heart","excerpt":"Nigel Bruce, as her father; Joseph Calleia, as the head of the murderous Barracini clan, and his two gun-toting sons, neither of whom are listed in the credits.

COACH Alfio Basile, a 50-year-old Argentine nicknamed Coco. Unlike a great number of Argentines past and present, he has done all his playing and coaching in his native country. He coached his first game for the national team on Feb. 19, 1992. STYLE Typically Latin, with short passes and plenty of lateral movement. TOP PLAYERS Diego Maradona, the man without a team, who is gradually getting into the shape necessary to meet the rigors of the tournament. Gabriel Batistuta, a striker who plays for Fiorentina, has the potential to be a high scorer in the tournament. Diego Simeone, a midfielder who plays fo Seville in Spain. Claudio Caniggia, who is returning after a year's ban for drug abuse, can also be a key to the attack. OUTLOOK The strength of Diego Maradona's legs will decide how far the team goes beyond the first round. No one argues with Basile that Argentina is in a fairly easy group in the opening round and its advancement is virtually assured. Unfavorable results in warmup matches should not be taken seriously. Playing two first-round games in the Boston area, where the temperature is not expected to be as hot, is also to Argentina's advantage besides the relatively weak opponents.

He took over as coach of the national team in the summer of 1990 and went without a defeat in his first six games. He is a man of few rounds and a master of tactics, as he proved in the elimination of France in the qualifying round. STYLE With most players competing for clubs in different countries, there is no concrete style. TOP PLAYERS Hristo Stoichkov, a forward with Barcelona and a fixture in the Spanish League for years, is the heart and soul of the team. Others to watch include Krasimir Balakov, a midfielder and the leading scorer for Sporting Lisbon, and Emil Kostadinov, a forward with Porto of Portugal who scored both goals on the final day of qualifying. Yordan Lechkov is Hamburg's rising star and the Bulgarians' key playmaker. Of the three goalkeepers, Borislav Mikhailov is considered the strongest. He had five shutouts in qualifying. The defensive unit is led by players from the home champion Levski Sofia -- Tsanko Tsvetanov, Emil Kremenliev, Zlatko Yankov and Petar Hubchev, who was sold recently by Levski to Hamburg SV. OUTLOOK They have trouble handling a skillful team that plays with speed. With Argentina and Nigeria, they have two of those types of teams in their group. What they have on their side is some experienced players and a coach who can make the right tactical move to win a game. A victory over Greece in their second game is a must if they are to advance. Greece CUP APPEARANCES This is the first. FIRST ROUND Argentina, June 21 in Foxboro, Mass.; Bulgaria, June 26 in Chicago; Nigeria, June 30 in Foxboro COACH Alketas (Alkis) Panagoulias, a 60-year-old Greek and a naturalized American citizen who has lived in the United States for 25 years. He originally came to the United States in 1962 to study for degrees in international relations and United Nations relations at the New York School for Social Studies. An accomplished player with Aris of Salonica, he is in his second stint as coach of the Greeks. He was the coach of the United States from 1983 to 1985. STYLE Direct up and down with little lateral movement and plenty of reliance on counterattacks. TOP PLAYERS Stelios Manolas, who is the captain of AEK in Athens, where he has played for 14 seasons, is the key to the defense. Tasos Mitropoulos of AEK, who at 36 is the Greeks' oldest player, is national team captain and the playmaker in midfield. He scored the tying goal, a header, against Russia in Moscow to give Greece its first-ever World Cup bid. Dimitris Saravakos of Panathinaikos is the most well-known forward. OUTLOOK Greece is the only nation in the tournament without a player competing for a club outside the country. The team has had some poor results in warm-up matches. Although Greece has the oldest team in the tournament in average age, lack of World Cup experience and mental toughness for the rigors of such a tournament is not on its side. What it does have on its side is strong fan support from the large Greek community and the fact the Greeks trained in the United States longer than any other team except Saudi Arabia. Nigeria CUP APPEARANCES This is the first. FIRST ROUND Bulgaria, June 21 in Dallas; Argentina, June 25 in Foxboro, Mass.; Greece, June 30 in Foxboro COACH In five years with the Super Eagles, Clemens Westerhof of the Netherlands has never lost an international match at home, and his coaching and organizational skills have unquestionably been a major factor in the team's rise. STYLE With their athleticism, strength and attacking bent, the Nigerians should be one of the most entertaining teams in the tournament. Their base 4-4-2 often becomes a 4-2-4 with four forwards: usually Emmanuel Amunike or Samson Siasia on the left wing, Rashidi Yekini and Daniel Amokachi in the center and George Finidi on the right wing. This works, in part, because Sunday Oliseh and others further back are capable of covering a lot of ground. The Super Eagles under Westerhof now rely less on the long ball and more on the short passing game, well-orchestrated by the playmaker Okocha. TOP PLAYERS Yekini is Nigeria's and Africa's star, a muscular striker with speed and power who has been the leading scorer in three different countries: Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Portugal. On defense, Westerhof has captain Stephen Keshi, Benedict Iroha and an imposing, experienced goalkeeper in Peter Rufai, who has competition in Wilfred Agbonavbare. OUTLOOK Westerhof says his team \\"will be the surprise of the World Cup,\\" but the truth is that Nigeria will not surprise any soccer buff by succeeding. The Eagles lost only one match in qualifying and have remarkable depth. The only question is defense, where the Nigerians suffered occasional lapses during the African Nation's Cup. If the Nigerians can play defense worthy of their offense, the quarterfinals just might not be the limit.

Their attempt to regain a civilian equilibrium is jolted by the sudden reappearance of General Tenius, an SS veteran with blackmail on his mind. Why the Kerenyis and their friends have reason to fear Tenius, Miss Gainham tells us in her own sweet time, reweaving along the way the texture of the era.

And without running down the vivid vistas you get from time to time of La Bardot, we must say the gorgeous Spanish scenery outmatches her, two for one.For the curious fact is the famous \\"kitten\\" is miserably used in this film, which went in France under the title of the novel by Albert Vidalie from which it is taken, \\"Les Bijoutiers du Clair de Lune.\\" All she does is act a sort of meek companion tagging along with a desperate young man who has murdered her uncle, seduced her aunt, evaded capture (with her assistance) and is now taking it on the lam.In this unlikely situation she hasn't much else to do than occasionally peel down to the bare essentials (under pretext of the oppressive heat) and chase foolishly after Stephen Boyd. This craggy young man, whose one expression suggests that he's just doing this for the Job, appears more intent on making mileage than on dallying with La Bardot. When Roger Vadim, the director, finally lines up the pair for a clinch, Mr. Boyd submits with such blandness that they'd just as well be back on the road.Under these circumstances, there isn't much zing in La Bardot. She takes her cue from the proceedings and not only acts but also looks immature. Half the time she's running barefoot, with her hair in matted strings. She also is called upon to take a fancy to a burro and a pig. Crossing the wires on her this way rather runs down the battery of La Bardot.However, the scenery is dramatic, even if the story is not, M. Vadim has made a harsh antagonist of the broken landscape of Malaga. A gleaming villa sprawled upon a hilltop looking toward the distant sea serves as the point of departure for journeys that take the characters to the primitive village of Mijas, its ancient bullring and to country beyond. The one valid thing about the picture is its scenery.Alida Valli and Pepe Nieto are the hapless aunt and uncle. The film, as shown at the Fine Arts, has dialogue in French and Spanish, with English subtitles to give the translation. At the Odeon, it has dubbed English dialogue.

In this eerie hermetic world, people are subjected to physical and emotional stress.

Each day the man working in the office, or his assistant, arranges objects on his window sill. The combinations and order of objects -- mostly office supplies and personal items and effects -- convey a message, like a semaphore, which viewers down on the plaza can interpret using a key-chart on the telescope. Changed a few times a day, sometimes more frequently, the arrangements indicate the subject's mood, productivity and overall workplace conditions. The day I took a peek, the objects included a calculator, a potted plant and a jar filled with binder clips, code for ''I am drifting.'' If you're lucky, you'll even get to see the office subject -- a middle-aged corporate lawyer whom the artist has asked to remain anonymous -- at his desk, on the telephone or interacting with colleagues.

Cronin's novel \\"Grand Canary,\\" declared:\\"The relationship between Dr. Leith and Lady Fielding is a delicate, original and moving contribution to modern literature.\\"As the story is dramatized at the Music Hall even the press representative must cross his fingers before setting out to defend the delicacy and novelty of the relationship between Warner Baxter and Madge Evans, and it is to be feared that the moving element must be in the direction of the exits. A rubber-stamp example of the film romance, it is lacking in any more potent motivation than the existence of that eternal mystic spark which has been igniting false and unconvincing celluloid passions since the invention of the \\"Came the Dawn\\" subtitle.\\"Grand Canary\\" does not deal, as the title might indicate, with the career of an opera soprano. It relates to the Canary Islands, the destination of Dr. Harvey Leith when he boards a tramp steamship at Liverpool. Dr. Leith, the scapegoat of a hospital scandal because he administered his serum to three charity patients who would have died anyway, plans to bury himself away in the tropics and enjoy a first-class bender. Instead, he engages in a taffrail romance with Lady Mary Fielding, who is to join her titled husband in the Canaries. Yellow fever is raging in the islands when the ship lands, and the doctor, suddenly recovering his interest in life, rushes into the heart of the fever area to lend his aid. Lady Fielding dashes after him, comes down with the fever, and is only saved from death by the doctor's newly discovered serum. Dr. Leith returns to England a hero and, on his arrival, is apprised by telegram that Lady Fielding has told her husband everything and is coming to join him.That is the story, and, despite the customary excellence of Warner Baxter, it has been dramatized with such an exterior and implausible style that it never really comes to life. The shipboard and island scenes are pictorially effective, but the film as a whole betrays faultiness in the arrangement of the script and a hazy, indecisive quality in the direction. Several sub-plots are submitted to a large amount of attention without ever attaching themselves successfully to the principal situation. The abortive romance between a young missionary and a hard-shelled Englishwoman promises to provide an interesting minor theme, but the picture drops it before it matures.The only genuine amusement in \\"Grand Canary,\\" in fact, is supplied by Marjorie Rambeau and Roger Imhof as a pair of rough-and-ready birds of passage, and, while there is an undeniable sum of good sense in their ultimate union, this too is managed pretty sketchily. As Lady Fielding, Madge Evans has pictorial allure without the necessary adjunct of acting talent. Carrie Daumery, as an eccentric marquesa who allows the doctor to use her mansion, is excellent, and her portrait of a confused and battered aristocrat bears a striking resemblance to the old marquesa of \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey.\\"The chief event on the Music Hall's great stage is a Leon Leonidoff revue, \\"The Five Senses,\\" which features the Rockettes.

That is a tall order for one television series, but the fact that it was made at all, and that it has been highly praised, says something about the ambitions of the company that devoted three years seeing it through, MacNeil/Lehrer Productions.   Behind ''The Story of English'' -part journalism, part creative rendering of ideals, part entrepreneurism - is the tale of Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer, the PBS news anchors, and the company they created to keep up, like a corporate Sancho Panza, with their diverse interests. It is a vehicle that has offered them journalistic and economic independence, as well as a means to further their aim of what they call ''quality television.'' At the same time, their venture, as the two acknowledge, has underscored the tensions inherent in trying to function both as journalists and businessmen.

These &#8220;fancy,&#8221; or &#8220;gay,&#8221; Dutch swell Lutheran and Reformed congregations from Allentown to York in southeastern Pennsylvania. The &#8220;plain&#8221; tenth, mostly Mennonites and Amish, cling to customs and patterns of dress that set them far apart from the mainstream. Because of this, the plain people, particularly the Old Order Amish, a total anachronism in 20th&#8208;century America, attract millions of visitors annually to this region of rich, rolling farmland without wanting to. Tourists find their lifestyle quaint and their accents charming. The Amish still live and dress and farm as they did centuries ago. Their ways are dictated by religious scruples against yielding to the conveniences and temptations of a modern world. They shun automobiles, tractors, electricity and bathrooms and live in accordance with a literal interpretation of the Bible, constantly looking to a future life not of this world. They wear prescribed beards, broad&#8208;brimmed black hats, prayer caps and plain buttonless clothes. Master farmers, they make their horse&#8208;andbuggy economy work as well in 1974 as it did when they first arrived in America 250 years ago, as a sect persecuted by both Protestants and Catholics in the Rhineland. The heart of the Pennsylvania Dutch country is Lancaster County, where the horse&#8208;drawn buggies owned by some 1,200 Old Order Amish families sometimes slow traffic to a snail's pace. Because vacationers flock here in such numbers in spring and yammer, clogging highways and back roads&#8217; alike, the late fall and the winter are in many respects better times to visit. The off&#8208;season also gives the Amish people a muchneeded respite from the hordes of summertime photographers. To the Amish, Pictures are graven images barred the Bible.

Don't look now, but we think \\"The Gay Desperado,\\" the new Pickford-Lasky film at the Music Hall, has solved the problem. It proceeds on the theory that it is not essential to have a chamois-lined vehicle for a songbird, that tenors will sing no matter where they are or what is done to them. It decides therefore to surround its tenor with comedians, press him into vigorous service and let an engaging musical comedy plot take its course. If he wants to sing, he must make his own opportunities. Meanwhile the horseplay's the thing.It works. It works quite well, in fact. Nino Martini, last encountered cinematically in a dullish item called \\"Here's to Romance,\\" now finds himself expected to be a comedian as well as a liquid-voiced specialist in \\"Celeste Aïda,\\" \\"Cielita Lindo,\\" \\"Estrellita\\" and a few other Mexican airs. Mr. Martini is a much better tenor than he is a comedian, but he does his best to enter into the picture's comic spirit. He permits himself to be crowned with an oversize sombrero, he trips over a serape, throws crockery at Ida Lupino and sheepishly faces a firing squad. What the Metropolitan Opera will think about it is more than we can say.It is, as you may have guessed, a rough and tumble business, with Mr. Martini as the singing caballero carried away by Leo Carrillo's bandit band to be their minstrel and troubadour. The Carrillo, operating somewhere south of the Rio Grande, has seen too many American gangster movies. He has learned the dire significance of the phrase \\"or else * * *,\\" and he has studied the Chicago specialists in the art of \\"snatch.\\" Having snatched Mr. Martini he next accomplishes the kidnapping of Miss Lupino and the wealthy young chap with whom she was eloping. It is there that Mr. Martini, the involuntary bandit, takes a romantic hand.It would be unfair to the picture to add much more detail, but we cannot resist mentioning the appearance of the American gangster crew—which includes comic doubles of George Raft, Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney—and its disillusioning effect upon the picturesque, music-loving desperadoes under Mr. Carrillo's command. These sequences are pure comedy and they have been played hilariously by Mr. Carrillo, Harold Huber, Mischa Auer and otheras. If the vocal Mr. Martini is forced into the background, it has been in the best of causes. Even an operatic tenor must be content with second place when a first-rate musical comedy is in the making. And \\"The Gay Desperado\\" is truly that.
