Fifi.As the French performer, born in Watertown, N. Y., but known to her public as an imported diseuse, she is decidedly unreal and hardly the star the director would have one believe her. But as little Betty Murphy, the girl who was plucked from the chorus to fill the place of the temperamental actress, Miss Moore is genuine and gives a feeling performance.That is the first half of the story, the rest is of her love for a race track tout whom she forces to seek a honest living. He does get a job through a man who is in love with Mlle. Fifi. There is a hold-up and the dishonest track follower is found guilty. He and the actress have already married. But she sends him away, hinting that she will quit her show, and is left alone.This last scene, in which the scion who has tried so hard to meet her is also sent away, then the dismissal of Jimmy, and finally, little Betty Murphy, alone in the midst of all her acquired finery, is quite telling. Miss Moore's voice here is nicely interpretive of her feelings. It is a most poignant bit, and a surprising enough ending for a film filled with scenes in color in which the characters appear as red as Indians, among other commonplaces usually found in pictures with, musical and stage backgrounds.The photoplay is filled with irrelevancies. Such, for example, as a song writer demonstrating a new ditty to the French performer simply for the sake of dragging in an extra musical number. And also many of the dancing scenes in which Miss Moore makes a sad mess of the terpsichorean bits.There is one song sequence, however, \\"If I Can't Have You,\\" in which Miss Moore does some good singing that is surely the best of the musically prismatic scenes. In her more serious moods Miss Moore is quite acceptable.

Morgenthau, for the Democratic nomination for Manhattan district attorney, began an advertising blitz this week with three 30-second commercials running on Time Warner Cable stations. The first of the ads, released on Monday, uses the television show ''Law & Order'' to try to make her point that Mr. Morgenthau has been in office too long (he was first elected in 1974).

A spokesman for her campaign, Eric Pugatch, would not say how much the ads cost","excerpt":"her most recent filing with the New York City Board of Elections includes a $625,000 payment to Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates, which is handling her television and direct mail advertising.    'Diversity and the D.A.,' Parts 1 and 2    PRODUCER -- Jason McNaboe    ON THE SCREEN -- Both new ads begin with the words, in white on black, ''Diversity and the D.A.'' The first shows Trevor C. Garel, identified as a former special assistant district attorney. The second ad shows A. Scott Bolden, identified as a former assistant district attorney. Each ad includes a headline dating from the early 90's about allegations of hiring bias. Both ads show a photo of Mr. Morgenthau with the numbers ''117 Senior Attorneys, 4 African American, 5 Hispanic.'' The first ad concludes with the words, ''30 Years. Nothing's Changed.'' The second ends with, ''30 Years Is Enough. We Can Do Better.'' Ms. Snyder does not appear in either ad.    THE SCRIPT -- In the first ad, Mr. Garel recites his qualifications -- 17 years in the Police Department, ''the first cop to graduate from Yale Law School.'' In Mr. Morgenthau's office, he says, ''People of color rarely got promotions and they certainly didn't get jobs with real responsibility.'' He cites the same statistics that appear on screen.Mr. Bolden makes similar comments in the second ad, concluding, ''We can do better. We must.''    ACCURACY -- Mr. Morgenthau's office said Ms. Snyder's statistics were wrong. Barbara Thompson, his spokeswoman, said there were 12 minority members among the 86 senior members of the legal staff, or 14 percent, about double the percentage of Manhattan lawyers who are members of minority groups. Ms. Snyder's campaign said the ad number came from Mr. Morgenthau's office's data. Black leaders raised this issue in the 90's.    SCORECARD -- The ads are as startling as a punch to the jaw, and the two men who appear in them are convincing. Ms. Snyder is likely to be criticized for ''playing the race card,'' but may attract support not only in minority communities but also among Manhattan's traditionally liberal white voters.    'Law and Order'    PRODUCER -- Jason McNaboe    ON THE SCREEN -- White letters appear on a black background, reading ''The Manhattan D.A. Election and the TV Show 'Law & Order''' The next words are, ''Life Is Stranger Than Fiction.'' Ms. Snyder speaks directly to the camera; the ad also shows her in several settings, including on the bench.    THE SCRIPT -- ''Even on 'Law & Order,''' Ms. Snyder says, ''the Manhattan district attorney changed 3 times in 17 years. In real life, the Manhattan district attorney has been there over 30 years. It's time for a change.'' She concludes, ''I want to be the district attorney for the 21st century.''    ACCURACY -- Not surprising, Ms. Snyder has her 'Law & Order' facts straight; she is a legal consultant to the television show. Mr. Morgenthau has, indeed, been D.A. for more than three decades. The ad accurately describes Ms. Snyder's career, and her endorsement by some law enforcement unions.    SCORECARD -- Ms. Snyder, 63, looks young and vigorous in her ad; viewers who know what Mr. Morgenthau looks like at age 86 may note the contrast. But it is unclear how voters will respond to the ''It's time for a change'' message, absent any specifics.

When we read Barbra Streisand's life story, that question seems more to the point than the usual quest for celebrity  dirt: affairs, drugs, her son's sexual orientation. Is she an egotist out of control or a strong, talented perfectionist in a sexist age? In STREISAND: Her Life (Crown, $25), James Spada doesn't really answer the question, but he provides detailed testimony, pro and con, and lets the reader decide. Stephen Sondheim loved her when they worked together on her \\"Broadway Album,\\" as did Pat Conroy when she filmed his novel \\"The Prince of Tides.\\" Anne Francis hated her when they appeared in the movie \\"Funny Girl,\\" more than two decades earlier. (\\"She said: 'Don't touch me. I've been told that a star is never touched in a scene like this.' \\") Walter Matthau, her co-star in \\"Hello, Dolly!,\\" said he was \\"appalled by every move she made.\\" Mr. Spada, who has written biographies of other actresses, including Grace Kelly and Bette Davis, manages to make Ms. Streisand's largely loveless childhood and early career struggles the most fascinating parts of her story. Young Barbra carried a cot from one friend's apartment to another's because she had no place to sleep, happily accepted free  dinners instead of pay and seemed amazed that people liked her voice (\\"I don't think I'm that good,\\" she told a roommate in 1960). However, by page 79, at the  age of 19, she's already difficult to get along with. The book ends on a frankly adoring note, but until then the story of the public's discovery of a genius and the genius's discovery of herself is actually thought-provoking.

The second choice is probably the more helpful of the two. Whenever this is Mr. Matthau's movie — and that's quite a lot of the time — it's reasonably funny and appealing. Mr. Matthau is up to his same old tricks, and those tricks have become happily familiar by now. He, and the movie's accomplished supporting cast, create the impression of considerable polish. If \\"Little Miss Marker\\" were a lot more witty, and a bit less overdecorated, it might recall the good-time-Charlie spirit of \\"The Sting.\\"But \\"Little Miss Marker,\\" which opens today at the Criterion Center and other theaters, also depends on Mr. Runyon's material — more than it can afford to, because the story is a sentimental tale and the movie, being contemporary, is relatively cool. The child of the title is a wonderful 6-year-old, left as collateral at a gambling establishment and eventually adopted by the head of the operation, Sorrowful Jones. As his name suggests. Sorrowful is a man who lives without love, but the child soon remedies that. The child also befriends Amanda, a beautiful widow, who soon befriends Sorrowful, with One Big Happy Family as everyone's eventual goal.Among the demands of this story is that the child be adorable, and that Mr. Matthau beam and cry. Sara Stinson, in the role that was originally Shirley Temple's, doesn't do much more than look sweet, and without Miss Temple at its heart, the story doesn't entirely make sense. As for Mr. Matthau, he's better at being gruff than at being fond. And the movie's one tearful scene is quite beyond him — especially because the director, Walter Bernstein, shoots it at a noticeably awkward angle that just makes the scene clumsier.Mr. Bernstein, the well-known screenwriter making his directorial debut, successfully incorporates some of Mr. Runyon's funniest lines into the story. And the movie has a number of winning gags, such as a rigged horse race in which the would-be victor is so slow the other jockeys have to work overtime to lose. There's also a laugh involving two dogs, and another, at the movie's beginning, when Mr. Matthau is heard giving one of his debtors the meanest dressing-down you ever heard. The door to his office opens, and out walks a tearful old lady.But the film is expensively listless much of the time, and Mr. Bernstein falters noticeably with the movie's visual style: it's much too lavish, except perhaps for students of Depression-era props. And at times the shadowy camerawork becomes more attention-getting than the story. Bob Newhart, drolly servile as Mr. Matthau's assistant, gets into a fight with Tony Curtis, who plays a foppish gangster, and Mr. Curtis crushes Mr. Newhart's hat, presumably bending it into a funny shape. But the hat is black and the wall behind Mr. Newhart is dark brown, so the hat becomes so hard to see that the joke is lost. At the end of the film, Mr. Matthau and Mr. Curtis get into another fight, this one out-doors. Their eyes are so consistently hidden in shadow that it becomes difficult to remember who's winning.Julie Andrews, elegantly costumed by Ruth Morley, looks lovely as the socialite that Mr. Curtis and Mr. Matthau and Miss Stimson all adore","excerpt":"her natural hauteur is somehow softened by the role. Also in the cast is Brian Dennehy, as a strong-arm aide of Mr. Curtis's, assigned to keep Mr. Matthau in line. One of the less welcome innovations in the story is the suggestion, expressed by Mr. Dennehy and Mr. Newhart, that there's something risque about Mr. Matthau's letting a 6-year-old girl sleep in his bed. \\"Little Miss Marker\\" isn't modern in any other way, and it doesn't need to be modern about that.\\"Little Miss Marker\\" is rated PG (\\"Parental Guidance Suggested\\"). It contains a few mild epithets.

After graduating from Hunter College, she moved into an apartment on East 37th Street with several girlfriends. Bette became a successful and well-paid executive assistant in Lennen and Knewell, but did not feel her worklife was satisfying. So, during Mayor John Lindsay's administration, when she read in the newspaper that the city needed teachers, she applied for a job and became a kindergarten teacher in the South Bronx for many years. Bette eventually moved to Tudor City, where she lived for more than three decades. There she met and in 1974, married John F. McKean, a retiree and leader in the tenants movement. During the 1980s, John and Bette led the successful fight to prevent Harry Helmsley from erecting high-rises on the Tudor City parks including one famous episode where they went out with bullhorns at 7 A.M. to rouse their neighbors and stop the bulldozers.

The camera pans the crowd and then freezes on the strikingly beautiful young woman waiting for the ship that will carry her to safety in New York. She has barely escaped the Nazi invasion of France and has spent the last three months in Spain hoping for the arrival of a ship bound for America. The young woman is Sonja Benjaminsson Zorrilla. Her biography is being written, and the movie about the fairytale life she led could still be filmed. Sonja, who died on March 22, 2002, was the daughter of Olafur Benjaminsson and Marie Wendel Benjaminsson. She spent most of her childhood in Reykjavik until polio struck, and the teenager was sent to Denmark for therapy and to attend cooking school. Sonja never did learn to cook, but she substantially regained her strength through great persistence, effort, and will. Her strong independent nature and her great sense of adventure soon took her off to conquer the world. She went to Wiesbaden, Germany where relatives could look after her while she attended art school. But the Nazis were coming to power, and Sonja soon moved to London where she continued her studies in art and also began flying lessons. One day, much to her chagrin, her flight instructor sent her skyward alone. Everthing went well until it was time to land and, as she pruned a few trees on the way down, she decided to end her flying career. While in London, she met a young man from the Russian royal family and, when she moved to Paris one year later, she already knew many of the people in the royal family enclave there. Sonja tried her hand at fashion design and was also offered modeling jobs, although modeling at that time was not considered proper for an upstanding young woman. Later on, however, her hands did appear on the cover of ''Vogue'' magazine. Sonja's beauty and charm continued to attract the attention of men and women alike. Rose Kennedy became a friend in Paris, and Aristotle Onassis was extremely interested in the young beauty. She refused his marriage proposal, believing the relationship would never last, but they remained friends throughout his life. As the Nazis began their invasion of France, Sonja fled to Spain and finally boarded a ship bound for New York. The trip was harrowing through submarine infested waters and, upon sight of the Statue of Liberty, Sonja knew she had found her new home. Aristotle Onassis introduced her to a very suave and handsome Argentine named Alberto Zorrilla. Alberto was an Olympic swimming gold medalist and had become a national hero in Argentina. He was also purported to be the best tango dancer in New York City. The striking couple was married and enjoyed a long-term union until Alberto's death. Serendipitous meetings continued throughout Sonja's lifetime, adding John Loeb, Sonja Henie, Richard Rodgers, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, among many others, to her long list of friends. She continued to paint, mostly portraits, and also wrote columns for the Icelandic newspaper. Sonja leaves her brother-inlaw, Grosvenor Murray, husband of her sister, Asta, who died last August","excerpt":"her niece, Margaret Murray Roberts, husband Laurence, and their daughters Daria Roberts Helmer and Sonja Roberts; her nephew, Thomas Olaf Murray, wife Elizabeth, and their daughters Kristina Murray, Patricia Nordwall, and Carolyn Murray. Sonja also leaves many cousins including her special friends Gudmundur Biergisson and Maria Wendel. Sonja will be remembered as a great woman with a big heart, stunningly beautiful, bright, talented, and charismatic.

In 1944 she was the first woman officer in the Army Judge Advocate's Generals Corps. The JAG cited her for this in April 1999 at a banquet at its school in Charlottesville, VA at which she was guest of honor. Later that year, the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession awarded her its Trailblazer certificate. She was born in Laurel, IA on the farm of her father, Henry J. Propp and his second wife Martha Knoble Propp. She grew up in nearby Marshalltown where she graduated from its high school. She graduated in 1930 from the University of Iowa and received her J.D. from its law college in 1933. After practicing in Mason City, she entered the Federal civil service in the regional office of the Farm Credit Admistration in Omaha, and later at the Federal Land Bank. Active in democratic politics, Miss Propp also served on the board of the Omaha Urban League. When Congress established what became the Women's Army Corps in May 1942, she was an original volunteer. She was commissioned after completing its OTC course at Fort Des Moines to which she returned early in 1944 as a captain and Post Judge Advocate and was formally detailed in the JAG in May 1944. In January 1945 she was assigned to the JAG office at General Dwight D. Eisenhower's European Command in Paris. Shortly after the German surrender, she was promoted to major and moved with the headquarters to Frankfurt, Germany and later to Heidelberg. In 1947 she left active duty as a lieutenant-colonel but continued the same work heading the civil affairs section as a civilian. She resigned from this post in the summer of 1951. In November she was married to Farnsworth Fowle, then a New York Times correspondent in Germany. After a year in London, they returned to the United States and settled in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.

By Sawako Ariyoshi. Translated by Mildred Tahara. (Kodansha, $14.95.)   ''Akiko placed a pan of water over the gas flame. . . . She put the shelled clams and frozen fish into the freezer, along with the packages of frozen waffles and pizza. . . . Some women frowned upon frozen foods and complained that they lacked taste. But for a working wife, speed and nutritional value came before taste.'' This novelistic world, made up of the realism of the kitchen and the work place, is the creation of 53-year-old Sawako Ariyoshi, one of Japan's leading female fiction writers. It's a far cry from the sword-brandishing of conscience- stricken samurai. While the Endos and Kawabatas and Mishimas and their successors appear to make up tales out of a concern for taste as much as speed, Miss Ariyoshi has turned her talents to creating issue-oriented fiction that has brought her millions of readers and great acclaim. ''The Twilight Years,'' originally published in Japan in 1972, focuses on the difficulties of caring for the aged in an urban culture where hearth and home care have been replaced by microwave ovens and state-operated centers for the elderly. Its heroine is Akiko Tachibana, whose mother-in-law dies suddenly, leaving an aging father-in-law in a state of mental confusion and physical decay. Akiko's struggle to keep her job and hold the family together while dealing with the senile and incontinent old man forms the central action","excerpt":"her own husband's growing concern for his impending twilight years adds a touching subtheme.

Born in Decatur, Georgia, Dr. Rives received her medical degree at Medical College of Georgia. She trained in psychiatry at Temple University and served as Chief Resident. Most recently, she was an attending physician and assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Medical Center. She won recognition for excellence in teaching, supervision, and academic scholarship.

Those who were fortunate enough to seek her counsel lose an invaluable teacher. Those who had the privilege of receiving her affection lose an irreplaceable friend.

The role requires a reserve of power that Ms. Tomowa-Sintow no longer seems to have available. She barely got to the end of \\"Vissi d'arte,\\" producing a weak and colorless tone. Her acting, uneventful most of the evening, became distractingly peculiar at the end: she shrieked in horror a moment before, rather than after, shaking Cavaradossi's body, then ran up the stairs to the parapet well before her pursuers appeared on stage. If Tosca had such psychic powers, she would not have got herself into this whole mess.   The other singers did better. James Morris produced a powerful and slyly nuanced Scarpia, managing to hold his own amid the mayhem of Franco Zeffirelli's first-act staging. The all-important words \\"Va, Tosca\\" were not spat out as usual but enunciated with dandyish precision. The opera works better if Scarpia is something more than a brutal madman.

She served as director of student affairs, editor of the first alumni directory and a founder of both the alumni and student government associations. Her dedication to public health and her love of teaching were extraordinary. A pioneering epidemiologist for over 60 years, Professor Gelman was teacher, mentor and friend to countless students, and her devotion to the School was unparalleled. Her contributions to the School include the establishment of the Gelman Professorship in the Department of Epidemiology in honor of her late husband. She also established the Gelman Laboratory Suite for Infectious Disease Research in the Jerome L. and Dawn Greene Infectious Disease Laboratory. She was a remarkable woman and we are the less for her passing. A memorial service will be held this spring on the Columbia University Medical Center campus.

The Holocaust -- the Third Reich's genocidal policies that began more than a half-century ago -- is in the forefront of concern for human life again. Declarations of ethnic cleansing in what was Yugoslavia, warfare in the Persian Gulf and tribal killings in Africa and who knows where else are being compared to the Holocaust, which caused the deaths of millions of Jews, political prisoners, gypsies, homosexuals and various others during World War II. When civilians anywhere are being beaten, starved or bombed, it's hard to deny them the right to borrow the word Holocaust, with its record of concentration camps and gas chambers, even though the German death machine was far more systematic and slaughtered larger numbers of innocents than are killed in today's atrocities.   In fact and fiction, the story of the Holocaust continues to be told. \\"The Journey,\\" by Ida Fink, is one such unusual novel, singular in its details, yet universal in its memories. Although intended as fiction, \\"The Journey\\" reads like fact","excerpt":"her previous book, \\"A Scrap of Time,\\" was a short-story collection.

Walking beneath plastic faux cathedral ceilings, drowned in lighting as bright as a flashbulb pop, she leaves at bay, for a few hours, her career as a country singer-songwriter and becomes just another neurotic shopper looking for a bargain. \\"There's something oddly therapeutic about it,\\" she says. \\"When you've had a hard week, and you want to be by yourself but you want some outside stimulation or surrealness, take yourself to the mall. You can fog out and just look in the windows.\\"    On a Friday afternoon after a band rehearsal for a tour that starts in a few days, Carpenter drives her Toyota Land Cruiser to the Tysons Corner mall in the suburbs of Washington, not far from her home in Old Town Alexandria, Va. Right now Carpenter is one of the top-selling stars in country music.

This is Dunant's second book to make the Times list","excerpt":"her previous novel, ''The Birth of Venus,'' had a nine-week run in 2004. Dunant, who was born in 1950, is much more familiar in her native England, where she's presented programs on BBC radio and television and is a well-regarded cultural critic. Earlier in her literary career she was known for a series of thrillers that featured a ''feminist private eye'' -- one critic's term -- named Hannah Wolfe. (Hannah was good company: ''The baddies are never quite the ones you want them to be,'' she cracked in one novel.) These thrillers usually tackled thorny topics like animal rights and surrogate motherhood. Critics have tended to approve of Dunant's move into historical fiction, a tough genre to master. (''There are no paeans to the watery beauty of Venice,'' Laura Miller wrote about Dunant's new book in Salon. ''Dunant doesn't make a fetish out of romantic love either. . . . 'Courtesan' finally emerges as something very rare, a celebration of the complicated and undersung affections that flourish between colleagues and friends.'') Last year Dunant told an interviewer: ''The skills I learned from thrillers -- how to construct a compelling story, how to hold the reader, how to play with them, how to not let you want to put the book down -- all these have not deserted me. They have, I hope, simply been used on a bigger canvas.''

Their music could be as psychedelic as anything produced in the United States. With Brazil under a military dictatorship, avant-rockers there produced music that challenged the establishment less by blunt protest than through double-entendres and sheer bewilderment.    Os Mutantes, which started in São Paulo in 1966, when its members were teenagers, backed up and collaborated with songwriters like Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. When the band showed up at a pop-song contest with electric guitars, it was booed. Its own songs mingled Brazil's carnival music and bossa nova with fuzz-toned garage rock, honky-tonk piano and orchestral chamber-pop, juxtaposing finesse and disruption. Meanwhile, the lyrics layered irony upon irony. It's no wonder that the band, which dissolved in 1978, has drawn latter-day fans like Beck and David Byrne. ''The idea was to destroy all formulas,'' the guitarist Sérgio Dias Baptista once explained.    Os Mutantes never performed in the United States. Mr. Baptista has now reunited three-fifths of the band: his brother Arnaldo on keyboards and the drummer Ronaldo Leme.

ONE FOOT ON BROADWAY, THE OTHER IN HOLLYWOOD"},{"year":"1950","title":"Although its hearts and flowers atmosphere may be too pronounced for some tastes, \\"Madness of the Heart\\" relates with sympathy and feeling a poignant story of a sightless young bride's struggle against the subtle machinations of a designing rival. This new British-made drama, which opened yesterday at the Park Avenue Theatre, serves up pathos liberally but with sufficient tact that the picture does not get caught in the quagmire of meretricious sentiment. However, the artful restraint evidenced in the writing and direction by Charles Bennett throughout most of the film's ninety-one minutes is completely and jarringly absent in a mendacious, melodramatic climax.Margaret Lockwood has her best role in a long while as an English working girl who loses her sight as she is about to be married to a French nobleman, spends a meditative period in a convent and then is persuaded by her fiancé to go through with their wedding. Miss Lockwood manages the difficult illusion of affecting blindness with conviction because her actions manifest an appreciation of extra-sensory perception. In familiar surroundings there is confidence in her movements and a natural awareness of objects that seems to belie her affliction, while in unfamiliar territory her uncertainty is suggested more than it is projected. That is good acting, indeed.Beneath the veil of upper-class social niceties which cloak \\"Madness of the Heart,\\" the author of the film (working from a novel by Flora Sandstrom with which the reviewer is unacquainted) brings into play a full measure of hypocrisy and cruel cunning. The love that binds Lydia and Paul de Vandiere is slowly changed from a thing of beauty to a corrosive burden by the wily deceits of the Comte de Vandiere, who bitterly resents Lydia's imperfection, and Verite Faimont, who had hopes of making Paul her husband.A magnificent chateau in the south of France serves as the background for most of the drama. Casual, but pointed, remarks about Lydia's condition","excerpt":"her responsibilities toward Paul and slight movement by Verite of a glass carefully placed by Lydia acquire sinister proportions. These and other deceits in a carefully laid campaign to undermine Lydia's confidence and make Paul conscious of the peculiar burdens of his marriage are punctuated by at least two bold attempts by Verite on Lydia's life. This is material which might easily have alienated an audience, but for the most part Mr. Bennett and his performers tell the story in credible terms.There is both sparkle and fierce determination to Miss Lockwood's acting and there is warmth and tenderness in Paul Dupuis' performance as the husband. Kathleen Byron is artful as the plotting rival; Raymond Lovell is competent as the Comte who comes to regret his behavior, and Maxwell Reed, Thora Hird, Maurice Denham and David Hutcheson also contribute helpful performances. \\"Madness of the Heart\\" probably won't stand any chance with the hepcats, but it should satisfy anyone with an open mind about old-fashioned romance lushly embroid-ered with sentiment. The chance did us good, in any event.

She is dark-eyed and serene, full of youthful gravitas, staring from the far wall in a one-room gem of an exhibition about the 15th-century master ANTONELLO DA MESSINA. The first true European painter, Antonello, a Sicilian, mixed traces of Netherlandish, Venetian, Provençal and Tuscan art to devise a sublime cross between Jan van Eyck and Piero della Francesca. His ''Virgin Annunciate,'' on loan at the Met from Palermo, was at one time thought to be by Dürer. The curators, Keith Christiansen and Andrea Bayer, do not exaggerate when comparing it to the Mona Lisa.    An incipient smile haunts the Virgin's expression. She conveys a kind of sexualized gravitas. Perhaps 13 or 14, uncannily self-possessed, from beneath a heavy blue veil and behind a lectern with an open prayer book on it, she calmly receives the news from the archangel Gabriel that she will bear the savior of the world. We stand more or less where Gabriel would be. So the Virgin gazes down and slightly past us, rapt in thought. Her left hand pinches the veil to her chest","excerpt":"her right hand juts forward, sharply foreshortened. The veil makes of her shape a stark A, balanced by the upward V of its folds, enclosing her face, which is handsome but not quite beautiful. Never mind that her body couldn't really fit that shape and her hands emerge as if from nowhere. The effect, nearly abstract, is so persuasive that questioning it is pedantic.    Among other paintings by Antonello, a full-lipped, round-faced Jesus crowned with thorns can break your heart. And a man with a 5 o'clock shadow, smiling at us, looks earthy and real.

In 1985, I joined the city agency responsible for foster care. As the crack epidemic spread, hundreds of women addicted to crack gave birth to babies, who then needed foster homes. Many infants also tested positive for H.I.V. It was my job to help find foster mothers for these children.    I have thought often about one child. Like the other children, she lived in a hospital, but she was not a newborn. She was 9. Her mother was an addict","excerpt":"her siblings were elsewhere in foster care. Somehow she had been admitted to a hospital on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Like Eloise of Plaza Hotel fame, she lived in a suite, was surrounded by adults and ordered room service. Like Eloise, she was precocious, everyone's pet and also a bit of a troublemaker. When I met her, she had been living in the hospital for more than a year.    Unfortunately, not only was she H.I.V.-positive, but once in a fit of anger she bit someone. That bite marked her forever. No one would take her in. I thought seriously about applying to become her foster mother. I was 24 and applied to graduate school instead and never found out what happened to her. Unlike the children in your story, a 9-year-old who was H.I.V.-positive in 1985 is unlikely to be alive today. Thank you for reminding us how far we have come.

Abbie did not allow her illness to crimp her style or dampen her enthusiasm. She applied the best in herself as physician, educator and human being to help bring out the best in those around her.

A Cambridge chef and writer, died Tuesday, June 13, of complications from Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), a rare neurologicaldisease. Born in New Orleans, she graduated from the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania and entered Radcliffe College at 16, graduating in 1954 with honors. As a young wife and mother in Massachusetts she taught second grade at Buckingham School in Cambridge, started a catering business in Chestnut Hill, drove a taxi and eventually became a chef at the Peasant Stock restaurant in Somerville, where she worked for 14 years, winning many culinary awards without ever following a recipe. She would rather cook for forty than for four, and always welcomed surprise dinner guests. She experimented with all foods and enjoyed everything (except lasagna) gnawable bones, sweet breads, okra, jambalaya, salad with poached eggs with Tabasco on all. She wrote poetry and short stories, hosted Shakespeare readings, studied Italian, Chinese and James Joyce, spent many summers at the Sewanee Writing Program in Tennessee and participated in various writing groups, including most recently her Food Writing Group. Upon retirement, she became a freelance grandmother, traveling in her Marimekko dresses to the homes of each of her eighteen newborn grandchildren as they appeared, where, according to one grandchild, she made ''the best bacon.'' She loved going to the movies with grandchildren, friends or even alone. She loved Bach, the Mendelssohn Octet, James Taylor, the Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle and family games of Scrabble. She was known for her funky clothes, her original turn of phrase, her amiable kookiness and her great heart.

But at least one young coed - Blair Ellen Morgan - is intent on escaping the cookie cutter. In search of a secular ''calling,'' Blair Ellen comes under the influence of Dan Rivers, the chaplain's charismatic young assistant. Dan becomes Blair's first lover, and she joins him when he hooks up with a Vista team in Norfolk's black slum. Blair's earnestness and youthful enthusiasm soon distinguish her as the real leader among the Vista volunteers, even more so when Dan is called back to West Virginia. Blair helps pull the black community together, developing a food cooperative that is highly successful but that soon comes under fire from the local business community. In another, more personal struggle, Blair finds herself torn between her fondness for New York Jewish liberal Shelley, and Shelley's charming black lover Spencer. When she painfully learns that she is not the only woman in Dan's life, Blair is forced to grow beyond him","excerpt":"her subsequent actions lead to disturbances within the Vista corps. As straightforward and unaffected as its West Virginia heroine, ''Only Great Changes'' is a worthwhile and realistic portrait of a significant social program.

In BERTHE MORISOT'S IMAGES OF WOMEN (Harvard University, $45), Anne Higonnet declares that \\"Morisot became a painter despite being a woman,\\" then argues that the painter's association with the Impressionist movement was an extraordinary feat. However, this thoroughly researched study shows that such was not the case. Morisot (1841-95) profited from her upper-middle-class origins -- for example, she studied painting under Corot with the support of her mother. Her marriage in 1874 to Eugene Manet, the brother of the painter Edouard, made her socially and professionally a member of Impressionist circles. Little wonder that Morisot showed her work in all but one of the Impressionist exhibitions. Ms. Higonnet, who teaches art history at Wellesley College, devotes very little space to Morisot's style or technique, instead focusing on the sociopolitical forces that shaped her paintings. Even though the 1894 painting \\"Julie Dreaming\\" boldly depicts a sensual, languid adolescent, Ms. Higonnet writes, overall Morisot's work \\"reflected a middle-class ideology of domestic femininity.\\" This observation seems fair, even though Ms. Higonnet then argues that Morisot wished to be freed \\"from the cultural constraints of gender.\\" The author's unstable definition of the painter's relationship to her sex, and of the place of the female artist in 19th-century France, is disappointing and ultimately irritating.

But she has already agreed to accompany the grandee of the island to the fiesta and the sailor waxes furious.

In ''Nine Women,'' her latest collection of stories and her first book in eight years, Miss Grau moves beyond the more insistent regionalism of her previous work to delineate the lives of nine very different women living in widely disparate worlds - tony, blue-blooded summer resorts, ingrown Roman Catholic communities, poor black neighborhoods and isolated bayou towns.

In 2003, Quinnipiac College awarded Martha an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters. In lieu of flowers, please send a contribution in her name for the use of the Oncology Department of Yale-New Haven Hospital. Burial will be private. A memorial service will be held on Wednesday, September 1, at 1 PM at the First Congregational Church, Broad and Church Streets, Guilford, CT.

I have found that the search for a decent cup of coffee in Japan is only slightly less exhausting than the search for the Holy Grail. A common technique among Japanese coffee enthusiasts is to select coffee beans with great care, roast them painstakingly in the shop, brew the coffee fastidiously, and then boil it beyond recognition. I have not, though, visited any of the shops highlighted in Ms. Stinchecum's article; perhaps there is hope yet. JONATHAN WEINBERG Ann Arbor, Mich.   Amanda Mayer Stinchecum responds:    Professor Weinberg's unfortunate experiences do not coincide with mine. One clue to finding good coffee is to look for shops that call themselves \\"coffee specialty shops\\" or for coffee shops that serve a number of different types of beans and blends; many shops that sell beans also serve a carefully brewed cup of coffee.

But the frenzied, largely incredible kung fu action fare he popularized is still being churned out in familiar style by the Orient's busy moviemakers. However, \\"Touch of Zen,\\" the Taiwanese feature on view this afternoon and tomorrow night at the New York Film Festival, is proof that familiarity can also breed a touch of annoyance with a standard approach to the genre.Its unfamiliar writer-director, King Hu, has not ignored traditional mayhem here, but he has demonstrated that pictorial artistry, Zen mysticism and the stylized martial arts, can make a fascinating mix.There is more than a touch of Zen and mystery in this period piece, despite its English subtitles. Program notes are necessary in fixing the time and locale as 14th-century China. But it is slowly made evident that a murderous warlord is out to eliminate a fugitive young lady loyal to the Ming Emperor, whose father he has aready dispatched","excerpt":"her two trusted aides and her country-bumpkin lover.Our renegade brunette beauty, it should be stressed, is no demure flower arranger. She is, it turns out, a prize pupil and acolyte of Zen Buddhist monks, who are as adept at weaponless, defensive kung fu as they are devoted to pacifism. As befits a grand myth, she and her equally expert cohort eventually eliminate those blood-thirsty pursuers in a succession of clanging swordplays and hand-to-hand clashes.As a Renaissance man also credited with the film's art direction and costumes, King Hu, who reportedly spent several years on this king-sized (three-hour) project, is obviously as dedicated to visual beauty and meditative Zen concepts as he is to action. And his views of gloomy bamboo forests, sun-dappled, green or rocky mountain crevasses and rushing rivers and waterfalls make truly spectacular backgrounds to both the peaceful and warring moods of the monks and the combatants.The confrontations between our heroine and her monks and the glaring villains are, of course, ludicrous and impossible. But King Hu and his cinematographer, Hua Hui-Ying, have staged all the prodigious leaps, the sparring and sword swinging with eye-catching, balletic effect.Aside from the almost mandatory posturing called for in these bouts, the performances are naturalistic, if flamboyant on occasion. As the saffron-robed monk-abbot, Roy Chiao Hung is a monolithic figure who not only is impressive as an imperturbable, unbeatable karate-chopper but also is fairly convincing as a contemplative type. Hsu Feng is animated and appealing as the harried lady sword swinger who sadly forsakes her lover and baby and chooses peace and sanctuary in his monastery.

In self-conscious response to this loss of the heroic, the English historian C. V. Wedgwood offers MONTROSE (St. Martin's, $35), a biography of the Marquess of Montrose, a 17th-century Scottish aristocrat chosen by King Charles I of England to quell a rebellion in Scotland. The author claims that Montrose qualifies as a true hero, one who still exhibits the luster of Achilles, Lancelot and Roland even after his story is told in simple prose. And she is persuasive","excerpt":"her writing ably captures Montrose's unflagging resolve in the face of battles, intrigue and execution. Each speech Montrose delivers to rally his outnumbered troops, each march he leads across the desolate highlands, becomes a fascinating illustration of his skill and spirit. His actions allow his biographer to catalogue a full store of chivalric traits. C. Veronica Wedgwood, whose books include \\"The Thirty Years' War,\\" \\"Oliver Cromwell\\" and \\"The Trial of Charles I,\\" tells her story dramatically: \\"Messengers came gloomily home to their chief. It was a raw March day and they saw the sun rise, a dark and angry red, the color of blood fresh spilt in a silver dish, they thought, and shook their heads at the omen.\\" This style, combined with bleak photographs of crumbling castles and portraits of brooding men, creates an atmosphere of Manichaean struggle, of clashing absolutes in which Montrose carries the banner of the noble and the decent. One suspects, though, that the situation is more complicated, and the turbid political and religious currents of this struggle do not make her classifications of hero and villain easy to maintain. Even so, it is difficult to remain aloof to the tragedy that descends on this charismatic figure, and one finds oneself rooting for him almost as strongly as C. V. Wedgwood does. DOUGLAS A.

TRANSFERS IN THE BRONX"},{"year":"1949","title":"The British producers of \\"The Girl in the Painting\\" missed a first-class opportunity to come up with an adult counterpart to \\"The Search.\\" The margin of error was not too great either, for the new picture at the Little Carnegie stems from an intriguing idea, and there are several very effective sequences in the drama, plus a fine performance by the Swedish actress, Mai Zetterling. Indeed, if the whole of \\"The Girl in the Painting\\" were as good as its parts, the posting of this notice would be a much more pleasant task.Too much, rather than too little, story and plodding direction are the principal faults. In writing about a British army officer's search among displaced persons camps in Germany for a girl who posed for a painting hanging in a London gallery, the authors give so much attention to setting each little detail in its proper place that the story loses its vitality. Sharp direction might have overcome this to an extent, but there still would be considerable diffuseness.Major Lawrence's curiosity is aroused when an elderly man standing next to him in the London gallery suddenly exclaims in guttural English that the face in the picture called Hildegard is his long-lost daughter Lydia. There is a hint of romantic fascination in the interest of Lawrence, who has just been jilted, but he undertakes the search in efficient army fashion, and upon locating the girl is confounded to find that her parents are with her. An obvious fear the girl has for her father and her apparent determination to remember only certain things about her early life arouses Lawrence's suspicions and leads to some interesting revelations best left unmentioned here.Things which might well have been suggested pictorially are developed at too great narrative length and the chances are you will guess the outcome of it all long before the authors are willing to let their secret out. This is too bad, for the atmosphere of the displaced persons camps gives a solid core of reality to the story that is not used to its full advantage.Miss Zetterling, who has an appealing as well as an expressive face, gives a convincing portrayal of the confused girl, and it is when she is off the screen that \\"The Girl in the Painting\\" sags most noticeably. Guy Rolfe makes a tall, handsome figure as Major Lawrence","excerpt":"Herbert Lom is an acceptable surly and sardonic type German as the girl's supposed father, and several lesser roles are also capably played.

It is a neat, carefree piece of work, which is helped greatly by Spencer Tracy, Pat Paterson, an English actress who here makes her American picture bow","excerpt":"Herbert Mundin, Harry Green, and, to a lesser extent, by John Boles.It is an artless little tale, which like many of its ilk proves to be thoroughly entertaining. Its background is that of the cinema citadel, and the comical Mr. Green appears as that great producer, Louis Wolf, who leaps in where angels fear to tread, when attacking the English language. He even likes to be told that his pictures are \\"stupendous,\\" whereas Mr. Boles as Hal Reede, a mighty player who thinks himself at the top of the heap, suggests that one of Mr. Wolf's lavishly praised productions will end in his being an extra and that it ought to be billed as \\"Hal Reede in the Stuffed Shirt.\\" Although Mr. Boles sings pleasingly and plays better than he does usually, he does not precisely impress one as living up to the high standard expected from Mr. Reede. Nevertheless, this all affords amusement.Three vagabonds, Smoothie King, Limey Brock and Spud Mosco, who come to life respectively in the forms of Mr. Tracy, Mr. Mundin and Sid Silvers, do much to arouse interest in the proceedings. King is a convincing talker, Brock has done time for forgery and cannot resist the penchant for gathering autographs, and Mosco once was a successful song salesman. This unworthy trio encounters Wanda Gale, a Canadian beauty prize winner, who has failed to impress any studio officials with the idea that her face is their fortune. So Messrs. Smoothie, Limey and Spud, whose consciences are about as vulnerable as a hippopotamus's hide, put their heads together and decide upon a way to attract the attention of such men as Wolf and Reede. King and his cohorts are presumed to have $60, and it is to their credit that no such sum ever was made to buy so much.Brock soon emerges as an English peer, and the winsome Wanda Gale (Miss Paterson) pretends to be the lord's daughter. As for King and Mosco, they are well-dressed emergency aides.The quartet embark on the train at Pasadena, declaring that they have come to meet friends, and reach Los Angeles, where they do not precisely emulate the shrinking violet. A few manoeuvres and Wanda is not only on the way to success, but she and the famous Mr. Reede fall in love.Among the musical renditions in this cheery offering are \\"Bottoms Up,\\" \\"Waiting at the Gate for Katy,\\" \\"Turn on the Moon,\\" \\"Little Did I Dream\\" and \\"I'm Throwing My Love Away.\\" In most instances the songs are sung as a natural part of the action, but \\"Waiting at the Gate for Katy\\" calls for a troupe of male and female vocalists.Miss Paterson is a clever and charming actress. She sings agreeably and plays this particular part ingratiatingly. Mr. Tracy, who is also at the Capitol in \\"The Show-Off,\\" once again reveals his histrionic ability. Mr. Mundin has realized that in restraint there is strength. He is far better than usual. Mr. Boles is handsome and good-natured, but scarcely believable when he gives an exhibition of a man in his cups. Mr. Silvers furnishes some of his characteristic comedy, and then you have Mr. Green, who plays as well as ever.Before going any further with this report, one must leave space for a word or so about Walt Disney's latest Silly Symphony, \\"The Grasshopper and the Ants.\\" Like most of the other delightful cartoons, this one is in Mr. Disney's and Technicolor's best style. There is the happy-go-lucky Grasshopper, who in his joy for Summer does not worry about Winter. But the ants, unlike this sluggard, lay in their stocks and have a series of lovely apartments in the roots of a tree.Among the stage numbers at the Radio City Music Hall are \\"The Water Lily,\\" with Nina Whitney and the ballet corps; \\"My Guiding Star,\\" with Evelyn Duerler, Joseph Macauley, Mario and Floria.

About three-fourths of it should find even the most dedicated esthetes squirming.In an extreme departure from such distinguished dramas as his \\"Ballerina\\" and \\"La Maternelle,\\" Jean Benoit-Levy has packaged a modest-scale dance concert of eight numbers, performed by Janine Charrat of the Paris Opera company and a handful of others from the title organization.As a picture and a performance this Hoffberg Productions import succeeds only in demonstrating some middling talent (excluding Mlle. Charrat and Claire Sombert) in stiff, plodding fashion. Since there is a maximum of prancing and a minimum of dancing, against some extremely tacky-looking sets, some customers may doubt that the proceedings even belong on the boards, let alone before an uneasy camera. The choreographers, at any rate, remain anonymous.Of the least tattered and banal numbers, \\"Dream of Love\\" (Liszt) offers Mlle. Charrat and Milorad Miskovitch in a thin but graceful pas de deux under a sinister-shaped, thorn-like tree, the one original decor touch. The team also does well in two fragments from Tchaikovsky's \\"The Sleeping Beauty,\\" although the trim, respectable backgrounds look back-alley compared to the Sadlers' Wells riggings at the Met.The program lands on solid ground in \\"Night and Day\\" (to Tchaikovsky again, not Cole Porter), with Mlles. Charrat and Sombert impressively symbolizing the conflict of darkness and light. But the footing is lost in the excruciating finals. \\"A Country Girl in Paris.\\"Happily, the clouds part for two added shorts that round out the program—one striking and the other almost too good to be true.Poetically triggering his camera to the score of Debussy's \\"The Afternoon of a Faun,\\" Director Hans Richter follows two dancers.

And the music itself, as played by the North German Symphony Orchestra, never sounded better on a sound track. This Flamingo Production was released by Martin J. Lewis.In \\"The Eternal Circle,\\" made in Germany and released by Kinesis, Inc., a dancer appears before a dark curtain and begins a series of rubbery gyrations, the camera darting to and fro like a whippet.Let us simply say that the extraordinary Harald Kreutzberg's interpretation of one of the dancer's best-known solos, as Death and five assorted victims, marks a perfect fusion of two mediums.The others responsible are Erich Menzel, producer","excerpt":"Herbert Seggelke, director-scenarist; Friederich Wilkins and Kurt Graunke, musicians; Andor V.
