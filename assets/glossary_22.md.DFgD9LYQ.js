charges take place out of jury's presence; Ehrlichman says he did not learn until last summer, when Nixon ordered release of transcripts of 3 conversations he had on June 23 '72, that Nixon had ordered for pol reasons that an FBI inquiry into Watergate be curtailed; Ehrlichman's atty William S Frates argues that 8-page rept in question and a 2d, briefer rept are admissible as evidence as part of the proof of Ehrlichman's contention that he had sought to find out truth about Watergate for Nixon and that he had then urged Nixon to get the truth out; Ehrlichman testifies that Nixon instructed him at end of Mar '73 to put himself 'in a position' to advise Nixon on Watergate matters on both 'underlying law' and 'facts'; says Nixon gave him this assignment after it became apparent that Dean was too deeply involved to do so; Judge John J Sirica reserves decision on admissibility of documents; attys for Robert C Mardian, J N Mitchell and Kenneth W Parkinson object to admission of documents; 2d rept is on an int Ehrlichman had with Paul O'Brien, an atty for Nixon re-election com; Neal does not object to introduction of rept; essentially, rept is summary or mention of some of events that have been reptd at trial; Neal says it contains much less information than did oral rept that Dean gave to Nixon on Mar 21 and contains incomplete information about events that Ehrlichman has been shown to have had information about; Ehrlichman testifies that he talked to Nixon's personal atty Herbert W Kalmbach in summer of '72 about raising money for Watergate burglars; describes conversation as far more limited than Kalmbach described it; says he learned in Mar '73 of existence of $350,000 cash fund controlled by H R Haldeman from which money was taken for burglars; Neal notes rept does not mention fund; says Ehrlichman previously testified that no such document existed; Ehrlichman testifies about June 23 '72 meeting he attended in which Haldeman told top CIA official to intervene with FBI head regarding Watergate investigation; says that on July 6 '72, Nixon told him that a vigorous FBI ivestigation in Watergate affair 'could well uncover' confidential CIA activities to detriment of natl interest;

The era of confrontation and division of Europe has ended. We declare that henceforth our relations will be founded on respect and cooperation.   Europe is liberating itself from the legacy of the past. The courage of men and women, the strength of the will of the peoples and the power of the ideas of the Helsinki Final Act have opened a new era of democracy, peace and unity in Europe.   Ours is a time for fulfilling the hopes and expectations our peoples have cherished for decades: steadfast commitment to democracy based on human rights and fundamental freedoms","excerpt":"prosperity through economic liberty and social justice; and equal security for all our countries. . . .    We undertake to build, consolidate and strengthen democracy as the only system of government of our nations. . . .  Fundamental Freedoms     Human rights and fundamental freedoms are the birthright of all human beings, are inalienable and are guaranteed by law. . . .   Democratic government is based on the will of the people, expressed regularly through free and fair elections. . . .    Democracy, with its representative and pluralist character, entails accountability to the electorate, the obligation of public authorities to comply with the law and justice administered impartially. No one will be above the law.   We affirm that, without discrimination, every individual has the right to:   *Freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief,   *Freedom of expression,   *Freedom of association and peaceful assembly,   *Freedom of movement.   No one will be:   *Subject to arbitrary arrest or detention,   *Subject to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.   Everyone also has the right:   *To know and act upon his rights,   *To participate in free and fair elections,   *To fair and public trial if charged with an offense,   *To own property . . . and to exercise individual enterprise,   *To enjoy his economic, social and cultural rights.   We affirm that the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of national minorities will be protected. . . .   Full respect for these precepts is the bedrock on which we will seek to construct the new Europe. Economic Liberty     Economic liberty, social justice and environmental responsibility are indispensable for prosperity.   The free will of the individual, exercised in democracy and protected by the rule of law, forms the necessary basis for successful economic and social development. We will promote economic activity which respects and upholds human dignity. . . . Friendly Relations     In accordance with our obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and commitments under the Helsinki final act, we renew our pledge to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. . . .   With the ending of the division of Europe, we will strive for a new quality in our security relations while fully respecting each other's freedom of choice in that respect.    The unprecedented reduction in armed forces resulting from the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, together with new approaches to security and cooperation within the C.S.C.E. process, will lead to a new perception of security in Europe and a new dimension in our relations. In this context, we fully recognize the freedom of States to choose their own security arrangements.   Aware of the dire needs of a great part of the world, we commit ourselves to solidarity with all other countries. Therefore, we issue a call from Paris today to all the nations of the world. We stand ready to join with any and all states in common efforts to protect and advance the community of fundamental human values. Guidelines for Future   Determined to foster the rich contribution of national minorities to the life of our societies, we undertake further to improve their situation. . . . We express our determination to combat all forms of racial and ethnic hatred, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and discrimination against anyone as well as persecution on religious and ideological grounds. . . .    The changing political and military environment in Europe opens new possibilities for common efforts in the field of military security . . . . following a period for national preparations we look forward to a more structured cooperation among all participating states on security matters, and to discussions and consultations among the 34 participating states aimed at establishing by 1992 . . . new negotiations on disarmament and confidence and security building open to all participating states.   We call for the earliest possible conclusion of the Convention on an effectively verifiable, global and comprehensive ban on chemical weapons, and we intend to be original signatories to it.    We unreservedly condemn, as criminal, all acts, methods and practices of terrorism and express our determination for the environmental eradication both bilaterally and through multilateral cooperation. We will also join together in combatting illicit trafficking in drugs.   We stress that economic cooperation based on market economy constitutes an essential element of our relations and will be instrumental in the construction of a prosperous and united Europe. . . . We underline that cooperation in the economic field, science and technology is now an important pillar of the C.S.C.E. . . . We reaffirm the need to continue to support democratic countries in transition towards the establishment of market economy and the creation of the basis for self-sustained economic and social growth. . . . Cooperation in the field of science and technology . . . must evolve toward a greater sharing of appropriate scientific and technological information and knowledge with a view to overcoming the technological gap which exists among the participating states.   We pledge to intensify our endeavors to protect and improve our environment in order to restore and maintain a sound ecological balance in air, water and soil. . . . We commit ourselves to promoting public awareness and education on the environment as well as the public reporting of the environmental impact of policies, projects and programs. . . . We stress the need for new measures providing for the systematic evaluation of compliance with the existing commitments and, moreover, for the development of more ambitious commitments with regard to notification and exchange of information about the state of the environment and potential environmental hazards.   We recognize the essential contribution of our common European culture and our shared values in overcoming the division of the Continent. . . . In order to promote greater familiarity among our peoples, we favor the establishment of cultural centers in cities of other participating states as well as increased cooperation in the audio-visual field and wider exchange in music, theater, literature and the arts.    The Charter also outlines new C.S.C.E. structures aimed at implementing the common goals specified above.   The Charter specifies that the heads of state or government of the 34 member-nations will meet again in Helsinki at the C.S.C.E. follow-up meeting in 1992 and on subsequent follow-up meetings.   It says the foreign ministers will meet as a Council at least once a year, providing the main forum for political consultations. Berlin is to host the first meeting.

A20    Body Found in Plane's Ruins  The body of a teenager believed to be the son of Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, was recovered from the wreckage of a corporate jet that crashed and exploded Sunday during takeoff from an airport in Montrose, Colorado.   A15    Crime in School Declines  Crime in the nation's schools fell sharply from 1992 to 2002, part of the broad decline in crime in the last decade, according to a report issued by the Justice Department and the Department of Education.   A21    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-7    No-Fault Divorce Pushed in New York  New York is one of the few states and by some definitions the only state that has not adopted some form of no-fault divorce. But now, matrimonial lawyers, bar associations and even some judges are pushing to have the law changed, saying it is archaic and needlessly heightens hostilities between spouses.   A1    Senator Wins 2nd Reprieve  A judge ordered Guy J. Velella, a former New York state senator, back to jail, agreeing with the city that a mayoral panel had the power to send him back. But just three hours later an appeals court temporarily put a halt to efforts to put Mr. Velella back in jail, allowing him to remain free until Dec. 16, when five judges will consider his case.   B1    Antismoking Effort Faulted  An independent review of the New York State Department of Health's $50 million program to reduce smoking found that it has repeatedly failed to spend all of the money available and has been unable to devise an advertising strategy to encourage people not to smoke.   B5    Retired Officer Is Indicted  A retired New York detective has been charged with manslaughter after his gun discharged in a Queens delicatessen last month, killing a teenage worker, District Attorney Richard A. Brown announced.

D1    BUSINESS DAY   C1-16    Merck Adopts Bonus Plan  Merck, which has been reeling since it withdrew its arthritis treatment Vioxx from the market after acknowledging that the drug can cause heart attacks, has adopted a plan that will give its top executives a chance for big bonuses if the company is taken over.   A1    New Market for Airbus  The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company the controlling shareholder of Airbus, said that its board ''fully supports'' the company's plan to build a competitor to the 7E7, Boeing's ultra-efficient, 200- to 300-seat plane aimed at the market for midsize aircraft.   C1    Credit Data, With a Catch  Under a federal law passed a year ago, many consumers will be entitled, beginning tomorrow, to a free credit report every year from each of the three big credit-reporting bureaus. But getting the free reports could be an expensive proposition for unwary consumers.

Numerous safeguards exist to protect such finds on land, providing Federal and state archeologists and historic preservation officials authority to assure that ''buried treasures'' will be professionally excavated and the artifacts preserved in museums and other institutions for the benefit of scholarship and general education.   Contrast these safeguards with the lack of same for underwater discoveries. Admiralty law has traditionally opened such finds to salvage operations, and the dramatic expansion of sport diving has resulted in increased pressure on known wrecks by recreational use. While these are certainly legitimate pastimes, we do not permit landside counterparts to destroy historic landside sites. Indeed, we redirect highways, modify public works projects and expend enormous sums to preserve them in the public interest.  H.R. 3194, a bill to transfer the authority for shipwrecks to the states and to devise guidelines by which the states can protect sites of true historic interest, is now being considered by Congress. And it may be more than coincidence that the recent spate of announcements comes at a time when the law may be modified to protect such wrecks from the exclusive commercial interest of salvors and the indiscriminate methodology that has characterized many such undertakings in the past.
