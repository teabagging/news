Fran Cohen was well known for both her philanthropy and her active involvement in many South Florida organizations. She was on the board of directors of The Florence Fuller Child Development Centers for more than 20 years serving as President for five of those years. She was a long time benefactor of the Boca Raton Community Hospital. Fran rarely missed an interfaith service, and was on the board of trustees of Temple Beth El and supported the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County. In addition, Fran gave college scholarships to many local students, as well as being a patron to Lynn University's Excaliber Society and Caldwell Theatre.

How well did he do it? Was it worth doing? If Mr. Roche's design for the Jewish Museum's new expansion brings to mind Goethe's standard formula for critical appraisal, that may be because the design itself is somewhat formulaic. It is an appealing formula, and Mr. Roche carries it off with devotion and skill. The building does not lack conviction. But it does lack depth.   This Sunday's long-awaited reopening of the museum after two and a half years of renovations brings to fulfillment an ambitious plan, conceived in 1989, to give the Jewish Museum a home worthy of its mission. With a permanent collection of more than 27,000 objects -- ranging from archeological artifacts to contemporary paintings -- this is the major American museum devoted to Jewish culture and history. The museum has grown in stages since its founding in 1904, when it was provisionally housed in the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary. Since 1947, it has occupied the former Warburg Mansion on Fifth Avenue at 92d Street. The choice of Mr. Roche, an internationally celebrated architect whose achievements include the master plan for additions to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, insured that the museum would assume an even grander presence on Museum Mile.

Previews and Openings    'TERRORISM' Opens Monday. A jet black and ominous comedy about modern Russian life that weaves together six interconnected scenes set everywhere from an airport runway to a lover's bedroom. Written by the Siberian brothers Vladimir and Oleg Presnyakov (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200.    'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Opens Tuesday. Seventeen composers each wrote one song to go with the lyrics of Mark Campbell for this solo show about the heartaches and successes of a gay New Yorker. In repertory with ''Score'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, (212) 239-6200.    'THE ARGUMENT' Opens Wednesday. Trouble in a relationship reaches its climax in this world premiere by Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of ''Omnium Gatherum'' (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303.    'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' Opens Thursday.A musical based on the infamous 1920's murder inspired by the philosophy of Nietzsche. Sounds like a joke, but doesn't seem to be (1:30). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, (212) 868-444.    'TABLOID CALIGULA' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Thursday. A comedy about a small-time criminal in the unforgiving underworld, part of the Brits Off Broadway festival (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street (212) 279-4200.    'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Opens June 1. Elaine May's three one-acts is a new comedy on Broadway (remember those?) about married couples and aging singles looking for love. It's being called a play ''about life in the new millennium.'' Daniel Sullivan directs (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.    'B.F.E.' Opens May 31. A kooky Asian-American family tries to escape its stifling home life, while a serial killer stalks its neighborhood in Arizona (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd (212) 279-4200.    'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' Previews start Wednesday. Opens June 15. Is it a comic tragedy or a tragic comedy?

The gimmick of this new spin on ''Stomp,'' which includes 11 percussionists from West and South Africa, is that every audience member plays his or her own drum during the show. David Warren directs (1:25). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, (212) 239-6200.    'THE PARIS LETTER' Opens June 12. A repressed Wall Street investment banker (is there any other kind?) has a long, hard fall in Jon Robin Baitz's new drama that spans four decades (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300.    'WORK' Opens May 28. Corporations take another beating in this satire of the cubicled life. Directed by Jim Simpson (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street (212) 226-2407.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)    'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising soufflé of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish wind-up music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us. (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:45)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitous and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Broadway    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the Armenian genocide. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, child-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at East 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Miriam Horn)    'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause (2:30). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'FLIGHT: THE RISE AND FALL OF CHARLES LINDBERGH' Garth Wingfield's droning bio-play transforms Charles Lindbergh's journey from tickertape hero to disgraced Nazi sympathizer into a sort of talking newspaper, minus op-ed pages, lively writing and the weather report. With Gregg Edelman playing the everyman pilot turned celebrity, and Brian D'Arcy James on hand to personify a series of slimy reporters (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'HENRY FLAMETHROWA' John Belluso's timely drama about girl in a coma who may or may not heal the sick engages the issues raised during the Terri Schiavo media circus. It's a thought-provoking and ambitious play (starring Tim Daly) but unfortunately there's no characters in it you can believe in (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity that any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'KING A' Het Laagland's variation on the legend of King Arthur for children features five energetic actors, 40 tiny chairs, several a cappella musical numbers, occasional swordplay and frequent inspiring affirmations. The show is inventive and full of physical energy but in the end may be a little too talky for its intended audience (1:20.) New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE MAIDS' It is no small feat to find the chill in Jean Genet's 1947 play about two maids who fantasize about killing their boss, but Jean Cocteau Repertory manages it. Credit an eye-opening performance by Amanda Jones as Solange, the dominant of the two maids (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond and East Second Streets, (212)279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MEMORY HOUSE' Dianne Wiest's warm, engaging performance provides the juicy filling in Kathleen Tolan's play about a tense stand-off between a mother and her teenage daughter over their differing philosophies of life. As she bakes a pie -- from scratch, mind you -- Ms. Wiest performs the still more challenging feat of keeping our sympathies keenly attuned to the appealing emotional undercurrents in Ms. Tolan's slight but sensitively drawn two-hander (1:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side-effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'THE PASSION OF THE CRAWFORD' For his slight but still tasty new show, John Epperson has decided to allow his voiceless alter ego, Lypsinka, to commune intimately and at length with one of her spiritual forebears, Joan Crawford. The centerpiece is a pointed but never vicious re-creation, or rather an interpretation, of a live interview Crawford gave at Town Hall in 1973 (1:30). Zipper, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'A PICASSO' Jeffrey Hatcher's play is a formulaic two-hander set in occupied Paris in 1941. Pablo Picasso (Dennis Boutsikaris) is brought in for interrogation by the severe Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), who works for the German cultural ministry (1:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood)    'THE PULL OF NEGATIVE GRAVITY' A Welsh man with no seeming interest in politics gets badly injured in the Iraq war and discovers that returning home will not be so easy. In this bruising, intimate and overly familiar play, which is part of the Brits Off Broadway festival, Jonathan Lichtenstein beautifully portrays how the war destroyed one rural family (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. ( Zinoman)    'SCORE' The subject of this one-man show is Leonard Bernstein and music, and the performer Tom Nelis, and the director, Anne Bogart, ''get'' Lenny -- now brilliant, now flamboyant, now superficial, now physically responding to recorded music (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village. (212) 239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' The comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)    * 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'THE FALL' Through Kenneth Nowell's looking glass, Hamlet is reversed, and a daughter","excerpt":"Jill is driven mad by her mother's ghost. Was the mother's expected death natural or an act of murder by her father, who too quickly married her mother's sister? A strong cast and superb director, Kate Marks, manage a tone that teeters effectively between the tragic and the hilarious, and one is left unexpectedly shaken (1:40). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, (212)307-9467). (Honor Moore)    'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street , (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'LES BELLES SOEURS' There is a good John Waters movie hiding inside Michel Tremblay's all-female play. This likable comedy about a New England woman who wins a million trading stamps wants to be a farce but is just a collection of observations searching for a shape (1:30). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)330-8650, closing on Sunday. (Gates)    'CHANTECLER' A version of Edmond Rostand's fable about a rooster and his role in the cosmos bills itself as a family show, but it's pitched way over the heads of the age group that would most enjoy its colorful costumes. But Cory Einbinder, the director, manages to make a smattering of scenes memorable: a parade of mutant roosters; a ridiculous trio of toads (2:20). Teatro La Tea, at Clemente Soto Valez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, second floor, (212)353-3101, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'JAPANESE PLAYS FROM THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY' The sole reason to see this evening of three one-acts is the rare staging of \\"Paper Balloon,\\" by Kunio Kishida, one of Japan's most important pre-World War II dramatists. The rest of the program is embarrassingly misconceived (2:00) . Common Basis Theater, 750 Eighth Avenue, room 500, (646)554-6557, closing on Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb)    'LITTLE WOMEN' Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of American Girl dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    * 'LOVE/LIFE A LIFE IN SONG' The year's finest cabaret act has expanded into a brilliant 90-minute concert for the theater in which Brian Stokes Mitchell sustains a remarkable fusion of pop-jazz singing and theatrical expression. A must (1:30). Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater, (212) 239-6200, closing on Monday. (Stephen Holden)    * 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naïve, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women (1:25). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR' Henry Adam's play starts out as a humorous, trenchant fable on how fear of terrorism can distort individual lives, not to say nations, but something mysterious happens after intermission: it mutates into a sitcom. The actors Ronny Jhutti and Mark McDonnell are very much worth watching, though. Part of Brits Off Broadway (2:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)    'THE PURSUIT OF PERSEPHONE' A musical inspired by F. Scott Fitzgerald's college romance with Ginevra King jams 26 songs into two and a half hours -- which feels even longer. The evening's most entertaining moments are the drag routines by the Triangle Club, a fraternity to which Fitzgerald belonged when he was at Princeton (2:30). Prospect Theater Company, at the Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, (212)352-3101, closing on Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'A LOT LIKE LOVE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A film that isn't half bad and every so often is pretty good, filled with real sentiment, worked-through performances and a story textured enough to sometimes feel a lot like life. (Manohla Dargis)    'THE AMITYVILLE HORROR' (R, 89 minutes) Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, this remake of the soporific 1979 horror flick marks a modest improvement on the original. But this time don't get attached to the family dog. (Dargis)    'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali) A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)    'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish) This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)    'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, in part because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    * 'FEVER PITCH' (PG-13, 98 minutes) To watch this new, thoroughly winning if not especially good romantic comedy is to appreciate, yet again, that the great loves of our lives are rarely perfect. (Dargis)    * 'FUNNY HA HA' (not rated, 89 minutes) Twenty-somethings looking for love, direction and fulfilling work -- this smart, cheaply made first feature is low-key, note-perfect and sneakily artful. (Scott)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)    * 'THE HOLY GIRL' (not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)    'HOUSE OF D' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Robin Williams plays a wise and kindly mentally retarded janitor. Enough said. (Scott)    'HOUSE OF WAX' (R, 105 minutes) Not the depilatory sequel to ''Beauty Shop,'' but rather a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price creepshow, with Paris Hilton, Elisha Cuthbert and a bunch of guys menaced by maniacs in the Louisiana backwoods. Grisly and slow. (Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    'JIMINY GLICK IN LALAWOOD' (R, 90 minutes) This frantic comic hodgepodge built around Martin Short's popular Comedy Central character is an intermittently funny free-for-all that suffers from attention deficit disorder. (Holden)    'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy and Robert Duvall (as Mr. Ferrell's father and rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson you'll win big anyway. (Scott)    'KINGDOM OF HEAVEN' (R, 145 minutes) A plaintive period epic from Ridley Scott, starring Orlando Bloom, about the bloody orgies of piety known as the Crusades. The film proves yet again that it takes an actor as self-serious as Russell Crowe to carry the weight of Mr. Scott's ambitions; it also takes a story Mr. Scott himself can really believe in for the filmmaker to do the same. (Dargis)    'KING'S RANSOM' (PG-13, 97 minutes) The cinematic equivalent of trampled chewing gum on a subway platform. (Holden)    'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese) This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two Dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    * 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French) A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)    'MA MÈRE' (NC-17, 110 minutes, in French) Avid sensation seeking in this film is such a grim affair that after a short while, the spectacle of its aimless characters bending themselves out of shape in the pursuit of depravity mutates from titillating to pathetic to laughable. (Holden)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth-graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MINDHUNTERS' (R, 106 minutes) This thriller re-imagines Agatha Christie's ''Ten Little Indians'' as ''Eight Little Profilers'': a team of would-be F.B.I. agents, isolated at a training compound to solve a simulated crime, soon realize that a real serial killer walks among them. The film may find a cult audience among fans of schlock cinema seeking a giggle and a scream. (Dana Stevens)    'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)    * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad-boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a little league coach. Superb performances, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'PALINDROMES' (not rated, 100 minutes) The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)    'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes) It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)    'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes) Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)    * 'STAR WARS III: REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    * '3-IRON' (not rated, 87 minutes; in Korean) A pop fable of urban loneliness that showcases the Korean director Kim Ki-Duk's witty sense of form. It's a thoroughly modern movie with elements of silent film, a love story shot with horror-film techniques, and a charming blend of style and sentiment. (Scott)    * 'À TOUTE DE SUITE' (Not rated, 96 minutes; in French) This downbeat homage to the French New Wave is a small, nearly perfect film that follows the sad chain of events when a headstrong 19-year-old art student goes on the lam with a Moroccan bank robber. (Holden)    'WALK ON WATER' (Not rated, 104 minutes) The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Stevens)    'XXX: STATE OF THE UNION' (PG-13, 94 minutes). A wildly silly action flick in which all that stand between the American people and the yoke of tyranny are big guns, bigger breasts, the thud-thud-thud of commercial rap and the multiplatform artist known as Ice Cube (né O'Shea Jackson). (Dargis)    Film Series    'CELEBRATING THE BLACK VOICES WEEKEND' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Symphony Space is screening George C. Wolfe's ''Lackawanna Blues'' (2005), based on Ruben Santiago-Hudson's play about a boardinghouse matriarch (S. Epatha Merkerson), and Stanley Nelson's ''Soldiers Without Swords'' (1999), a history of black newspapers in America. Mr. Santiago-Hudson, Ms. Merkerson and Mr. Nelson will hold question-and-answer sessions after their films. Leonard Nimoy Thalia, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-5400; $25. (Anita Gates)    'FIRST NATIONS/FIRST FEATURES' (Through Monday) The final days of the Museum of Modern Art's 25-film showcase of the first films of directors from indigenous cultures around the world. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212)708-9400, $10, $8 for 65+, $6 for students. (Gates)    'ONCE UPON A TIME: SERGIO LEONE' (Through Sunday) A cold-blooded henchman and a nameless drifter? It must be Leone (1929-89), auteur of the so-called spaghetti western. BAM Cinématek continues its 10-day Leone tribute. Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100; $10, $7 students and 65+, $6, Cinema Club Members. (Gates)    FRANÇOIS OZON RETROSPECTIVE (Sunday through June 5) The Museum of the Moving Image is honoring Mr. Ozon, the genre-bending French director of ''Swimming Pool'' and ''Under the Sand.'' The event begins with screenings of ''Sitcom'' (1998), about a suburban family with a rat, and ''Criminal Lovers'' (1999), a sort of tabloid version of the Hansel and Gretel story, and closes with a personal appearance by Mr. Ozon. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)784-0077; museum admission, $10, $7.50, 65+ and students. (Gates)    PACIFIKA: NEW YORK HAWAIIAN FILM FESTIVAL (Today through Sunday) Hey, how many film festivals include hula and ukulele workshops? New York University's Tisch School and the Hawaii Cultural Foundation are presenting some 30 features, documentaries and shorts that reflect the cultural heritage of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. Titles include ''Mauna Kea: Temple Under Siege'' and ''Polynesian Power: Islanders in Pro Football.'' Cantor Film Center, 36 East Eighth Street; Tisch Film and Television Theaters, 721 Broadway, (212)966-3378; $8 to $10. (Gates)    'SCREEN DECO' (Monday) Film Forum celebrates Art Deco Week with screenings of two highly designed 1930's films and 45-minute illustrated talks by Eric Myers and Howard Mandelbaum, authors of ''Screen Deco.'' Ralph Murphy's ''Top of the Town'' (1937) is about a luxury nightclub atop a skyscraper. Edmund Goulding's ''Reaching for the Moon'' (1930) is set on a grand ocean liner. 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212)727-8110; $10, $5, children, members and 65+. (Gates)    JOHN SAYLES AND MAGGIE RENZI TRIBUTE (Tomorrow) Mr. Sayles and Ms. Renzi will appear in person at the Museum of the Moving Image to present screenings of two of their films and participate in panel discussions about political filmmaking and the role of women in the industry. The films are ''Matewan'' (1987), about a coal miners' strike, and ''City of Hope'' (1991), about politics, crime and corruption in New Jersey. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)784-0077; museum admission, $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * THE BLOOD BROTHERS (Tuesday) Screaming lyrics like ''We're scrapped valentines/We're tangerine rinds'' over pummeling, chaotic guitars, this visceral Seattle quintet finds that temperature at which panicky noise-punk explodes into emo shrapnel. 8 p.m., Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, www.spiritnewyork.com or www.ticketmaster.com, $12. (Laura Sinagra)    BOREDOMS (Wednesday) For almost two decades now, the Japanese noise group has been one of the best psychedelic rock bands in the world. Though its latest album doesn't touch its best, its live show always matches sonic exploration with stage charisma. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $20. (Sinagra)    * BRIGHT EYES, THE FAINT, MARS BLACK (Tomorrow through Wednesday) The Nebraskan singer-songwriter Conor Oberst is perhaps too jittery to resonate as a New Dylan to diehard fans of the Old Dylan. But his emphatic wisdom, political indignance and wine-soaked laments make him a contender for the best songwriter of his generation. These shows focus on music from the electronic rock half of his recent double-album. With goth-dance band The Faint and self-deprecating rapper Mars Black. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, (212)353-1600, $25, sold out. (Sinagra)    KELLY CLARKSON (Tomorrow) Pulling a hit song from the jaws of assured post- ''American Idol'' obscurity, the amiable Kelly Clarkson wisely ditched light dance pop for attitudinous pop rock. The Max Martin-penned ''Since You Been Gone'' is the catchiest party song since ''Hey Ya.'' 1 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212)307-7171, $37. (Sinagra)    COMMON (Monday and Tuesday) The Chicago rapper Common has at times deserved the stigma that attends the label ''conscious rap'' -- the assumption of preachiness and lackluster execution. On his new record, though, he meets the challenge of working with the fellow Midwesterner and current ''It'' producer Kanye West. 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, (212)243-4940, $30.(Sinagra)    * THE DECEMBERISTS (Thursday) The weight of the bandleader Colin Melloy's baroque songs about child queens, heartsick cold war spies and vengeful seafarers is lightened by his sweeping lovelorn sing-alongs. 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)387-0505, $18. (Sinagra)    * DEERHOOF (Tomorrow and Sunday) This excitingly whimsical band harbors equal amounts affection for No Wave angularity, exuberant noise-pop, and outsider naif art like the Shaggs. Their latest release is an electronically augmented fractured fairy tale about a kidnapping milkman. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $10 (Sinagra)    DR. JOHN: 'ALL BY HISSELF' (Tonight and tomorrow, and May 25-29) Dr. John is steeped in New Orleans barrelhouse piano, swampy bayou funk and the gris-gris mysticism that surrounds it. He has applied his cagey growl of a voice and florid piano playing to jazz standards and songs with a conscience. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., except Wednesday and Thursday when shows are at 8 p.m., Au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, Manhattan, (212)308-9455, $50. (Jon Pareles)    THE EVENS (Tomorrow) The Evens is the new duo from Ian MacKaye, who will forever be followed (if not always loved) by fans of his pioneering previous bands Minor Threat and Fugazi; joined by Amy Farina, he lends his famous wail to casual (but not passionless) indie-rock songs. With Parts & Labor and others. 2 p.m., East River Amphitheater, East River Park, the Lower East Side, www.eastrivermusicproject.com, free. (Kelefa Sanneh)    FISCHERSPOONER (Thursday) The heavily conceptual art-world buzz and gallery extravaganzas of Fischerspooner didn't turn its electro ditties into hits; now the band is back on a more humble scale. After show party with the D.J. Andrew Andrew ($10). 9 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, Chinatown, (212)941-8100, $22.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Pareles)    JOSEPHINE FOSTER (Tonight) You might call Ms. Foster's eerie warbling old-fashioned, except that it evokes a scrambled past that exists only in her own vision: mountain songs that never were, spaced-out hybrids that never will be. She is to open for Akron/Family and the Angels of Light. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $15. (Sanneh)    FOUNTAINS OF WAYNE, BEN KWELLER (Sunday) Still underappreciated even after 2002's fluke MTV smash ''Stacy's Mom,'' these 30-something songwriters continue to write clever, pure pop ditties and some of the smartest yuppie satire around. This show benefits the Sing for the Children Fund. The Brooklyn-based melodist Ben Kweller opens. 4 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue, $50 for concert-only, $150-$2500 for special VIP access. Information at www.singforthechildren.org. (Sinagra)    * GANG GANG DANCE (Thursday) This sly, angular local band recently released ''God's Money'' (The Social Registry), a beguiling album full of splintered post-punk rhythms that cohere around the dreamlike murmurs of Lizzi Bougatsos. With Bloodlines and Electroputas. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15. (Sanneh)    GIPSY KINGS (Monday) Strumming half a dozen guitars, singing in a husky rasp and stamping their heels on the floor, this French pop group is to flamenco what Rice-a-Roni is to paella. Which is not to say that some of their international hits, like ''Bamboleo,'' aren't fiendishly catchy. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, at 50th Street, (212) 247-4777, $39.50 to $79.50. (Pareles)    * GZA, C-RAYZ WALZ, J-LIVE, VAST AIRE (Monday) The most cerebral Wu Tang Clan member, GZA (aka ''Genius''), fronts a tour of rappers who idealize the East Coast's Golden Age of elite M.C.'s. That is, they pursue nuance over histrionics and hubris. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $18.50 in advance, $20. (Sinagra)    SOPHIE B. HAWKINS (Tuesday) Most famous for the gay-positive radio hit, ''Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover'' on a 1992 album adorned with naked photos by David LaChappelle, the intriguingly gutsy Hawkins now plays the singer-songwriter circuit. 7 p.m., Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-7235, $32 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sinagra)    HOT HOT HEAT (Tonight) In a fray of 80's revival bands with interchangeable frontmen, this Canadian outfit boasts the more memorable bounce of curlicued leader Steve Bays. Problem is, as evidenced by the petulant single ''Goodnight Goodnight,'' his relatively shallow vision and cloying choruses don't often justify the cocky posture and overwrought hiccups. 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, (212)353-1600, $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sinagra)    BILLY IDOL (Sunday and Monday) Those who played the faux-noir ''White Wedding'' at their weddings, or affected a sexy snarl for old times' sake during pop-punker Billy Idol's quick flicker on MTV's ''I Love the 80's'' can now dance with themselves and others as Idol reprises his radio hits. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, Upper West Side, (212)496-7070, $33.50 to $53.50. (Sinagra)    JIM & JENNIE AND THE PINETOPS (Monday) Unlike a lot of younger Alt-Country bands that nod to classic traditions, this Pennsylvania group actually plays accomplished bluegrass topped by high lonesome close-harmonic vocals. 7 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side (212)260-4700, $10. (Sinagra)    KING GYPSY ROCKER MASSIVE (Sunday) Gogol Bordello's Eugene Hutz has done for Gypsy music what the Pogues did for Irish traditionals, fusing their dizzy catharsis with visceral punk scuzz. This event fills the entire Knitting Factory complex with musicians occupying points on the Balkan punk rock continuum. Performers include DJ Hutz, World Inferno Friendship Society Nervous Cabaret, and Slavic Soul Party. 7 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132, $15. (Sinagra)    CYNDI LAUPER, NATALIE MERCHANT, NELLIE MCKAY, SANDRA BERNHARD (Monday) This benefit concert for the family of the well-regarded and recently deceased music executive Theresa Brilli will feature a full set by the 80's new wave rocker Ms. Lauper, as well as guest appearances by the serious-minded singer-songwriter Ms. Merchant, the cabaret wunderkind Nellie McKay and others. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, (212)777-6800, $60. (Sinagra)    * LIGHTNING BOLT (Thursday) This noisy and exuberant two-piece makes a terrifying racket, using fuzzed-into-obliteration bass and galloping drums (with some screaming, too) to create half-abstract pieces that hint at everything from heavy metal to dance music. With Mutant Life Expectancy and others. 9 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Columbia Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007, $10. (Sanneh)    SARAH MCLACHLAN (Tuesday) Still singing with epic pop swoon about love, resolute ambivalence, and broadly conceived existential matters, the founder of Lilith Fair is thinking increasingly globally (e.g., last year's ''World on Fire'' single). 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212)465-6741, $34.50 to $84.50. (Sinagra)    MONADE (Tomorrow and Sunday) Laetitia Sadier of the pacific, intellectual art pop group Stereolab continues in that vein with music that's charming yet somewhat insular. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side (212)260-4700, $14 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)    MARK O'CONNOR, DAVID BROMBERG, NATALIE MACMASTER (Tomorrow) Billed as a ''fiddling summit,'' this concert should put some idiosyncratic twists into tradition. It includes Mark O'Connor's mixture of Appalachian and classical music, Natalie MacMaster's rough-hewn Celtic fiddling and stepdancing from Cape Breton and David Bromberg's all-American eclecticism and vintage violins, along with Mr. Bromberg's guests Jay Ungar (whose ''Ashokan Farewell'' was the theme of Ken Burns's ''Civil War'') and Molly Mason. 8 p.m. New Jersey Performing Arts Center, One Center Street, Newark (888)466-5722, $10 to $48. (Pareles)    JOHN OSWALD AND MICHAEL SNOW (Monday) Early adopter of mashup pop bricolage, the ''Plunderphonics'' originator John Oswald plays saxophone with the avant-garde filmmaker/artist, and here pianist, Michael Snow. 9:30 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, (212)358-7501, $10. (Sinagra)    PINBACK (Tuesday) Overthought pop constructions are an acquired taste, but this band's pointillist songs are at their most compelling when they sound like stripped-down sonic schematics. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, (212)777-6800, $18.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    PLASTIC PEOPLE OF THE UNIVERSE (Sunday) In Prague in the 1960's, the Plastic People of the Universe transmuted the lessons of Frank Zappa and the Velvet Underground into dank, dissonant, precise songs that drew the wrath of Czechoslovakia's Communist government. The band's persecution galvanized a dissident movement that eventually triumphed. But the reconstituted band's songs are more than period pieces; by finding a rock language for Eastern European angst, they turn desperation inside out. 7 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)539-8777, $25 in advance, $30. (Pareles)    RILO KILEY, PORTASTATIC (Thursday) This band combines the expansive American longing of Bruce Springsteen with the bedroom introspection of early Liz Phair. The frontwoman Jennie Lewis's humanized star power makes for an explosive live show.

(Pareles)    TEAM SLEEP (Wednesday) Though his band, the Deftones, got famous on the frat-friendly nu-metal circuit in the late 90's, Chino Moreno has a reputation as a thoughtful lyricist and eclectic music fan. He's been steadily taking things in a dreamier direction, and this side project looks to explore the expansive desertscapes beyond hard-rock bashing. 8 and 11 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132, $15 in advance, $17 at the door.

(Ratliff)    * BILL FRISELL TRIO (Tomorrow and Sunday) This group, with the keyboardist Sam Yahel and the drummer Brian Blade, is one of three different trios that the guitarist Bill Frisell now plays with, and it's the one that perhaps goes the furthest out there. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232, cover, $30.

Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212)258-9800, $30, plus a $10 minimum (Ratliff)    ANDREW HILL 'RETRO' QUARTET (Through tomorrow) The pianist Andrew Hill is one of the most mysterious composers of modern jazz, not just for his fraught harmonies and layered rhythms but for his periodic disappearances from the scene. But he's come back over the last decade, leading a number of bands; this is a quartet with the saxophonist Greg Tardy, the bassist John Hebert and the drummer Leroi Jones. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, (212)581-3080, cover, $30, plus a $10 minimum.

(Ratliff)    * BOBBY HUTCHERSON QUARTET (Through Sunday) Mr. Hutcherson is one of the great individual voices and better composers in jazz, and he's a vibraphonist, making him triply rare.

But he is also an earthy blues-and-bop player from Chicago; his résumé includes time in the bands of Dinah Washington, Dizzy Gillespie and Cannonball Adderley. 8, 10, and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626, cover, $20, minimum, $10. (Ratliff)    KATE McGARRY (Tomorrow) A lot of jazz singers are good at a few devices and punch them out song after song; Ms. McGarry has a deeper supply. You'll find shades of pop singers like Suzanne Vega and Rickie Lee Jones in her voice; you'll also find some of the highest refinements of great jazz singing. She has a breadth of material that runs from jazz standards to traditional Irish ballads to a version of the Kinks' ''(So) Tired of Waiting for You.''

(Ratliff)    * EIVIND OPSVIK 'OVERSEAS' (Wednesday) Mr. Opsvik is a young Norwegian bassist and bandleader with an unusual gift for writing small, poignant pieces of music. His melodic shards are strong, as are the chord sequences moving underneath them; he has the distinction, in a time when jazz compositions are becoming increasingly opaque, of writing catchy tunes, and his fat-toned, unfussy bass sound enhances them. His new record is ''Overseas II,'' on Fresh Sound, and his band includes Tony Malaby, Jacob Sacks, Craig Taborn, and Kenny Wollesen. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)929-9883, cover, $8 and a one-drink minimum (Ratliff)    OREGON (Through) Celtic music, jazz, swing and classical guitar get all mixed up in the music of Oregon, a band that's been around since 1970.

(Ratliff)    * NICHOLAS PAYTON QUINTET (Wednesday through May 28) The trumpeter Nicholas Payton first grabbed the jazz world's attention with his remarkable feeling for early New Orleans jazz and more recently made an obstinately spacey funk record, but he's spent most of his professional time dealing with the rich languages of post-1960 jazz. Here he'll be mining that territory. 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, midtown, (212)581-3080, cover, $30, with a $10 minimum (Ratliff)    ERIC REED TRIO (Through tomorrow) Always alert and fluent, Mr. Reed, the pianist, has gospel and bebop and a lot of post-50's modernism in him, too.

(Ratliff)    * LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA PLAYS THAD JONES (Through tomorrow) The trumpeter and composer Thad Jones, who died in 1986, always deserves a second look. A member of Count Basie's orchestra during the 1950's and early 60's, he decamped to form his own big band, which played weekly shows at the Village Vanguard, starting a new large-ensemble jazz tradition. Jazz at Lincoln Center's gleaming band takes on his music, with the saxophonists Jerry Dodgion and Billy Harper and the bass trombonist Douglas Purviance, as guests; Vincent Gardner, one of Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra's trombonists, presents new arrangements of the old tunes. 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212)721-6500, $85to $150. (Ratliff)    * CLARK TERRY (Tuesday through May 29) It's possible that no other jazz musician has as much amusing old-guy charm as Mr. Terry, and when you think he's all sweetness, he'll rattle you profoundly with a cool, beautifully executed piece of fluegelhorn playing. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037, $30. (Ratliff)    THE TRIO/SEX MOB (Tonight) The Trio includes three jazz-oriented jam-band heroes: the bassist Chris Wood (of Medeski, Martin & Wood), the saxophonist Skerik (who plays with Stanton Moore and Galactic) and the drummer Johnny Vidacovich (of Astral Project).

(Ratliff)    Classical    Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'CYRANO DE BERGERAC' (Tonight) Musically not much of an opera, it does provide a meaty role for the ageless tenor Plácido Domingo, who gives a vocally fervent and poignant portrayal of Cyrano, the fearless and noble guardsman cursed with an absurdly huge nose. The cast is excellent, and Francesca Zambello has created a stylish and handsome production. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, sold out, but returns may be available. (Anthony Tommasini)    'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Run on enthusiasm and a shoestring, the tiny Amato Opera mounts a modest production of the Donizetti classic.

And the Met has assembled a top-rank cast, especially René Pape as Mephistopheles. Alas, the Met's new production by Andrei Serban is a jumble. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, sold out, but returns may be available. (Tommasini)    'TOSCA' (Tomorrow) The Met puts its season to bed with a soothing old favorite: Puccini's classic, in Franco Zeffirelli's lavish and historically authentic production. The high point of the cast should be Marcello Giordani, who has been singing ardently and ringingly, as Cavaradossi. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $145 and $215 tickets remain. (Anne Midgette)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Great views and typically fresh performances help make this floating concert hall one of the best for chamber music.

Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212)997-7717, $100 and $250. (Tommasini)    NEW YORK CHORAL SOCIETY (Tonight) It's like Giacomo in the Kentucky Derby: an amateur chorus overmatched in Beethoven's well-nigh unsingable ''Missa Solemnis.'' A risky proposition, it nevertheless affords the opportunity to shine. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $18 to $75. (Oestreich)    NEW YORK NEW MUSIC ENSEMBLE (Monday) Contemporary music often involves a measure of gamesmanship, or at least, a sometimes fluid negotiation between the composer and the performers (and sometimes the listeners). With game-playing as its theme, this first-rate group offers works by Hiroya Miura, Wayne Peterson, John Anthony Lennon, David Rakowski and Andrew Imbrie. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3303, $15; $10 for students and 65+.

(Anderson)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION: AFRICAN AMERICAN ART FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses's view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    * ASIA SOCIETY AND QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'EDGE OF DESIRE: RECENT ART IN INDIA,' through June 5. A highly selective, multigenerational survey of different kinds of contemporary art being made in India; embracing craft, folk and tribal traditions as well as popular culture and academic modernism. The smaller portion is at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue at 70th Street, (212)288-6400; the more expansive and varied section at the Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700. Also at Queens: ''Fatal Love.'' (Holland Cotter)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'BASQUIAT,' through June 5. Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame (usually on the same surface) with a loquacious style that mixed mediums and gave visual voice to the glories, history and pain of blackness. Despite a few glitches, this generous retrospective provides an exhilarating account of his short innovative career. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Smith)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments, representing 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. (See above.) (Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES: DESIGNING FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics; but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, the innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)    * EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustín Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with Revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' through June 8. Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering 81-foot-tall construction, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections; there is not much to the work beyond that. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Michael Kimmelman)    * SPANISH INSTITUTE: 'FROM GOYA TO SOROLLA,' through July 30. More than 75 pictures from the Hispanic Society, celebrating its centenary; starting with Goya's grave portrait of Pedro Mocarte, they track an arc to figures like Francisco Núñez Losada and salon virtuosi like Ignacio Zuloaga and Joaquín Sorolla. 684 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)628-0420. (Kimmelman)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LARRY CLARK,' through June 5. The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Ken Johnson)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression as she captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some absurdly theatrical galleries, where her work reveals that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Kimmelman)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12, 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient time, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. (See above.) (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEFINING YONGLE: IMPERIAL ART IN EARLY 15TH-CENTURY CHINA,' through July 10. Sequestered in the exquisite Chinese decorative arts galleries, this show is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Cotter)    MUSEUM FOR AFRICAN ART: 'RESONANCE FROM THE PAST,' through May 29. Roughly 90 sculptures, along with a few bead and fabric pieces, from the African holdings of the New Orleans Museum of Art. They make a savory anthology, with plenty of textbook staples, and some surprises. 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-7700. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!: SELF-TAUGHT ARTISTS, THE BIBLE AND THE AMERICAN SOUTH,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelists. Many names familiar to followers of 20th century folk and outsider art are on hand including William Edmondson, Minnie Evans, the Reverend Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Johnson)    * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'EL BARRIO: PUERTO RICAN NEW YORK,' through June 12. A snapshot of El Barrio -- East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem -- as seen through archival images and pictures by the contemporary photographer Hiram S. Maristany taken at a revolutionary political moment in the 1960's and early 70's. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Cotter)    * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'THOMAS DEMAND,' through May 30. A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, taking his own cinematic works. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Kimmelman)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'CHRIS MARKER,' through June 13. Made entirely on the computer, ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' -- a two-channel, eight-screen DVD with which this French underground film legend makes his New York debut as an installation artist -- gives the horrors of World War I an eroded beauty and haunting pertinence. (See above.) (Smith)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)    NEUE GALERIE: 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' through June 6. More than 100 faces shot by 35 photographers. It's a savvy show that homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art, or music, this country has produced. Also at the museum: ''Chris Ofili: Afro Muses 1995-2005.'' 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Smith)    THE UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO: VISION AND CONTINUITY,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TIM HAWKINSON,' through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Mr. Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800)944-8639. (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER: BLACK SUN,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    * JACK GOLDSTEIN A hero of the Pictures generation revered by the new Pop artists and theorists of the 80's. His films from the early 70's (from 20 seconds to five minutes long) have a cool, deadpan quality recalling early videos of William Wegman. Ed Ruscha-style paintings of lightning storms from the 80's, here and at Metro, are thrillingly cinematic. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, through June 11. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-7100, through May 27. (Johnson)    * 'PROVIDING FOR THE AFTERLIFE: BRILLIANT ARTIFACTS FROM SHANDONG' The archaeology boom in China continues, and the 50 objects from Han dynasty tombs in this show are being exhibited in the United States for the first time. China Institute Gallery,125 East 65th Street, (212)744-8181, through June 4. (Cotter)    * RICHARD WATHEN A young British artist plugs some 21st-century energy into 18th-century portraiture, painting with a matte, flat delicacy that gives familiar poses a new-born freshness, and not only when clothing is subtracted. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through June 16. (Smith)    Galleries: 57th Street    'EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY' Among more than 70 narrative paintings, drawings and prints by a wide range of 20th century artists are works by Max Beckmann, James Ensor, John Heartfield, Kathe Kollwitz, Sue Coe, Martha Rosler and Eric Fischl. Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, (212)245-6734, through May 27. (Johnson)    'WILDER' This tribute to theLos Angeles dealer Nicholas Wilder, (1937-1989) presents works by 28 artists who were shown at his gallery between 1965 and 1979. The all-star lineup includes Dan Flavin, Agnes Martin, John McCracken, Richard Tuttle and Cy Twombly. Parrasch and Washburn galleries, 20 West 57th Street, (212)246-5360 and(212)246-5300, through May 27. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    TINA BARNEY The photographer known for her large, sumptuous color photographs of rich people often caught in situations of subtle psychological tension presents portraits shot in Spain and Germany that are included in her book ''The Europeans.'' Janet Borden, 560 Broadway at Prince Street, (212)431-0166, through May 27. (Johnson)    TERAO KATSUHIRO, SHINKI TOMOYUKI, YOSHIMUNE KAZUHIRO, YUMOTO MITSUO Four artists, from a Japanese facility for the artistically talented mentally disabled, appear possessed of naïve but intense imaginations and formal predilections bordering on compulsive. Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, (212)925-1200, through May 31. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    VICTOR BURGIN: 'THE LITTLE HOUSE' A video meditation on architectural beauty and conflicting male and female desire by a veteran English artist is one of the best, least didactic works of his career. Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, (212)462-2668, through May 28. (Smith)    DEAN BYINGTON Skillfully blending the hand-made and the mechanical, the paintings of this San Francisco artist use patterns suggestive of lacy wallpaper and images from 19th-century engravings to evoke landscapes and their not always peaceful inhabitants. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)255-8450, through June 18. (Smith)    IAN COOPER With a series of works that focus on the child-star of the ''Poltergeist'' movies, this young artist adds his distinctive preoccupation with popular culture and the spirit world to the black-on-black, Goth-leaning current in new art. Cue, 511 West 25th Street, (212)206-3583, through June 4. (Smith)    CHERYL DONEGAN: 'OLD, TEMPORARY' While video-projected images of colorful cheap toys unfold on the wall, a woman's maniacally cheerful voice recites a rapid-fire litany of affirmations composed for Amway salespeople: ''I am the best at what I do. There is no one better. I get the job done,'' and so on. It is funny and scary. Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212)255-0979, through June 4. (Johnson)    ROBBERT FLICK: 'TRAJECTORIES' With the cinematic idea that successive views give a dynamic sense of place, Mr. Flick mounted a video camera in his car window. He packs the results in grid formation on big sheets that give off the vibes of a country road, a city street, a desertscape. The whole is more than the sum of its tiny parts. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)989-7600, through June 18. (Glueck)    AMY GARTRELL: 'HOT HANDS, COLD HEART' The tribulations and infatuations of youth are the subjects of drawings, felt banners and an installation involving faceted glass charms and a lugubrious tree that would have done Edward Gorey proud. Daniel Reich, 537A West 23rd Street,(212)924-4949, through May 28. (Smith)    JAMES GOBEL: 'RIDICULE IS NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF' Fat Rococo-era fops pose on a striped floor against a background of snow-covered rocky peaks in a campy, mural-scale confection made of neatly assembled pieces of colored felt. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212)352-2238, through May 27. (Johnson)    'L.A.' A group show that reflects the sprawl and vitality of the Los Angeles art scene is also so desperately crowded that it seems superfluous, especially given the high profiles of half of the 48 artists. Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212)243-3159, through May 27. (Smith)    NEETA MADAHAR Large, handsome, eerily unreal color photographs of real birds attracted to a free-form grid of tree braches by a shifting cast of birdfeeders. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through June 11. (Smith)    RICHARD PRINCE A well-chosen assortment of works from the past 25 years by the influential Neo-Pop semiotician includes joke paintings, car hood sculptures and photographs of scruffy upstate New York landscapes. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through June 18. (Johnson)    'SCULPTURE' This judicious small selection of three dimensional works includes a rustic dream house by Vito Acconci; videos showing through an antique Asian iron gate by Nam June Paik; big, smooth white birds by Hiraki Sawa; and an amazing, life-size stainless steel tree by Roxy Paine. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through June 25. (Johnson)    QIU SHIHUA: 'INSIGHT' At first, the canvases by this painter from Shenzhen, China, look like nothing more than slightly scuffed expanses of raw fabric. Look again and you discover peaceful, luminously misty landscapes realized with amazing subtlety. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, (212)414-1169, through May 28. (Johnson) JOHN F. SIMON JR.: 'ENDLESS VICTORY' Mesmerizing, animated patterns driven by sophisticated software programs and running on laptop screens; they would make excellent screen savers. One plays inventive variations on Mondrian's ''Victory Boogie Woogie.'' Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646)336-7183, through May 28. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'GLASS, SERIOUSLY' This fine selection of artworks in glass, picked by the independent curator Lilly Wei, includes tear drops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)    * AURIE RAMIREZ A remarkable self-taught artist creates a candy-colored but complex universe (in watercolor) of androgynous dark-haired beauties who usually wear frock-coats and pinstriped pants. Her first show anywhere dovetails nicely with smaller debuts of the bristling cannibalizations texts, images and found materials by Peter Gallo and the collage drawings of an artist known only as Carter. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)924-4212, through June 11. (Smith)    Last Chance    JOSEF ALBERS/DONALD JUDD: 'STRUCTURE AND COLOR' Despite the 40-year age difference, this vivacious museum-quality show of two geometric abstractionists -- one proto-Minimalist, the other Minimalist -- is a call and response echo chamber of levitating squares and rectangles of color. Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, (212)925-4338, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    'COLLAGE: SIGNS AND SURFACES' Joseph Cornell, Romare Beardon, Jess, Robert Rauschenberg and other big names in collage history are on hand for this show of works by more than 70 artists. But many of the most intriguing works are by lesser knowns, like Arch Connelly's pearl-encrusted ''Self Portrait'' and Michael Cooper's ''16 Yellow Things,'' a gridded arrangement of a ticket stub, a Lego block and 14 other small items.

It spread a goodly amount of cheer among an audience in the Rivoli yesterday afternoon and the fact that it has in its cast Beryl Mercer and Charles McNaughton, who were in the original stage offering, is assuredly to its advantage. Spoofy, role of the shell-shocked officer, who was played in the footlights version and also in the mute screen effort by Cyril Chadwick, is acted by Claude Allister, whose comic sayings and antics afforded so much fun in the picturization of \\"Bulldog Drummond.\\"This production, which was supervised by Max Marcin, producer of the play, is a cleverly developed piece of work with competent acting in at least three of its roles. There are times when two of the characters speak their lines as though it were an effort, which is not altogether the fault of the performers, as these particular passages are too verbose.The live ghosts are Spoofy, who suffers from amnesia, which results somehow or other in his being a kleptomaniac","excerpt":"Jimmie Gubbins (Mr. McNaughton) and William Foster. The latter is an American who left his native land under a shadow and enlisted in the British forces.They refer to themselves as \\"live ghosts,\\" because they have been reported killed in action, whereas they were actually captured by the Germans and held as prisoners until just before the Armistice. To complicate matters. Mrs. Gubbins, Jimmie's bibulous step-mother, has been collecting insurance from the War Office and she insists, when Jimmie appears before her in the flesh while she is soliciting information regarding him from the spirit world, that he must \\"stay dead\\" until she has received a further instalment on the young man's insurance.Mrs. Gubbins also hears that no less than £1,000 sterling is offered for a William Foster and one can readily imagine her excitement when she realizes that the second of the \\"live ghosts,\\" is none other than Foster.Most of the fun is contributed by Mrs. Gubbins and Spoofy, who springs more than one surprise on his pals. An account in a newspaper relates how Lord Leicester's home was robbed and a baby kidnapped. Gubbins and Foster suspect Spoofy, who has been missing from the house overnight, of having a hand in the crime. Gubbins is perhaps not as astonished as the audience when Spoofy, his soiled clothes changed to a morning coat, striped trousers and a sbiny silk hat, appears pushing a baby carriage, in which there is a youngster which the shell-shocked fighter names \\"Some Lung.\\"This audible adventure clings to the play, in this instance another point in its favor. Its scenes are nicely handled and with the exception of a few uneven spots, the reproduction of the voices is quite life-life. Miss Mercer gives an excellent idea of the Cockney speech and the habits of Mrs. Gubbins. Mr. McNaughton's interpretation of an individual born within the sound of Bow Bells is restrained and natural. Mr. Allister's portrayal of the shell-shocked soldier with a vacant stare and a childish smile adds to the effect of the unfailing comedy.Thornton Freeland, the director, has made good use of the camera when, he depicts Spoofy's memory returning. One sees the giant head of Spoofy faintly and then the screen widens and war incidents appear, with Spoofy going over the top. During these Kaleidoscopic glimpses, there is always present the outline of Spoofy's countenance. Finally the screen returns to its normal size and Spoofy has regained his memory, chiefly through a blow on the head from a policeman's truncheon.Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld's imaginative short film of Tchaikovsky's \\"1812\\" is one of the other numbers on the program. This subject is accomplished with much artistry. The accompanying music was recorded during the photographing of the action, which first shows the Russians and then the French, and finally the Russians offering up thanks for Napoleon's retreat, which is followed by the strirring rhythm of the old Russian national anthem.The music is especially fine in this \\"1812.\\" but during a choral interlude there is the mistake of having figures on the screen look as if they are singing, but their lips are not synchronized with the rendition. One of the acoustical experts said that this film was the first to show a real perspective quality in its sound. THE SCREEN; The Shell-Shocked Kleptomaniac.

For the import is basically the work of Monja Danischewsky, who helped produce that hilarous alcoholic adventure, \\"Tight Little Island,\\" and Henry Cornelius, who directed that equally chucklesome antic, \\"Passport To Pimlico.\\" This time, the Messrs. Danischewsky and Cornelius, assisted by Basil Radford, whose idea they developed, have turned in a frolic that is short on loud guffaws, but which abounds in smoothly executed if restrained humor. The producer and director may not have reached heights attained previously, but they are not short-changing the customers either.It is obvious that they show a profound appreciation of anyone who has wagered an odd bob or two on a horse race. It is quite believable that Major Hill, a gentleman and an impoverished lover of the thoroughbred, now running a pet shop in a London suburb, Lamb's Green, should desperately want to own a racer. And, it is also credible that Lamb's Green's various citizens—including the dour bailiff, who has come to attach our man's holdings for an outstanding business debt—should listen to our hero's plan to form a syndicate to buy a nag. Although the syndicate's subsequent adventures are likely to strain credulity, chances are it will be fun observing those goings-on.Although the producers have allowed their tale to sag on occasion, they have had the ingenuity and good taste to come up with enough situation gags to make those moments rare. Major Hill, for instance, has his eyes set on Montana Miss—the same filly that took him out of the red—but fate sees to it that he buys Father's Folly, an aptly named but nervous gelding that isn't in the same class as Montana Miss. The syndicate of 300, most of them one-pound contributors, agree to change their charger's name to The Galloping Major and vote to enter him in Aintree's famed Grand National steeplechase when they sadly learn he can't run on the flat.There is, of course, many a slip between that entry and the race itself with Major Hill, a last-minute, overweight substitute, riding his own colors. The surprising and genuinely funny result of that meeting is best described by the announcer, who, exhausted at the end, exclaims: \\"It's the most incredible race I've seen.\\"Basil Radford gives the role of the Major the precise amounts of bewilderment, gentility and charm the part requires. A. E. Matthews steals a scene or two as a splenetic, old clubman and a leading member of the syndicate.

Mr. Watson, known as a saxophonist and composer, had big-band aspirations, not a fruitful thing to have, given jazz's generally enfeebled economic situation. The concert, often brilliant, looked as if it was set to go down in legend, a one-time event making Mr. Watson one of those rare jazz composers lucky enough to hear their music played by a large ensemble, if only for one night. With big bands seemingly relegated to the dustbin of history, the music was destined for the security of Mr. Watson's desk drawer.   But the current jazz renaissance has had all sorts of salutary effects, not the least of which is a flowering, albeit small, of interest in big-band music among both audiences and musicians.

And in \\"The Damned\\" (Les Maudits), a melodrama with pronounced psychological overtones, which began a stand at the Rialto on Saturday, director René Clement and an excellent cast microscopically dissect the oppressor and collaborator under the harrowing duress of fear of impending retribution after the end of the conflict. The view is realistic—not pretty—but the end result is a film, which except for a somewhat flamboyant finish, is a taut, wholly believable and absorbing adventure.The producers, apparently taking literally the old saw having to do with rats on a sinking ship, have set the tale moving in April of 1945 when a Nazi general, a hig-hranking gauleiter and his aide board a U-boat in a pen at Oslo. Already aboard are an Italian Fascist industrialist, his wife, who also happens to be the general's mistress, a renegade French newspaper man and a timorous Scandinavian scientist and his 'teen-aged daughter. The voyage toward South America is halted at the outset by a depth-bomb attack which wounds the industrialist's wife and necessitates surreptitiously landing in France and kidnapping a doctor. The latter, cognizant that he is not long for this world, uses the only weapon at his command, his medical knowledge, to spread a false \\"psychosis of contagion\\" among the tense members of what he terms a \\"veritable Noah's Ark.\\"The scenarists and Director Clement, realizing that \\"communal life\\" within the tight confines of a submarine would be \\"a Chinese torture,\\" focused their cameras on each fleeing bigwig in turn. And the dissolution of resistance is methodical and inevitable almost from the moment the group learns of the death of Hitler and the end of the war. It would be unjust to single any of the cast out for special mention since each performance is a tile, meaningless alone, but feying neatly into a complete mosaic.Fosco Giachetti gives a completely satisfying performance as the industrialist defeated by the turn of his fortunes and who, while knowing of his wife's infidelity, is consumed by love. Count as equally sound the portrayals turned in by Paul Bernard, as the traitorous, fawning journalist","excerpt":"Jo Dest, as the vengeful gauleiter; Henri Vidal, as the trapped medico; Hurt Kronefeld, as the tight-lipped and coldly forceful general; Florence Marly, as his mistress; Michel Auclair, as the gauleiter's subservient aide, and Dalio, as a reluctant South American agent.Director Clement, whose work, if memory serves, has not been seen here until now (his \\"La Bataille du Rail\\" is slated to be released in the near future), has kept the dialogue as brisk as the action, which has been photographed in a terse, almost documentary fashion. And though the languages used include German, some Italian and English as well as French, the language the ill-fated damned speak is eloquent enough even without the many English subtitles employed. Its small flaws notwithstanding, mark down \\"The Damned\\" as a graphic and generally exciting entertainment, which also is a sober comment on the wages of political sin.

Although I have no personal knowledge of Ms. James, her achievement as a respected film critic suggests she is not a dumb blonde (with curls) irresponsibly advocating the shallow virtues that Ms. Strong takes her to be championing.   I was one of those self-consciously serious young women who, in eager response to the bias of \\"Little Women,\\" donned too quickly the imagined, morally superior clothes that were Jo's -- only to mature and acquire the fuller understanding that moral vanity was perhaps more dangerous than personal vanity. After all, it didn't require Nietzsche to discover that the moral advantage is often claimed by those resentful of the beautiful and rich; any young woman's first serious stirrings of envy, and her attendant honest reflections, would lead to the same discovery.

Being no admirer of the orthodox dentifrice flavors, this reporter considered that both Mr. Herbert and Miss Blondell deserved to succeed with their Cocktail Toothpaste. A whisky flavor for a morning pick-me-up, a Martini flavor for the hour before dinner, and a champagne flavor at bedtime ought to help the disposition as well as the teeth. Miss Blondell thought so too, and so did her clientele. The big out-of-town buyers were, in fact, so delighted with the new product that they bought it on its own merits, and did not lose their tempers when Miss Blondell declined their invitations to dinner.Miss Blondell, you see, was really the daughter of Rufus K. Twitchell, the toothpaste king. He was so stuffy that he didn't even believe in career women. When his daughter asked him for a job he informed her, rather too harshly, that her place was at home with her mother. So Miss Blondell evolved the Cocktail Toothpaste with Mr. Herbert, an ex-bootlegger who had great difficulty remembering his own name, and they sold the idea to her father's chief rival. Then she went out on the road with the new line and proceeded to outwit William Gargan, her father's star salesman. They really liked each other a lot, but agreed that they were to be ruthless business rivals until dinner time. Mr. Gargan and the Twitchell firm got the worst of it.\\"Traveling Saleslady\\" is a lively and moderately diverting little comedy out of the stream of \\"Convention City,\\" to which it is, however, inferior. Miss Blondell and Mr. Herbert have played their respective roles so often in the past that they probably don't need to read their scripts more than once. The photoplay presents most of the familiar faces in the Warner repertory group. The inventory includes Grant Mitchell as the conservative toothpaste magnate, Ruth Donnelly as his wife, Al Shean as his enterprising rival, Glenda Farrell as a fresh dame, and Bert Roach as a half-wit salesman who seems to be three sheets in the wind even when he hasn't been within miles of the Cocktail Toothpaste samples. They are all diverting enough in a rather familiar way.

Abandoned by her mother at 9, Louise soon falls madly in love with another family's mother, then with that mother's adopted son, and remains consciously faithful to her doomed love ever after.    THE QUALITY OF LIFE REPORT, by Meghan Daum. (Viking, $24.95.) A fine comic first novel in which misguided fantasy betrays a young New York television journalist, first by sending her to the Midwest, where folks are simple and good, then by orders from New York to do a lifestyle series on the simple, good folk.

RAISING AMERICA: Experts, Parents, and a Century of Advice About Children, by Ann Hulbert. (Knopf, $27.50.) To what, exactly, has the vast body of expert opinion about child rearing amounted? Hulbert's prodigious collection of material represents it mainly as teeter-tottering between discipline and permissiveness, sometimes inside the same expert at different stages.    PERSEPOLIS, by Marjane Satrapi. (Pantheon, $17.95.) A dramatic, witty, insouciant autobiography in bold, densely rendered comic-book form by a woman born to the leftish secular bourgeoisie of 1960's Iran; she was 10 when the shah fell and his tyranny was replaced by the ayatollah version. The book ends when she is 14 and her parents put her on a plane for some safer place (she now lives in France).    GULAG: A History, by Anne Applebaum. (Doubleday, $35.) Applebaum, a columnist for The Washington Post, is one of those who think Hitler and Stalin merit the same opprobrium. Using archival material Solzhenitsyn never saw, she supports his analysis of Stalin: Lenin written larger.    GETTING MOTHER'S BODY, by Suzan-Lori Parks. (Random House, $23.95.)

THE DUST OF EMPIRE: The Race for Mastery in the Asian Heartland, by Karl E. Meyer. (Century Foundation/PublicAffairs, $26.)

THE APPRENTICE: My Life in the Kitchen, by Jacques P&#233;pin. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) This memoir by a celebrated chef recounts a culinary coming-of-age, from the hunger pangs of wartime France to the job as personal cook to Charles de Gaulle to the passage to America that would give rise to the author's unabashed partiality for Oreos, Jell-O and iceberg lettuce -- though not, dare we hope, combined.    SHADOW WITHOUT A NAME, by Ignacio Padilla. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $22.) Four first-person narrators share the work in this somber, sometimes sinister novel of 1916 and its portents in Europe: three of them are chess players, lost in a maze of history and demonic invention; the fourth seems to be the devil.    GOOD FAITH, by Jane Smiley. (Knopf, $26.) Joe Stratford, narrator and protagonist of this subtly polemical novel (it is against greed), rests reasonably content with his life as a real estate agent. It doesn't last; the prospect of big money opens before him, and a former I.R.S. agent, now some kind of wise guy, enmeshes him in unblessed doings.    WE PIERCE, by Andrew Huebner. (Simon & Schuster, $24.) Rooted in the author's family history, a novel of the 1991 gulf war follows a young Army sergeant as he gradually perfects the emotional hollowness that allows him to live with all that he has seen and done in Iraq, as well as with the exquisite awareness of his own expendability.

As I said, the gimmick is dreadful.

Considerable ingenuity is exhibited by this allegorical fantasy, about Adam and Eve, but the light touch that would bring out its sparkle seldom shows through on the screen of the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse.Perhaps a simpler approach, with more satirical bite, is needed. But while the script is wanting, the scenic designs which represent Heaven, Hell and post-war Berlin have a certain imaginative appeal. The acting is good, too, especially so in the case of Bobby Todd, as a wealthy manufacturer—his product is Adam's Apple Cider—who is greatly distressed because he cannot work out a way to live happily with his wife and his mistress.The struggle that has raged between Heaven and Hell for the possession of man since Lucifer sent an emissary snaking into Paradise to tempt Adam into plucking the proscribed apple is visualized by the manufacturer in terms of his own problem during a dream. As he sees it, the heavenly forces were quite confused about how to keep Adam happy since he remained bored even after Eve had been created to keep him company. In fact, Eve is somewhat indifferent about the whole business herself, but, rather than give Adam up entirely, would share him with Lilith after the descent from grace into confused jumble that is earth.Heaven is represented as a vaporous domain where people buzz about aimlessly, sounding sometimes like dive bombers. The Garden of Eden is a dull, barbed wire enclosure floating between earth and heaven. Hell is a noisy, smoke-filled night club where Lucifer presides as a genial headwaiter up to the point when Adam attempts to flee without paying his bill. The contention of the film is that the \\"opening\\" of earth was premature. The heavenly major domo, Mr. Peter, was still trying to cement a crack in the big globe and was not quite ready to send Adam there, but had no choice after the first man had defiled Paradise by taking up with Lilith. Presumably this could have been a happier planet if Adam had not been so impatient.With all the effort that was put into \\"The Original Sin\\" it is a shame that it doesn't come off better. Germanic humor still is a bit heavy for this sort of spoofing. Some of the English dialogue translations by Herman G. Weinberg show a sense of rhyme and humor, however. Mr. Todd is slyly amusing as the meek Adam and good performances are given by Bettina Moissi, as Eve","excerpt":"Joan Maria Gorvin, as Lilith; Arno Assmann, as Lucifer, and Helmut Kautner, who, besides playing Mr. Peter, also directed \\"The Original Sin.\\" Commentary on Woes of Man"},{"year":"1950","title":"MOUNT KISCO, N.

Picasso encouraged him. When Miro felt discouraged by the public response to his art, his older compatriot advised: 'Pretend you're waiting for the subway. You have to get in line. Wait your turn, after all.\\" Around 1924, when Miro discovered his own formal language, Picasso told him that he was the only artist after Picasso himself to have carried painting forward.

For in \\"Thelma Jordon,\\" which came to the Paramount yesterday, these amours, which involve a basically fine family man and the designing dame he can't resist, seem to have stumped the experts who made the picture. \\"Thelma Jordon\\" is, for all of its production polish, adult dialogue and intelligent acting, a strangely halting and sometimes confusing work. And, though it is concerned with emotions, great emotional impact is not one of its shining attributes.Under Robert Siodmak's direction, the pace of this romantic melodrama is generally slow and generates some speed toward a climax which is not too startling. His principals, however, are carefully limned. Thelma Jordon, a shadowy figure at first, who seems to have fallen in love with Cleve Marshall, an assistant district attorney, emerges as a unique plotter who has used him as an unwitting tool so as to kill her aunt for that lady's fortune. Marshall, on the other hand, is not a playboy but a sensitive husband and father fed up with his in-laws, whose extra-curricular attachment is genuine and a torture. Not nearly as convincing is his willingness to risk his career as the prosecutor who throws the murder case against her.As the ill-fated schemer who finally succumbs by actually losing her heart to the D. A., Barbara Stanwyck is handling a complex assignment professionally and with a minimum of forced histrionics. Wendell Corey, as the tormented lover for whom she destroys both herself and her paramour, is a taut and understandably harried man who knows \\"you can't divorce children\\" but whom nevertheless, is driven toward his dilemma.Richard Rober, as Miss Stanwyck's conniving sidekick","excerpt":"Joan Tetzel, as Corey's rejected wife; Paul Kelly, as a resolute investigator, and Stanley Ridges, as the wily defense attorney, contribute sturdy supporting portrayals.
