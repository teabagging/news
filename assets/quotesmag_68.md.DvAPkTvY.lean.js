The Museum print department has already purchased several of the prints, according to the gallery's director, Sylvan Cole. AAA gallery is open Monday through Saturday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.

Pabst, the Austrian-born director who is best known for his work with Louise Brooks (\\"Pandora's Box,\\" \\"Diary of a Lost Girl\\") and least well known for those films he made under the auspices of the Third Reich. This documentary by Johanna Heer and Werner Schmiedel pays particular attention to the latter chapter in Pabst's life, and to the connections between an artist's work and the political climate in which it is engendered.    Interviewing an assortment of film scholars and first-hand observers of Pabst's work, the film makers assemble a meandering but often illuminating portrait. Among those providing details of Pabst's history are Anne Friedberg of the University of California, who discusses the director's collaboration with Sigmund Freud in the 1920's on \\"Secrets of a Soul,\\" a film that attempted to dramatize the process of Freudian analysis and included some remarkable dream sequences, which are glimpsed here briefly in film clips. Ms. Friedberg, in one of the film's many interesting digressions, also mentions an attempted collaboration between Freud and Samuel Goldwyn that would surely have been bizarre had it come to pass.
