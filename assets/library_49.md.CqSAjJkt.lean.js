Congress is now considering renewal of those same price control and allocation authorities for use during oil supply disruptions.   The driving force behind this new legislation is a belief that markets cannot be trusted during periods of short supply, and that during these times market functions should be turned over to a Federal agency.   There is an alternative: Let market forces set prices and distribute oil supplies, and recycle the resulting increased windfall profits tax revenues to provide financial protection for individuals and essential public services. Unfortunately debate comparing these two alternatives has been confused by several misconceptions:   Misconception No. 1: Markets have not worked well during disruptions.  Proponents of this view tell of state governors riding on oil trucks to direct diesel fuel to their farmers, or flying to Washington to get more gasoline for their states from Federal bureaucrats. But these stories only underscore the inadequacy of Federal controls. Price controls and allocation plans were in place, inhibiting normal market operations, before the Arab oil embargo and Iranian revolution.

Malawi derives its name from the Maravi, a Bantu people who settled in the region in the 13th century and whose descendants, the Chewas, make up a significant segment of the current population. In the 1830's, the Ngoni, driven from what is now South Africa by the Zulus, arrived in the area around Lake Nyasa. The arrival of the Scottish missionary David Livingstone in 1859 led to the establishment of the British-controlled Nyasaland Protectorate in 1891. In 1953 Nyasaland formed a federation with Northern and Southern Rhodesia (Zambia and Zimbabwe) and began to organize an independence movement. The fight for independence was led by Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda, an expatriate who assumed the presidency of the Nyasaland African Congress, later the Malawi Congress party, upon his return in 1958. The British granted Nyasaland self-governing status in 1962, and Banda was elected prime minister the following year. Malawi achieved full independence under its present name in 1964. Banda soon introduced one-party rule and had himself declared president for life in 1971. All dissent was crushed while corruption and nepotism strangled the economy, leaving Malawi's citizens among the poorest in the world. By 1990 internal unrest and the decline of Banda's popularity (he was now in his 90's) rapidly led to change. In 1992 a series of violent strikes by workers in the two largest cities resulted in more than 35 deaths. The United States, Great Britain, and Germany, hoping to push the Banda government to institute democratic reforms, cut off most of the $500 million they had been giving annually in aid. In June 1993 Malawians voted 2 to 1 to institute a multiparty system and in May 1994 Banda lost his nation's only free election in 30 years to Bakili Muluzi's United Democratic Front (UDF). In December 1995, Banda was acquitted of conspiring to murder four of his political rivals in 1983.

We prefer to stay at farms, like the ones mentioned here, that are part of the Gites de France, an organization sponsored by the French Government, because the quality is consistently high.\\nLa Riviere \\n\\nLike an ancient encampment, La Riviere sits in a hollow. In winter, the fields behind it are flooded by the Aure River, which turns them into a lake six feet deep. In spring they are marshy, home to dozens of birds that sing day and night.\\n\\nThe Maries decided to turn their farm into a place that takes paying guests 10 years ago. They got rid of their dairy cattle, kept enough pigs and sheep for their own use, and turned to raising grain for profit. They fixed up four bedrooms, added bathrooms and hung out their sign.\\n\\nThe rooms are simple and refreshing, furnished with old farm furniture. The linens and towels dry on a line in the backyard and are crisp and fragrant, and long windows open to let in the soft air.\\n\\nGuests have access to rooms through the front door and up an impressive stone stairway enclosed in a tower. A room on the third floor offers a tableau of the courtyard with its pecking chickens and gorgeous rose garden.\\n\\nUntil this year, Mrs. Marie offered a set menu, posted outside by the front door, for passers-by. Now she serves meals only to guests staying on the farm, and the meals are different each day.\\n\\n\\"Once we had a family stay 18 days. I fixed something different for them every day. Once you've got it here,\\" she said, tapping her head, \\"It's not hard to get it ready.\\"\\n\\nHer specialties are rich with local cream and butter. Among them are meaty farmyard chickens simmered in cider","excerpt":"lamb chops braised with fresh garden carrots and onions; crepes dusted with sugar; garlicky pork pate; pork chops grilled in the fireplace; potatoes smothered in seasoned cream. They are full of flavor, well prepared and abundant.\\n\\nBy 8 P.M. the five highly polished old farm tables in the dining room at La Riviere were full. Mr. Marie offered either homemade pork pate or home-smoked ham with tomatoes as a first course. The main course was chicken in cider, poulet pays d'Auge. The salad of tender butter lettuce was from the garden, as were the shallots that seasoned it. The cheese tray, which went from table to table, included Camembert, Pont-l'Eveque and Livarot, all Normandy cheeses. Apples come from a neighbor, and for tarte Normande, Mrs. Marie's favorite dessert, they were folded in a buttery custard batter.\\n\\nBy midmeal all 12 dinner guests were sharing conversation, along with Mr. Marie, who regaled us with tales of the farm, where his family first moved in 1954. As guests lingered near the fire, he announced that he'd thrown some bales of straw in the furnace to warm the bedrooms. \\"We heat with straw here,\\" he said. \\"It's economical and it's ecological.\\"\\n\\nAs is usual on farms, breakfast is served beginning around 8:30, to give farmers time to do their chores beforehand. It varies little from farm to farm -- generally good, crusty bread, sometimes a croissant, usually homemade jam, always butter, and an endless pot of rich black coffee. On a dairy farm there is always fresh milk.\\n\\nAfter breakfast at La Riviere, the marsh is ideal for bird watchers, and the small dirt roads that surround the fields offer gentle country walks. \\nLe Loucel \\n\\nAt Le Loucel, a farm just feet from Omaha Beach in the village of Colleville-sur-Mer, we had a view of the English Channel from our bathroom window. We had chosen Le Loucel for its proximity to the beaches but were dismayed by the commercial sign outside announcing a television set in every room. We were quickly reassured, however, when shown our lodgings. Carefully restored by Bernard Petit, the farmer and owner, the room was light and airy, furnished with antiques and decorated with fragrant garden flowers. Outside the tall, deep-seated windows was a backyard with a swing set, lilacs in bloom and a large kitchen garden.\\n\\nWe had to walk through the barnyard to get to the backyard, and there bumped into Mrs. Petit, who was feeding rabbits. We heard a clatter from the dilapidated barn and Mr. Petit poked out his head. \\"Just one of the cows kicking over a bucket,\\" he said. \\"Nothing to worry about.\\"\\n\\nMr. Petit restored the charming dining room, which has an old, wavy stone floor and an enormous fireplace, as well as an adjoining room. He is both waiter and host, and Mrs. Petit is the chef. They offer two set menus of regional specialties, as well as crepes a la carte. All the dairy products, including a pot of butter set on the table, come from their 10 dairy cattle; pigs, chickens and rabbits are also raised on the farm.\\n\\nSpecialties include pate, served in the terrine it is cooked in; a golden tarte rich with Camembert, Livarot and Pont-l'E veque; roast duck with a heap of country french fries, and delicate crepes filled with everything from smoked ham to melted chocolate.\\n\\nPerhaps the best thing on the menu is the tergoule, which arrives at the tablein a bowl the size of a wash basin. A specialty of the tiny area that stretches from St.-Lo to the western border of Caen, it is like a rich and creamy rice pudding. Ingredients are simple, just milk, rice, sugar and cinnamon. The secret is in the long (six hours), slow cooking. \\n\\nLe Loucel charges extra for breakfast, which is unusual. We lingered over it the next morning, enjoying the light farm commerce. People came to buy fresh milk, cream, cheese and bottles of hard apple cider. Others stopped to read the menu. Most made reservations to return.\\nLa Rosiere \\n\\nBrigitte Etienne and her husband, Roland, live on a 14th-century farm inherited from Mr. Etienne's parents. There they raise 50 dairy cattle, the grains to feed them, and enough poultry for themselves and guests. They've also created a small industry with five bedrooms to rent, a crepe stand open in summer where Mrs. Etienne makes and sells crepes, and two small houses they rent by the week.\\n\\nBrought up on a farm less than two miles from where she now lives, Mrs. Etienne works with her husband on the farm in winter and in summer she becomes chef and hostess, which suits her well. She immediately puts guests at ease, takes the time to talk and laugh, and prepares food that makes you want a permanent reservation.\\n\\nThe Etiennes decided to open their house to guests seven years ago, when they realized that they needed to augment their income to keep the farm. Mr. Etienne set about fixing up bedrooms in the house and adjoining barns. Mrs. Etienne pulled out her old recipes and they opened their doors.\\n\\nThey occasionally eat with guests, but most often eat in the kitchen with their children. Mrs. Etienne pops in and out of the dining room to serve and talk to guests. Mr. Etienne pokes his head in, sometimes has a drink, is easily engaged in conversation, particularly if it touches on agriculture or politics.\\n\\nThe Etiennes' farm was built in a square, with the house on one side, the farm buildings all around. It was completely enclosed at one time, though much of the wall on the roadside has crumbled with time, offering a misty view of the rolling valley beyond.\\n\\nThe farmyard is a happy clutter, with stacks of building materials here and there, old barbecues -- put to use during the summer -- bits of rusted machinery half-tucked in one barn, huge tractors parked in another. The rooms are spacious and furnished with an assortment of new and old furniture. Several have small kitchens. A television set is available in the main room.\\n\\nGuests are right in the midst of farm life at the Etiennes'. They can watch the cows being milked, even watch one being born if that's on the schedule. Country roads offer ample opportunity for walks.\\n\\nChildren are welcome, and the Etiennes accommodate them with a big sand pile out front, surrounded by toys. They make any concession necessary, from arranging a special bed, to pulling a high chair up to the table. If a child doesn't sleep in the bed she offers, Mrs. Etienne doesn't charge for the child's stay. In the common sitting room, comfortably furnished with big old chairs and a sofa, books are piled everywhere, for children and adults.\\n\\nMrs. Etienne takes pride in her meals, adding little extras like a kir royale (champagne and creme de cassis) before dinner, and two desserts, such as marbled poundcake and freshly made chocolate mousse. Her huge, golden bacon-and-potato omelet drizzled with fresh cream was a triumph. She brought three to the table, and was eager to make a fourth. \\"It doesn't take me any time to break eggs, you know,\\" she said. At the Etiennes' the spirit of generosity is such that it is hard to imagine where the profit arises. \\n\\nGuests wander off to their rooms by 11. By 8 A.M. Mrs. Etienne is at work again, the table set with huge bowls for breakfast coffee, baskets of bread, slabs of butter and homemade jams. Guests prolong their leave-taking, chatting with Mrs. Etienne. It's clear they want to stay, clear she'd be glad to have them.\\nLa Suhardiere \\n\\nAbout 20 minutes west of Caen, at La Suhardiere, guests are greeted and shown to their rooms by Francoise Petiton. If the sun is out she'll offer bicycles or the use of a fishing pole for the pond that her husband, Alain, created. If there's an experienced rider in the group, the family's horse is available, but with a warning that she needs a strong hand.\\n\\nThe Petitons also have dairy cattle, and they welcome visitors' help bringing them in for milking, a trip through fields and across the drive to a barn built above the house.\\n\\nThe Petitons bought their farm in 1976, after Mr. Petiton's family had worked it for a generation. It was built in 1714, and they've restored and furnished it with beautiful antiques. Two of their three guest bedrooms are upstairs and look over the courtyard. The third, a bit hurriedly put together, was once a barn and now resembles a small apartment, complete with kitchen.\\n\\nThe house faces the fish pond and rolling hills pockmarked with huge craters from bombs dropped during World War II. \\"My parents left it then,\\" Mr. Petiton said. \\"They returned when the war was over.\\"\\n\\nThough they work hard, the Petitons have relaxed natures, particularly in summer when the cows are out to pasture and the farm work decreases. Mr. Petiton spends a great deal of time working in fields scattered within a six-mile radius of the farm. He milks the cows around 6:30 P.M. so that by 7:30, he's ready to sit down with the guests. Their 11-year-old son, Laurent, also joins guests at meals.\\n\\nMrs. Petiton admits she isn't a born cook, but she takes meals seriously, spending hours in the kitchen. The Petitons raise calves and chickens and have a large vegetable garden. Mrs. Petiton buys other ingredients to keep the menu varied, such as the salmon she poached and served with a delicate mayonnaise and beautifully carved tomatoes. Their veal is subtle and tender, and she serves it bathed in cream. Her fruit tarts are legendary.\\n\\nMrs. Petiton stands near the table, sharing local gossip, listening to what her guests have done during the day. She never sits down for an evening meal. \\"Do you realize what I would look like if I ate a meal like this every day?\\"\\nIf you go \\nThe Basics\\n\\n Most farmers who offer guest rooms do so because extra income helps them keep their farms. Rooms are private and clean, but they are not luxurious. Most have bathrooms, but soap is not always provided and towels are small. Tables are generally communal, meals served within limited hours. But the rewards are many, because you get behind the beauty of hedgerows, inside lovely old houses, under a thatched roof and near a cozy fireplace. \\n There are two types of farm to stay on. Fermes-auberges are primarily restaurants, offering meals prepared with ingredients raised on the farm, and occasionally rooms. Tables-d'hotes or chambres-d'hotes (which aren't always on farms) offer rooms with breakfast and often an evening meal. Rooms vary from about $30 to $45 a night with breakfast. Meals are usually less than $20 a person, with drinks.\\n \\"French Country Welcome,\\" a guide to farms that take guests, can be obtained from the Federation National des Gites de France, 35 Rue Godot de Mauroy, 75009 Paris, telephone (English-speaking clerks) 49.70.75.75, for $22 by mail, $19 on the spot. The dialing code for Paris is 33-1.\\nWhere to Stay \\n La Ferme de la Riviere (Paulette and Herve Marie), 14230 St.-Germain-du-Pert; 31.22.72.92. Take the autoroute from Paris, then the N13, direction Cherbourg. When it turns into a two-lane road, go toward La Combe, then turn left on the D113. Go straight to the first intersection and take the D124. The farm is on the left, with a small sign hanging out front. A double room is $40 a night with breakfast, calculated at 4.9 francs to the dollar; the evening meal is $17, cider included. La Riviere is open from April 1 to Nov. 1.\\n La Ferme du Loucel, (Bernard and Paulette Petit), 14710 Colleville-sur-Mer; 31.22.40.95. From Bayeux, follow the signs for Port en Bessin, then for Grand Caen, then for the American Cemetery. Rooms are $47 a night. Menus are $16 and $28 without wine; crepes are about $7.75. Breakfast is $5 a person. Easter through October.\\n La Rosiere (Brigitte and Roland Etienne), 14117 Tracy-sur-Mer; 31.22.33.88. From Bayeux take the D16 toward Arromanches. The farm is just over three and a half miles on the left. Double rooms are $30.35 with breakfast, and there are rooms with a private kitchen for $40; meals are $14 each, with apple cider. Open from April 1 to Nov. 1.\\n La Suhardiere (Francoise and Alain Petiton), 14240 Livry; 31.77.51.02. Take the D9 from Caen, direction Caumont-l'Evente. The farm is on the left just before Caumont. Don't confuse it with the farm right before it, which has a huge sign announcing trout fishing. A room for two with breakfast is $43; dinner is $22 each, with wine or cider. Open all year.

''Sweet Will,'' a musical revue whose text is based entirely on Shakespeare, is the composer's follow-up to his 1981 show, ''Shakespeare's Cabaret,'' which won a Tony nomination for best musical score. Though the new show further reveals Mr. Mulcahy to be a versatile, melodically inventive composer, his marriage of Elizabethan poetry and contemporary pop, is an awkward mismatch. ''Sweet Will,'' which opened Sunday at the New Silver Lining Theater (349 West 46th Street), sets lyrics from 11 Shakespearean plays, including four songs from ''The Tempest,'' three from ''Twelfth Night'' and two each from ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and ''As You Like It.'' The 80-minute, two-act show also includes an adaptation of Shakespeare's early narrative poem, ''Venus and Adonis'' and musical settings of seven sonnets. Mr. Mulcahy's stylistic range encompasses delicate folk-pop (''Where the Bee Sucks''), Fats Waller-influenced pop-jazz (''All That Glisters''), Chopinesque ballads (''Take, Oh Take Those Lips Away''), country music (''O Mistress Mine'') and reggae (''Hey, Ho, the Wind and the Rain''). A cast of four actor-singers, including the pop-soul vocalists Keith Amos and Rosalyn Burrough, the tenor Stephen Lehew and the soprano Stephanie Cotsirilos, have strong enough voices to be able to sing without microphones, and Michael Ward's ingenious arrangements weave electric and acoustic keyboards, guitar and percussion into settings that scale contemporary pop sounds down in volume to Elizabethan proportions.

MENAPACE   In a city where such civic treasures as the Woolworth Building and Rockefeller Center are not official landmarks, and where the Landmarks Preservation Commission is constantly deluged with letters urging the designation of other significant sites, it is hard to accept the premise that the commission is overstepping its bounds.  Yet that is the shrill alarm that Bernard Richland is sounding.   Is the commission on a ''binge''? The facts suggest the opposite.  In each of the fiscal years 1980 and 1981, the Landmarks Commission designated 40 landmark sites, ranging from individual buildings to historic districts. To date, there are only 670 individual landmarks in the city, 42 historic districts, 28 interior landmarks and eight scenic landmarks. If this is empire building, the commission has a long way to go.
