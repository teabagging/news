At the Bogmen's sold-out concert on Friday night at Irving Plaza, the audience was too busy dancing, jumping up and down and crowd-surfing to think twice about what Bill Campion was singing. Songs from the Bogmen's album, \\"Life Begins at 40 Million\\"  (Arista), mourned a mother's death, imagined global warming, faced a manipulative psychiatrist, attacked a self-righteous hypocrite and confronted a  girlfriend who walked out when the singer lost his job. \\"You've got nothing nice to say, so spit it all out,\\" Mr. Campion proclaimed.         His voice could sound frazzled and exasperated; it also rose to mock-heroic,  high-vibrato choruses. Onstage he was exuberantly disheveled; at one point, he twirled around, then toppled. But as he bounded around, his energy came through  more clearly than his sarcasm.

Contest in Heavy Blow"},{"year":"1992","title":"Mzwakhe Mbuli has three assets that more agitprop poets could use: an imposing bass voice, the agility to dance with head-high kicks and the backing of a superb band, the Equals. Mr. Mbuli, who is from South Africa, denounces apartheid, and he calls for resistance and black unity. At S.O.B.'s on Wednesday night, his serious messages took flight on the Equals' catchy guitar lines and lickety-split polyrhythms.   Mr. Mbuli's words praise heroes (from Marcus Garvey to Nelson Mandela to Gandhi), mourn the dead and warn that South Africa could turn into a battleground like Yugoslavia. Behind them, the band plays bouncy mbaqanga, adding its own kinds of three-against-two syncopations and melodic twists. The Equals' guitarist, Floyd Manana, peals out one supple line after another, sometimes with the clicking crispness of mbaqanga, sometimes with a jazzy elasticity. In a typical song, Mr. Mbuli might harmonize an unaccompanied introduction with the Equals' two female backup singers, recite while the band vamps, play conga drums in pattering cross-rhythms, share an exuberant dance with the women and sing a tuneful chorus.

But at the Lone Star Roadhouse, the legendary New Rhythm and Blues Quartet was fashioning a different kind of cultural canon.   The N.R.B. Q. was post-modern when post-modern wasn't cool. The band started mixing up its roots music referents more than 20 years ago, when it started out on a touring circuit that would make it one of the nation's most beloved live bands. Tuesday night's show was packed with revelers familiar with the patented N.R.B.Q. method of shifting between pop genres until everyone in the room grows dizzy with delights, and the band delivered a set that satisfied all comers.

A tribute to the percussionist Tito Puente, the concert at its best had an expansive quality. Mr. Faddis, improvising with the arrangements and the instrumentation, created full-blown, distinct pieces that hadn't existed before. By pulling together a collection of riffs and vamps, and calling on soloists to improvise and compete against each other, he created something that had suspense.   The concert, the third in Carnegie Hall's jazz series, moved around a bit to build a historical narrative, linking Mr. Puente's extraordinary early orchestrations with pieces by another Latin-jazz pioneer, the trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. Mr. Puente's music, rife with elements of the more advanced be-bop composers and the rhythmic drive of Afro-Cuban music, merged perfectly with Mr. Gillespie's own Latin-influenced pieces, including \\"Manteca\\" and \\"Woody 'n' You.\\" The historical connection was there and easy to see.

The soldiers get off, gay and joking, because they haven't yet discovered that war—especially this war in Russia—is to be a gruesome calamity. They move forward on foot to a village, where they see a large group of peasants herded together under the menacing guns of German guards.Mainly to tease his truculent sergeant, one of the good-natured Italian soldiers starts to play \\"The Internationale\\" on his harmonica, whereupon a German orders the Russians to sing, obviously to humiliate them. When the Russians refuse, the Germans threaten to kill them, much to the horror of the Italians.Then a strong and stalwart Russian stands up and starts to sing, and all the others join him. It is a rousing, defiant demonstration, and the Italians are much impressed by it. They offer the Russians bread, but the Germans try to stop this. Whereupon a fight ensues — between an Italian soldier and a German.That's the sort of picture it is: the Italians and the Russians are the heroes, the Germans are the brutes. The Italian Blackshirts are also villains when they come in later on. This élite corps, under a snarling commander, is composed of bullies, rapists and cowards.While there are some affecting incidents in this bulging panorama of the war that the nice Italians were involved in on the eastern front in the terrible winter of 1942-43—a poignant incident, for instance, in which a gentle Italian lad is killed in a great wide field of sunflowers while trying to aid a hysterical Russian girl—the disquieting impression of the whole thing is that of a propaganda film carefully arranged and slanted to extol Italian and Russian amity.The circumstances of its production indicate this intent. It was co-produced by Italian and Russian companies (with some American financing), it was photographed on locations in the Ukraine and at the Mosfilm studios in Moscow and it was directed by an Italian, Giuseppe de Santis, best known for his direction of \\"Bitter Rice.\\"Furthermore, it is cunningly acted by Italians and Russians, aided by a couple of familiar Americans dragged in from left field. One of them, Arthur Kennedy, plays the snarling commander of the Blackshirts, and you never saw such a villainous type. He is a tense and dyspeptic veteran of Mussolini's famous march on Rome, and he wears in artificial left hand, which turns out to be a fake. The only intriguing thing about him is that he looks a little bit like Lenin. Somebody—not Mr. Kennedy—must have taught the dickens for this.The other American actor in this international cast is Peter Falk. He plays an Italian medical officer, the son of a rich Neapolitan, who goes on a mission of mercy to aid a wounded Russian partisan and is killed by the Germans. Mr. Falk is implausible.Most conspicuous among the Italian actors is Raffaele Pisu as the soldier who plays the harmonica and goes on through the campaign to the frigid and dismal end","excerpt":"Riccardo Cucciolla as his buddy; Andrea Checchi as a brave, humane colonel and Nino Vingelli as the sergeant who is a universal topkick stereotype.Grigori Mikhailov is a specimen Volga Boatman as the brave Russian who gets up to sing and later is executed as a hostage when Mr. Falk does not return. Lev Prygunov (apparently a Russian) is the Italian lad who tries to aid the girl, and Shanna Prokhorenko, who played the lass in \\"Ballad of a Soldier,\\" is the girl he so sadly assists.Here and there, the direction of Mr. de Santis has reality and vitality, but for the most part it is lurid and in the theatrical style of fake war films. The dialogue is a babble of Italian, Russian and German, postsynchronized. But it is all straightened out in slangy English subtitles.

Women's lives are controlled by men. When the Werelians export their rigid plantation system to the colony world of Yeowe, the assets eventually rebel. To the astonishment of Werel's hereditary warrior class, the rebels overcome their oppressors, with  the indirect assistance of the Ekumen, a federation of civilized worlds that figures in much of Ms. Le Guin's science fiction.         It is not hard to discern in the entwined histories of Werel and Yeowe echoes of South Africa, Vietnam, Ireland, 19th-century Hawaii, the antebellum South and so on. But these echoes never become intrusive because, for all her interest in  the ways that societies evolve, Ms. Le Guin always homes in on individuals and the roles they play, by choice or not, in the great events of history. Characteristically, she chronicles the rebellion on Yeowe only in flashbacks. The first of the four novellas in this book is set in a remote village on Yeowe  where a freedwoman named Yoss has come to \\"make\\" her soul, according to the precepts of her religion, in preparation for death.

There can be a great deal of artistry in street-dancing, or hip-hop.

Meanwhile, the premises are crawling with a crooked policeman, Mr. Truscott (\\"You surround the property,\\" he says to his men. \\"I'll surround the house\\"), disguised as a member of the Metropolitan Water Board.Everything goes so systematically wrong that there has to be a happy ending for just about everybody but Mr. McLeavy, the very dumb, Roman Catholic innocent who may, just possibly, be the only character in the script with whom Mr. Orton was unsympathetic. \\"I've raised a ghoul at my own expense!\\" he cries when he learns Hal has been tampering with Mum's corpse.At another point, the mourning husband demands to be able to open his wife's coffin. \\"She's my wife. I can do what I like with her.\\" Says the shocked policeman, who is about to divide the bank loot with Hal, Dennis and Fay: \\"Indeed not, sir. Conjugal rights should stop with the last heart beat!\\"I quote this dialogue at some length because there are still enough examples of Mr. Orton's displacements of conventional attitudes to make the movie \\"Loot\\" quite funny. However, Silvio Narizzano, the director, in making a movie out of the one-set play has not simply opened it up, he has also put it on the rack.He has stretched it out with no great imagination, not only by showing us all of the action that takes place outside the hotel, but by making a movie, that is, by cross-cutting between scenes of simultaneous action and by breaking up individual scenes into close-ups, medium shots and long shots.

But it was a cooking lesson, not a language class. The instructor, Antoine Bouterin, is the chef at Le Perigord restaurant on East 52d Street.

FOOD NOTES"},{"year":"2005","title":"Acting families don't get much more royal than the Redgraves and the Burtons. On Broadway alone, five members of the Redgrave clan and two Burtons have received a total of 13 Tony Award nominations and won 4 times. (That's one fewer nomination than Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy amassed between them, but some of the Redgraves and Burtons based their stage careers in Britain. And if you're going to include spouses, then you have to throw in the 10 nominations for Natasha Richardson's husband and former husband, Liam Neeson and the producer Robert Fox, and one for Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton's twice-former wife.) There is currently a Redgrave-Burton convergence on New York stages, with Lynn Redgrave and Kate Burton appearing in ''The Constant Wife,'' Vanessa Redgrave in ''Hecuba'' and Natasha Richardson in ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' But it's not by any means the first time these two clans have crossed paths. Here's a short guide to intra- and interfamilial projects over the years.    1951: Michael Redgrave and Richard Burton play Hotspur and Prince Hal, respectively, in a legendary cycle of Shakespeare's histories at Stratford-on-Avon.    1958: Richard Burton stars in two TV adaptations of plays by John Osborne, ''Look Back in Anger'' in 1958 and ''A Subject of Scandal and Concern'' two years later. Both are directed by Tony Richardson, who would marry Michael Redgrave's daughter Vanessa in 1962.    1963: Michael Redgrave inaugurates the National Theater Company in London by playing Claudius in ''Hamlet.'' His daughter Lynn plays a lady-in-waiting.    1967: Vanessa Redgrave plays Guenevere in the film of the Lerner and Loewe musical ''Camelot''","excerpt":"Richard Burton created the role of King Arthur on Broadway in 1960, but Richard Harris takes the role in the film. (Vanessa's daughter Natasha Richardson has been suggested as Guenevere for a rumored Broadway revival of ''Camelot,'' opposite her husband, Mr. Neeson.)    1983-84: The families cross paths in two 1980's mini-series. In ''Wagner,'' Richard Burton and Vanessa Redgrave star as husband and wife. Richard Burton's final role comes the following year in ''Ellis Island,'' in which he stars opposite his daughter, the young Broadway actress Kate Burton, and Natasha Richardson (as a Russian prostitute).    1993: Lynn Redgrave presents ''Shakespeare for My Father,'' an evening of verse and family reminiscences, 30 years after father and daughter appeared together in ''Hamlet.'' Looming over the set is a large portrait of Michael Redgrave as Marc Antony. The play runs for nine months on Broadway, earning her a best actress Tony nomination -- and putting her in competition with her niece Natasha Richardson, who is nominated for ''Anna Christie.'' They lose to Madeline Kahn (''The Sisters Rosensweig'').    2005: A Redgrave and a Burton share the stage for the first time in 54 years. This time it's Lynn Redgrave and Kate Burton as mother and daughter in the Roundabout Theater Company revival of Somerset Maugham's ''Constant Wife,'' now playing at the American Airlines Theater. As it happens, the Roundabout is also employing Lynn's niece, Natasha Richardson, in ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' while Vanessa Redgrave stars in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of ''Hecuba'' just across the river, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, through June 26.    2006: Lynn Redgrave is scheduled to play Lady Bracknell in ''The Importance of Being Earnest'' at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles.

The 47-year-old, a fixture on the American musical scene since his first New York recital in 1961, took to the hallowed stage on Monday evening as part of the hall's Keyboard Virtuosos series. In a perfect world, all debutants would be so well prepared, musically and technically.   Mr. Goode, his mane now prematurely silver, is anything but a gray performer. He commands, in fact, a wider spectrum of tone color than any pianist of his generation whose name comes quickly to mind. In that, at least, his current international success has left him unchanged. Unchanged also is his ability to lose himself in the music at hand. Those who remember him as one of the founding members of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center two decades ago can be assured that the quicksilver temperament and total immersion in the score that distinguished his playing then continue in force. The passing years have brought some changes, however: Mr. Goode has become less Dalcrozian in his keyboard manner, which at one time rivaled Glenn Gould's in eurythmic quirkiness.

For \\"Operation X,\\" the new variant of the book produced and directed in England and Italy by Gregory Ratoff, with Edward G. Robinson in the stellar role, is superficial drama couched in florid phrases. Although Mr. Ratoff is dealing with a man whose vision it is to rule the world through the monopoly of a strange, anonymous mineral, the script and cast are less than majestic.They are, in effect, merely play actors who do quite a bit of talking in some pretty fancy settings. What they are saying, once some of the sweeping statements are pigeonholed, is that Mr. Robinson, a legendary financial wizard who rose from blacking boots in Constantinople to top dog in the cartel field, is a man thirsting for greater power. He is also a lonely man whose other great love is his beautiful daughter, whom he wants to join in marriage with the son of the African potentate supposedly wealthy in lands containing mysterious mineral deposits.But his daughter, on whom he has lavished affection and such trinkets as cars and white mink coats, has found her own true love. So, his wife, a patient helpmeet whom he has ignored through the years and a spouse desperate to insure her daughter's happiness, reveals that the daughter is not the tycoon's but the daughter of another man.As the husband, shocked by this revelation into an insanity that has him still working on \\"Operation X\\" but unable to recognize his family, Edward G. Robinson gives the film's solitary rounded performance. He is a restrained schemer whose dreams of \\"mastery of the world\\" seem ominously real. Not so, Peggy Cummins, as the blonde light of his life, who looks like his idea of a \\"fairy princess\\" but whose characterization is strictly mundane. Nora Swinburne, as his wife","excerpt":"Richard Greene as the journalist with whom Peggy Cummins falls in love, and Gregory Ratoff, who also is featured in the production as Mr. Robinson's fumbling retainer from 'way back, are adequate in other featured roles.The backgrounds Mr. Ratoff has chosen, particularly a villa facing the sea at St. Remo, are sumptuous and eye-catching. But his script is less than impressive. And, Mr. Ratoff must be listed as a man who is willing to give all to his calling.

Hastings's severed, silver-haired head, unceremoniously dumped into a red fire bucket, is soon set before Mr. McKellen, who idly pokes a worming finger into its bloody muck as if he were searching its orifices for buried treasure or, worse, private pleasure.   What exactly Richard hopes to find in Hastings's head remains a mystery perhaps best left unsolved, but that strange, ghoulishly funny bit of business is typical of Mr. McKellen's uninhibited approach to the Shakespearean villain the 20th century has long since sadly recognized as its own. Without relinquishing any of the evil in the part, the actor finds some of the malicious humor in Richard that Brecht and Chaplin once found in Hitler.

The film opened yesterday at the Kips Bay Theater.The text is lucid, the meaning is clear and the backgrounds authentically Greek. It was shot mostly in the ancient amphitheater of Dodoni, surrounded by rocky hillsides that are coldly sunlet, as if they had been internally frozen in some pre-historic period.As a movie, however, \\"Oedipuus the King\\" is a well-intentioned bore, a movie whose visual style (lots of long, meaningless, overlapping dissolves) seems to have been copied from television, and whose staging is a series of unresolved conflicts between the demands of the motion picture and those of the theater.With Christopher Plummer in the title role, it also is rather coldly actorish. There's nothing wrong with mannerisms in themselves—as Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier prove — as long as the actor remains in command of them.On the screen, if not on the stage, whether he is playing Baron Von Trapp or Oedipus, Plummer's mannerisms — sudden changes in speech tempo that seem to have no relation to meaning, the sardonic smile that, on the big screen, turns into a smirk — are distractingly exquisite.These things continually slow down what should be a relentless progression of events as, in the space of one apocalyptic day, Oedipus comes to face his terrifying fate.Some of the other players, however, are quite acceptable, especially Lilli Palmer, as Jocasta, mother and wife to Oedipus","excerpt":"Richard Johnson, a good actor who has never had much to do in films, as a compassionate Creon, and Cyril Cusack and Roger Livesey as those ubiquitous messengers that in Greek tragedy have to present so much exposition.All of them, however, including the German-born Miss Palmer, have such an overlay of British stage speech that they sometimes seem a little out of place against the real Greek countryside. In the theater, there are no such contradictions in illusion. Orson Welles appears briefly, and effectively, as the literally mountainous seer, Tiresias.The film is the first theatrical effort of Philip Saville, the television director who, among other shows, directed the Plummer version of \\"Hamlet\\" that was filmed at Elsinore. His excursion to Greece, like his one to Denmark, was, I think, a needless expense. \\"Oedipus the King\\" does not depend for its effect on authentic backgrounds.It is, essentially, a beautiful pagan ritual—the exorcising of otherwise unspeakable guilt. Like any good ritual, it's not where it's performed — but how — that counts. A marriage performed in a cathedral need be no more legal and binding than one performed in a diving bell.

The art center at 82 North Broadway was converted from the birthplace and boyhood home of the noted American artist 20 years ago this month by the Edward Hopper Landmark Foundation.    Mr. Sanborn is the former rector of the First Baptist Church on North Broadway, which the Hopper family attended. He will take with him some of \\"Eddie's\\" early drawings as a student at Nyack High School, and various Hopper memorabilia that he has collected over the years.    \\"He was a giant of a man, physically,\\" Mr. Sanborn said, \\"but a very quiet giant. His wife and sister did most of the talking for him.\\" The simplicity and sensitivity that mark Hopper's work, Mr. Sanborn said, were an integral part of his personality. He died in 1967 at the age of 85.    An exhibition of reproductions, to remain through the summer, will trace the development of Hopper as an artist. \\"We can't afford to buy his paintings or even his works on paper,\\" said Lawrence Heyl Jr., director of the center. \\"A small black and white steel engraving that I saw in Manhattan recently was $50,000.\\"    According to Mr. Heyl, Hopper was not a very prolific artist, having painted a few hundred oils and watercolors and some graphics that are distributed throughout 30 museums in the United States and numerous private collections. \\"They are rarely on the market,\\" Mr. Heyl said. For more information, call 358-4381. CARTOON EXHIBITION     The Museum of Cartoon Art's traveling exhibition at the White Plains Library, opening Saturday and running through Sept. 14, is a reminder that the museum will be moving from its Rye Brook quarters to Florida, probably by the end of the year, said Barbara Hammond, the director.    \\"Masters of Cartoon Art,\\" as the exhibition is called, features original drawings and colored photoengravings dating from 19th-century satirical drawings by Honore Daumier to the contemporary cartoons of Garry Trudeau.    Among the dozens of legendary cartoonists represented in the show are Thomas Nast, the father of political cartooning","excerpt":"Richard Outcault, creator of \\"Hogan's Alley\\" and \\"Buster Brown\\"; Rudolph Dirks and his \\"Katzenjammer Kids,\\" Walt Kelly's \\"Pogo,\\" Rube Goldberg's \\"Boob McNutt,\\" Bud Fisher's \\"Mutt and Jeff,\\" Hal Foster's \\"Prince Valiant,\\" works by Pat Oliphant and Al Hirschfeld, and \\"Beetle Bailey\\" by Mort Walker, who founded the museum in Greenwich in 1974.    The 9,000-square-foot museum, a former private mansion on Comly Avenue, is up for sale at $1.6 million, \\"but we would probably take less,\\" Ms. Hammond said. A city-owned site in Boca Raton, Fla., has been selected as a new location, available on a long-term lease. The museum must raise the money to build a 40,000-square-foot site that will house a theater for screening cartoons and holding special events, as well as substantial exhibition space for all the material it now keeps in storage.    Gallery hours in White Plains are Mondays through Thursdays, 9 A.M. to 9 P.M.; and Fridays, 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. The library is downtown at 100 Martine Avenue. TRIBUTE TO DANES     In October 1943 more than 7,000 Danish Jews and some non-Jewish spouses were transported in hundreds of small boats to safety in Sweden, avoiding a scheduled Nazi roundup of the total population of 8,000 Jews for shipment to concentration camps.    In appreciation of the courage shown by the Danes who organized and carried out the exodus in defiance of Nazi authorities, an Act of Courage Award will be presented by the Rockland Center for Holocaust Studies to a member of the Danish Consulate in New York City this week.    The ceremony will take place at 8 P.M. Tuesday in the center headquarters at 17 South Madison Avenue, Spring Valley, N.Y. Dr. Leon Falik, president of Tribute to the Danes and Other Rescuers, an American-Israeli organization based in Manhattan, will be the speaker. The public is welcome to attend. Call 356-2700 for more information. REAL EARTH TONES     Sticks, stones, earth, trees, bark, mud, water, shells, natural light and an occasional bit of paint or other art material are the components of works in the exhibition opening today at the Katonah Museum on Route 22 at Jay Street.    \\"Sticks and Stones: 10 Artists Work with Nature\\" is an indoor-outdoor exhibition by artists who are accustomed to seeking their materials in the landscape, rather than using manmade materials to reproduce a landscape. They are not part of a school, nor do they necessarily know each other. Patrick Dougherty, Kim Jones, Ilan Averbuch, Mel Kenrick, Robert Lobe, Giuseppe Penone, Alan Sonfist, Michaelle Stuart, James Surls and James Turrell are the 10 artists.    The more malleable materials are shaped into two- and three-dimensional forms that are free-standing, or hang off the exterior walls of the museum or are mounted in the galleries. Rigid materials are arranged into forms or combined with other things to alter their characteristics.    Because the process of installation was as wild as the works themselves, a video was made of it, featuring interviews with the artists. It is to be shown daily on a multi-monitor setup in the lobby.    The show will run through Sept 1. Museum hours are Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from noon to 5 P.M., Wednesdays from noon to 8 P.M., and Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Call 232-9555 for more information. CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS     Volunteers from the age of 13 to adults of any age are needed at the Greenburgh Nature Center to devote one morning or afternoon a week to helping out in one of three areas.    More than 140 animals are housed at the center, from mice to pythons. Many are there temporarily, having been rescued from the wild. Volunteers are needed to assist with their care, in showing them to the public, and helping to improve the wildlife exhibits.    In the 500-square-foot greenhouse completed three years ago, there are tropical, subtropical and desert plants, exhibitions that are mounted and changed seasonally, and displays relating to propogation, all needing attention. Outdoors the rock and herb gardens, a wildflower garden, lawn shrubs and flower beds require more tending than the staff can provide.    Finally, those with administrative, typing or computer skills would be of help in the office, or working on publicity, or staffing the gift shop. Staff professionals supply all the initial instruction and ongoing guidance.   The center, on Dromore Road off Central Avenue, is open daily except Friday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. The grounds are open from dawn to dusk. Call 723-3470 for more information or to sign on as a volunteer.

In a frank, brisk, semi-documentary manner, it rather belatedly hails British naval valor during the Chinese civil war in 1949.The cast of this strictly man's-man entry has only one name (Richard Todd), and one or two others familiar to moviegoers here. Finally, the sole incident upon which the picture is based—the stranding of H. M. S. Amethyst on the Communist-dominated Yangtze River—provoked more immediate concern, quite logically, at home than abroad.However, no apologies are in order for this taut, graphic and convincing close-up of a ship in real trouble back in 1949. After a rousing battle sequence at the outset, the Eric Ambler script moves in on the battered survivors, led by Mr. Todd, and their agonizing plight, as the incidents are ticked off almost impersonally (minus, glory be, a single flashback to the hearth).Since the actual plight of the vessel—what amounts to a stubborn sit-down strike in full view of the enemy—is as ironic as it is heroic, the situation provides some hard-bitten intrigue on both sides. Mr. Todd's shore \\"conferences\\" with a beguilingly sinister Chinese Red, succulently played by Akim Tamiroff, are so blandly suspenseful that the Amethyst's final escape down the river seems fairly standard. This climax will surprise nobody, nor should it, since such was the case.Unfortunately, too, much of the British naval jargon is either clipped off or swallowed. And while there are human touches all along the way, the ship's-log compactness of the scenario rules out any real emotional stature.Under the steady, alert direction of Michael Anderson (who piloted Michael Todd's eighty-day odyssey around the world), this unpretentious import sustains a real cutting edge that brooks no nonsense. Mr. Todd, William Hartnell and most of the others, excluding a starry-eyed Donald Houston, play it accordingly. The word for \\"Battle Hell\\" is shipshape.
