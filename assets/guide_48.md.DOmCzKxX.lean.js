As a formal musical prelude to this experimental event, the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra gave its Great Performers debut concert at Alice Tully Hall on Sunday afternoon. But there was nothing formal, in the stuffy sense, about the playing of these lively musicians.     The program began with Bach's Concerto in D minor for Two Violins, Strings and Basso Continuo. And the way the standing string players (except for the two cellists) swayed and bobbed to the music seemed a physical manifestation of their involvement. The tempos were lithe, the phrasing clean and the articulations crisp, with vibrato kept to a minimum. The nimble violin soloists, drawn from the ranks of the orchestra, were Gottfried von der Goltz and Anne Katharina Schreiber.     Next came a performance of ''Il pianto di Maria: Giunta l'ora fatal,'' a cantata for solo voice, string ensemble and organ, long attributed to Handel but now credited to an 18th-century Italian composer, Giovanni Ferrandini. The mezzo-soprano Bernarda Fink brought dusky beauty to her singing of this poignantly dramatic work, in which the Virgin Mary expresses anguish and anger over the death of her son. ''If I were made Mother of a God/ in order to see a God die,'' the English translation of one bitter recitative begins, ''then forgive me, Eternal Father/Your favor is a great torment.''     Ms. Fink was also compelling in Bach's Cantata No. 170 for solo voice and strings, which included solo instrumental parts for Katharina Arfken, who had just played a vibrant performance of a Bach concerto for oboe d'amore and strings, and the organist Markus M&#228","excerpt":"rkl.

Even the Government's flash estimate of a 4 percent annual growth rate in the current quarter seemed little cause for cheer. That gain reflected a modest slowing in the paring of business inventories - hardly the stuff that recoveries are made of.\\n\\nA rising money supply may be more of what's needed, but Treasury Secretary Donald Regan thinks it's already growing too fast. He expressed fears, as did Fed chairman Paul Volcker a few weeks ago, that M-1 - which has been soaring of late - might have to be reined in to prevent a new round of inflation. But the markets - more than a little jittery about the Fed's intentions - seem convinced that Mr. Volcker, fearing a stillborn recovery, will shun calls for tighter credit.

She is the warm-hearted young widow, also childless, who answers his ad for a live-in housekeeper. He is Jewish. She is Catholic. He is a chilly intellectual. She is a sentimental slob. He likes Mozart. She likes Phoebe Snow. He has a hearing aid. She has a big mouth.   So it goes, and goes and goes and goes, in \\"Park Your Car in Harvard Yard,\\" the Israel Horovitz comedy that has parked Jason Robards and Judith Ivey at the Music Box Theater on Broadway, one of New York's most merciless tow-away zones. The play is one of those one-set, two-actor, odd-couple contraptions that periodically seduce producers in search of low budgets and high returns along the lines of \\"Same Time, Next Year\\" or \\"Educating Rita.\\" This particular example is only five minutes old before the audience is sure that the playwright can only be heading in one of two directions: either one of his characters will die in bed, or both of them will have sex there. In the evening's sole burst of ingenuity, Mr. Horovitz nearly pulls off both these denouements, though the advanced age of Mr. Robards's teacher requires that the carnal climax be achieved by proxy.

(Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $40.) A big collection (768 pages) of untheoretical, unpolitical, vivid writing about dancing by a critic who maintained for 25 years that art was about beauty, not ideas.    OFF KECK ROAD, by Mona Simpson. (Knopf, $19.) A novel smaller and more delicate than is the author's wont, concerning three characters, all unmarried women in Green Bay, Wis., all living lives in which events are rare, emotion is slender and conclusions are inconclusive.    W. E. B. Du BOIS: The Fight for Equality and the American Century, 1919-1963, by David Levering Lewis. (John Macrae/ Holt, $35.) The second volume of Lewis's distinguished biography picks up Du Bois's life after World War I and pursues it through a series of trials and disappointments scarcely to be matched in the life of any scholar of any race.    HIROHITO AND THE MAKING OF MODERN JAPAN, by Herbert P. Bix. (HarperCollins, $35.) Based on recent Japanese scholarship and the author's own research, this biography finds the emperor neither a Hitler nor a pacifist but a flawed statesman, fully informed about what his country was up to, but almost always swayed by the current political wind.    ONE PALESTINE, COMPLETE: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate, by Tom Segev. (Metropolitan/Holt, $35.) The prehistory of Israel, told from three perspectives -- Jewish, Arab and British -- by an Israeli journalist who concludes that the mandate was the most important factor in forming the state, not, as so often maintained, an obstacle.    RIMBAUD, by Graham Robb. (Norton, $35.) A biography informed by close, intelligent reading of all Rimbaud's writings, not just the poetry he abandoned when he was 20 for a career of imperialist adventurism","excerpt":"Robb takes the life and work of Rimbaud in a single vision, as a unity not broken by separating the poet in France from the gunrunner in Africa.    LYING AWAKE, by Mark Salzman. (Knopf, $21.) A novel about a cloistered nun in Los Angeles, agonized by the discovery that her visions of God's love seem biologically based; by a writer skilled in the lucid presentation of spiritual states.    LICKS OF LOVE: Short Stories and a Sequel, by John Updike. (Knopf, $25.) Short stories sharing a theme of retrospect and a tone of forgiveness, and a 182-page novella, ''Rabbit Remembered,'' in which a contentious Thanksgiving dinner brings Rabbit Angstrom's survivors together to clash and to form new alliances.    TRILOBITE! Eyewitness to Evolution, by Richard Fortey. (Knopf, $26.) A British paleontologist's account of the shelly creatures that occupied, and sometimes dominated, the seas for about 300 million years. It's also a kind of informal handbook on the joys of small science and the recombinations of facts that often smoke out a scientific truth.

Each was seen in a role debut that might have been devised by Maurice Bejart, who pays a lot of attention to the physical beauty and theatricality of his dancers.    Mr. Proia and Miss Alexopoulos are good-looking, and they make a handsome pair. Miss Alexopoulos, one of the company's senior ballerinas, is adept at the creation of a subtle mood or ambiance on stage. Mr. Proia brings a kind of Gallic wit and distance to most of what he dances. Neither is the kind of raw young thing one envisions in this small but potent piece about a chance meeting in a luminous ballet studio between two dancers in love with themselves, their world and, possibly, each other. Given the startling simplicity of the ballet, a degree of raw youthfulness is helpful for the embodiment of that naked fixation with the allure of the stage, the audience and one's own beautiful self as glimpsed in studio mirrors. These two experienced performers capably enacted innocence and attraction.

Bartlett, Board Chairman and CEO of the F.A. Bartlett Tree Expert Company of Stamford, CT, was born in Stamford, CT, on October 11, 1917. He was the son of the late Francis A. and Myrtle K. Bartlett. Following graduation from the Irving School, Tarrytown, NY, he attended the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University, later transferring to the business school at Columbia University. He joined the family business in 1937 and, a year later, was instrumental in coordinating efforts to restore damaged landscapes in the aftermath of the great 1938 hurricane. Mr. Bartlett enlisted in the U.S. Army in June 1941, six months before Pearl Harbor, becoming a specialist in military equipment and supplies as well as a graduate of the military intelligence school. He saw action in the South Pacific, including the New Guinea and Philippines campaigns. He rose to the rank of staff sergeant and was awarded the Soldier's Medal for Bravery for risking his life to rescue a pilot from a burning aircraft. Resuming his career with the Bartlett Company, he was successively named Vice President, a director, Executive Vice President, President, Vice Chairman and, in 1975, Chairman and CEO. A lifelong arborist, he counted among his most rewarding accomplishments the establishing of two major arboreta, the Bartlett Arboretum of the State of Connecticut in Stamford and the working arboretum located on the property of the Bartlett Tree Research Laboratories and Experimental Grounds in Charlotte, NC.

Yesterday, it was Graham Hood at the National Collegiate Athletic Association outdoor championships at Boise State University in Moscow, Idaho. Taking the lead from Andy Keith of Providence with half a lap to go, Hood held off Erik Nedeau of Northeastern to win the 1,500 meters in 3 minutes 42.10 seconds, and Keith, second to Bruton indoors, faded to last. Off a slow pace (2:06 at 800 meters) Hood closed with a sizzling 54.4 final 400. Bruton's fifth place gave the Razorbacks 14 points in their quest for their third straight men's team title.    Flirtisha Harris of Seton Hall, who doesn't like to run the 400 meters, added the N.C.A.A. outdoor 400 title to the indoor title she won in March. Running a perfectly judged race, she passed Janeen Jones in the final 30 meters and pulled away to win by 4 meters in 51.66 seconds, a personal best by nearly a second.

However, \\"Out of the Clouds\\" and \\"Value for Money,\\" at various neighborhood showcases, are almost consistently disappointing. And three hours is a long sitting. Quite.These J. Arthur Rank imports in color are significant on two counts. Both films have talented contributors, before and behind the cameras, who have happier laurels to rest upon. And in the second entry, the generously displayed charms of the highly-touted Diana Dors constitute what might be called a platinum blond ice-cream soda.\\"Out of the Clouds\\" is a tepid, unsurprising and genteel look behind the scenes of London Airport. This \\"Grand Hotel\\" of the waiting rooms is also singularly and surprisingly lacking in drama. Some pleasant airline employes exchange jovial or wishful comments between planes. Among them are Anthony Steel, a playboy pilot","excerpt":"Robert Beatty, morosely tied to a desk, and James Robertson Justice, the bearded flight veteran.The action, or lack of it, centers on a tender but laboriously detailed romance, that of two nice young passengers. David Knight plays the fellow, a rather bumptious American, fairly convincingly. But a soft-spoken girl of sphinxlike beauty and dignity named Margo Lorenz (a newcomer) scores neatly, if minutely. And she is the only one, in this Michael Balcon - Ealing Studio production, who does.\\"Value for Money\\" is a coy and generally clumsy strain for laughs until the final, genuinely amusing reel. At this point a London chorus girl (guess who) regally descends on a bleak Yorkshire factory town to stalk a wealthy young miser, John Gregson.Unfortunately, this good-natured entry is most unsubtly weighed down with heavy-handed writing by a couple of scenarists, and directing by Ken Annakin. The shy, penny-pinching hero remains a bore, and a fine gallery of small-town sideline performers is wasted. Likewise, the pert Susan Stephen, as the local reporter who finally marrige Mr. Gregson—and one can only wonder why.Miss Dors' role is strictly standard, along with a heart of gold toward the end. But her first, grim reaction to the grimy factory community is funny indeed. And her pop-eyed tour of the proud hero's cramped, hideously old-fashioned home is hilarious. If this shapeless comedy were a bit more hard-boiled, and less cluttered with cliches, J. Arthur Rank might have had something. At any rate, Miss Dors certainly has. Screen: 2 From Britain; 'Out of the Clouds' and 'Value for Money'"},{"year":"2006","title":"Robert Bechtle's new exhibition of paintings and drawings at the Gladstone Gallery in Chelsea wrestles with the art-historical ghost of Edward Hopper. Exquisite, refined photorealist street scenes denuded of people and eerily gloomy interiors populated by a lonely, sad-looking male figure (Mr. Bechtle himself) are basically the norm. They are sometimes creepy but at other times overload the emotions to such a degree that you want to step into the picture and give the old guy a hug. Several marvelous, subtly toned charcoal-on-paper studies for the larger oil paintings in the main gallery fill out the side rooms, and in some ways steal the show: Mr. Bechtle's various weaknesses as a colorist and painter of skies are less noticeable here, where everything is pretty much a pale shade of gray. All the drawings are masterfully realized, though a group depicting wide street intersections in San Francisco (including ''Potrero Intersection -- De Haro and Southern Heights,'' above) possess a cinematic sweep, reminiscent of the opening scenes from that great 1970s television detective series ''The Streets of San Francisco.'' More introspective than some of his previous exhibitions, these paintings and drawings nonetheless have tremendous appeal.

The idea for the Forbes 400 -- rather than, say, 300 or 500 -- was inspired by Mrs. Astor's 400, the definitive list of New York high society in the 1890's. It's rumored that Mrs. William Backhouse Astor Jr. limited her social list to 400 because only 400 people could fit into her ballroom, but that may not be true. In any case, they had to be the right 400 people. As her escort, Ward McAlister, explained to reporters in 1888: ''If you go outside that number, you strike people who are either not at ease in a ballroom or else make others not at ease.''     The first edition of the Forbes 400, dated Sept. 13, 1982, included mainline families like the Rockefellers, the Mellons and the du Ponts.

By Steven Suskin. (Schirmer, $35.) There are few who would deny that Broadway's greatest gift to the world has been the musical comedy, and perhaps fewer still who would dispute that this decidedly American concoction reached its peak in the middle of this century. Among its many other virtues as a comprehensive research tool, or just as a delight for theater aficionados, \\"Opening Night on Broadway\\" by Steven Suskin, a theatrical producer and manager, confirms that the critics were definitely aware something special was happening on the Great White Way at the time. As Brooks Atkinson wrote about \\"Finian's Rainbow,\\" which opened in 1947, four years after the pivotal \\"Oklahoma!\\": \\"If the American musical stage continues to improve, it will no longer be necessary for anyone to speak dialogue on the stage. Everything essential can be said in song and dancing.\\" From \\"Alive and Kicking\\" to \\"Ziegfeld Follies of 1957,\\" this collection of excerpts from the daily reviews constitutes a galvanizing parade of the peacocks as well as the turkeys. Though the era encompassed practically every great musical our generation knows by name (including \\"Guys and Dolls,\\" \\"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,\\" \\"The Music Man,\\" \\"My Fair Lady,\\" \\"The Pajama Game,\\" \\"West Side Story\\" and \\"Hello, Dolly!\\"), typically it was the less successful shows that inspired the wittiest comments.

The film doesn't have the charm of ''Finding Nemo,'' but it's fun and there are plenty of jokes for the grown-ups.    TEA AND SYMPATHY (1956)  Tuesday at 8 p.m. on TCM.  When Robert Anderson's play opened on Broadway in 1953, attitudes were such that Tom Robinson Lee, the young protagonist, was described in reviews as being ''falsely suspected of homosexuality.'' In the film, directed by Vincente Minnelli, Tom (John Kerr, left, with Deborah Kerr) is simply ridiculed and called ''sister boy'' by his classmates and even his housemaster (Leif Erickson) at a New England boys' school. The only person who sympathizes with Tom is the housemaster's beautiful wife (Ms. Kerr), and she decides to help him prove his heterosexuality by sleeping with him. This decision gave us the line ''Years from now, when you talk about this -- and you will -- be kind.''    NARC (2002)  Saturday at 8 p.m. on AMC.  Joe Carnahan's gritty police thriller makes the good-     cop-bad-cop formula seem new again. Jason Patric (right) plays Nick Tellis, a former narcotics officer who has been involuntarily retired since he accidentally shot a pregnant woman. He is called back on duty to investigate the murder of an undercover cop. Nick is guilt-ridden and wound tight, and things become even more tense when he meets his new partner. That man is Henry Oak (Ray Liotta), a heavy-handed bully who believes in rough justice. The dead man was his partner.    SPLASH (1984)  Saturday at 8 p.m. on ABC Family.  The young Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah and Ron Howard (who directed) all had their first big hits with this romantic comedy about a Manhattan lonely guy and a mermaid. Mr. Hanks plays Allen Bauer, who whines to his brother (a very funny John Candy) about not having found the right woman. But he's about to. When a gorgeous, speechless, naked blonde (Ms. Hannah, below) appears, Allen takes her in. She quickly learns English by watching television at Bloomingdale's and, inspired by a street sign, decides to call herself Madison. She and Allen are in love at first sight (it helps that Madison is innocently enthusiastic about physical affection). The only complication is that when she gets into water, she has fins. But the couple will work things out. Where do you think all those little girls named Madison came from?

Hearst. It was possibly the most auspicious first night of a photoplay, the affair being further enhanced by Victor Herbert and his orchestra.In the audience were people in society, city officials, stage and motion picture celebrities. Some of those in the seats witnessed a vivid portrayal of their own ancestors, living in a peaceful village on the lower end of Manhattan. They saw John Jacob Astor, stern and full of business ideas","excerpt":"Robert Fulton, thoughtful and eager; Washington Irving, Henry Brevoort, and Delmonico presiding over a lunch wagon.Free of all the clatter and banging of trolley cars, elevated railroads, the congestion of tall buildings, the notoriously noisy subway, the greatest city of the world was depicted a little more than a century ago as a sort of Arcadialike haven, which was aristocratic yet talked with Hoboken about sports, whose citizens loved their wine—a village that had just inherited a fire department partly manned by the young swells, and where for the offenders against law and order there were the stocks.All this was in the day when Robert Fulton introduced to the ultra-conservative element his Clermont, when Cornelius Vanderbilt skippered the ferryboat to Staten Island and John Jacob Astor had a nice little piano and fur shop.For costumes and settings and photography \\"Little Old New York\\" is one of the most exquisite productions ever thrown upon a screen. In spite of the moderate thrill of the narrative one envies the days of long ago even with the lack of speed and electric light. The story is sweet and appealing and runs along without a single hurtful halt, and Sidney Olcott, the director, has shown excellent taste in refraining from any of the usual motion picture gymnastics. The acting is quiet and natural and the characterization is good, although Marion Davies is far too feminine ever to be mistaken for a boy. But as the picture rolls along the illusion gains headway and one lives with the picture. In those days they were unwilling to recognize Fulton's invention and perhaps they were just as blind to a lad's characteristics.The photoplay first introduces the young and old bloods of the Battery and from there one is taken to Ireland. Marion Davies as the girl, Patricia O'Day, is a vivacious, fearless colleen bawn, ready for the fray and to protect her old father.Later in New York Patricia is shown impersonating her brother Pat, who died in mid-ocean, so that she and her father inherit the great fortune of a relative. She wears tight trousers and boots, and is nervous about the ordeal of posing as a boy.\\"Keep a bold front,\\" adjures her father. \\"It's the ???ck of me that's trembling,\\" confesses Patricia.Harrison Ford plays Larry Delavan, the young aristocrat who expected to come in for the money. His costumes as well as those of the other players are faultlessly made, every little detail, even to oblong eyeglasses, having received attention.An alluring sequence in this photoplay is the depicting of Fulton and other notables aboard the Clermont in the Hudson. Pat, as she is then known, is also on the vessel, which is tried out that day. Fulton is nervous and Astor is skeptical. The steamboat starts and then stops. Futon peers down through steam clouds to the engine room, and Pat becomes so frightened that she confides to Larry Delevan that she has a confession to make before she dies. The wonderful little craft gets going again, and amazement is shown on the faces of the doubting Thomases as the steamboat surges through the river waters. The replica of the Clermont is wonderfully well constructed.One sees the people aboard, their countenances reassured, and from the mast breaks the Stars and Stripes in colors. By that time men are only too anxious to invest their money in Fulton's folly, but it is too late.When Patricia, as Pat, of course, is offered Ariana de Puyster's hand to kiss, she pushes it away, which action elicits the remark:\\"What an impossible little boy.\\"Pat becomes a social incorrigible. Miss de Puyster consents to sing, and Pat so dislikes it that \\"he\\" fishes out his harp and tries to drown the sounds of the magnificent lady's voice with his own efforts. Pat is left with the men and their smokes, and finally the pale-faced Patricia picks up a churchwarden clay pipe and puffs on it. with the resut that she becomes very ill. But ills on the film are quickly forgotten.The Hoboken Terror and Bully Bov Brewster are matched to fight each other in the fire-house. Pat scrambles in, eager to see how the match is going and anxious for the New York fighter to win, as Larry has his house up on a wager on the outcome of the encounter. There is a scrambling and much jostling, but Pat eventually hides up in the little bell tower. This old-fashioned bare-knuckle fighting, when the second's knee serves as a stool, is interestingly sketched. But Pat knows enough to see that the Hoboken Terror is getting the best of the fight, and therefore \\"he\\" pulls the fire bell. The throng is infuriated at the discovery of the trick and Patricia is tied by her hands to a post while the Hoboken Terror uses a horsewhip upon her. Then Patricia can't stand it any longer and screams that she is a girl.From the beating Pat received one would have imagined that it would have sent her to bed for a week, but next morning Patricia, in dainty laces and ribbons, issues forth in the house, a picture of the rose in full bloom.Sam Hardy is good as Cornelius Vanderbilt. George Barraud, as Henry Brevoort, wears his clothes remarkably well and in the brief appearance he made he was always perfectly at home. J. M. Kerrigan is an indomitable John O'Day. Courtenay Foote is splendid as Robert Fulton. Ford is rather heavy as Larry Delevan. Andrew Dillon is capital as John Jacob Astor.

The survey rates restaurants based on questionnaires filled out by more than 3,000 people who dined out in the suburban regions on an average of 3.1 times a week. These diners rated four restaurants in these areas higher for food -- 28 on a scale of 30 -- than New York City diners rated any of their restaurants. The ratings were matched by only about a dozen restaurants in other parts of the country.   They are Xaviar's in Piedmont, N.Y.","excerpt":"Robert Henry's in New Haven; Da Pietro's in Westport, Conn., and L'Abbee in New Canaan, Conn. Sally's, a pizzeria in New Haven, was given a rating of 27 for food, making it the highest-rated pizzeria in any of the Zagat guides. The rating is comparable to those given by New Yorkers to Bouley, Lutece, Le Bernardin, Aureole, Peter Luger and Chanterelle in New York City.   According to the new guide, Mirabelle in St. James, L.I.; Fine Bouch in Centerbrook, Conn., and Harrald's in Stormville, N.Y., are also in this category. Keeping the possibility of ratings inflation in mind, this is a useful guide for those who dine in suburban areas. It provides plenty of pertinent information about the restaurants. The guide is $9.95 in bookstores. Milk-Tasting    The American Institute of Wine and Food is holding a milk-tasting on March 4, 6:30 to 8:30 P.M. at the Regency Hotel, 540 Park Avenue (61st Street).

Hand-Harvested Potatoes    Variety has been the victim of the industrialized farming that has typified American agriculture over 40 years. But recently consumers have shown an increasing interest in old-fashioned produce that had all but disappeared. Farmers have responded by cultivating it.    Chris Holmes of New Penny Farm in Presque Isle, Me., grows eight kinds of potatoes, most of them impossible to find elsewhere. They are raised without chemical sprays and are harvested by hand, so they have none of the gashes that machine-harvested crops sometimes suffer. The dirt is lightly brushed from the potatoes before shipping, and since they are not washed clean, Mr. Holmes says they have a longer shelf life.   Among the varieties are yellow-fleshed Caroles and Bintjes for baking or roasting. Others are rich-tasting, starchy Irish Cobblers, moist Katahdins that make excellent mashed potatoes and low-starch red-skinned Sangres for salads.   A 10-pound sampler of four kinds is $25, including shipping east of the Mississippi. There is an extra charge for shipping to the West. Other assortments are available starting at $15. There is even a Potato of the Month Club. For information: New Penny Farm, 85 Williams Road, Presque Isle, Me. 04769; (207) 768-7551. The Dutch Influence    How has traditional Dutch cooking influenced American cuisine from colonial times to the present? Peter G. Rose, a food historian, will lecture on the subject Sunday at the Queens County Farm Museum, 73-50 Little Neck Parkway, Floral Park, Queens.  The lecture is free and begins at 2 P.M. For information: (718) 347-3276. SEASON'S FIRST FRESH SHAD    SHAD have been working their way up the East Coast, and as they enter river estuaries in the Carolinas to spawn, fishermen have been ready. The first fresh shad of the season is now available.   Prices are generally about $6 a pound for the fillets and $5 to $8 for a pair of roe, depending on size. Shad is usually purchased filleted; removing the tiny bones from this member of the herring family takes considerable expertise.   The roe is best lightly sauteed. The fillets are excellent baked or broiled, nicely complemented by a tangy garnish. Tart sorrel sauce is classic.

Miss Prevost is quite well suited to the rôle of Julie Gamelyn, the cheerful Red Cross nurse, who has her own ideas about love and the future of the man who is smitten by her vivacity and undeniable charm. Mr. Blue impersonates Peter Graham, the clergyman who gave up his chaplaincy and became an English Tommy. Mr. Blue is not physically fitted for this part, which calls for a more spiritual looking actor. His forte is in in light comedy, and with all the earnestness of his performance he does not impress one as having devoted his life to teaching the Gospel.The director, Harry Beaumont, has made the most, of the scenes in France, with Julie ever ready to show her affection for Peter in spite of his ill-cut khaki uniform. Her kisses are of the usual motion picture variety—prolonged and violent.A gripping sequence is where Peter, after the armistiee, takes a job in South Africa. His duties are described as \\"buying stinking wool from sweaty natives.\\" In a shack he associates with Stenhouse (George Siegmann), a hog when he is sober and a fiend when he is drunk. Stenhouse makes life unbearable for Peter. Mr. Beaumont pictures him drenching the sugar with coffee from his spoon and spilling his food and drink down his shirt. In this part Mr. Siegmann is most effective, especially when he lashes Peter when in a drunken fury because Peter objected forcefully to Stenhouse's conduct toward the female natives.There are some splendid scenes, with ???wering skies, in the South African stretches. The wounding of Peter by Stenhouse brings a surgeon to the scene. He is accompanied by Colonel Donovan and Julie, Colonel Donovan, who is usually immaculate in his attire, looks like a fashion plate after riding over the trail for four days.In London, following his recovery from his bullet wound. Peter starts a mission, at which food and coffee are distributed to the poor. This mission is supposed to be in Limehouse, but through some unfortunate error on the part of the title writer it is set forth as being in Cheapside. Possibly the producers imagined that because of the name of this thoroughfare it must be near Limehouse, when actually it is miles away and a busy artery in the heart of the English metropolis.The finish of this pictorial effort weakens the production. This is due to the angling for a happy ending, which has been accomplished in an obvious and stereotyped fashion.In the Limehouse chapter Peter meets the girl to whom he was at one time engaged. She has aged materially, while Peter's face and hair remain just as they were when he left France. It strikes one as surprising, therefore, that Angelica does not recognize him at once instead of sobbing out a story about a minister who never came back.There are a number of sequences in this film which are worthy enough to compensate for some of the disappointing stretches, and therefore it makes a stirring entertainment up to the last chapter, which is muddled and banal.
