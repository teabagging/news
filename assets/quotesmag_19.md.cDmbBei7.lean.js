Frank James Cooper was born in Helena, Mont., in 1901 (in the 1920's, an agent born in Gary, Ind., would persuade him to change his name). His parents, British immigrants, owned a large ranch, and Cooper went to school with Indian children. When he was only 8, his mother moved the family back to England, where Cooper spent three years feeling very much a hick outsider. He returned to the United States with the beginning of that tall, lean look that would soon get him into silent Westerns.

Lawrence's novel \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover,\\" first published in 1928 and banned in England until 1960 (and in the United States until 1959), created a sensation with its frank depiction of sex. The novel, however, was not merely a portrait of \\"the warm blood-sex that establishes the living and revitalizing connection between man and woman.\\" It was also a searing indictment of post-World War I England, providing both a fierce, disturbing portrait of a sterile society undermined by industrialism and class-bound conventions and a plea for its regeneration through passion and a return to nature.

Minute Men, staging a J.

For without Spencer Charters, Gene Morgan, Victor Kilian, Norman Willis and a few others of the featured classification, \\"Lady From Nowhere\\" would remain simple spinach, and could be fittingly dismissed.Mr. Charters and Mr. Kilian are, respectively, a Connecticut farmer and his hired man, who enjoy a relationship that should be a lesson to Capital and Labor, and who, in their canny way, give haven to Miss Astor under the impression that she is a runaway heiress whose father will pay a neat reward for her safe delivery. In reality she is Polly Dunlap, the manicurist who saw Tough Eddie Lustig knock off a mug named Fletcher in a hotel room, and both the police and Tough Eddie are hunting very hard for her. Mr. Morgan is Eddie's rather fumbling beater in the hunt.Miss Astor is capably terror-stricken, touchingly lovelorn, and heroically sacrificial as occasion demands. Mr. Quigley (he's the reporter on the Clearview Clarion) is 6' 3\\" and darkly handsome. He is being heralded by his studio as another Robert Taylor, and he treats his current rôle somewhat gingerly, as if he were a little awed by the prospect.

Fairleigh Dickinson, under the direction of Tommy Lang, has won four in a row after last week's victories over St. Francis (N.Y.) and Rider, which has lost 9 of 11 games.   Long Island University continues to have its problems. The Blackbirds suffered losses to Monmouth and Fairfield last week -- their ninth and 10th losses in 12 games. At the rate the Blackbirds are going, Coach Arnold Ramirez, who is six victories away from 200, may have to wait until next year. Patriot League    Holy Cross claimed sole possession of first place with a 1-0 triumph over Colgate last Saturday. Brian Petz, the senior striker, scored the goal that gave the Crusaders their sixth consecutive victory. They started the season 0-3. In other league games, Army played Lehigh to a 3-3 deadlock","excerpt":"Lafayette posted a 4-2 victory over Bucknell and Navy suffered a 2-1 loss to La Salle in a nonleague match.

They posted a 2-1 overtime triumph over Trinity (Tex.) in the Emory tournament at Atlanta on Traci Tapp's two goals after a scoreless deadlock at the end of regulation.

His fall and winter ready-to-wear show was wild, wicked and enormously entertaining. It is likely to cause frissons of anxiety throughout the fashion world because, guess what? The champion of long skirts has changed his stance. Legs are back. Oh, there are a few long, thin dresses with flounces at the hem, just to keep the franchise.   But you know what you will really need to be in fashion next season? A long white shirt -- you will wear it over your black tights and boots, under your black velvet jacket cut short to let the shirttail show, or under your tailored jacket scattered with brilliants that look like snowflakes. At night, when you want to dress funky, you toss the same white shirt over a black dress, or you tuck it into the waistband of a big velvet skirt with a train. The new formality, you know.    Lagerfeld is a master of the funny interlude. Are all the models in Paris wearing suffragette high-laced shoes or clunky boots on the runway?
