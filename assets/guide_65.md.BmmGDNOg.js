The lights come up on a chorus of babbling 17th-century French swells who are figuratively guillotined by a progression of elegant, falling front curtains, each more disfigured than the last by blotted, calligraphic graffiti. Not long after that, the same curtains rise on a new shock for the eye: a towering period anteroom in nearly unrelieved white, as seen from a skewed, fisheye-lens perspective. And then comes the piece de resistance: A corpulent buffoon -- the beast of the title, known as Valere and played by Tom McGowan -- delivers a marathon soliloquy that runs some 400 lines and, like the entire play, has been composed in rhymed verse!    No, one won't soon forget the first half-hour or so of \\"La Bete,\\" which takes the brave chances so rare in new American plays. The flip side of such daring, however, is the high expectations it raises. Mr. Hirson promises nothing less than a mock-Moliere comedy of manners and ideas as refracted through (or deconstructed by) a post-modern sensibility.

By the time \\"La Bete\\" dwindles down to a coda as embarrassingly mawkish as its prologue was startling, one is still waiting for the promised laughter, ideas and dramatic conflict to possess center stage.

As a kid, I may even have gawked at a few women whose thin, penciled crescents made them seem like escapees from old black-and-white movies, never considering what went into achieving such a look or that young women of my generation might be altering their brows.

It turned out that L.'s mother had caused the swelling by plucking L.'s eyebrows, pulling out the hairs one by one.

Unlike much American music being composed today - music represented, in all its healthy diversity, on other recent LP's - Mrs. Zwilich's symphony is unashamed in allowing heartfelt emotion to show through.\\n\\nIn a preface to the score, the 47-year-old composer says she wrote the work ''with great affection for the modern orchestra,'' including ''its indescribable richness and variety of color.'' On a New World LP (NW 336), these riches are immediately apparent in the marvelously warm and assured performance by the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra under John Nelson: this music sounds good.

What makes Ms. Easton's work so distinctive and so exhilarating is its wit. Each of the program's four new and recent dances was crammed with surprising incident. Sometimes the surprise came with a sudden, quick gesture that connoted a specific emotional relationship in a dance that was at least superficially abstract. Other times, the surprise lay in unexpected phrases and transitions or in the way Ms. Easton used an expected move at an unexpected time.    Ms. Easton's gift for subliminal logic was most apparent in her new \\"Come Hither,\\" a solo for Nancy Sakamoto. Dressed in a white satin tank suit with a white tulle skirt, Ms. Sakamoto looked at first like a barefoot ballerina as she moved before a white square of light ingeniously centered on the stage's black back wall to suggest a fashion photographer's setup.

Although the prime has probably peaked, there is continuing pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower the cost of money more rapidly. But, the nation's preoccupation with mortgage rates has obscured the fact that the rising cost of other housing resources - land, building materials and energy - may present far more important long-term problems for the housing industry.   In its recently published Interim Report, President Reagan's new Commission on Housing concentrated on how to reduce Government intervention in the housing market. Although the commission was established to ''assess those factors which contribute to the cost of housing,'' its report gives little indication that the White House is interested in the complete range of reasons behind spiraling home prices. The Administration's apparent reluctance to initiate new housing policies clashes with the growing need for better land management, alternative building materials and residential energy standards.

Not only does the Health Code require state certification, but it will not accept such certification without the prescribed course in child development and reading.  Staffing at day-care centers has a professional director at the top, with a master's degree in education and at least two years' classroom experience. Each group in a day-care center has a certified teacher responsible for the group, plus a full-time assistant teacher and a part-time aide.
