Phipps and his    English-born wife, Margarita   Grace Phipps, commissioned George A. Crawley to design an English-style country house with extensive gardens in the Long Island countryside.

By designing the gardens as well, Mr. Crawley achieved a harmonious whole.   The styles of the individual gardens in the 15 acres immediately surrounding the house constitute a kind of visual history of English gardens: from rose garden beds in quatrefoil formation and an Italianate walled garden with trees espaliered in the 17th-century manner to herbaceous borders and a cottage garden of the late 19th century.

The interest in seeing Mr. O'Neill step behind the lectern was the lectern itself.  The Governor, while experienced in public speaking, has an aversion to crowds of microphones waving in his face. When broadcast reporters set microphones on his desk, he tries to push them back, to leave himself a few inches of clear space.   The reporters, however, say they get better quality recordings by keeping the microphones close. Recently, therefore, the Governor asked that a new lectern be built, and on Monday, it was unveiled.

A.The penguins' feet    do    get cold, nearly freezing","excerpt":"in fact, the temperature of their toes has been measured at just about 32 degrees Fahrenheit. The birds have evolved a remarkable temperature control system in which blood warms the feet, but only enough to keep them functioning. The system is most efficient among the penguins of the Antarctic. The emperor penguin, for example, spends most of its life with its bare feet in direct contact with ice, snow or freezing water. If its feet were maintained at the same high temperature as the rest of its insulated body, precious heat would be lost quickly through conduction or convection. So the penguins evolved an anatomical arrangement in which arteries carrying warm blood toward the toes run side by side with veins carrying cold blood back in the opposite direction. The returning blood absorbs heat from the outflowing blood, and because of this efficient heat exchange, the circulation can be reduced to a level just high enough to keep the foot tissues alive. These foot tissues have special traits; they can survive with slowed circulation and conduct nerve impulses even when extremely cold. Also, penguins' feet, like those of ducks and other birds that spend time in cold water, are made up of lots of tendons and a minimum of musculature, and cold tendons are not as uncomfortable as cold muscles.

They are responsible for \\"Woman Proof,\\" the film feature this week at the Rivoli, which is one of those photoplays brimful of chuckles and laughter. The narrative itself is not especially novel or sparkling, but the way in which it has been handled by Ade as the author, Green as the director and Meighan as the principal player renders it well worthy of the trio.The acting in this film is especially good. The part which Meighan plays suits him much better than the rôles in which he has to parade with an overcast expression, which he occasionally has to fill. In spite of the simplicity of this story, the producers have not hesitated to spend all the money necessary to make it a polished production. Where there is a garden party, it looks like a real garden party, with the large umbrellas over the tables, the girls in attractive and expensive gowns, all of them apparently enjoying their tea and sandwiches.Jefferson Rockwood's will bequeathes one million dollars to each of his four children, with the stipulation that they marry within five years. If they don't marry, according to the clause in the document, the millions are to go to benefit an asylum for the aged. There is little difficulty regarding the marriage of the two daughters, as they are wed long before the time set. Dick Rockwood returns from London with a girl he wants to marry. The stumbling block to getting the millions is Tom Rockwood (Meighan). He is supercilious when it comes to girls","excerpt":"in fact, they bore him. His work is his only love. So, knowing that all are going to lose their money unless the obstinate and unappreciative Tom falls in love, Wilma, his sister, endeavors to assemble all the girls she can and then inveigle Tom into attending the gathering. But Tom's heart is of flint when it comes to flappers, zippers and the old-fashioned girls. And the time is getting very short to save the millions, which old Milo Bleech, the lawyer, would delight to handle for the asylum for the aged.Ade's hand is plain throughout this film. He describes the zippers zipping and the flappers flapping—a zipper being from six months to one year older than a flapper. They are very good looking—in this picture. Most of the titles are well written, and many of them drew waves of laughter from the audience.There is an Eveless Eden in the course of the story, where Uncle Joe Gloomer holds forth with a pal. They want Tom to join their ranks as a woman hater, and it looks as if he were about to become a life member of their association when Tom meets Louise Halliday (Lila Lee). Gradually Cupid pierces the Rockwood heart.Gloomer, portrayed by Charles A. Sellon, hardly ever appears on the screen without increasing the mirth in the theatre, and the spectators even laugh at his pathetic countenance when Tom pulls down the blinds just when he and his crabbed old pal are trying to rescue the young man from the clutches of the rather winsome creature.Lila Lee is satisfactory in her part and Louise Dresser is capable as Wilma Rockwood.

''BUWALSKI: A ROAD OPERA.'' Smart chamber opera -- sometimes almost too smart -- is the specialty of the Nine Circles Chamber Theater which, since its founding a few years ago, has created operas that attempt to explicate Paul Celan and deconstruct Camille Saint-Saëns. Its latest production, presented with the experimental Dutch company Opera Spanga, takes on Beauty and the Beast: it's a multimedia fairy tale about an ugly man whose hands are his one beautiful feature, and who falls in love with a beauty he sees on television. Jonathan Levi wrote the libretto, Mel Marvin created the jazz-permeated score, and Opera Spanga's director, Corina van Eijk, intermingled film and live action in this updated fairy tale.

Over the years, Bizet's gritty opéra-comique has succumbed to edema, and Franco Zeffirelli's Metropolitan Opera production suffers from particularly acute bloat and a lumbering quality; even the lead characters seem like archetypes of their roles rather than specific, living figures. Musically, the outlook is better: Olga Borodina is her customary fine self, applying a fantastic chest voice and her characteristic languor in creating a Carmen both earthy and seductive. As Don José, Neil Shicoff produces a bleat on some of the French vowels, but when he's good, he's very good. Hei-Kyung Hong is appropriately delicate as Micaëla. The most dramatically effective moment is the duet between Ms. Borodina and the worthy young bass-baritone Ildar Abdrazakov as Escamillo in the last act, mainly because he is her real-life husband. James Levine conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215 (Midgette).    ''DAPHNE.'' It has taken more than six decades, but Strauss's late opera ''Daphne,'' first presented in Dresden in 1938, finally has its first staged production in New York, courtesy of the adventurous New York City Opera and directed by Stephen Lawless. One reason this 90-minute work in one act remains a rarity may be its convoluted metaphysical story of a sensual and godly young woman, Daphne, who fearing mortal life and adult sexuality, yearns to be at one with nature. But the main reason the opera, despite its lushly harmonic score from Strauss's autumnal period, seldom turns up is the challenges it poses to the orchestra, the lead soprano and the two supporting tenors. Under the conductor George Manahan the City Opera orchestra acquitted itself admirably. The coloratura Elizabeth Futral had a triumph on opening night as Daphne, singing with great agility, full but never forced sound, touching vulnerability and stamina, and scampering about the stage like a nature girl. The tenor Roger Honeywell as the shepherd Leukippos fared better than the tenor Robert Chafin in the killer role of Apollo, who compete for Daphne's affections. The whimsically updated costumes were more effective than the pointlessly cumbersome abstract set. Overall, though, the presentation is a rare chance for New York operagoers to experience a great work. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $105 (Anthony Tommasini).    ''THE MAGIC FLUTE.'' The Amato Opera, now in its 57th season, stages its productions on modest but generally attractive sets, and uses reduced orchestrations and singers who can often be described as enthusiastic amateurs. But there is an evident devotion to opera and its composers in the company's work, as well as an intimacy that should well serve the symbolic world of Mozart's ''Magic Flute,'' performed here in English. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m. The Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $30, $25 for students and 65+ (Allan Kozinn).    ''OTELLO.'' Opera buffs who are counting on Ben Heppner to be the Heldentenor of our time were understandably worried when he endured some vocal troubles in recent seasons. So his vocally splendid performance in the daunting title role of Verdi's ''Otello'' on the opening night of the Metropolitan Opera was something to cheer about. His clarion top notes and dusky-toned middle range singing easily soared over the orchestra, and he shaped Verdi's melodies with an elegant suppleness. He may have had opening-night jitters, though, for dramatically his work was tentative and he seemed too focused on his voice. The soprano Barbara Frittoli as Desdemona was not as much a support as she might have been. Her singing was sumptuous but a little bland. Carlo Guelfi's Iago was also a disappointment, vocally robust but dramatically stiff. For the most part James Levine's conducting had organic sweep, excitement and great nuance. Now that Mr. Heppner has proved to himself that he can nail this role vocally, he will surely take more emotional risks. The overall performance should gain confidence as the run continues. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200 (Tommasini).    ''PLATÉE.'' There is an element of meanness in Rameau's ''Platée,'' the French baroque comédie-lyrique, which has returned to the New York City Opera in Mark Morris's enchanting production. Mr. Morris, who directed and choreographed the work, does not shy away from the cruelty in the story, which surely is just as Rameau intended. To teach his jealous wife Juno a lesson, Jupiter pretends to fall in love with Platée, a homely, part-amphibian marsh nymph who carries on like the grand dame of the swamp creatures. As costumed by Isaac Mizrahi, Platée may look ridiculous, with her frog skin, webbed feet and hands, and a sagging breast and tummy disguised by a sheer greenish gown. But as played by the diminutive and riveting tenor Jean-Paul Fouchécourt, Platée is an endearing diva. It's funny, yes, but heartbreaking to see her so blithely duped. The winning cast includes members of the Mark Morris Dance Group, wildly costumed as frogs, snakes, nymphs and such. Daniel Beckwith conducts. New York City Opera. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $115 (Tommasini).    ''LA RONDINE.'' Puccini's seldom-heard opera ''La Rondine'' (''The Swallow''), long considered the composer's problem-child opera, gets a boost of confidence in a lovely production by the New York City Opera, a revival of a staging by the director Lotfi Mansouri from 1995. In ''La Rondine,'' Puccini tries to capture some of the sensibilities of a Viennese operetta, so his typically emotive musical voice feels somewhat reined in. But the score, filled with Puccini's Italianate brand of Viennese waltzes and some wistfully beautiful melodies, wins you over. The soprano Pamela Armstrong gives a poignant and vocally rich portrayal of Magda, a courtesan in Paris who runs off to Nice with the smitten young Ruggero, but, fearing his rejection if he were to know the truth of her past, returns to her kept life. Gerard Powers brings boyish charm and a nice, warm lyric tenor voice to the role of Ruggero. Also winning are Tracey Welborn as the wry young poet Prunier and Angela Turner Wilson as Lisette, Magda's perky maid, whom Prunier adores. In his City Opera debut Stephen Lord conducts an undulant account of this undervalued work. Tonight at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $27 to $105 (Tommasini).    ''DIE WALKÜRE.'' James Levine, who has long claimed Wagner's ''Ring'' for himself at the Metropolitan Opera, has turned over the podium to Valery Gergiev for a revival of ''Die Walküre,'' the second of the four ''Ring'' operas. Mr. Gergiev brings a different approach to the score: more rhapsodic, less structural; fleeter overall, though less sublime than Mr. Levine at his best. But Mr. Gergiev has also brought a roster of singers from the Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg, all of whom have won acclaim in the Kirov's productions of the complete ''Ring'' in the last few years. The soprano Olga Sergeeva -- young, slender, agile, appropriately wild-eyed and at home sporting golden ringlets and breastplate -- is a Brünnhilde right out of a storybook of Nordic myths. Her voice has a cool Nordic coloring to match, and she sings with energy and considerable power. Her tone can be hard-edged, though, and her pitch wavered at the end of the opening night. Another star of the Kirov, the bass Vladimir Vaneev, who was ill for the first performance, is to sing Wotan tomorrow. The ageless Plácido Domingo still brings vocal charisma and riveting artistry to his portrayal of Siegmund, though he has to work harder vocally that he used to. The bass Stephen Milling is a chilling Hunding. The soprano Adrianne Pieczonka takes over the role of Sieglinde. Tomorrow at 12:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215 (Tommasini).    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC. This intimate floating concert hall, moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, is a wonderful place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while taking in striking views of the lower Manhattan skyline. Tonight, the pianist Terry Eder plays a recital of works by Chopin, Ravel, Brahms and others. Tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon will feature an ensemble of barge regulars playing Shostakovich's brilliant Piano Quintet along with works by Schubert and Strauss. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: tonight, $35; Saturday and Sunday, $40; students, $25. An additional free concert will take place tomorrow at 1 p.m. (Jeremy Eichler).    BEAUX-ARTS TRIO. The revered pianist Menahem Pressler, having celebrated his 80th birthday at the Metropolitan Museum last season with a variety of events, continues full steam ahead. Here he leads his younger colleagues in the Beaux-Arts Trio, which is itself (at least in the person of Mr. Pressler) celebrating its 50th anniversary. The players are obviously counting on even greater longevity, as they begin a three-year survey of Beethoven trios and sonatas with the ''Ghost'' Trio, a violin sonata (Op. 23) and a cello sonata (Op. 69). Tonight at 8, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $45 (James R. Oestreich).    EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK. This group, directed by Frederick Renz and long known as the New York Ensemble for Early Music, has spearheaded a new 10-day festival, the New York Early Music Celebration, which begins with a variety of events around the city tonight. Mr. Renz and company chime in loudly tomorrow with Handel's original festive orchestrations of the ''Royal Fireworks Music'' and the ''Water Music,'' deploying 60 players (12 of them oboists). This promises to be a highlight of the festival, and not just for sheer volume. Tomorrow night at 8, Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212) 280-0330. Tickets: $40 (Oestreich).    LIONHEART. As part of the New York Early Music Celebration -- a 10-day celebration of medieval through Classical music and the ensembles that specialize in it -- this superb vocal ensemble is reviving ''My Fayre Ladye,'' a program of music from Tudor England. As the title suggests, women are the subject of these works by William Cornysh, John Dunstable, John Browne and others, with both sacred and amorous imagery interspersed. Tonight at 6:30, St. Ignatius of Antioch Episcopal Church, 522 West End Avenue, at 87th Street. (212) 864-1217. Tickets: $25; $15 for students and 65+ (Kozinn).    MORITZBURG FESTIVAL. Think Marlboro Festival, but think German baroque: in 1993, three young musicians, inspired by Marlboro, founded the Moritzburg Festival in a castle in eastern Germany (near Dresden). The experiment seems to have worked: now under the sole direction of the cellist Jan Vogler, the festival has spawned attention, CD's and a New York debut last fall. It returns to Weill Recital Hall on Sunday with a program that runs the gamut from Mozart to the New York premiere of a new piece by the pianist Olli Mustonen. Also featured are Shostakovich's G minor quintet, op. 57, and Brahms's op. 36 sextet; Mr. Vogler, Mr. Mustonen and the violist Cynthia Phelps are among the performers. Sunday afternoon at 2, Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $30 (Midgette).    MOZARTEAN PLAYERS. Currently in its 25th anniversary season, this fine period-instrument group has persevered through all the vicissitudes of New York's early music scene. At the ensemble's core is a piano trio (Stanley Ritchie, violin; Myron Lutzke, cello; and Steven Lubin, piano) but the group expands with guest artists as the occasion demands. This performance, part of the New York Early Music Celebration, will feature the trio alone in works by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. Sunday at 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. Free, though tickets are required (Eichler).    POMERIUM. This most venerable of New York's early-music vocal ensembles, founded in 1972 and led by Alexander Blachly, consistently presents programs that offer both beautiful singing and scholarly enlightenment. Its contribution to the New York Early Music Celebration is a program that explores the musical exchange that took place between Burgundy and Spain during the 16th century, after the marriage of Philip the Fair and Juana of Castille. The music includes works by Ockeghem, Gombert, Victoria and Morales. Sunday at 4 p.m., Music Before 1800, Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights. (212) 666-9266. Tickets: $25 to $40; $20 to $35 for students and 62+ (Kozinn).    Dance    ''BALLETS RUSSES TO BALANCHINE: DANCE AT THE WADSWORTH ATHENEUM.'' This exhibition, which pays tribute to George Balanchine's centennial, addresses the brilliance of Serge Diaghilev's productions for his Ballets Russes and the dawn of 20th-century modernism with costumes, archival material and art of the time. Through Jan. 2. Museum hours: Wednesdays through Fridays 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wadsworth Atheneum, 600 Main Street, Hartford, Conn. (860) 278-2670. Admission: $10 for adults; $8 for 62+; $5 for youth from 13 through college; children 12 and under free (Jennifer Dunning).    BIG DANCE THEATER. It would be hard to imagine more disparate influences than President Richard Nixon's Watergate tapes and the adult diaries of Kaspar Hauser, the 19th-century ''wild child'' found abandoned in a German forest. Throw in the Old Testament, Kabuki dance and Taiwanese movie music and you have ''Plan B,'' a shimmering strand of evocative storytelling that manages to suggest a great deal about innocence in all its guises. Paul Lazar, who directs the company with Annie-B Parson, is a fascinatingly unreadable Nixon. Today and tomorrow (and Wednesdays through Saturdays through Oct. 9) at 7:30 p.m. Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Manhattan, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $25 (Dunning).    ESSE AFICIONADO. In ''Event Horizon,'' this collective of modern dancers presents new choreography by Gina Graham and Maki Morinoue in a setting that resembles a sea of icicles. Tonight at 9, tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m.. Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, West Village, (212) 560-4825. Tickets:$15 (Jack Anderson).    FALL FOR DANCE FESTIVAL.

In this first of two programs, Ms. Fenley will present her new ''Lava Field,'' with music by John Bischoff, and two recent pieces, ''Kuro Shio,'' which fuses Chinese and Western sensibilities to music by Bun-Ching Lam, and ''Water Courses,'' set to a vocal composition by the poet Joy Harjo.

Tuesdays through Saturdays from noon to 6 p.m. (Dunning).    ''FOREVER TANGO.'' Luis Bravo's ''Forever Tango'' features sultry and comical dancers and first-rate musicians in a show, extended through Nov. 28, that is both tacky and transcendent. Today (and Tuesdays and Thursdays) at 8 p.m.; tomorrow (and Wednesdays) at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $46 to $86 (Dunning).    NOEMIE LaFRANCE. After having her way with steep old Manhattan stairways and dark garages, Ms. Lafrance takes on a field in Westchester in ''Unseen: Landscape,'' an hourlong site-specific dance. Sunday at 2 p.m., followed by a discussion. (Rain date is Sunday Oct. 10.) Neuberger Museum of Art, State University of New York at Purchase, N.Y. www.sensproduction.org (Dunning).    LIMÓN DANCE COMPANY. A company devoted to dramatic and emotional expressiveness presents two mixed programs of noted modern-dance works of the past and contemporary creations. Program A: tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 2 p.m., features ''Extreme Beauty,'' a new work by the German choreographer Susanne Linke, along with pieces by Lar Lubovitch and the company's founder, José Limón. Program B: tomorrow at 2 p.m. and Sunday at 7:30 p.m., brings together dances by Jiri Kylian, Donald McKayle, Daniel Nagrin, Adam Hougland and Limón.

Tonight through Sunday night at 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15 (Anderson).    ''OKINAWA KUMIODORI.''

There will also be a workshop in traditional Okinawan dance and music tomorrow from 2 to 4 p.m. at Japan Society. Tickets: $30 (Dunning).    STREB S.L.A.M. You could say Elizabeth Streb is sitting pretty, with her own 150-seat studio-theater in which to create new dances, regularly presented. But no one sits for long at a Streb program. The dancers fly, dive and dangle in new and recent pieces. The audience can walk around, as at a fairground, with popcorn provided. Today and tomorrow (and Fridays and Saturdays through Nov. 20) at 7 p.m.; Sunday (and Sundays through Nov. 21) at 3 p.m. S.L.A.M.

Historians have dealt harshly with the period following the revolutions that swept through the cities of Europe in 1848. Repressive, reactionary, stuffed with overblown eclectic buildings, the third quarter of the 19th century was dominated by bad faith and bad taste. Yet this was also the era that gave us the cosmopolis, the dazzling hub of industrial and imperial prosperity, a place designed to be not only a home to its citizens but also a host to the rest of the world.   The year 1848 is remembered more for barricades than for buildings","excerpt":"in France, Italy, Germany, Austria and Spain, workers and students took to the streets to fight for a litany of socialist demands. The year is also remembered as a time of disillusionment, a season when European artists and intellectuals lost their faith in social progress. Many artists adopted the oppositional stance that persists, in somewhat fossilized form, to this day. But something more profound than utopian hope perished in the uprisings of 1848. Neither wholly of the middle class nor fully estranged from it, many artists lost a clear sense of which side of the barricades they were on.

Now Playing    * 'RED LIGHTS' Starring Jean-Pierre Darroussin and Carole Bouquet. Directed by Cédric Kahn (not rated, 106 minutes","excerpt":"in French with English subtitles). This brilliant, sinister French thriller is a twisty road movie in which every sign points toward catastrophe. As night falls during the journey of an unhappily married couple from Paris to Bordeaux, the clogged highway takes them into descending levels of psychosexual hell. Mr. Darroussin's Antoine is a mousy, balding insurance salesman who hates his job and resents his more successful wife, a sleek corporate lawyer. The movie is a study of male passive aggression that comes up with a malicious Hemingwayesque solution to Antoine's masculinity crisis. When his wife, fed up with his drinking on the road, deserts him to take the train, he picks up a hitchhiker he knows may be a dangerous escaped convict and courts the redemptive (and grisly) male rite of passage he's been seeking. Following Jean-Luc Godard's ''Weekend'' and Claire Denis's ''Friday Night,'' ''Red Lights'' uses the traffic jam as a potent screen metaphor for something bigger.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses.    Now Playing    ''ALIEN VS. PREDATOR,'' starring Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova, Lance Henriksen and Ewen Bremner. Directed by Paul W. S. Anderson (PG-13, 110 minutes). Set in a Jules Verne world beneath the earth's surface in an incalculably ancient pyramid buried 2,000 feet beneath the Antarctic ice cap, Mr. Anderson's film imagines an apocalyptic conflict between two of 20th Century Fox's franchise monsters, on loan from ''Alien'' (1979) and ''Predator'' (1986). The humans, including Ms. Lathan as the world's greatest guide and Mr. Bremner, the Scottish character actor (''Trainspotting''), as a geologist, don't have much to do in ''Alien vs. Predator'' but put the plot in motion and stand back to watch it work, a precarious position that eventually claims most of them. Though it turns out that Mr. Anderson does have an idea for creating a rooting interest, it's too far-fetched even for fantasy, and the film turns into a cold but occasionally impressive special-effects extravaganza (Dave Kehr).    ''ALMOST PEACEFUL,'' starring Simon Abkarian, Lubna Azabal and Zabou Breitman. Directed by Michel Deville (not rated, 90 minutes","excerpt":"in French, with English subtitles). Movies about survival often divide between those that grimly insist on the triumph of the human spirit and those equally grim testaments to absolute despair. In ''Almost Peaceful,'' a gently observed film about Holocaust survivors from the French director Michel Deville, survival means something other than choked laughter and sentimental bromides or brute, animal struggle. Survival also means the modest, faltering steps the not-dead take toward the resumption of everyday normal life. Based on an autobiographical novel by Robert Bober, a French writer and filmmaker who worked as an assistant director on a few early François Truffaut features, ''Almost Peaceful'' opens in the summer of 1946. In an upstairs apartment on an anonymous Parisian street, Albert (Mr. Abkarian) and his sad-eyed wife, Léa (Ms. Breitman), are raising two young children and running a modest tailoring shop where most of the employees are other survivors. Amid the warm, enveloping hum of steady work and clattering machines, Jews who survived the death camps work side by side with Jews who evaded their horrors, fashioning a new world for themselves stitch by careful stitch (Manohla Dargis).    * ''BEFORE SUNSET,'' starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Directed by Richard Linklater (R, 80 minutes). Nine years after parting, in Vienna, at the end of ''Before Sunrise,'' Jesse (Mr. Hawke) and Celine (Ms. Delpy) rediscover each other in Paris and relive their brief encounter. This time it is even briefer: the film unfolds, without skipping a minute, in the hour or so before Jesse must catch a plane home to New York, and all those minutes are filled with looping, self-conscious talk as the reunited lovers wander along the Seine. Their intimacy is tinged with nostalgic regret. The airy sense of freedom that they shared in their early 20's has given way to the resignation of adulthood, even as they meander toward a second chance. The liberating sweetness of the earlier movie has mellowed into a saltier, sadder flavor, but Mr. Linklater, one of our most literate and intelligent directors, has not talked himself out of the possibility of romance, and the movie's relaxed, discursive structure is dense with implied feeling and oblique drama (A. O. Scott).    * ''THE BOURNE SUPREMACY,'' starring Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Brian Cox and Julia Stiles. Directed by Paul Greengrass (PG-13; 120 minutes). It may sound odd to call a chilly, paranoid thriller entertainment comfort food. But in the wake of 9/11 this globe-trotting post-cold-war melodrama full of standard cloak-and-dagger intrigue has the reassuring aroma of a home-cooked meal. There are no jihads or terrorists in sight and no apocalyptic scenarios, only dirty little secrets, as spies and counterspies from Russia and the United States tangle in a grubby story involving oil, sold secrets, murders and cover-ups. In this sequel to ''The Bourne Identity,'' many of the major hands who created the first film have returned, including Mr. Damon as Jason Bourne, the C.I.A.-trained assassin who still has serious memory problems and can't recall why he is being hunted by everybody, although blurry flashbacks leave him with clues. As before, he spends almost the entire movie on the run. The thriller reminds you that rhythms of film editing and collage-making have allowed Hollywood to make the chase movie a surefire format. Plot and character ultimately don't matter much in a film that's all about building and sustaining a mood in which visceral and emotional rhythms are blended into a high-gloss thrill ride (Stephen Holden).    *  ''BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS,'' starring Stephen Campbell Moore, Emily Mortimer and Dan Aykroyd. Written and directed by Stephen Fry (R, 105 minutes). Mr. Fry, a noted actor and sometime novelist, makes his directing debut with this adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's ''Vile Bodies,'' considered by many to be the funniest novel ever written in English. The movie honors its source with vigor and gusto, capturing both Waugh's cheeky humor and his dark, stringent moralism. Mr. Moore and Ms. Mortimer are touching and funny as the central couple, an impecunious aristocrat named Adam Symes and his long-term fiancée, Nina, but the picture is brought to life by its large supporting cast of both well-known and unknown British actors (and one Canadian, Mr. Aykroyd, playing a blustering press baron). The chaotic plot follows a gaggle of twittering, gilded youth through the cynical, gossip-ridden social whirl of pre-World War II Britain. The parallels with the present are obvious without being overdone, and Mr. Fry's exuberant, occasionally messy film departs from the usual stuffy conventions of costume drama (Scott).    * ''COLLATERAL,'' starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 115 minutes). In ''Collateral,'' the edgy new thriller from Mr. Mann, the city never sleeps; it doesn't even relax. Set in Los Angeles mostly after dark, after the city's sunshine has given way to cool noir, the story centers on a taxi driver, Max (Mr. Foxx), and the assassin, Vincent (Mr. Cruise), who hops a ride with him deep into the night. Pitched between interludes of anxious intimacy and equally nerve-shredding set pieces, ''Collateral'' scores its points with underhand precision. The film is about a lot of different things, about how Los Angeles lights up even at night, how cars become prostheses of ourselves and how driving with the radio on can be bliss. But as with all of Mr. Mann's movies, ''Collateral'' is finally about men and work, and about how being a man is itself a kind of job, which explains why this fastidiously made commercial film isn't just an entertainment, but a statement of personal faith (Dargis).    * ''THE DOOR IN THE FLOOR,'' starring Jeff Bridges, Kim Basinger and Jon Foster. Written and directed by Tod Williams (R, 111 minutes). Avoiding the traps of sentimentality and overdone whimsy that lie in wait for adaptors of John Irving's fiction, Mr. Williams has made a version of ''A Widow for One Year'' that is better than the book. Mr. Foster plays Eddie, a prep school student who spends a long, eventful summer working as an assistant to Ted Cole (Mr. Bridges), a famous writer and illustrator of children's books. Ted and his wife, Marion (Ms. Basinger), are still grieving over the loss of their two sons in a car accident years before, and their marriage is falling apart. All of this might have made maudlin, precious melodrama -- especially when Eddie and Marion begin their affair -- but rather than emphasize the plot, Mr. Williams makes it a relaxed, roomy landscape for the characters to roam around in. The cast rises above the occasional implausibility of the material, and the movie is funny, touching and understated. It is dominated by Mr. Bridges's performance, one of the finest pieces of screen acting by an American man so far this year, a heroically life-size portrait of wounded narcissism and masculine need (Scott).    ''EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING,'' starring Stellan Skarsgard and James D'Arcy. Directed by Renny Harlin (R, 114 minutes). Spinning heads, cascades of pea soup and your mother's Army boots are nowhere to be found in ''Exorcist: The Beginning,'' but lovers of the ridiculous may be delighted to know that the specter of little Linda Blair a-twitch and a-tremble is not entirely forgotten. A prequel to ''The Exorcist,'' William Friedkin's 1973 shocker in which Ms. Blair played a child hijacked by Beelzebub, this new film comes gussied up with some fine talent (it stars Mr. Skarsgard as the same character played by Max von Sydow in the original) and a bag of cheap tricks. But when push comes to demonic shove, hell apparently hath no fury like a woman in green pancake makeup, just as surely as some producers have no shame. Despite Mr. Harlin's reliance on shock cuts and loud noises, however, the film singularly fails to deliver any palpable shivers. Perhaps more expectedly it does afford the occasional and presumably unintended laugh (Dargis).    * ''GARDEN STATE,'' starring Zach Braff, Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard. Written and directed by Mr. Braff (R, 102 minutes). This small, smart, off-kilter comedy has the cheek to present itself as ''The Graduate 2004,'' although its affectionate subversion of a popular classic also stamps it as ''The Anti-Graduate 2004.'' From its story of the waking up of an emotionally numbed young man (Mr. Braff) to its editorial use of a contemporary pop soundtrack, the movie obsessively refers to that 1967 generational landmark. The New Jersey suburban landscape to which Andrew, Mr. Braff's 26-year-old alter ego, returns from self-imposed exile in Los Angeles, is a universe apart from the lotus land where he has lived for the last nine years in a chemical stupor. Because ''The Graduate'' established the stock vision of suburban alienation that has persisted through ''American Beauty'' and beyond, you expect ''Garden State'' to uphold the cliché. Instead, it allows Andrew to discover some nuggets of spiritual gold in the East Coast wasteland he dreaded revisiting. As precocious filmmaking debuts tend to be, ''Garden State'' is too self-conscious by half, but its struggle to revitalize a cliché by turning it inside out is a worthy one (Holden).    ''HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE,'' starring John Cho and Kal Penn. Directed by Danny Leiner (R, 87 minutes). This stoner, gross-out comedy has one foot here and one foot there. The here is a politically savvy universe where the title characters, 22-year-old New Jersey roommates who are Asian-American (Mr. Cho) and Indian-American (Mr. Penn), puncture ethnic stereotypes. The other foot is rutted knee-deep in the muck of perpetual puerility according to Hollywood. The movie is a sub-sub-''After Hours'' odyssey in which the title characters, while stoned on a Friday night, catch a galloping case of the munchies from a television advertisement for White Castle burgers and embark on an all-night search through the wilds of New Jersey for the nearest outlet. Along the way the pair are menaced by a gang of extreme-sports punks, a rabid raccoon and a computer-generated cougar they use as a getaway horse. Surviving one mishap after another, the pair finally arrive by hang-glider at their junk food shrine. The chemistry between the two is as old as Abbott and Costello (Holden).    ''LITTLE BLACK BOOK,'' starring Brittany Murphy and Holly Hunter. Directed by Nick Hurran (PG-13, 97 minutes). With Ms. Murphy starring as an ambitious associate producer of a trashy television talk show, this movie aspires to be a dewy-eyed self-help fable for ambitious young women folded into a mean-spirited satire of Jerry Springer-style reality programming. Offering few laughs and a climactic scene of breathtaking cruelty, the plot-heavy film draws you against your will into its malignant force field. Almost from the beginning, its sugary and rancid strains work against each other. To put it another way, ''Little Black Book'' would like to be a wised-up but still starry-eyed ''Working Girl'' and a more acerbic ''Broadcast News.'' In trying to be both things at once, it can't hold a candle to either forerunner. Batting her large, vacant eyes and sucking her lower lip into a pout, Ms. Murphy suggests a dumbed-down Meg Ryan with a gloss of Melanie Griffith (Holden).    * ''THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE,'' starring Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber. Directed by Jonathan Demme (R, 130 minutes). Mr. Demme, updating John Frankenheimer's classic exercise in cold war liberal paranoia, wisely treats the original as a touchstone rather than a template, and his movie, in spite of some narrative flaws, stands on its own as a witty, anxious thriller for a new age of political uncertainty. Mr. Washington plays Ben Marco, a veteran of the Persian Gulf of 1991. Haunted by nightmares, he tries at once to hold on to his sanity and unravel a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels of corporate and political power. Mr. Schreiber is a young congressman propelled toward the vice presidency by his monstrous mother, played with ice-chomping glee by Ms. Streep. The convolutions of the story are less important than the vigor of the performances, and the movie wears its attenuated political relevance lightly. Which may be a good thing, since this ''Candidate'' is, in the end, a breathless and intricate thriller about the continuing need for campaign finance reform (Scott).    * ''MARIA FULL OF GRACE,'' starring Catalina Sandino Moreno and Yenny Paola Vega. Written and directed by Joshua Marston (R, 101 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). It's painfully understandable why the 17-year-old title character of this gripping Colombian film would risk her freedom and even her life to be a drug mule. The movie follows the desperate plunge of Maria (Ms. Sandino) from a dead-end job as an assembly-line worker in a Colombian flower factory into the drug-smuggling underworld. Her dangerous undertaking is her last resort when she finds herself unemployed and pregnant. Before the story zeroes in on the harrowing details of drug running and its dangers, it details Maria's hopelessly circumscribed life in a rural village. If her story is a template for countless others like it, what keeps your heart in your throat is Maria herself. In a performance that feels more lived in than acted, Ms. Sandino's Maria is an attractive, smart, spirited young woman who faces the challenge of fending for herself with a fierce determination and ingenuity that compromise but never undermine her essential decency and morality. The movie sustains a documentary authenticity that is as astonishing as it is off-handed. Even while keeping you on the edge of your seat, it never sacrifices a calm, clear-sighted humanity for the sake of melodrama or cheap moralizing (Holden).    ''OPEN WATER,'' starring Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis. Written and directed by Chris Kentis (R, 79 minutes). In this minimalist, digital video thriller, a tourist couple spend their vacation trying not to be eaten by sharks. ''I wanted to go skiing,'' complains Susan (Ms. Ryan), and you can hardly blame her. She and Daniel (Mr. Travis), her boyfriend, out for a morning of scuba diving, have been left behind by the charter boat, and they bob up and down, fighting panic, exhaustion and each other in a desperate struggle to survive. The film, simply and efficiently shot without special effects or well-known actors, evokes some deep and primal fears, but it is ultimately too small, too under-dramatized, to provoke anything more intense than squirming discomfort. Susan and Daniel are so bland that they could be anybody, which is the problem, and your sympathy for them is fleeting, as if you had encountered them in a short, grisly item on the local evening news (Scott).    ''THE PRINCESS DIARIES 2: ROYAL ENGAGEMENT,'' starring Anne Hathaway, Chris Pine and Heather Matarazzo. Directed by Garry Marshall (G, 120 minutes). In the cardboard kingdom of Genovia, the setting for this new feature-length fairy tale, the streets are as scrubbed of dirt and personality as a Disney theme park. A mythic European country where everyone speaks accented English by way of Britain, France and Brooklyn, Genovia is the adopted home of Princess Mia (Ms. Hathaway), a onetime San Francisco teenager-turned-Old-World pretender. Unlike Pinocchio, Mia doesn't hang her wish on just any star; she hangs it on the movie-made promise that every girl can find her inner princess and, like, you know, rule. Directed by Mr. Marshall, who's been selling wish-fulfillment fantasies for years, most notably in ''Pretty Woman,'' and written by Shonda Rhimes, ''The Princess Diaries 2'' combines a classic storybook scenario, in which the former ugly duckling refines her swan standing, with the usual self-help uplift. This time around, the princess who would be queen learns what the rest of us know already: happy movie endings generally come to those women who eat their independence and, in time, a wedding cake, too (Dargis).    ''SHE HATE ME,'' starring Anthony Mackie and Kerry Washington. Directed by Spike Lee (R, 138 minutes). In his flailingly angry new comedy, Mr. Lee carries his political exasperation beyond outrage into chaos. The carelessness with which the director hurls his feelings about hot-button topics onto the screen is the filmmaking equivalent of last-ditch marketing: grab everything in sight, roll it up into a big, messy mud ball and hurl it against the wall, hoping that something sticks. Lashing out in all directions, the director addresses white-collar crime, the Bush administration, AIDS in Africa, the Mafia, Watergate, sex and reproduction, lesbianism and the meaning of family in a disoriented rant that lurches from one subject to the next with little to tie it together. A sex farce one minute, a crude political skit the next, an imitation ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' harangue the next, ''She Hate Me'' can't maintain its focus long enough to say anything fresh. The boilerplate polemics mouthed by stick-figure characters sound like the beery 3 a.m. debates of a college bull session (Holden).    ''THE VILLAGE,'' starring Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix and Adrien Brody. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 120 minutes). Mr. Shyamalan remains our leading cinematic rug-puller, but the carpet grows ever more threadbare. This time, he populates a preindustrial Pennsylvania village with an impressive cast of elders and youngsters, who almost never use contractions and who live in fear of some scary creatures in the surrounding woods. As ever, Mr. Shyamalan uses the classic techniques of movie suspense (and James Newton Howard's sinister score) to conjure an atmosphere of mystery and dread, which vanishes even before the big plot twist sends the picture spinning into silly, pretentious allegory. Don't worry, I won't spoil the surprise. It spoils itself (Scott).    ''WE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE,'' starring Mark Ruffalo, Laura Dern, Peter Krause and Naomi Watts. Directed by John Curran (R, 103 minutes). Meticulously adapted from two novellas by Andre Dubus, Mr. Curran's film is a somber anatomy of two marriages in crisis. Mr. Ruffalo's Jack, who teaches literature at a small college, is having an affair with Edith (Ms. Watts), the wife of his best friend, a writer named Hank (Mr. Krause), who has a fling with Jack's wife, Terry (Ms. Dern). It is all a bit too symmetrical -- a bedroom farce without a sense of humor -- and the characters float free of any credible social context. But this dark, cracked crystal of a film nonetheless works as a kind of marital film noir, with the threat of emotional violence hanging over every scene. The actors give brave, unshowy performances, especially Ms. Dern, who lets go of any trace of actorly vanity, and Mr. Ruffalo, who portrays male weakness with an honesty rarely seen in American movies (Scott).

In the early books, the hopelessness is bitter and destructive","excerpt":"in her middle and late period, it is flailing and ironical.   Published separately in the early 1960's, her first three novels are now reissued as ''The Country Girls Trilogy.'' As always, Miss O'Brien addresses the old misunderstanding between men and women. Her characters live in what Aldous Huxley called ''a hostile symbiosis,'' a deep, historical distrust. There is little friendliness or good will between the sexes in this village in western Ireland: each sees the other as a punishment for the ancient sin of desire.   This is the life that Kate, the narrator of the first two novels, and her friend Baba are born into. While Miss O'Brien underlines their isolation by more or less ignoring events outside the village, the time seems to be the 1930's or 40's. Women, including the girls' mothers, are swept into the corner by convention, by Irish Catholicism and perhaps by Miss O'Brien. Men repair -the word is apt - to the pub.

M. Coetzee's ''Slow Man.'' The omission of Rushdie's novel from the contest's shortlist seems particularly startling -- if only because the Booker's chief judge this year, the critic John Sutherland, reviewed ''Shalimar the Clown'' in The Evening Standard not long ago and said that it displays Rushdie ''writing at his best.'' There's not much consolation for Rushdie on this week's best-seller list, where ''Shalimar the Clown'' does not appear. (You can find it instead on the hardcover fiction extended list, available online, where it makes its debut at No. 18.) None of Rushdie's first three novels, ''Grimus'' (1975), ''Midnight's Children'' (1981) and ''Shame'' (1983), made the Times list. His commercial breakthrough was ''The Satanic Verses,'' which spent nine weeks at No. 1 on the hardcover fiction list in 1989, knocking off a Danielle Steel confection called ''Star,'' after Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran declared that Rushdie had been ''sentenced to death.'' Since that time, each of Rushdie's novels has made the list in hardcover -- ''The Moor's Last Sigh'' for four weeks in 1996, ''The Ground Beneath Her Feet'' for one week in 1999 and ''Fury,'' also for one week, in 2001. Rushdie won't take home the Man Booker this year, but he's already got that competition more or less licked -- in 1993 ''Midnight's Children'' won what was called the ''Booker of Bookers'' for the best novel in the 25-year history of the award.     WORKING-CLASS HERO: Barbara Ehrenreich's new book, ''Bait and Switch: The (Futile) Pursuit of the American Dream,'' enters the hardcover nonfiction list this week at No. 8, while her previous book, ''Nickel and Dimed,'' hangs onto the paperback list at No. 4. ''Nickel and Dimed,'' published in 2001, has become a publishing phenomenon -- it spent more than three months on the Times hardcover list and has now spent 94 weeks on the list in softcover. In ''Nickel and Dimed,'' Ehrenreich went undercover to work low-wage jobs","excerpt":"in her new book she explores the world of the white-collar unemployed. Critics have not, in general, been kind to ''Bait and Switch.'' But ''Nickel and Dimed,'' after the swamping of New Orleans, seems timelier than ever. ''It made complete sense to me that thousands of New Orleans residents wouldn't be able to evacuate the city,'' Ehrenreich told The Hartford Courant. ''They don't have cars. They don't have credit cards. A single illness or injury could cost them their jobs, because they occupy low-wage positions where the most important requirement is simply showing up for work.

Created in 1939 by Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff, Blue Note advanced by fits and starts into the mid-1950's, when it developed an utterly distinct style -- in sound engineering  and album cover graphics as well as in music. Until it was sold in 1967, the label commanded the loyalty of a generation of jazz lovers. Lion was the producer, the one who signed artists and supervised recordings. Wolff apparently administered the business end, but he was also a photographer, and he chronicled the Blue Note sessions for 28 years, chiefly for the album jackets. Although a few Wolff portraits became instant classics, many were reduced to postage-stamp  size by his art director, and the reputation of his work suffered. THE BLUE NOTE YEARS: The Jazz Photography of Francis Wolff (Rizzoli, $65), with text by the veteran record executives Michael Cuscuna and Charlie Lourie, is an opulent tribute to a photographer whose style was as individual as the music he illustrated. Roaming the studio during rehearsals, Wolff caught his subjects in  meditation and in action, during performance and playback -- but always in a harsh light that freezes every hair with icy clarity. Occasionally he captured two or three musicians in one frame, but usually he went after solitary figures","excerpt":"in highlighting the angularity of their faces, he managed to flatter the convictions and talent of a surprisingly homogeneous group of black men. (The presence of only two women and fewer than a dozen white men is representative of Blue Note, and another aspect of its uniqueness.) The luminous assurance is pervasive in images as superficially varied as Miles Davis smiling, Art Blakey scowling, Joe Henderson smoking, Dexter Gordon laughing and Hank Mobley playing.

He made his Off Broadway directorial debut pumping Lanford Wilson's lowlife drama ''Balm in Gilead'' full of Bruce Springsteen and Tom Waits music, transforming it into a street opera. John Malkovich made such a stunning first impression as a maniacal performer and rock and roll ringmaster that when he directed Kevin Kline and Raul Julia in George Bernard Shaw's ''Arms and the Man'' at Circle in the Square last summer, many theatergoers were perplexed by the production's gentleness and romanticism.

Bolton, President Bush's nominee to be ambassador to the United Nations. A former chief of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, Carl W. Ford Jr., is expected to testify that Mr. Bolton tried to squelch intelligence at odds with administration policies. Senator Lincoln Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island and a pivotal vote on the committee, has said he is reserving final judgment on the nominee.    Behind the Politics -- This is shaping up as a test of an administration that may have lost clout on Capitol Hill for its positions on Social Security and the Terri Schiavo case. Mr. Bolton, a critic of the United Nations, is something of a lightning rod for those who contend the administration is too unilateralist in foreign affairs. Senate staff members have said that while the odds favored confirmation, it was not a foregone conclusion.    Philip J. Purcell  The News -- Morgan Stanley's chief executive, Philip J. Purcell, is trying of stave off an attempt by eight retired executives to force him to resign. Whoever wins, the company is likely to emerge smaller and less powerful. Moreover, the longer the nasty and public scrap goes on -- weakening the company -- the greater the chances that it could become a takeover target.    Behind the Fight -- Bigger is only sometimes better. Mr. Purcell merged Dean Witter with Morgan Stanley in 1997, a combination of investment banking and retail brokerage that never worked very well. Today, bigger banks have more money tied up in deals, and smaller ones are faster and more focused.    Meanwhile, neither side in the contretemps has adequately explained how it intends to restructure the company's businesses to produce better results than Mr. Purcell has so far delivered.    Ming Kuang Chen  The News -- A restaurant deliveryman from China who speaks virtually no English spent three days in a high-rise elevator in the Bronx, while the police searched for him. Mr. Chen finally emerged, dehydrated but otherwise fine, after someone heard the elevator's alarm. No one knows why it took so long.    Behind the Ordeal -- The story is a reminder of how big the city is, and how many people get lost in it. Sometimes they literally lose themselves, on the subway or on the streets. Other times they lose themselves in different, more tragic ways. For example, deliverymen often fall prey to criminals, and there was concern that Mr. Chen was just one more victim.     When a building maintenance man finally did speak to Mr. Chen over the elevator intercom, he couldn't understand him and thought he was a drunk.    Tom Delay  The News -- The House majority leader, Tom DeLay, the subject of a campaign fund-raising inquiry in Texas, faces questions in Washington about overseas travel sponsored by outside groups and his wife and daughter, who were reported in The New York Times to have received more than $500,000 since 2001 from his political action and campaign committees. While Republicans continued last week to rally to his defense, a few have begun to question how long Mr. DeLay can withstand the onslaught of bad news.    Behind the Support -- How far does, or should, party discipline go? What is the tipping point for a party leader? While Republicans publicly continue to attribute Mr. DeLay's troubles to liberals in the news media and Democratic attack groups, some have begun to speak privately about their sense that his standing is in danger, particularly if there are more developments.    Mariano Rivera  The News -- As the baseball season begins, Mariano Rivera of the Yankees, possibly the best late-inning relief pitcher of all time, is struggling. In his first appearance last week against the Boston Red Sox, he gave up a ninth-inning home run","excerpt":"in his second, he allowed three hits, three walks and the Yankees lost. Moreover, Rivera, noted for his imperturbable confidence on the mound, looked shaky and unsure.    Behind the Performance -- Rivera told reporters, ''I will leave if I don't have confidence.'' But athletic confidence is an notoriously fragile thing. When it goes, it can go for a minute, for a day, forever. Rivera has been a key to the Yankees' success since he came to the major leagues in 1995, and no one really knows how the team would fare without him, so used are they to his coming in to nail down a win when the game is on the line.

The Soviet peace plan endorsed by Iraq and the ultimatum for immediate withdrawal proposed by President Bush on Friday seem to indicate the end is near even if there is a ground war. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told Congress last week that \\"this downturn could well prove shorter and shallower than most prior postwar recessions.\\" And the Chinese and Hong Kong governments are working out their differences over a new airport in Hong Kong, which will provide a lift to the local economy. The estimates are that the Chinese economy could grow at a 5 percent rate this year, a big plus for Hong Kong, which is still China's gateway to the West.

Its emergency room treats more than 39,000 cases a year.\\n\\nDr. Glantz, 37, had the right qualifications, of course, but it was also his easygoing nature and sensitive and jovial bedside manner that he extends to co-workers, as well as patients, that made him boss of the E.R.  Dr. Glantz entered the field 10 years ago, when physicians in emergency rooms were still the Rodney Dangerfields of medicine. They got little, or no, respect not only from other physicians, but also from the public. \\n\\nBut the field was already changing from one populated by many residents, semiretired doctors and those not able to succeed in their chosen fields to high-quality board-certified physicians trained in emergency medicine. E.R.'s were moving from being subsections with little authority to full departments with real power.\\n\\n\\"While I still get asked sometimes when I'm getting a real job,\\" said Dr. Glantz, who works 10-to-12-hour shifts three of every six days, \\"this has become one of the hottest residencies now.\\" \\n\\n\\"We're no longer low man on the totem pole,\\" he said. \\"It is also one field where doctors don't have to wear beepers or be on call. And I get plenty of vacation, six weeks a year.\\"\\n\\nDr. Glantz had originally wanted to be a surgeon, but he grew to love the action, variety and times when seconds count and the adrenalin surges in emergency medicine. \\"I wouldn't do anything else,\\" said Dr. Glantz, whose face is lightly freckled and whose brown hair is beginning to gray. \\"I don't know how private doctors do it. I'd be bored to tears.\\" \\n\\nIn emergency medicine, doctors have to know something about everything, he said. In one day he might have to treat a head injury, stabilize a heart-attack victim, set broken bones and deliver a baby on a car seat.\\n\\n\\"But every time I get cocky enough to think I can handle everything,\\" Dr. Glantz said, \\"something comes through the door that we don't understand. It keeps me studying.\\"\\n\\nDr. Glantz's days vary dramatically. Sometimes, business is slow, and just a few of the 22 beds are occupied. \\n'We're Very Superstitious' \\n\\n Sometimes the ambulances never stop arriving. Like that cold winter night in 1990, when an Avianca jet crashed a few miles west of the hospital, sending a stream of ambulances carrying 11 trauma victims, five of them children. Or when the Walt Whitman Mall fire in 1991 sent to the hospital 22 smoke-inhalation victims and one burn victim, who later died.\\n\\n\\"We're very superstitious,\\" Dr. Glantz said. \\"We follow the moon. Actually, Mondays after holidays are usually bad, and summer is worse than winter, because weekend warriors are some of our best business. And beer and lawn mowers are a terrible combination. We had a guy in here who ran over his foot with one. He had a Meisterbrau in one hand and a lawn mower in the other. True story.\\" \\n\\nThree women arrived in the emergency room in one month, each complaining of unspecified abdominal pain and each in labor. \\"One of the women even had other children,\\" Dr. Glantz recalled. \\"Now that's real denial, when you are in labor and don't even know you're pregnant.\\"\\n\\nOn a recent Monday, which was slow, Dr. Glantz was tending a man who had a grand mal seizure at a friend's house and was taken by ambulance. The man, who had a history of seizures, was using medication to control them, but had forgotten to take it that morning or even for a few days. It was difficult for Dr. Glantz to get a straight story. He hears lies daily, he said, but he does not grow angry, because patients usually lie out of embarrassment.\\n\\nHuntington Hospital does not treat the same populations as many urban hospitals, but the community has changed dramatically in 20 years.\\n\\n\\"Long Island is no longer a bedroom community, where everyone is a homeowner with a two-car garage and 2.4 kids,\\" said Dr. Glantz, who grew up in Rosedale and earned his B.S. in chemistry at the State University at Stony Brook in 1977. \\"Now we have the Saturday night knife-and-gun club. We get slashings and knifings and shootings. Not as much as Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, but we get our fair share, if there is such a thing as a fair share.\\"\\n\\nJust after noon on that Monday, a young man accompanied his 12-year-old cousin, who had an earache. After a quick look at the boy's ears and throat, Dr. Glantz found the problem.  The right ear was bright red, a sure sign of an infection. Dr. Glantz told the boy about the eardrops and bubble-gum-tasting antibiotic that he would prescribe and shook his hand, but he gave no hint to the youth or his cousin that children's ear infections belong in a pediatrician's office, not in an emergency room.\\n\\nDr. Glantz was well aware that the boy, like an increasing number of people in the region, is in the Medicaid program. In the Huntington region, he said, there are virtually no physicians who treat Medicaid patients, because of the paperwork.\\n\\n\\"The nearest clinic that takes Medicaid is pretty far away, in Wyandanch,\\" he said. \\"And they are so swamped that this boy probably would not have been given an appointment until next week. Others have no health insurance at all. We're the safety net here. No one is turned away, which is one of the beauties of emergency medicine. I can treat everyone equally, from the homeless to someone from Lloyd Harbor who pulls up in a Rolls- Royce.\\"\\n\\nSuddenly a mother carrying a baby who was bleeding from the head rushed in. The woman explained that her car had skidded in Dix Hills and hit a tree. The windows on the driver's side shattered, and the baby, Jake, was in his car seat at the time.  \\"Well, that's good,\\" Dr. Glantz said. \\"Now let's take a look at him.\\" \\n\\nAs the mother let go, Jake began to cry. A nurse took off his diaper, which had glass shards in it. The mother winced and kissed the baby, who was five days away from his 1st birthday. She, too, started to cry. \\"He may have just been hit by some flying glass,\\" Dr. Glantz said. \\"And that would be good.\\" \\n\\nHe held a pen in front of Jake's face and told him to watch the rocket ship.  \\"See it come out of mommy's ear,\\" he said, as he checked the baby's pupils to see whether his brain was functioning properly. \\"Kids respond better when I act like a silly uncle.\\"\\n\\nAn hour later Dr. Glantz was looking at X-rays of Jake's head and chest. \\"Looks good,\\" he said. \\"Now I get to reassure the mom. That's what I like to do.\\" Her son needed several stitches. But before Dr. Glantz could sew the cuts on Jake's forehead he had to perform another operation, something that he called \\"a parentectomy,\\" or removing the parent from the room. \\"I have always found that the child does better when the parent is not in the room,\\" he said. \\n\\nWith a large bright light overhead, Dr. Glantz put Jake in a blue papoose, which the baby did not like. Jake began to cry. \\"I'm sorry, Pumpkin,\\" Dr. Glantz cooed. He injected a local anesthetic, checked for glass in the wounds and began stitching with a tiny curved needle. \\"This is where the art of medicine comes in,\\" he said, as he sewed nine tiny stitches across two small cuts. He cleaned the baby's head, which was red from numerous scrapes, and dabbed bacitracin on the area. \\"So do you hate me?\\" Dr. Glantz asked as he took Jake out of the papoose. Jake stopped crying.\\n\\n\\"Now we're buddies?\\" Dr. Glantz asked. \\"Give me five! Two and a half?\\" Dr. Glantz carried Jake to his mother, singing to him all the way.

The scenery is varied, often breathtaking. At Cannes there are long sandy beaches backed by resort hotels.

She also aided Cornell vitally in his projects that led, in 1974, to his founding of the International Center of Photography, in New York. For many years Edith single-handedly organized and maintained not only her husband's negatives and archives but also those of Cornell's late brother, Robert Capa, who was killed on assignment in Indochina in 1954. Furthermore, for hundreds of photographers from around the world Edith served as a kind of surrogate mother, always ready to provide a home away from home.

He may have been partly right. Mexico, it seems, tried mightily to prop up the peso, but last week that effort failed -- failed big. The peso, already weakening, plummeted when Mexico let it go into free-fall against the dollar. Some costs were quick: banks and other investors lost a bundle. And some will stick around: an abrupt loss of confidence in the new President, Ernesto Zedillo, and a fear of new economic chaos in a nation seemingly getting its footing. So how did the Mexican Miracle take such a nasty spill? Perhaps because that miracle was kept alive more on hope than on basics. The hope now: a new, solid beginning with the peso at a lower, more stable level.  Listen to the Children  Think of \\"hand-held electronic organizers\\" and you naturally think of sleek, solemn, hyped-up executives.

Casio, heeding the lesson, has started selling kid-level organizers in the United States. There's probably a lesson here for Apple Computer and its Newton \\"personal digital assistant\\": The children know. THE ECONOMY Carter Plays Softball  Talk about the sacred and the mundane! Jimmy Carter, hopping about the globe in a crusade for world peace, last week offered his services in a surprisingly humble dispute -- one in which, though feelings run high, no bloodshed seems likely. Yes, we're talking baseball, and Mr. Carter's gesture didn't seem to help. Players and owners have so far managed to erase a sizable business from the American map, and the owners just declared an impasse and decreed a salary cap -- when, that is, salaries are paid.  Of Owls and 'Welfare Cowboys'  On the environmental front, President Clinton just got his way in one battle and retreated from another. He put a lot of effort into resolving a dispute about logging in Northwest forests that house the fabled spotted owl, and the Administration came up with a plan allowing harvests at less than a fifth of 80's levels. And last week a Federal judge approved the plan. At the same time, Interior Secretary Babbitt backed down from a plan to increase grazing fees for public lands, leaving the issue to the Republicans. Environmentalists jumped hard on this one, with one lawyer predicting that Congress would \\"perpetuate subsidies for welfare cowboys.\\"  Open Gift, Insert Foot  The Christmas gift to clients -- it's usually a cliche so tired it's snoring on arrival. A bottle of Scotch, perhaps -- or maybe a bottle of Scotch. But now, into this imaginative void, leaps Raoul Felder. After Mr. Felder, a Manhattan divorce lawyer, dropped a knife on his foot some years ago, he was flooded with slippers of sympathy -- 150 pairs, which he then had to give away. Aha! he said, and a furry idea was born. This year, when gift season descended, he sent out 200 pairs of slippers that have a marked likeness to Mr. Felder -- hardly surprising, since he'd sent off multiple photographs and sketches to a slipper importer, which in turn got a Chinese factory to do the deed. With stuff like this, who needs lawyer jokes?  Tax, Spend, Cut, Duck  Robert Byrd hit it on the head last week. Gazing at the jumble of tax cuts and spending cuts sprouting on both sides of the aisle, Senator Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat, called it all \\"drag racing\\" that would end in a \\"demolition derby.\\" No sooner had President Clinton leaped for the tax-cut wagon than the Republicans yanked it from under him, saying spending cuts would have to come first. Sure enough, the next day Mr. Clinton came up with $24 billion in spending cuts, nearly half of it from the Energy Department. Newt Gingrich had no comment; \\"we have our own plan,\\" his press secretary said. All this commotion, and it isn't even Jan. 1 yet. Tax advice for '95: duck. Prancer for Vice President?  Perhaps it's part of the migration back to traditional values, perhaps it's just a cyclical quirk, but Santa Claus was hot, hot, hot this time around. Hallmark reports that the image of the revered Mr. Claus -- whether on card or gift wrap -- was especially strong, and Coke has splashed a jolly Santa on bottles and cans. And he's managed to put a pudgy, fur-draped foot squarely in the land of the serious (an episode on A&E's \\"Biography,\\" putting him in a league with F.D.R.) and the popular (a Better Homes and Gardens cover, in a league with Oprah and Di). Clearly, he'll be running for President in '96.  COMPANIES A Pentium in Time . . .  It was fun while it lasted -- watching the computer types debate the difference between \\"perfect\\" and \\"99.989 percent perfect\\" (or was it 99.898?). But the great Pentium drama seems to be over: last week Intel blinked, saying it would gladly replace those flawed chips. Andrew Grove, Intel's president, said he regretted a policy that \\"seemed arrogant and uncaring,\\" and the company ran large ads apologizing. The impact on Intel: of the five million Pentiums, perhaps a million will be replaced; at $100 a shot, that might cost Intel $100 million. Pretty minor, investors thought, as the stock shot up. The impact on you (if your computer has a Pentium): call (800) 628-8686 now, and you'll get a replacement, though it may take two months. Or wait a decade or two -- the offer's open-ended. But by then, of course, today's computers will seem like amusing antiques. . . . Did the Pentium, by the way, make Intel directors and executives nervous? Perhaps. In the last couple of months, as the crisis was unfolding, eight insiders sold more than 250,000 shares (roughly $15 million worth); in last year's fourth quarter, they sold none. . . . Windows a Bit Late  Just half an hour after Intel threw in the chip, Microsoft said the release of its new operating system would be delayed yet again, possibly till August. It's the successor to Windows 3.1 -- the giant-killer among operating systems -- and when it appears, it could rake in $1 billion in sales in a year. But so far it's been called Windows 95 -- not, as it turns out, the greatest name. At last report, no delay is expected in the onset of the new year, so \\"we may have to rename it,\\" a Microsoft executive said. But at least it seems determined to get it right before it goes public. Microsoft's shares took a fast dip. A Matter of a Few Zeros  When Prudential Securities agreed last week to pay $550,000 for making illegal political donations, it was the largest civil settlement ever for the Federal Election Commission. But put it in perspective: Prudential has paid more than 1,000 times that -- $700 million -- to settle civil and criminal charges linked to the sale of limited partnerships.  'Liberal Books Don't Sell'  Newt Gingrich once accused House Speaker Jim Wright of fuzzy ethics concerning sales of a book Mr. Wright had written (and earned $55,000 from). Soon, farewell Mr. Wright; five years later, enter Mr. Gingrich. And last week came reports that Mr. Gingrich had signed a $4 million-plus book contract with HarperCollins, a Murdoch publishing house. Representative David Bonior labeled the deal a \\"$4 million Christmas gift\\" from an empire that includes the Fox network, which faces a regulatory battle. A spokesman for Mr. Gingrich called Mr. Bonior \\"an attack dog.\\" As for Mr. Gingrich, he said, \\"Conservative books sell. I can't help it if liberal books don't sell.\\" Quick! Where's the Perfume?  Guess what, guys: the stores are on to you. It's a retailing axiom that merchants make half their annual sales during Macy's Gridlock Month (sometimes known as December, though it starts the second that Thanksgiving's over). But store executives know this bizarre season can be broken into more precise fragments. Last week, for instance, was the week of the panic shopper -- and \\"men,\\" a Bloomingdale's manager said with assurance, \\"are panic shoppers.\\" So if you dashed into a store and grabbed the first gifts you saw, you can be sure those gifts were deliberately placed in your line of sight -- and that just over the next rise of perfumes, clerks nodded knowingly.

There are unintegrated slums, of course, beginning at the foot of Carter Bridge on the island of Lagos, but many Nigerians live in the sprawling middle&#8208;class housing de velopments of Apapa, Surulere and Ikeja and also in the plushly suburban mansions of Ikoyi Island, where most foreign diplomats and businessmen reside. Nigeria is under military rule, and by law politicking is not permitted, but ebullient Lagos residents talk long and loud about the proposed return to civilian rule in 1976.Three schools of thought on the subject are most often heard: 1. That the military should continue to rule. 2. That a civilian government should take over. 3. That the new government should consist of a combination of civilian and military leaders. Other current topics  of conversation&#8212;in English, the official language of this former British possession, and in various African languages&#8212;include traffic jams, housing shortages, the building boom and other indicators of a fast&#8208;paced, oil&#8208;bolstered economic boom. In addition, people are talking about what promises to be the biggest of all African cultural celebrations, the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, which is scheduled for November and December, 1975. Early indications are that as many as 100,000 visitors will come to this city of about a million people for the festival. &#8220;Where are we going to put them?&#8221; residents ask.

Some 30 are African nations seeking to reverse a tragic fall in per capita income over the last two decades","excerpt":"in Latin America, many countries now have a chance to grow out of debt, and remarkable progress is being made in Eastern Europe, all in cooperation with the I.M.F.   The I.M.F. also assists its members to improve their economic efficiency. By helping countries move from state-run to market systems and reduce their foreign debt to sustainable levels, it contributes to laying the foundation for long-term sustainable growth. It is such growth that will eventually prevail against poverty and in some ways help the environment, too. The fight against poverty is the only way to avoid a situation where people are driven to destroy irreplaceable environmental assets, such as rain forests. The I.M.F. coordinates advice and support with other international agencies with environmental concerns and expertise.   Economic change and transformation are not costless. The I.M.F. encourages countries to develop social safety nets so that the more vulnerable segments of the population can, to the extent possible, be protected against the inescapable hardship of economic adjustment.   The advertisement and solicitation were inaccurate in suggesting that I.M.F.-supported programs are financed solely by United States taxpayers. The United States and 153 other members own shares in this cooperative institution; these pooled resources are used to extend credit and technical assistance to member countries in need. By making a contribution to the financial resources of the I.M.F., each country -- including the United States -- also establishes a right to draw on the institution, which it can exercise when a need arises.    An increase of the I.M.F.'s capital base is indispensable to enable it to face the unexpected needs of its members, such as those brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis. The best prospect for preserving the environment worldwide is to be found in encouraging and assisting countries to develop their economic potential, not by attacking as convenient targets agencies like the I.M.F. and the World Bank that are dedicated to that goal.

Well, yes. But the billowing cloaks and rippling cloths are exactly what Mr. Tetley's visions of Shakespeare's play are about.   The impact of the production is primarily visual rather than dramatic in narrative terms. The wholesale display of yard goods by Mr. Tetley and his designer, Nadine Baylis, is a conscious borrowing of stylized or symbolic props and fabrics in the Japanese and Chinese theater. On the conceptual level, this transposition of scenic techniques - embodied also in the ballet's Kabuki-style figures and martial arts sequences - is linked to the rapprochement Mr. Tetley makes between Chinese philosophy and the play.   It is an interpretation less readily found onstage than in the program notes found in the Academy's monthly, In Performance, published in conjunction with the Norwegian National Ballet's recent New York premiere of the ballet. Mr. Tetley writes: ''Prospero's speeches link with the thoughts of Heraclitus and Lao-tse: life is a paradox","excerpt":"in life we must accept death; to lose everything is to regain everything; our world is change; everything flows.''

They portray art. They depict in three dimensions the position art occupies in a given place and time. Bergamot Station, a sprawling complex of commercial art galleries in Santa Monica, may well be the most accurate portrait of the art world in the 1990's. An ad hoc collection of ramshackle metal sheds once occupied by a company that made hot-water heaters, Bergamot Station is an ideal  shelter for an art world stripped of the prosperity that covered it in the 1980's like a thick layer of goose fat.         There's no glamour here, no overt signs of prestige. Though the place is packed with people on Saturdays, Bergamot Station has no more charm than a weekend parking-lot flea market. The stained concrete pavement and the rough industrial materials usher us into a world far removed from the lofty Getty Center or the slick designs of PaceWildenstein and Gagosian, two blue chip New York galleries that recently opened Los Angeles branches amid great press fanfare.

His neighbors were on their roofs with shotguns. In the months after that, business collapsed because collectors from tonier parts of the city no longer wanted to go into his.

From the right, the Jeffersonian declaration that \\"all men are created equal\\" is under heavy attack from neo-Victorian elitists. From the tattered remnant that remains of the left, both Jefferson and the Declaration of Independence are derided as hypocritical on the grounds that Jefferson owned slaves.   Historians are right to dismiss the charge because it applies contemporary standards to a man who lived two centuries ago. As the Jefferson scholar Douglas Wilson points out, the question of why Jefferson held slaves gets us nowhere. The more interesting question is: Why did a man who inherited slaves and a fortune dependent upon them, and who lived in a society that was inured to slavery, decide at an early age that slavery was morally wrong and forcefully declare that it ought to be abolished? The answer is that Jefferson was exceptional, ahead of his time -- but not completely free of it.

After such fanfare, we were prepared to be disappointed. We were, but not—happily—so seriously as to make us discount everything the foreign reviewers had said. \\"Liebelei\\" is not epochal, but it is a charming, Old World, sensitively performed and absorbing photoplay which ends on a note of poignant tragedy.None too distinguished in its story, the picture relies entirely, and with merited confidence, upon the ability of its players to give it life. The names of most, if not all, the members of its cast are strange to local filmgoers, and that is a pity. For, in Magda Schneider the screen has a heroine of wistful beauty and rare talent","excerpt":"in Luise Ullrich an expert little comedienne; in Wolfgang Liebneiner and Willi Eichberger two extremely capable young men; in Gustaf Gruendgens a menacing heavy, and in Paul Hoerbiger an excellent character man. Obviously we have no right to regret that Hollywood has no monopoly on the world's talent, but we cannot help wondering how the Wonder City, with all its omniscience, missed Miss Schneider.The story upon which this skillful band lavishes its talents is that of the young Lieutenant Lobheimer, who, after an illicit and injudiciously managed affair with the Baroness Eggersdorf, finds his true love in the daughter of a musician. With rare charm and with quiet simplicity, their romance progresses happily and in ignorance of the rumors of scandal that now, belatedly, were reaching the Baron Eggersdorf's ears. The climax comes when the lieutenant, celebrating his final leave-taking of the Baroness and his newly found happiness, is challenged to a duel by the Baron and is killed. His sweetheart commits suicide.With so somber a tale at its mercy, the wonder of \\"Liebelei\\" is that it can at the same time be so mellow, radiant and tender a picture. But it is, and that can be attributed only to the players, their director and to the photography.

Not only as a painter and discerning collector but also as a critic for Partisan Review, Morris preached the gospel of abstraction when American abstract painters had few supporters.   An excellent exhibition here at the Williams College Museum of Art recalls the contributions of this exceptional couple by bringing together a selection of their paintings and of the art they collected by the likes of Braque, Picasso, Arp, Ben Nicholson and Joaquin Torres-Garcia. More than simply a tribute to Frelinghuysen and Morris, the show is also a reminder of a crucial but often overlooked period in the development of 20th-century American abstract art, just before the rise of the New York School in the 1940's and 50's.

New laws have already given patients the right to reject aggressive medical care. But recent developments, including the astonishing success of a do-it-yourself suicide manual and widespread fascination with a suicide machine invented by a Michigan doctor, proclaim that some patients want still more control at the end of life.   Doctors have become exceedingly proficient at prolonging life -- and prolonging dying -- with their technology: ventilators, pumps to assist the heart, antibiotics at $500 a dose.

The new success of Prada and Gucci, until recently more renowned for fashionable luggage than for what the fashionable might carry inside, has been a double insult.

Hemlines are coming down, albeit gradually, a sobering fact in itself.

On the one hand, there was the escapism of revivals from the distant past, including the jackets of English dandies. On the other, there was the realism of classic dressing, emphasizing clothes that can last more than one season.    In the realism camp, there is a widespread revival of knitted clothes, long an Italian specialty. The knits include oversize bulky sweaters and long, skinny skirts.

By Thursday, 26 houses are to introduce their spring ready-to-wear collections in one of five salons that hold up to 1,000 people. The first floor of the fairgrounds' massive main building has been converted into a street of shops, where 30 manufacturers are presenting their wares between shows. Beppe Modenese, one of the fair's organizers, predicts the number will double by next year.    The few trends that have developed so far are not revolutionary, though nobody is looking for revolutions. Long skirts are knocking at the door, biding their time. Short skirts are thriving.

One, Versus, introduced in his new retail shop on Via San Pietro all'Orto, mixes the wild and romantic prints for which he is famous. Jeans jackets with soft bouffant party dresses, pale colors with bold black-and-white graphics. At $400 to $1,200, the prices are half those of his regular collection.

You cook it breast-side down in a black iron skillet (this is essential) with a plate on top. The plate is weighted down and it is this that contributes the name ''smothered.''

The odds are that you'll leave the Roxy in a very friendly mood indeed.The Osborne family, presided over by the big sister, Tessa, consists of little Mary, Jeep, Michael and \\"Granfeathers,\\" a whiskered old chief petty officer who has a way of creating one crisis after another. They live meagerly, but serenely happy in their companionship, in a ramshackle boathouse on a Florida lagoon not far from an Army air field. And it is with their earnest and humorous efforts to scrape up a suitable meal for an expected soldier guest that the film mostly deals. The first crisis comes when Granfeathers buys Tessa a new dress out of his slender pension check and thereby upsets her carefully balanced budget.How and where to get a chicken for the table is a big problem, one which reaches poignant heights when Granfeathers suggests roasting Mary's pet hen. Then there is the amusing housecleaning interlude when everything manages to go wrong, and finally, after everyone has somehow obtained a chicken, comes the big day when the children maintain a heartbreaking vigil at the bus stop for the soldier, who doesn't show up. Just how they bring home a substitute soldier guest provides one of the film's more delightful episodes, and we have no intention of revealing it here. A romance between Tessa and the soldier is sort of dragged in, simply as a matter of formula, but it is at least pleasantly handled.The story of \\"Sunday Dinner for a Soldier\\" is not the kind which stands up well in bare outline, for it is essentially a series of incidents, not a full-blown narrative. Yet all the pieces fall together into a refreshing screen pattern. The children are wonderfully well played by Connie Marshall, Bobby Driscoll and Billy Cummings. Charles Winninger is delightful as the grandfather given to grandiose fibs, or, as he puts it, \\"exercises of the imagination.\\" Anne Baxter is appealing as Tessa and John Hodiak is good as the soldier. But it's those youngsters who give \\"Sunday Dinner for a Soldier\\" its appeal. Fact is, we haven't enjoyed being around movie kids so much in a long, long time.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"IN NEW FILM"},{"year":"1945","title":"Graham Greene's Nazi spies in London, via Fritz Lang.

This was bracing compensation for the middling performance of Mozart's \\"Nozze di Figaro\\" that opened the hallon Wednesday evening.   In fact, \\"Onegin\\" received precisely the kind of staging and performance that made Glyndebourne's worldwide reputation. Graham Vick, the festival's director of productions, revealed an almost Classical refinement under the surface of this Romantic opera. Its tale of thwarted love unfolded through a series of spare, eloquently sung scenes. Onegin's first-act rejection of Tatyana, for example, was mirrored by Tatyana's third-act rejection of Onegin: in each scene, both characters sat in chairs on opposite corners of a nearly bare stage. Also, each act was clearly divided into a public scene of festive celebration and a private scene of confrontation and confession. Andrew Davis's conducting of the London Philharmonic, along with an ensemble of striking singers, gave passion and flesh to the director's formalism.

So long to following someone to their car for their cart, the only one in sight. In the parking lot of the Finast Supermarket, shopping carts are plentiful and undamaged. They also cost money.    The rented shopping cart has come to Long Island. Finast, a division of First National Supermarkets, is offering carts on deposit at its New Hyde Park store. Pay a quarter, get a cart. When finished, shoppers return the cart to the cart corral and get their 25 cents back. If shoppers like the concept, other stores may soon offer rented carts.    \\"We're doing it for environmental reasons,\\" said Rich Posa, the Finast director of operations for Nassau County. \\"It stops carts from being left on the streets and carts' getting hit by cars. You could compare it to the bottle deposit.\\"    Shoppers seem to like it. \\"In one way it's good,\\" said William McConnell of Queens Village who was returning his cart for his 25 cents. \\"You'll always get a cart. But if you don't have a quarter, you're in trouble.\\"    Finast gave out $4,000 in quarters, Mr. Posa said. The store obviously missed Eddie Amore of Floral Park. \\"You got a quarter?\\" Mr. Amore yelled to a friend as he stood helplessly by the locked shopping carts.    Nearby, Michael Tiefenworth of Floral Park gallantly offered his cart for free. Someone had broken off the handle, and the cart could not be locked into the cart corral. \\"This is the store's free cart,\\" Mr. Tiefenworth said. \\"People kill for it.\\"    The carts are chained together. To loosen one or return one for the quarter requires careful reading of the explanation sign. Frank and Fran Parisi of New Hyde Park gave up reading. \\"Could you show us?\\" Mr. Parisi asked Kathleen Velez of Queens Village, Queens, who was taking a cart.    After finally releasing the cart, Mrs. Parisi noticed the bottom was coated with syrup. Mr. Parisi then had to figure out how to return the cart, get his quarter back and release another cart. After five minutes at the corral, the Parisis were ready to go home foodless.    But along came Dede Silverston of Floral Park, who was returning her cart. Mr. Parisi decided to override modern technology. \\"Can we trade?\\" he asked Mrs. Silverston. She gave him her cart; he gave her his quarter.    East Meadow Court Star    For Mike Kunkel, an East Meadow tennis coach, it was a move into the big time. After seven years of coaching girls' high school tennis, he finally had a player in the Nassau County singles finals.    \\"She has no idea of the importance of this,\\" Mr. Kunkel said as he watched his star, Monica Pope, warm up on a court of Great Neck South High School. \\"She is not the least bit nervous.\\"   The coach, however, was. \\"The butterflies are starting,\\" he said.    Miss Pope, 15, formerly of Rumania, now of East Meadow was about to compete against one of Long Island's top players, Kelly Granat, a junior at Roslyn High School and the third seed in the tournament. \\"Kelly is nationally ranked,\\" her mother, Phyllis, said. \\"She'll be playing in the national indoor championships in Detroit at the end of November.\\"    Miss Granat arrived at the tournament with four Prince tennis racquets. \\"She's sponsored by Prince,\\" her mother said. Miss Pope arrived with one Dunlop racquet. She had brought it with her from Rumania, one of the few personal possessions she was allowed to take.    The Pope family emigrated to East Meadow in the summer. Mr. and Mrs. Pope are dentists and hope to continue their careers in the United States. Miss Pope is a high school freshman, and studies are as important to her as tennis, she said.    \\"I speak seven languages,\\" she said. \\"I would like to use them in my career.\\"    In between studying, she played tennis on the East Meadow varsity team. She was undefeated. \\"She never lost a set,\\" Mr. Kunkel said.    The Rumanian became the dark horse at the Nassau championships. Players wondered how good she was. They never really found out. Playing against Miss Granat, Miss Pope made so many unforced errors, she lost 6-2, 6-1. She lost five games double-faulting on her serve.    Next season will be different, Mr. Kunkel predicts. \\"She didn't get enough practice,\\" he said. \\"I'm going to have her work out with the boys in the spring.\\"     Therapeutic Smiles    Finding humorous nurses at a conference on humor in nursing was as easy as sitting down at a lunch table with psychiatric nurses from Winthrop University Hospital.    \\"Are nurses funny?\\" the Winthrop nurses were asked. \\"We're a laugh a minute,\\" Helen Lau said. \\"We have a sick sense of humor.\\"    Joann Kopnicky supplied an example: \\"We told a new nurse that on a certain day she had to wear a clown outfit because it was the annual clown day where we all dressed up as clowns. She did, we didn't.\\" The nurses burst into laughter.    Nurses laughed a lot at the one-day conference, \\"The Use of Therapeutic Humor in Nursing Practice,\\" sponsored by the educational arm of South Oaks Hospital in Amityville.    \\"In adversity, humor is what works best,\\" said Susan Kravitz a nursing official at South Oaks and the class wit from Valley Stream Central High School. Ms. Kravitz was in charge of the conference which was attended by 300 nurses.  \\"Nurse humor is not one joke, but a style of coping,\\" she said. One of the ways to cope is reading funny material to patients, said Elaine Pasquali, a nursing professor at Adelphi University.      \\"Laughter is internal jogging,\\" Ms. Pasquali said. You can always exercise your patients by making them laugh, she added.    It is important to laugh in a hospital, especially in the psychiatric wing, said Patricia DiBona a psychiatric nurse at Winthrop. \\"There's a fine line between the nurses and the patients,\\"she said.    \\"Yes,\\" Mrs. Kopnicky added. \\"The desk.\\"     Inside the Candy    Halloween safety tips now include not talking to strangers and having candy X-rayed. The Walk In Medical Care Clinics of Miller Place, Sayville and St. James offered free X-rays of holiday treats.     \\"We just laid them out on the X-ray table,\\" said Ann Ross of the Miller Place clinic. The candy not the children, she added.   \\"With all the scares about foreign substances in the food being handed out on Halloween,\\" Ms. Ross said, \\"X-raying treats makes sense. This is our good-will service to the community.\\"    After the candy and fruit were X-rayed, the children took their booty home, along with the X-rays.    Is candy that is X-rayed less healthy? \\"Not that I know of,\\" Ms. Ross said. \\"I'm sure the doctors would have told us if X-raying candy is bad for children.\\"             A Correction    An article in the Long Island Weekly last Sunday about women stricken with AIDS referred incompletely to the reason Emily Varga's 12-year-old daughter repeated a grade in school. The daughter, a gifted student who sympathized with her mother's plight, asked to be left back to retain the \\"place and time,\\" her mother said.
