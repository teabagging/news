Though they may have been only too willing to give up backyard chores when they moved into a condo, they now feel a sense of loss. Ruth Price, for example, who moved four years ago from a one-family house in Guilford, Conn., to a condominium about 30 miles away, suffered such withdrawal symptoms that she now helps tend a friend's vegetable garden in the next town.

CBS's ''60 Minutes'' was the most-watched show of the night, with 9.44 million viewers. That, in combination with a ''Cold Case'' rerun (7.37 million) and the made-for-television movie ''Open House'' (7.62 million), added up to the CBS victory in households. But the lineup was not as popular in the 18-to-49 demographic, where CBS placed fourth. NBC edged out Fox in that age group, with a two-hour ''Dateline'' (8.01 million), along with repeats of ''Law & Order: Criminal Intent'' (8.7 million) and ''Crossing Jordan'' (8 million). Fox featured the most popular offering of the night among adults 18 to 49, an original episode of ''Family Guy'' (6.10 million). The series premiere of ''The Princes of Malibu,'' Fox's reality sitcom in which the music producer David Foster financially cuts off his layabout stepsons, drew 4.97 million viewers.

The Israeli prime minister spoke of a force consisting of European Union members with combat experience and the authority to take control of Lebanon's border and crossing points.   A1    Israeli warplanes hit civilians escaping by vehicle from their villages in southern Lebanon at least six times in a series of fierce bombardments, witnesses and officials said. Lebanese Red Cross ambulance drivers complained about narrowly avoiding Israeli fire as they cleared out the wounded, and a Lebanese photographer was killed when an Israeli missile struck near her car. A1    Saudis Urge Cease-Fire  A delegation from Saudi Arabia asked President Bush to push for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and the terrorist group Hezbollah. The foreign minister said he delivered a letter from the Saudi king, Abdullah, with suggestions for ending the violence. It met a cool reception from American Officials.  A8    Syrian Calls U.S. Course Faulty  The Bush administration's approach of indirectly pressuring Syria to drop support for Hezbollah is doomed to failure, said Bthaina Shaaban a top Syrian minister. Washington, she says, is ignoring reality if it thinks groups like Hezbollah and Hamas can be purged by allowing Israel to bomb at will.  A9    Recruitment Troubles in Iraq  Recruiting a new police force to battle the insurgents in Iraq has become a central element in the United States' plan to reduce American forces. American commanders face securing a modicum of cooperation from a wary population, and to contend with a campaign by insurgents to assassinate and intimidate the members of Iraq's fledgling security services.  A10    Saddam Hussein was hospitalized after a hunger strike, and was being fed with a tube and given tests to ensure that he could continue to attend his trial, Iraqi and American officials said. Widespread sectarian violence returned after two days of relative calm, with at least 57 people killed in bombings in Baghdad and Kirkuk.  A11    Artist Shadowed by Nazi Ties  After years of obscurity, the first publicly financed exhibit since World War II of the work of Arno Breker, the German sculptor whose art so vividly expressed Nazi ideology that he became known as ''Hitler's favorite sculptor,'' is being mounted in Schwerin, Germany. The exhibit has ignited a debate in a region which has had a spurt of far-right and neo-Nazi political activity recently.  A3    NATIONAL A12-15    U.S. to Limit Payments For Victims of Disaster  The Department of Homeland Security, responding to months of criticism and ridicule, will sharply cut back on emergency cash assistance for victims of major disasters, and more carefully control access to free hotel rooms. Immediate emergency aid would not exceed $500 in cash instead of $2,000 per family under the new rules.  A1    Bar Association Critical of Bush  The American Bar Association said President Bush was flouting the Constitution and undermining the rule of law by claiming the power to disregard selected provisions of bills that he signed. In a comprehensive report, a bipartisan panel of the bar association said Mr. Bush had used such ''signing statements'' far more than his predecessor.  A12    Sunday Services in Parks  From Memorial Day to Labor Day, 42 state, national and private parks in Pennsylvania hold nondenominational Christian worship services. The chaplains come from local towns and faraway states, as do the worshipers, mostly Protestants. Last year, 18,000 people attended services in Pennsylvania parks.  A13    Elderly Katrina Victims Struggle  Thousands of elderly Hurricane Katrina evacuees still struggle to get by in cities hundreds of miles from their home in New Orleans. But more than most evacuees, it is the elderly who want most to return, say social service workers, and who have the hardest time doing so.  A12    F.D.A. to Limit Industry Ties  The Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce an effort to write guidelines detailing the kind of industry ties that are permitted for those who serve on its powerful advisory boards. The agency hopes to appease critics who have complained that board members often have such deep financial ties to drug makers that their advice is tainted.  A13    SCIENCE/HEALTH    Stomach Surgery Called Risky  Four of every 10 patients who undergo weight-loss surgery develop complications within six months, the federal government said. The number of such surgical procedures has been rising rapidly, along with the incidence of obesity, which now afflicts 30 percent of adults in the United States, health officials said.

B1    Campaign Draws Big Names  With their race quickly becoming a national symbol of rifts in the Democratic party, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman and his challenger, Ned Lamont, are turning to national political stars to help bolster each of their campaigns, apparently hoping that the big names can help turn out votes in the coming primary for the Senate.  B1    SPORTSMONDAY D1-8    Tiger Woods Wins British Open  Tiger Woods shot five-under-par 67 at the 135th British Open to win the 11th professional major championship of his career. Mr. Woods's victory gave him back-to-back British Open titles, a feat last accomplished by Tom Watson at Royal Birkdale in 1983. Chris DiMarco shot 68 to finish second. D1    Landis Wins Tour de France  Floyd Landis secured his first Tour de France victory, finishing the three-week, 2,267-mile race 57 seconds ahead of Oscar Pereiro of Spain. Mr. Landis kept the trophy in American hands after Lance Armstrong won it seven straight times before retiring.  D1    ARTS E1-8    Bitter Breach for Pilobolus  Pilobolus Dance Theater has become embroiled in a bitter dispute with the choreographer Alison Chase.

The election marks the end of an era in Germany and the opening of a new one in Europe, where center-left governments now dominate the continent's politics.   A1    European leaders congratulated both Mr. Schroder and Mr. Kohl. They hailed Mr. Kohl's role in consolidating Europe after German unification and expressed confidence that Mr. Schroder would continue in the same tradition.   A10    Loan Package for Brazil  The Clinton Administration and the International Monetary Fund are taking the lead in putting together a package of loans for Brazil, likely to total more than $30 billion, to limit the damage from the Asian crisis to Latin America's biggest economy. A bailout plan is risky, but one that American leaders seem inclined to take for Brazil, which buys nearly 20 percent of America's exports and is home to thousands of American-owned factories.   A1    U.S. Optimism Over Bosnia  Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, visiting Bosnia, said that country's national elections created ''some room for optimism'' for the future of its shattered society, even though the Bosnian Serb leader endorsed by the United States, Biljana Plavsic, lost her bid for re-election. He warned that Bosnian leaders had to make more progress or risk losing international support.   A3    Assault on Kosovo Continues  Serbian security forces continued their campaign of destroying ethnic Albanian villages in Kosovo province even though the Serbian Government announced on Saturday the end of the military offensive in the province whose people are mostly ethnic Albanians. In crippling the rebel movement, the Government has brought devastation to civilians.   A3    Albright Holds Mideast Talks  Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright pushed for agreement on crucial details of a long-stalled peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, with American officials saying the White House hoped to announce progress when President Clinton meets with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.   A6    New Opposition in Japan  A credible political opposition is bubbling in Japan, a country that for half a century has been largely a one-party state. While the development has been obscured by the mountains of bad debts, battles in Parliament and growing international frustration with Japan's economic problems, a vigorous opposition leader -- Naoto Kan -- has been forcing the Government to alter its policies.   A8    The Japan Leasing Corporation, with liabilities estimated at more than $18 billion, said that it had filed for bankruptcy, the largest such action in Japan since World War II.   A6    NATIONAL   A12-15    Hurricane Slams Gulf Coast With Winds of 105 M.P.H.  Hurricane Georges slammed into the seaside cities and resorts of the Gulf Coast with rain-packed winds of up to 110 miles per hour and a sea surge of 10 feet or more.   A1    In Haiti, homes, livestock and crops were swept away and entire villages were destroyed by the flooding that followed the hurricane. Many people had ignored warning to evacuate.   A12    While relief supplies have begun to arrive from abroad, many of the Dominican Republic's eight million people have yet to receive any help.   A12    Attorney General Hospitalized  Attorney General Janet Reno fainted during a church service in suburban Maryland and was hospitalized at Georgetown University Medical Center, where she was to be held for observation.   A13    First Lady Stays the Course  On a three-day, five-state fund-raising tour for Democratic Congressional candidates, Hillary Rodham Clinton stayed the course, smiling opaquely and assuring old friends and political allies that she was ''just fine!'' as she praised the President and criticized Congress.   A14    President Clinton raised nearly $4 million in Silicon Valley, Hollywood and South Texas this weekend for Democratic candidates. Protesters carried signs outside the events, but inside, loyal Democrats offered moral support as they opened their wallets for the party.   A15    An aide to the President sought to prepare the public for a possible settlement of Paula Corbin Jones's sexual misconduct lawsuit, saying that it should not be taken as admission that her accusations are true.   A15    Broadening its counterattack against possible impeachment proceedings, the White House is working with Congressional Democrats to turn the tables and investigate the investigators by examining how Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent prosecutor, came to look into the Lewinsky matter.   A14    Three veteran politicians said that there would be no deal between the President and Congress until after the Nov. 3 elections.   A14    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Republicans Sense Victory In State Assembly Races  Democrats are biting their nails and Republicans are smelling blood in Assembly races in the downstate suburbs, across upstate New York and in a few parts of New York City. Strategists on both sides predict that Republicans could gain 5 to 10 seats in the November elections, which would be the Democrats' worst setback in decades.   B1    Schumer Strikes Back Upstate  After a week of being assailed in television advertisements as a ''liberal Brooklyn congressman'' who was hostile to upstate interests, Charles E. Schumer campaigned across western and central New York, ticking off the names of relatives who had lived there and blaming Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato for the economic decline that has gripped the region.   B6    Bronx to Unveil Stadium Plan  Hoping to place the Bronx back at the center of the debate over a home for the Yankees, the Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, plans to unveil a $535 million proposal to restore Yankee Stadium's original monumental exterior, install 120 luxury boxes, ease traffic congestion and redevelop the surrounding neighborhood with a waterfront park, a Yankee Hall of Fame and sports-related stores.   B1    ARTS   E1-10    OBITUARIES   B7-8    Betty Carter  One of jazz's great singers and a composer and arranger whose groups were virtual schools for generations of young jazz musicians, she was 69.   B8    Peter Brock Putnam  A blind historian who spoke and wrote about aspects of blindness and was active in nonprofit organizations, he was 78.   B7    Blanca Rosenberg  A Jewish native of Poland who wrote a book about surviving the Holocaust by posing as a Catholic peasant, she  was 85.   B7    BUSINESS DAY   C1-10    Flaw Found in Web Software  A potentially serious security flaw has been discovered in the programming language used in the Navigator and Communicator software of Netscape Communications -- a defect that might allow an outsider to read information on a personal computer user's hard disk.

William C. Westmoreland against CBS et al. for portraying him in a television documentary as the leader of a ''conspiracy at the highest level'' to underestimate enemy troop strength in Vietnam; the other brought against Time magazine by the Israeli general, Ariel Sharon, for accusing him of having discussed with Lebanese Christian leaders the need to take revenge for the assassination of President Bashir Gemayel just before the Phalangist massacre of Palestinians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in Lebanon.

Knopf. $16.95. \\n\\nFROM October of 1984 into January and February of 1985, two older military leaders were engaged in the same form of unaccustomed combat in closely similar settings in the same building. Both had brought libel suits in the United States District Court in Manhattan to vindicate their reputations - and incidentally, according to their complaints, to seek as much as 100 million or more restorative dollars - allegedly injured by maliciously false stories disseminated about them by two prepotent news media giants. (Renata Adler says ''there was never any question, in anybody's mind,'' that neither plaintiff was serious about the money, but does not include in her many questions about the lawyering why, if that was so, attorneys would put numbers like $50 million, for Gen. Ariel Sharon, or over $100 million, for Gen. William C. Westmoreland, in solemnly signed complaints.) Both must have yearned more than once in the course of their legal hostilities for the more familiar risks and chaos of the battlefield.

says Israel was strong enough in 1st hours of conflict to avoid 'the disaster that befell us,' adding that 'what happened to us should not have happened'; asserts that mil command delayed for 36 to 40 hours pushing of reinforcements across canal bridgehead, delay which meant that Egyptain 3d Corps on eastern bank of canal south of Israeli bridgehead had not been encircled or reduced as a mil force by time 1st UN cease-fire was imposed on Oct 22; other Israeli officers contend that Egyptians 'failed to read the battle correctly' and to grasp what was happening after canal crossing; Sharon contends, however, that Israelis were equally remiss and were unaware of exact nature of battle; bolsters argument by noting that only high-ranking official to visit bridgehead during 1st critical days was Defense Min M Dayan 'the only one' who 'understood what was happening'; explains that other comdrs believed that he had failed to secure bridgeheads and its approaches and were reluctant to risk funneling 2d division into battle; says his tanks penetrated 15 mi across canal and into Egypt before being reinforced, but that he was ordered to recall them; asserts that after bridgehead west of canal had been reinforced by 2d armored division his own force was prevented from racing north to attempt to encircle Egyptian 2d Corps, which occupies eastern end of canal; says he had capability to encircle 2d Corps, which would have resulted in neutralization of most of Egyptian forces; says his divison met little initial resistance on west bank of canal, but that major force he used to push back elements of 2d Egyptian Corps that could have threatened corridor leading to bridgehead met with bitter opposition and failed to push Egyptians back very far;

In one instance, she remembers, she even received a call from someone she had never heard of -- the Rev. Al Sharpton.   Mrs. Garcia remembers that the reverend extended sympathy and offered assistance. Within an hour, she said, he was in her apartment with a handful of aides, reciting a prayer, pledging to cover funeral costs and suggesting the legal services of his brother in arms, Alton H. Maddox Jr. In the next few days, Mr. Sharpton led marches through her neighborhood while tensions roiled.

Perhaps this approach, too, was impossible because art of the level of accomplishment was not available or was simply not being produced.

IN FACT, IT never was. The flat roofs, steel I-beams and characterless plate-glass windows that shout \\"modern\\" in every mall across America are but one facet of a design esthetic that, by definition, is constantly reinventing itself. For modern is not a style. It is an attitude that embraces a dynamic present and uses its innovations to improve everyday life. Now, a new generation of architects and designers is rediscovering its original revolutionary spirit.   So why do some people cringe at the very word \\"modern\\"? It's an image problem that can be traced back to Le Corbusier's definition of the ideal house as a \\"machine to live in.\\" At the time he coined the phrase, machines were still thrilling newcomers in a world festooned with vestigial traditions: duster coats, antimacassars, dumbwaiters. Ardent populists, the masters of modern still failed to consider that although people may have welcomed machines into their lives, they never wanted them as exclusive company. Or that although mass production made life easier, Corbusier's dream of the \\"standard house for normal, standard people\\" was an insult to those who believed in the sacredness of a heterogeneous society. It didn't help that modern -- sheer poetry in the hands of geniuses of minimalism like Mies van der Rohe -- was easy to duplicate on the cheap.    Part of the problem was misinterpretation. Even Corbusier's own villa masterpieces were intimately scaled, exquisitely crafted sculptures. The popular notion of modern -- sober and stark -- was probably shaped less by reality than by the movies and such ballyhooed shows as the 1932 exhibition on International style at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Still, it was a vision that held sway over our minds and magazines until the 70's, when post-modernism unlatched the door to the past. Design students started poring over classical monuments, then moved on to long-overlooked 20th-century modern achievements. One was Pierre Chareau's Maison de Verre in Paris, completed in 1932. Here, poetry and industry are wedded with fluid precision. There are walls that slide and roll, retractable stairs and a nesting table modeled on airplane propeller blades. Its glass-block facade aglow with the light from within, the Maison de Verre achieved cult status a decade ago, yet Chareau's name still doesn't figure in standard architecture guides.   A similar fate befell the architect Eileen Gray, whose Cubist-inspired furnishings of the 20's and 30's were rediscovered for reproduction in the early 80's. Although Gray used chrome in furniture before Mies van der Rohe or Le Corbusier, she ultimately rejected it as cold, fragile and, as she declared in 1929, \\"contrary to good taste.\\" Her contemporaries defined modernism by function","excerpt":"she added comfort and wit. She called a bulbous leather chair resembling stacked inner tubes \\"the Bibendum chair,\\" after the balloon-limbed Michelin-tire icon.    One of the most fertile, untapped strains of modern drew its inspiration from local landscapes. These buildings look as if they belong to the traditions of place, but function in a resolutely contemporary way. William Wurster was one of the first to explore this potential in the houses he designed in the San Francisco Bay area between 1927 and 1942. Drawing on indigenous building types, he stripped wide verandas and interior courtyards of their nostalgic trappings. Today, regional modernism has a particular resonance for architects interested in designs that are sensitive to the environment.   As modernism becomes more inclusive, it is easier to embrace its idiosyncratic monuments. Casa Malaparte, for one. This mysterious villa on a cliff above the Bay of Naples seems to have been shaped by the eroding winds of time. The cascading steps descending from its roof appear both ancient and modern, natural and an extraordinary feat of engineering.    More recently, the work of the American architect Paul Rudolph has passed from being violently reviled to warmly appreciated. When his Yale Art and Architecture Building, with its corduroy-concrete exterior and 37-level interior, caught fire in 1969, it was rumored that a student was responsible. Today, seminars are held about its dynamic rendering of space.  It is from such atypically modern architecture that the \\"new modernists\\" take their cues. This generation, a sampling of whose work is shown on the following pages, understands that modernism possesses a vigor and authenticity unrivaled by period styles. Liberated from preconceptions, these designers are inspired by the past, pure geometry, philosophy, even music. As a way of thinking, modern is demonstrating its ability to reinvent itself and to shape the present well into the next century.
