infrared temperature map of Jupiter indicates that planet, as predicted, radiates 2.5 times more heat than it absorbs from sun and that there apparently is little variation in cloud temperatures on day and night side of planet--fact which indicates that Jupiter does not readily dissipate heat it gets from sun; Jupiter's magnetic field extends 4.5-million miles into space, but its more well-defined effect in trapping radiation particles extends out only 1.2-million miles; discovery of Io's atmosphere is inferred from analysis of radio signals that passed fringes of satellite and were seen to be bent; scientists maintain such occurrence is 'firm evidence' of layer of electrons surrounding Io; theorize that satellite's atmosphere probably extends 65 mi from its surface; Jet Propulsion laboratory scientist Dr J D Anderson says that study of effects of Jupiter's gravity on trajectory of Pioneer 10 indicates that 'the mass of the whole Jupiter system is heavier' than had been estimated; new estimate is that Jupiter and its moon is heavier by as much as mass of 1 to 2 of Earth's moons; Anderson says Io was found to be 20% more massive than Earth's moon and appears to be more like inner than outer planets, but agrees that Io could have formed elsewhere in solar system and may have been captured by Jupiter's powerful gravity; determines that 99% of Jupiter's mass appears to lie beneath point some 1,400 mi below planet's hypothetical surface--boundary where gaseous hydrogen of planet's atmosphere apparently turns to liquid hydrogen; between 'surface' and 1,400-mi boundary, mass of Jupiter is equal to less that 3 Earth masses; Calif Inst of Tech scientist Dr G Munch repts spacecraft's infrared instruments, which penetrated 13 miles into Jupiter's upper atmosphere, recorded temperatures ranging between -215 and -230 degrees Fahrenheit; says Jupiter radiates more heat along a wide equatorial band than it does at other latitudes; variations in heat radiation appear to correspond to to planet's parallel multicolored bands of clouds; Munch concludes that Jupiter's thick opaque atmosphere has a 'very large heat capacity,' adding that it probably takes 1 wk to before it dissipates heat of sun; calls planet's cloud cover 'a very effective greenhouse'; Langley Research center physicist Dr W H Kinard says Pioneer 10 had recd 300 times as many micrometeoroid impacts in Jovian magnetic field as it did in interplenetary space;
