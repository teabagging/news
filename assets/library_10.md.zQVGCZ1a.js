What happens to the Negro here happens to him because he is an American. It is not the American Jew who can either instruct him or console him.

Still, such activity does not make the bar a standout in the neighborhood, with its late-night melange of butchers, steakhouses, gay bars, S-and-M clubs, and transvestite and transsexual streetwalkers.         But now, the bar wants to open an Upper East Side outpost, Hogs & Heifers East, at 1843 First Avenue near 93d Street, and some neighbors are as riled as stuck pigs. Two committees of Community Board 8 have voted overwhelmingly -- 10  to 0 and 24 to 1 -- to recommend the denial of the license application pending before the State Liquor Authority.

The movie, which opens today at the Quad Cinema, is the adolescent reminiscence of Jimmy O'Leary, a New Yorker who grew up in an Irish farming village and immigrated to America shortly after the events depicted in the film.         The civil war that followed Ireland's struggle to gain home rule may have ended in the 1920's, but three decades later, resentments still simmer. The movie focuses on the feud between Jimmy's father, Arthur (Colin Lane), and his neighbor Josie (Niall O'Brien). Although the two men fought side by side for Irish independence, they became antagonists in the ensuing civil war, Arthur opposing the treaty establishing the Irish Free State and Josie supporting it. Fueling their enmity is their youthful rivalry for Jimmy's still-beautiful mother, Catherine (Marian Quinn).

The first in this series is \\"I Ought to Be in Pictures,\\" a play that might well be classified by Simon historians as one of the minor works.    Minor, maybe, a bit too complexly clever and certainly overdrawn in its search for meaning, but the Simon touch -- the apropos one-liners, the withering retort, the finely drawn characters who are so familiar they might almost be stereotypes except for their essential humanness -- tends to brush aside all quibbles. The play is entertaining and has the ingredients necessary to all narrative concoctions: we care about the people the playwright is telling us about.

Not one of the world's major industrialized economies now enjoys good health and a bright prognosis. Diplomacy and political leadership often involve recommending tough measures only for the other nations' economic ailments. Here, country by country, are the challenges that economists and business leaders say these nationsl face. BRITAIN    When Harold Wilson reneged on his pledge to maintain the pound's value 25 years ago, his Government toppled. Now John Major faces a continuing recession, high interest rates and a currency crisis that forced him to go back on his word. GERMANY    No end in sight to the fallout from the takeover of eastern Germany, the largest leveraged buyout in history. With expenses of $100 billion a year, Germans borrow what they refuse to pay in higher taxes. They and their fellow Europeans pay up anyway in higher interest rates, slower growth and monetary turmoil. FRANCE    Savvy, competitive industries and continuing growth fail to relieve high unemployment. Still, it's politics, not economics, that dominates the agenda. The nation's role in a unified Europe, and its sufferance of President Mitterrand, turn on a referendum this Sunday. ITALY    Coalition governments prove incapable of clinging to office or bringing huge budget deficits under control. State-owned industries are no more efficient than the tax collectors. Currency traders, doubting the fight against inflation willever turn serious, continue to profit by betting against the lira. SPAIN    Marrying into the European Community in 1986 meant marrying for better (at first) or for worse (right now). Foreign investors and builders have backed off, production costs have risen, and jobs are harder to find. Budget and trade deficits show the strain.

And although it's been well over 10 years since the breakup of the Beatles, Mr. McCartney's image hasn't changed much - to the public at large, he's still the cute, consummate pop tunesmith.   He is also the surviving member of the Lennon-McCartney songwriting partnership that made the Beatles what they were, and as such he has been subjected to intense media scrutiny since John Lennon's death almost a year and a half ago. When he began working on a new album a few months after Mr. Lennon was shot, and working on it with George Martin, who produced the Beatles from the beginning, rumors began to fly. Teams of reporters scoured the Caribbean island of Montserrat, where Mr. Martin owns a studio.

It is downright imperceptible.This Israeli import, which opened yesterday at the Festival Theater, is made with seriousness and some skill. Its depiction of a shut-in, obsessed marriage is a vehicle for exploring a fenced-in, surrounded quality in Israeli society. But we are more aware of the vehicle's own airlessness and monotony than of the landscape it is trying to take us through.Based on the novel by Amos Oz, \\"Michael\\" is the story of Hanna, a young teacher who marries an archeology student in Jerusalem. The marriage is impetuous","excerpt":"neither has any money, and they move into a cramped apartment.It is more than the apartment that is cramped, however. They are nice, educated young people; full of tolerance and good will. But life closes in on their marriage. She has a baby, he has to go on with his studies; time and space seem to dry up on them.It is an arid, reasonable marriage. Michael, the husband, escapes into stolidity and a flirtation with a fellow student. Hanna fantasizes about being ravished and carried away. Not by pirates or airline pilots, but—this being Israel—by Arabs\\"What are we living for?\\" she asks her husband at one desperate moment before she drifts utterly away. \\"People don't live for anything: they just live,\\" he replies.Now all this could be a wry accusation that Israeli society lives amid Arabs while it avoids all psychological contact with them. The formal message is that such a posture has to be paid for by a loss of reality, by a drying-up of life. As a child, Hanna had two Arab children as her best friends; as an adult she dreams about naked bodies, black mustaches and—to pin down the nationality beyond doubt—checked keffiyehs floating out behind.So costumed, the imaginary sequences are ludicrous. But ludicrousness is not the problem with \\"My Michael.\\" In fact, done as a slapstick comedy about an Israeli housewife with Arab fantasies, it might have been not only funny but pointed as well.The problem is the film's deliberate attenuation; its deadpan development of married banality in a painfully banal style. Every possible soaper cliché is brought out: the announcement that she's pregnant; his sulky mopping of the floor while she sits, sulky and distended; his efforts to study while the baby cries; his flirtation; her sexual teasing of a young boy.True, a number of these scenes are done with economy and charm. There is good acting, particularly from some of the older characters with small parts.The performance of the principals is less satisfying. As Michael, Oded Kotler is stolid, as the part requires, but not much else.Efrat Lavie, who plays Hanna, is more effective. But she plays her part from beginning to end with one fixed expression of gloom. Her gloom is a frail and pretty thing to see, but after a while, in its fixity, it makes the whole movie look underexposed.

The incredible success of his first novel, ''Catch-22'' - surely thrilling to the author who was only 38 years old when it was first published in 1961 - must, by this time, also be maddening to him. It is one thing for him to have written one of the most celebrated of post-World War II novels and quite another to have everything that followed compared to it and found somehow wanting.

Corrections"},{"year":"1921","title":"TWO motion pictures that came to Broadway last Sunday illustrate the present fondness of filmmakers for \\"religious themes,\\" and also bear an interesting relation to each other, one of them being an attempt to present chapters from the actual life of Christ and the other purporting to expose the existence and influence in the Church of Christ today of the very \\"scribes, Pharisees and hypocrites.\\" whom He so thoroughly denounced.There are several points of view from which a tremendous drama might be built out of the subject matter of these two pictures. One of them could be the eloquent sequel of the other, and together they could have a unity, and a difference, that would make each distinctively strong and both powerful in combination. They might be great, but they are not, neither separately nor together, because each is inherently weak","excerpt":"neither is bright enough to shed light on the other. They only suggest the idea of what they might be; the idea remains something imagined and desired, rather than something accomplished. Perhaps, if filmmakers were fonder of motion pictures than of \\"religious themes,\\" religious pictures would have more dramatic and spiritual power.One of these photoplays is \\"Behold the Man!\\" which has begun a series of Sundays at the Apollo Theatre, and the other is \\"The Inside of the Cup,\\" now occupying the Criterion.The latter production is superior to the former. From the technical point of view, it is much better made, and its treatment, as a whole, shows greater skill and ingenuity. In some respects it is above the average photoplay. Albert Capellani, who directed it, has ideas of continuity and photography which find expression in it, and the acting, while not distinguished by any memorable performance, is acceptable, though the characters are theatrical types rather than typical human beings. However, William P. Carleton as the rector, David Torrence as the Banker Parr, Edith Hallor and Jack Bohn as his daughter and son, Marguerite Clayton as the younger Parr's sweatheart, Richard Carlyle and Margaret Seddon as two of Parr's victims, and Albert Roccardi and Frank A. Lyon as shareholders in Religion, Inc., are all sufficiently alive to give the semblance of life to some of their scenes. But the unrealities of the story prevent its living continuously, from one scene to the next, and so it is only in high moments that it seems anything but fiction reflecting life faintly and disproportionately. How good a translation it is of the novel by Winston Churchill upon which it is based the writer cannot say.The chief trouble with \\"The Inside of the Cup\\" as a photoplay, in the writer's opinion, is that it aims at theatrical effect rather than the presentation of truth. It approaches a complex condition of real life and simplifies it by the easy process of ignoring the difficult and confusing factors and selecting particular traits of human character for overemphasis. Its people are simply personified virtues and vices plainly labeled. For example, Eldon Parr is a wealthy banker who goes to church on Sunday and on Monday frankly calls his stock manipulations \\"murder.\\" He advises one of his faithful employes to invest his savings in a stock which he knows will soon be worthless and then discharges the man when he appeals to him for help.The Parr of real life, however, would surely talk as sanctimoniously on Monday as on Sunday, and probably believe himself a great saint, too, and if one of his friendly employes lost money through his advice he would undoubtedly reimburse the man and be credited by himself, the employe, the employe's wife and others with an act of true generosity. His pecuniary profit would come from those who had been \\"foolish\\" enough to buy the stock in the open market and could not hold him personally responsible for their losses. Again, there is Wallis Plimpton, a vestryman in the church, and a real estate dealer who owns a saloon where a percentage of the profits of trade in the underworld is collected for him by his personal representative. He even goes to the saloon himself to meet his agent. But the Plimpton of real life would own the saloon, collect all the rent it would yield, and show to the satisfaction of any \\"practical\\" man that he could not be held responsible for what the long-term lessee did with it.And so it goes. The whole story deals with unrealities. The reformers would have an easy and successful time if life was as simple a thing as \\"The Inside of the Cup\\" would make it. Their only work would be getting evidence against individuals, and that is all that the picture does, presents evidence against its straw men that immediately destroys them. It merely disposes of a few villains of its own creation—and by miraculously converting them to ways of righteousness, too. It does not analyze a real condition of affairs and point a way to correction. It does not even throw a ray of light on a problem enveloped in darkness for many. So, as a movie it may be good enough, but as a photoplay with a purpose it is wholly futile.Also on the Criterion's program is about the most thoroughly enjoyable Post Nature picture that has brightened a local screen. It is called \\"My Barefoot Boy,\\" and in it the little wire-haired fox terrier, who began the story of his life in \\"A Tale of a Terrier,\\" continues the chronicle of his adventures. He's a real dog, not one of your performing pets dulled by training in tricks, and it is easy for the spectator to let himself go and imagine that this individualistic canine is actually telling his story to the cameraman. Considerable ingenuity must have been used by the director of the picture to induce the dog to do naturally what was wanted is him, and the illusion is perfect. The story is that of the narrator's life on a farm, and its passages of bright humor and scenic beauty were keenly relished by those present when the writer saw the picture, as they are sure to be by any one. \\"My Barefoot Boy\\" is one of those delightful little treats that come unpretentiously and entertain generously. Also it seems to promise the development of the narrative scenic, or the scenic narrative, which holds great possibilities for cinematography.THE boundless opportunities for treating a great subject greatly have been missed in \\"Behold the Man!\\" it seems to the writer. The picture, with its strong coloring, its uninspired conventionality, its formal stiffness and its mechanical crudities, seems more like a series of animated illustrations such as decorated the cheap Bibles of the last generation than a cinematographic life of Jesus of Nazareth. The subject is treated reverently, yes, but as if the director had been afraid, in his reverence, to make the people resemble human beings in any way. The story could be told, as if it had really happened, without any lack of reverence. It's no disrespect to Christ to say that He did actually live and, to all outward appearances anyhow, acted like a man.Another weakness of the story is its failure to present the real mission and message of Christ. It deals episodically with certain incidents of the story told in the synoptic gospels, but greatly overemphasizes the miracles, and seldom illuminates an act or scene by showing its underlying reason and surrounding circumstances. Also, on the subject of the money changers in the Temple at least, it misses the point entirely, and it seems safe to add that provincial Galilee never saw such evidences of wealth and magnificence as are attributed to it in the scene of the wedding at Cana.The only impressive scenes of the picture are the pageants in which violent coloring and stiff formality are not obtrusively out of place. The attempt to set the Biblical story in a modern frame has not been carried out with noticeable skill, and the titling of the picture does not help it.

However, I feel obligated to shed some light as to why Mr. Perlstein’s romanticized idea of what college should be like is not possible for every student. The period of self expression and experimentation of ideas during four years between the ages of 18 and 22 is a fairytale scenario for the masses. This blissful journey through college where students have time to read books like Measure for Measure in dorm common rooms and have intellectual discussions of what Shakespeare’s true message was, is not for everyone. Yes, college today is connected with real world issues and students study boring topics (to some) like business. College being practical should not be a novel concept. With the price of higher education today, parents only hope that their children are learning up to date education and not skipping class to discuss classic works of fiction. Immigrant parents, at least mine, are forever advising their children to work hard and obtain a degree that will secure a job after college. I could never dream of studying music, dance or theatre because to my parents, those careers are merely hobbies. I was meant to “be a lawyer, a doctor or a diplomat!” my mother always said.

Gwen Vanessche, communications manager of public relations at French Rail's White Plains office, which sells Eurail passes in North America, replies: Theft on trains seems to be particularly prevalent in the southern European countries. I know that in France it is certainly a concern. There are, in fact, undercover policemen on some trains in Europe. All doors to cabins on sleepers should be able to be locked.

Hitler won't like it","excerpt":"neither will Goebbels; frankly, we were not too favorably impressed either, although for a different reason. We can endure just so much hissing, even when Der Fuehrer and the Gestapo are its victims. The Warners had courage in making the picture, but we should have preferred to see them pitch their battle on a higher plane.Based on the evidence presented by the G-men during last year's spy trials and on newspaper gleanings, the film's quasi-documentary character has been supported by its employment of newsreel shots of Hitler haranguing his Brownshirts, a commentator's voice, maps and other factual pictorial matter. But its editorial bias, however justified, has carried it to several childish extremes. Membership in the National Socialist party cannot be restricted entirely to the rat-faced, the brute-browed, the sinister. We don't believe Nazi propaganda Ministers let their mouths twitch evilly whenever they mention our Constitution or Bill of Rights. We thought that school of villainy had gone out with \\"The Beast of Berlin,\\" made back in '14.Since most of the facts are known, it seems superfluous to go into the story at all, except to mention that the Warners, conscious as they are of the spy and propaganda menaces, still are encouragingly confident of America's proof against them both. As Edward (G-man) Robinson remarks, the Nazis must he mad to think they can get away with it. So, after Francis Lederer, Paul Lukas, Dorothy Tree, Joe Sawyer and the other enemy agents have had their come-uppance, the Warners eaves-drop on a couple of the boys in a lunch-wagon and discover that Uncle Sam still is their favorite relative.As melodrama, the film isn't bad at all. Anatole Litvak has paced it well, and the performances of Mr. Robinson as the Federal man, Mr. Lederer as the weak link in the Nazi spy network and Mr. Lukas as the propaganda agent are thoroughly satisfactory. But the film's promised revelations have long been in the public domain, and we cannot fight down the impression that the picture has cheapened its cause and sacrificed much of its dignity by making its villains twirl their long black mustaches.

Call it a frank but lightweight little sex bauble, smoothly handled and consistently amusing. And, we might add, adult fun—not for the kiddies.Based on a European stage success called \\"The Dazzling Hour,\\" and co-adapted and directed by Mario Camerini, this Edward Harrison presentation has to do, simultaneously and ever so slyly, with sex and an unproduced opera. Apparently, in the good old days of Bellini and Donizetti, a boudoir promise held more security than an opera house contract.With this suggestion drolly established, and one eye shut, the plot sets up a romantic quadrangle to the rustle of nineteenth-century costumes and period operatic fragments. Now basically the ingredients are those old tried-and-true stand-bys—mistaken identity, continual prowling toward the bedroom and, to balance things, true love. But the incidents are so nimbly paced and written, and the entire cast so amiable, that the result ranges from disarming to plain funny.Signor Cervi is a lecherous, influential old count in pursuit, at first, of a villager he believes to be a composer's wife. This lady, deliciously performed by Nadia Gray, is actually a notorious libertine. Armando Francioli is the idealistic young musician who tentatively plays along with the confusion. And Signorina Lollobrigida is, believe it or not, his virtuous Plain-Jane wife (at first!) who decides not to sit idly by as the opera nears the boards.The humor comes from the ensuing confusion and crossed suspicions and, finally, from Signorina Lollobrigida's awkward attempt to play the libertine. The dialogue is salty and witty from beginning to end, and the closing line, with the principals in cozy understanding, is a howl.While Miss Gray, who looks amused at the whole thing, palms the picture, Signorina Lollobrigida and the two involved gentlemen seem almost as sporting. Deft bits are contributed also by Paolo Stoppa, as a mayor","excerpt":"Nella Zocchi, as a maid, and Marisa Puntas, as a fire-breathing prima donna.We repeat — naughty but nice, and not for the kids.

A9     Arafat's Whirlwind U.S. Tour   Yasir Arafat sailed through New York, Georgia and Texas, seeking to put pressure on Israel to halt plans to build a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. The Palestinian leader said agreements between Israel and the Palestinians might unravel without some change in the settlement decision. His trip was not without some unexpected theater, including a misunderstanding over where his plane would land.   A3     Mubarak Denies Israeli Appeal   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said he would not intervene in the case of an Israeli accused of spying and scheduled to stand trial in Cairo, despite an appeal from the visiting Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

A3     Swiss Propose Holocaust Fund   President Arnold Koller of Switzerland proposed creating a $4.7 billion fund and using its interest earnings to aid victims of the Holocaust and other calamities.

Among the donors were the organizers of a multibillion-dollar development in China that won the Clinton Administration's backing.   A1      Health Records Called Insecure   The computerized medical records of millions of Americans are subject to misuse or abuse, but few people recognize that fact, a committee of the National Research Council said.

A1       Ohio River Surges Inland   The Ohio River ran over its banks at Cincinnati and up the slope to Cinergy Field, the former Riverfront Stadium, which found itself in the river.

A1       Unemployment Jumps in City    New York City's unemployment rate reached 9.9 percent in January, the state said. It was the highest monthly rate in three years.
