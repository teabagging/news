Q.   I'm confused about my estimated tax payments. I was divorced last October, and re-ceived taxable alimony income for a three-month period that year, along with some dividend income. My 1981 taxable income is low compared with 1982, when I will receive a full 12 months of alimony plus the same amount of dividend income.   I'm told that as long as my estimated tax payments for 1982 equal the amount of tax I paid in 1981, I will not be subject to an underpayment penalty. Is that the case?  A.   It is perfectly legal as well as good financial planning to make estimated tax payments each quarter that together no more than equal the amount of tax you paid last year. This is one of several ''safe harbor'' exceptions that relieve individuals of any penalties for underpaying estimated taxes. It is also a favorite approach of those who expect their current income to far outstrip last year's as a result of a big salary increase, or a spouse who has gone back to work.

There are other memorable operatic midnights, of course. Verdi in particular seems to have loved transacting business at the witching hour. Think of Rigoletto returning to collect the corpse of (he thinks) the Duke","excerpt":"of the \\"Ballo\\" Amelia, in the moonlit shadow of the gallows, attempting the seeress Ulrica's cure (she hopes) for her feelings toward the king; of Don Carlos awaiting his garden assignation with (he thinks) his stepmother, the queen; of the disguised Sir John Falstaff cowering by Hearne's oak waiting (he thinks) for his tryst with Alice Ford.   But midnight isn't just the witching hour. It also marks day's end, the time by which working people who have to be up early in the morning ought to be in bed. And it's this workaday sense that is the basis for the most memorable of operatic midnights - in fact, one of the most haunting moments in all of opera: the \\"Mitternacht\\" quartet that doesn't quite end Act II of \\"Martha.\\"   There are no assassins or corpses here, no seeresses or gallows, no romantic triangles or jealous lovers or midnight trysts. There's no more than a brush with royalty: our heroine, Lady Harriet Durham, is a maid of honor to England's Queen Anne, who herself comes within offstage pointing distance of appearing in Act III. Also, this being a comic opera, there are disguises - the plot turns on the bored Lady Harriet's whimsical idea for her and her companion, Nancy, to don peasant girls' garb and attend the fair at Richmond.   Eventually, through a series of Comical Mischances, the ladies wind up as hired domestics in the farmhouse of the brothers Plunkett and Lionel. Well, not brothers but foster brothers; as they remember amid the hubbub of Richmond, Lionel and his mysteriously banished father were taken in by Plunkett's family, and the soon orphaned Lionel was raised as a son by the mother whose memory is so delicately recalled by both brothers.   The world encountered by \\"Martha\\" and \\"Julia,\\" as Lady Harriet and Nancy identify themselves, isn't your standard operatic world of murder and intrigue but a world still stranger and more dreaded: a world of Old-Fashioned Family Values. The Dignity of Labor. Honesty, Loyalty and Trustworthiness. The Sanctity of Mom.   Operas built on Old-Fashioned Family Values aren't often repertory staples - one thinks of Charpentier's \\"Louise,\\" Rossini's \\"William Tell\\" and not many others - and \\"Martha\\" has an especially meager reputation. Back near the turn of this century, while Richard Strauss was still able to imagine that his second opera, \\"Feuersnot,\\" was winning the public acceptance denied its predecessor, \\"Guntram,\\" he nevertheless had his alibis in place. He noted the considerable demands the work made on its performing forces, and then added that \\"Kunrad's big address still comes up against the deficient ubderstanding of a public accustomed to 'Trovatore' and 'Martha.' Will that ever change?\\"   Strauss thus established his claim as the 20th century's first celebrity \\"Martha\\"-basher. The record will show, however, that the public still hasn't caught up with Kunrad's harangue, whereas poor old \\"Martha\\" - Baron Friedrich von Flotow's only enduring legacy, first performed in Vienna in 1847 - continues to stake its claim to audience attention. Here's a radical thought: Might the series of operatic masterpieces that Strauss was about to unleash with \\"Salome\\" and \\"Elektra\\" have more in common with \\"Martha\\" than with \\"Guntram\\" or \\"Feuersnot\\"?   What makes the household of Plunkett and Lionel so special, and perhaps what also makes this so difficult to pin down (it is best appreciated through gradual absorption), is that their values aren't FITGpreachedFNMG. Richard Strauss himself seems to have learned, sometime between the composition of \\"Feuersnot\\" and \\"Salome,\\" that while sermonizing may have a place, the opera stage isn't it. Values aren't what you talk about, they're what you have - or rather, what make you do what you do.   So while Plunkett and Lionel don't talk about the golden rule, it can be seen - and heard - at work in pretty much everything they do. In the Act I duet, listen to Lionel's reflexively heartfelt response (\\"Blessed, yes blessed be her memory\\") to Plunkett's mention of their mother, and then hear how Plunkett without fuss returns the thought in his more down-to-earth manner (\\"Yes, she was a fine woman . . .\\").   Neither brother shows much interest in his own special qualities, but each has a well-developed sense of delight and wonder regarding the other's. If Lionel's gentle and poetic disposition is more immediately striking, it is more than balanced by Plunkett's physical and emotional strength. Look and listen closely, and we can begin to perceive the overwhelming protectiveness on the part of Plunkett the realist that has made it possible for Lionel the idealist to survive as long as he has, behaving as if the world around him truly is a just and reasonable place. And then we will more readily observe that the crisis for Plunkett is if anything greater when Lionel crashes into hard reality.   Since this is an opera, it's logical to expect the brothers' special qualities to be expressed at least in part through vocal qualities, and the simplest explanation for the general underappreciation of \\"Martha\\" is that we rarely hear it well enough sung. Because the musical materials look so simple, and the vocal lines appear undemanding relative to those of fancier operatic roles, what we are likely to get is operetta-quality voices - a problem, for that matter, suffered by all the better-quality operettas as well.   To date, the best corrective is the disk of excerpts recorded by Angel in 1960 with Fritz Wunderlich as Lionel. The role doesn't lie especially high, but large chunks of it sit on the break, the upper-midrange transitional area of the voice (D, E, F) where even good tenors are more likely to be deploying strategies for traveling between the vocal registers than to be singing with Wunderlich's liquid, luxuriant ease and wide range of rhythmic and dynamic control. Couple a voice of such beauty and control with such believably personal and specific musical instincts (for which Wunderlich was rarely given sufficient credit, probably because you didn't hear him self-consciously \\"interpreting\\"), and we can begin to hear the qualities in Lionel that have such a brightening effect on everyone at all susceptible to his guilelessness and generosity.   In particular, we can (a) hear the effect on Lionel of his infatuation when he is at last left alone with \\"Martha\\" in Act II, and (b) get a clearer sense of his effect on her than even she will have for another two acts. The most obvious example of (a) is Lionel's rhythmically energized yet melting response to Martha's protestation of servantly ineptitude, that all she likes to do is stand around and sing: \\"Singen sollst du, frohlich sein . . .\\" - \\"You shall sing, be happy, and in our work we will be inspired by your song, so pure and gentle.\\"   The most obvious example of (b) is Lady Harriet's capitulation to Lionel's plea for a song: not merely a song, but the best performance our prima donna has in her - this is, after all, her biggest solo opportunity of the evening - of Flotow's setting of \\"The Last Rose of Summer.\\" The difference in their social positions makes it impossible for Lady Harriet to imagine the romantic attraction that \\"Martha\\" is feeling, and the confusion she is experiencing doesn't lessen her sense of the absurdity of Lionel's love-levels-all-ranks marriage proposal, or the cruelty of her dismissal.   To this confusion add the open warfare raging between the re-entering Plunkett and \\"Julia,\\" interrupt it all with the sound of midnight, and nothing less than an operatic quartet could capture the moment. Here again we have to turn to Wunderlich to hear the possibilities. Except for a dip down to A flat, Lionel's entire part here lies within a fifth around the break, from D flat up to A flat, and nobody else I have heard can do with it what Wunderlich does.   For example, Peter Anders, the Lionel of a much-circulated 1944 Berlin \\"Martha,\\" sings it very nicely but is so clearly \\"managing\\" the vocal line that he can't manage any real vocal ease, or poetry. Curiously, Caruso, who recorded this quartet along with several other \\"Martha\\" excerpts, and who, you would figure, could have done with its lines whatever he wanted, just bulled his way through; he doesn't seem to have connected to it.   Perhaps the words led him astray. What Lionel sings is: \\"Sleep well, and may you regret what your wicked scorn has done; o let me tomorrow enjoy your love - good night.\\" Which doesn't sound like our Lionel - awfully \\"me\\"-centered. To which the most reasonable explanation may be that the poor boy is, after all, in love, and his brain may be a bit scrambled, because when you add the music, you hear that the FITGvocal FNMGactions all have to do with Martha's well-being, not his own.   If what we have sounds like an opera that ought to be called \\"Lionel,\\" about a virtuous lad who discovers that practicing those Old-Fashioned Family Values can get you not only publicly humiliated but also, if you're really lucky, arrested, it may be because Flotow has drawn his hero in musically fuller dimension. Or it may be because the innocent Lionel is the more obviously sympathetic protagonist.   There's nothing inherently less believable about the deep-rooted dissatisfaction with her life that drives Lady Harriet to the dopey prank that has such messy consequences. We may identify more cozily with Lionel's high-mindedness than with the surely unintended cruelty that slips into Lady Harriet's observation of the comical characters she encounters on this \\"Farmhouse\\" ride in the Real World theme park. But it may be more important for us to identify with the unattractive behavior - a favorite theme of Richard Strauss's operas, interestingly - and perhaps all we need is a soprano who can make Martha's situation as real for her as Wunderlich made Lionel's for him.   For that matter, there is very little in the opera that can't be made real, and in the process even some of the more clunkily predictable sections of the score - the choral scenes, for example - might be made personal and alive in a way that is not likely to happen if they're treated simply as figments of the genre of early-19th-century German comic opera.   \\"Martha\\" may not be a masterpiece, but it does some worthwhile things awfully well, and has a lot more going for it than the inescapable \\"Ach, so fromm\\" (or \\"M'appari,\\" if you prefer) and the borrowed \\"Last Rose.\\"  MUSIC An Opera of - Gasp! - Old-Fashioned Family Values"},{"year":"1977","title":"A Carter Administration official in Washington said yesterday the Treasury Department had received a preliminary report from Arthur Anderson and Company, the accountants, on New York City'City budget,. which raised questions but drew no conclusions about the appropriateness &#8216","excerpt":"of the &#8220;C.U.N.Y. shuffle.&#8221; Article 3 ‐‐ No Title"},{"year":"1934","title":"Figures on applications and acceptances for 182-day bills TREASURY BILLS OVERBID.","excerpt":"Of the $251,941,000 Offered, $75,353,000 Is Accepted."},{"year":"1925","title":"Bonds offered REAL ESTATE ISSUES LEAD BOND MARKET","excerpt":"Of the $28,814,000 in New Offerings Today, $18,500,000 Are Realty and Mortgages.

THE UNDISCOVERED ELIZABETH BISHOP"},{"year":"1994","title":"This book has become a true classic: essential reading for everyone seriously interested in politics in the broadest and least partisan sense. In some ways, it is even more relevant to the United States today than it was when it created a sensation on its original publication in 1944.\\n\\nNearly a quarter of a century ago, I wrote an introduction to a new German edition of \\"The Road to Serfdom.\\" That introduction is equally relevant to this 50th anniversary edition. I herewith quote it in full before adding a few comments.\\n\\n\\nOver the years, I have made it a practice to inquire of believers in individualism how they came to depart from the collectivist orthodoxy of our times. For years, the most frequent answer was a reference to \\n[\\nthis\\n]\\n book. Hayek's remarkable and vigorous tract was a revelation particularly to the young men and women who had been in the armed forces during the war. Their recent experience had enhanced their appreciation of the value and meaning of individual freedom. In addition, they had observed a collectivist organization in action. For them, Hayek's predictions about the consequences of collectivism were not simply hypothetical possibilities.\\n\\nToday, we hear little of \\"central planning,\\" of \\"production for use,\\" of the need for \\"conscious direction\\" of society's resources. Instead the talk is of the urban crisis -- solvable, it is said, only by vastly expanded government programs","excerpt":"of the environmental crises -- produced, it is said, by rapacious businessmen who must be forced to discharge their social responsibility instead of \\"simply\\" operating their enterprises to make the most profit and requiring also, it is said, vastly expanded government programs; of the consumer crisis -- false values stimulated by the self-same rapacious businessmen seeking profits instead of exercising social responsibility and of course also requiring expanded government programs to protect the consumer, not least from himself; of the welfare or poverty crisis -- here the jargon is still \\"poverty in the midst of plenty,\\" though what is now described as poverty would have been regarded as plenty when that slogan was first widely used.\\n\\nNow as then, the promotion of collectivism is combined with the profession of individualist values. Experience with big government has strengthened this discordant strand. There is wide protest against the \\"establishment\\"; an incredible conformity in the protest against conformity; a widespread demand for freedom to \\"do one's own thing,\\" for individual life styles, for participatory democracy.\\n\\nAs Hayek so persuasively demonstrates, these values require an individualistic society. They can be achieved only in a liberal order in which government activity is limited primarily to establishing the framework with which individuals are free to pursue their own objectives. The free market is the only mechanism that has ever been discovered for achieving participatory democracy.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the relation between the ends and the means remains widely misunderstood. Many of those who profess the most individualistic objectives support collectivist means without recognizing the contradiction. \\n\\nIt is tempting to believe that social evils arise from the activities of evil men and that if only good men (like ourselves, naturally) wielded power, all would be well. That view requires only emotion and self-praise -- easy to come by and satisfying as well. To understand why it is that \\"good\\" men in positions of power will produce evil, while the ordinary man without power but able to engage in voluntary cooperation with his neighbors will produce good, requires analysis and thought, subordinating the emotions to the rational faculty.\\n\\nSurely that is one answer to the perennial mystery of why collectivism, with its record of producing tyranny and misery, is so widely regarded as superior to individualism, with its demonstrated record of producing freedom and plenty. The argument for collectivism is simple if false; it is an immediate emotional argument. The argument for individualism is subtle and sophisticated; it is an indirect rational argument.\\n\\nHow stands the battle between collectivism and individualism in the West after the publication of Hayek's great tract? The answer is very different in the world of affairs and in the world of ideas.\\n\\nIn the world of affairs, those of us who were persuaded by Hayek's analysis saw few signs in 1945 of anything but a steady growth of the state at the expense of the individual, a steady replacement of private initiative and planning by state initiative and planning.\\n\\nYet in practice that movement did not go much farther. What produced this unexpected check to collectivism? First, particularly in Britain, the conflict between central planning and individual liberty that is Hayek's theme became patent. The tradition of liberty, the liberal values, were still sufficiently strong in Britain so that when the conflict occurred, central planning was sacrificed rather than individual liberty.\\n\\nThe second force checking collectivism was its inefficiency. Government proved unable to manage enterprises, to organize resources to achieve stated objectives at reasonable cost. It became mired in bureaucratic confusion and inefficiency. \\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, the check to collectivism did not check the growth of government; rather, it diverted its growth to a different channel. The emphasis shifted from governmentally administrated production activities to indirect regulation of supposedly private enterprises and even more to governmental transfer programs, involving extracting taxes from some in order to make grants to others -- all in the name of equality and the eradication of poverty but in practice producing an erratic and contradictory melange of subsidies to special-interest groups. As a result, the fraction of the national income being spent by governments has continued to mount.\\n\\nIn the world of ideas, the outcome has been even less satisfactory to a believer in individualism. In one respect, this is most surprising. Experience in the past quarter-century has strongly confirmed the validity of Hayek's central insight -- that coordination of men's activities through central direction and through voluntary cooperation are roads going in very different directions: the first to serfdom, the second to freedom.\\n\\n\\nIn 1994, there is wide agreement that socialism is a failure, capitalism a success. The fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of Communism behind the Iron Curtain and the changing character of China have reduced the defenders of a Marxian-type collectivism to a small, hardy band concentrated in Western universities. Yet this apparent conversion of the intellectual community to what might be called a Hayekian view is deceptive.\\n\\nWhile the talk is about free markets and private property -- and it is more respectable than it was a few decades ago to defend near-complete laissez-faire -- the bulk of the intellectual community almost automatically favors any expansion of government power so long as it is advertised as a way to protect individuals from big bad corporations, relieve poverty, protect the environment or promote \\"equality.\\" The discussion of a national program of health care provides a striking example. The intellectuals may have learned the words but they do not yet have the tune.

(Houghton Mifflin, $25.) Sexual awakening (not necessarily at the right time or for the right object) is a constant in this rather clinical collection of a novella (which centers on an aging countess whose vanity demands the constant service of a young lover) and three short stories about older men ruined by inopportune attacks of desire.    SOME HOPE: A Trilogy, by Edward St. Aubyn. (Open City, paper, $14.95.) Part comedy of manners, part chamber of horrors, these linked autobiographical novellas, set in the loftiest echelons of the British upper class, demonstrate that deep chemical dissolution and crisp Savile Row tailoring need not be conflicting imperatives.    THE POEMS OF MARIANNE MOORE, edited by Grace Schulman. (Viking, $40.) A vast anthology, including previously uncollected work, by a poet who subverted the time-honored   $(4$) /   $(4$) /   $(4$) /   $(4$) /   $(4$) of English verse to forge a new, asymmetrical metrics (lines of nine syllables!) that sounds like no one else.    COOK: The Extraordinary Voyages of Captain James Cook, by Nicholas Thomas. (Walker, $28.) This life of Cook, by a professor of anthropology, concentrates less on Cook's feats of navigation and cartography, which were marvelous, than on the ambassador from Europe who probably produced more ''first contacts'' with exotic peoples than anyone else ever.    THE STORIES OF RICHARD BAUSCH. (HarperCollins, $29.95.) The stirrings of the male heart and soul are the matter of Bausch's stories. In ''Valor,'' for example, a man acts heroically when a school bus crashes, then goes home to his wife, who has decided to leave. But his noble deed retains its nobility and enables him to reach over and touch her shoulder. It's not much, but it isn't nothing.    SHOOTING THE SUN, by Max Byrd. (Bantam, $23.95.) Science fiction meets the Wild West in this ingenious novel about an expedition in 1840, organized by a beautiful young Francophile American astronomer, to photograph an eclipse of the sun, predicted by an early computing machine of the English savant Charles Babbage.    BANDBOX, by Thomas Mallon. (Pantheon, $24.95.) At the center of this novel, set in a Hecht-and-MacArthur universe of curmudgeonly editors, swell dames and shimmering watering holes, two glossy magazines wage a circulation war in the twilight of the pre-Depression era.    THE SLEEPING FATHER, by Matthew Sharpe. (Soft Skull, paper, $14.) Sharpe's second novel rotates the point of view among the members of the Schwartz family of Connecticut","excerpt":"of these, our primary guide is Chris, a bitterly intelligent boy rolling bored through high school.

He offered her the biggest compliment he could: ''This is so good,'' he said of her work, ''you would not believe it was done by a woman.'' Nonetheless, he declined. Female artists were a relative rarity at the top galleries, and the most famous painters of the day were all men. The disparity was even more extreme at museums, and when paintings came up for sale, those by male artists fetched by far the higher price. By 1989, the artist-activists known as the Guerrilla Girls, founded to call attention to these disparities, were postering SoHo with a list of 67 women and artists of color whose work could be purchased with the record $17.7 million one Jasper Johns painting brought at auction.    Flash forward to spring 2005. With the Guerrilla Girls preparing to exhibit in the first Venice Biennale overseen by two women, a casual observer might think the art world is at the vanguard of gender equality. But next week's contemporary art auctions, one of the most prestigious art markets in the world, tell a very different story indeed. Of the 861 works that Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips de Pury, & Company are offering over three days starting May 10, a mere 13 percent, are by female artists.

Her two historic lectures and the book that grew out of them are a cornerstone of feminist doctrine and freethinking criticism. Although the essay was written to be delivered in public (at Cambridge University in 1928), it was not regarded as a dramatic piece -- until Eileen Atkins gave it life on stage.    In her performance at the Lamb's Theater, Miss Atkins offers a virtuosic feat of acting and a luminous portrait of the artist. She brings to the role a great assurance, humor and resonance.

We tend to think of Tennessee Williams's plays, rather than his fiction","excerpt":"of Woody Allen's movies, rather than his stories; of John Updike's novels, rather than his poetry or reviews. The fact remains, however, that these artists have all demonstrated a remarkable fluency in a variety of forms, as have others throughout history. Had Chekhov been required to state his occupation on a passport application, would he have chosen ''playwright'' or ''short-story writer''? Would William Blake have opted to be identified as a poet or a painter? And what about Wyndham Lewis - painter? novelist? polemicist? or simply professional malcontent?   In Britain, of course - where it's long been assumed that a properly educated person should be able to write elegantly as well as, say, paint and play the piano - layman authors, from Alec Guinness to Jonathan Miller to Oliver Sacks, almost routinely turn out eloquent, polished works. And professional writers regularly move from one form to another with unself-conscious ease. Anthony Burgess has written screenplays, symphonies, biographies, poetry, children's stories and criticism, in addition to some two dozen novels; and Michael Frayn, who is probably best known today as the author of such West End and Broadway hits as ''Noises Off'' and ''Benefactors,'' enjoyed earlier success with five comic novels and a satiric newspaper column.

Decorum must be maintained, which suppresses most of the colorful slang terms that political people use in private debate.   On occasion, a word pops up that has not been ruled upon. One such is yobbo, a term now sweeping Britain that has not yet made an impact across the Atlantic. In the House of Commons, when Norman Tebbit, the Conservative Party chairman, derided a group called the Militant Tendency within the Labor Party, Neil Kinnock, the opposition leader, led his supporters in what was described in The Daily Telegraph as ''uncontrolled giggling'' and ''tie-slicking.'' This demonstration caused the Conservative to label his tormentors, who would not let him speak, ''a bunch of yobbos.''   A yobbo is a ruffian. On a recent visit to London, I asked Mr. Tebbit for his definition of the slang word, and he promptly replied, ''A low-grade, street-corner thug.'' (A Labor front-bencher called Mr. Tebbit ''a street-corner lout,'' which is synonymous, though lout is standard English.) The noun yobbo has lent itself to adaptation in the adjective yobbish and a second noun, yobbism, which is presumably a belief in the values of hanging out on street corners and being a yob.

But the results should be interesting among the echoes of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue and 112th Street, where the choir will perform tonight through Sunday at 8. The group is also adding instruments, including hammered dulcimer, guitar, clavichord, zither and Laotian mouth organ. The music, although rooted in early music of both East and West, is 20th century, most of it composed by Mr. Hykes. Tickets: $7 ($6 for students and over-65's).

As I watched the three MaGrath sisters reassemble for the 30th birthday of one and for the impending death of the grandfather who'd long cared for them, I found myself often grinning at what might have been gruesome, sometimes cocking my head sharply to catch a rueful inflection before it turned into a comic one, and always, always admiring the actresses involved. I also found myself, rather too often and in spite of everything, disbelieving - simply and flatly disbelieving.  Since this is scarcely the prevailing opinion, I'd best be specific.   Take a case in point. Mia Dillon plays the only one of the three who's married, and at the moment she's most decidedly stealing the limelight from the aging birthday girl, Lizbeth Mackay, and from Mary Beth Hurt, the pop singer who didn't make it and wound up in a mental institution over Christmas.
