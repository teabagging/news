The public and the press continually refer to residents as doctors. While residents have graduated from a medical school and some may be licensed, they are all enrolled in a graduate medical education program called a residency. The system of graduate medical education must be changed so that it is understood by the professors, directors of clinical services, the trainees and the public that resident \\"doctors\\" are graduate medical students and cannot be permitted to provide independent patient care services without a clearly accountable supervisory scheme.   The 405 regulations, which were developed in part as a response to the Libby Zion tragedy, need to be vigorously enforced. While media focus has been on the provisions preventing sleep deprivation of residents, the regulations of greatest import and least mentioned are those with regard to supervision. The committee that made the recommendations for the 405 regulations said, \\"It cannot be overemphasized that the intent of the committee is to increase the responsibility of the attending physicians in the supervision of residents.\\"   Medical educators endorse the precept that doctors are not qualified to practice medicine until they finish at least the minimum of three years of graduate medical education required by many specialties for board certification.

But there's nothing like agreement at the moment either about what the new business leader should look like or about standards appropriate for evaluating business conduct in a new cultural climate. And for that reason the current image of business is more problematic than conventional wisdom intimates. Practical works such as Mark H. McCormack's ''What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School'' are innocuous - plainspoken guidebooks providing advice to fledglings about ''how to read people,'' how to ''take the edge,'' when to order Perrier, when to order Scotch, other basic business skills.

Though the Letts ethnically and linguistically are quite distinct from their northern neighbors the Ests, Latvia's history parallels that of Estonia. German merchants, knights, and missionaries made Latvia a semi-ecclesiastical German colony in the 13th century; in the 16th century Latvia passed under first Swedish, then Lithuanian rule; in the 18th century Peter the Great's Russian empire absorbed the land. A 19th-century cultural revival, inspired in part by Johann von Herder, a native of Riga, found expression in folkloric societies, archaeological research and the compilation of the epic poem, Lacplesis. Brest-Litovsk, the Soviet Union's 1918 peace treaty with Germany, granted Latvia's political independence for the first time in its history. The constitution of 1922 established a one-house legislature in whose system of proportional representation about 20 different political parties participated. To avoid violence between left and right armed extremists, Prime Minister Karlis Umanlis dissolved the Parliament in May 1934 and ruled as dictator until a new constitution that provided for expanded presidential powers and a second house of the legislature, based on the conception of a corporate state, came into existence in 1938 just before the Hitler-Stalin Pact awarded Latvia to the Russian sphere of interest. Stalin garrisoned troops in Latvia, rigged elections, and incorporated the country as a new union republic of the U.S.S.R. in 1940. For 50 years, harsh Soviet rule continued. The larger cities were Russianized and the highly educated middle and upper-middle classes were deported throughout Russia. Industrialization brought relative prosperity, but the national consciousness was never eradicated. Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, led to the creation of dissident groups who staged public demonstrations on the anniversaries of the Stalin-Hitler Pact and of the establishment of Latvian independence. After the head of the Latvian Communist party, Boris Pugo was transferred to Moscow, Latvia's Communist party came under the influence of the newly created Latvian Popular Front. With the new political influence of non-Communists, on Sept. 29, 1988, Latvian replaced Russian as the official language. In March 1990, following Lithuania's example, Latvia announced its intention to secede, survived Gorbachev's January 1991 military crackdown, and after the failed August 1991 coup in Moscow, declared independence. In June 1995 Latvia gained associate status with the E.U. Summer elections revealed deep political divisions as the three major political parties took half the seats. It was not until December that Andris Skele was able to become prime minister, heading a cabinet containing members of six of Latvia's nine parties. Skele was forced to resign in July 1997 because of corruption charges and over disappointment that the E.U. would not consider Latvia's application until the “second wave.” Parliamentary elections in Oct. 1998 resulted in the same degree of party splintering, but Vilis Kristopans was able to form a government. More significantly, in a referendum voters eased the citizenship laws, making it simpler for ethnic Russians (one-third of the population) to become citizens. In June 1999 Pres. Ulmanis' second term ended; his successor, Vaira Vike Freiberga, became the first female president of an ex-Soviet republic. Coalition discord brought the end of the Kristopanis government in July 1999; the successor government, under Andris Skele collapsed in April 2000, with the mayor of Riga, Andris Berzins, nominated as his successor. In 2002 a four-party center-right coalition government was founded with Einers Repse as prime minister. In 2004 Latvia joins the E.U. and NATO.

Except for brief episodes of British rule, Suriname remained under Dutch control until its independence in 1975, shifting toward authoritarian military rule in 1980. The military created its own political party (the February 25 movement) and banned opposition organizations. The 1988 National Assembly election of Pres. Ramsewak Shankar ended direct military rule, but the restriction of civil liberties continued. The Shankar government was overthrown in a bloodless coup led by Cmdr. Ivan Graanoogst in 1990, and civilian rule was restored in 1991 although the former military ruler, Col. Desi Bouterse, who led the coup and remains “Advisor of the State,” is apparently still the defacto ruler.

Kuwait, at the head of the Persian Gulf, was part of the Abbasid empire from the eighth century and was absorbed into the Ottoman Empire in the late 16th century. It was organized as a principality under the al-Sabah dynasty in 1756, but the Ottomans continued to assert sovereignty. Increasing British influence during the 19th century was formalized in 1899, when Kuwait became a British protectorate. The discovery of oil, first exported from Kuwait after World War II, rapidly made the principality one of the wealthiest in the Middle East. The British protectorate ended in 1961, when Kuwait gained full independence. The great majority of oil field workers in Kuwait are non-Kuwaiti Arabs, including many Palestinians. Oil revenues have made possible a total welfare state for Kuwaiti citizens, who pay no taxes and enjoy a wide range of free social services. Kuwait allied itself with Iraq in the Iran-Iraq War of 1980–88; Kuwaiti tankers came under heavy attack from Iranian warships in the gulf. In July 1987, Kuwaiti tankers were reflagged with the U.S. flag and placed under escort of American warships in an operation that continued into 1989. Most of Kuwait's territory is barren and sparsely inhabited but with proven crude oil reserves of 94 bil. barrels—10 percent of the world's reserves—other economic endeavors are not needed. On Aug. 2, 1990, Kuwait was invaded, and later annexed, by Iraq. In February 1991 it was liberated by a coalition of Arab, non-Arab Muslim, and Western nations led by the United States. Much of the country was destroyed or looted by the Iraqis. After its return to power, the ruling al-Sabah family came under strong pressure to institute democratic reforms. Parliamentary elections were held in 1992, and opposition candidates won 30 of 50 seats. The sultan then announced a new cabinet with more nonroyal members than ever before. A brief war-scare flared up in October 1994 as 20,000 Iraqi Republican Guards were moved to the Kuwaiti border, only to retreat in the face of U.S. military opposition. In November, Iraq formally recognized Kuwait's sovereignty Kuwait"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: northern Europe.

By 1387 Britain was long independent, but Denmark added Sweden and Finland to its domain. Yet it was never a great power. Its kings never really controlled the nobility, while in foreign affairs it was dominated by the Hansa, the league of German trading cities. In the 16th century Denmark had to recognize the independence of Sweden and Finland. In the 19th century it lost Norway (to Sweden in 1814) and Schleswig-Holstein (to Prussia in 1864). In the 20th century Denmark sold the Virgin Islands to the United States in 1914 and had to recognize Iceland's independence in 1944. In the 19th century, Denmark was transformed from a poor peasant society to one of Europe's richest agricultural nations by means of reforms that established agricultural cooperatives and emphasized intensive specialization in the production of dairy products and pork. These products remain a mainstay of the Danish economy. Denmark remained neutral during World War I. In 1939 Denmark signed a 10-year nonaggression pact with Germany, but Germany nevertheless invaded Denmark in April 1940; the country surrendered without a fight. In 1941 Denmark's ambassador in Washington transferred defense of Greenland to the United States, and much of Denmark's merchant fleet joined the Allied war effort. Denmark was placed under German martial law in August 1943 and was treated as an enemy nation. Danish resistance succeeded in evacuating 7,000 Jews to neutral Sweden. Denmark was liberated by British troops in May 1945. Although Denmark was not technically a participant on the Allied side in World War II, it became a U.N. member in 1946 and a founding member of NATO in 1949. By the latter year, the postwar recovery was complete, with industrial levels exceeding those of the prewar period. High taxes, unemployment, and inflation remained problems, but the economy was aided by the growth of trade with West Germany. In 1953 the king assented to a constitutional reform that abolished the upper house of the legislature, leaving the Folketing as the sole legislative body. Proportional representation meant that it was impossible for any party to gain a parliamentary majority, so Denmark is always governed by coalition regimes. In the postwar period, these normally have been led by the Social Democrats. In the 1950's Denmark adopted a characteristically Scandinavian program of free enterprise, high taxes, and extensive social welfare systems. A high rate of economic growth, spurred by agricultural exports, continued throughout the 1960's. Denmark joined the E.C. in 1972. The 1970's brought economic difficulties, as Danish oil exploration in the North Sea yielded disappointing results, and inflation reached double digits. The elections of 1982 installed Denmark's first Conservative government since 1905. A Conservative four-party coalition formed in 1984 remained in office until 1993 when Prime Minister Schlüter resigned over charges of misleading the Folketing about restrictions on the immigration of Tamil refugees. Social Democrat Poul Nyrup Rasmussen formed a coalition government with only a one-seat majority. The general revival of the world economy in the 1980's coupled with government austerity measures has led to renewed growth and lowered inflation. Although as recently as 1986 Danish voters renewed their commitment to the E.C., in the June 1992 referendum on the Maastricht Treaty—providing for common defense and foreign policy as well as a common currency and central bank—Denmark said “no.” The E.U. quickly made concessions that guaranteed Denmark's right to opt out of any common E.U. citizenship, police force, defense policy, or judicial arrangement. In May 1993 Danish voters approved this different version of the treaty. In Sept. 2000 a referendum on the euro was defeated and later the Danes said they would not be part of the E.U.'s army. In Nov. 2001 Folketing elections, the Liberal Party, for the first time since 1920, outpolled the Social Democrats and the Liberal coalition organized a new government of the right under premier Anders Fogh Rasmussen. Within a week they had carried stronger immigration-control measures—the principal issue that had separated the two coalitions in the campaign.

The birthplace of Gautama Buddha (C. 600 B.C.), Nepal was for many centuries a collection of petty principalities, inhabited by various Tibeto-Burman peoples who mostly practiced Lamaistic Buddhism. In 1769 the country's three geographical zones—floodplain, foothills, and high mountains—were united under the Gurkhas, who made Hinduism the country's official religion. Nepal established treaty relations with Great Britain in 1792 and fought a border war with British India in 1814-16, but it was never incorporated into the British Empire. A revolution in 1950 overthrew a government of heriditary rulers that had overthrown the Shah dynasty in the 19th century. King Tribuhavan (a Shah) was restored and tried to introduce democratic reforms, but his son Mahendra dissolved Parliament and introduced a tiered system of town, district, and national councils. Road and air links to India, Pakistan, and Tibet were improved, and Nepal began to emerge from its customary isolation. The successful climb of Mt. Everest by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 focused international attention on Nepal. Mahendra was succeeded in 1972 by his son, Birendra. Antigovernment demonstrations in 1990 led to the shooting deaths of 63 civilians, so Birendra lifted a 30-year-old ban on political parties and ordered the constitution rewritten to establish multiparty democracy and human rights as essentials of the political system. The king retains control of the military and is still head of state. The Nepali Congress Party formed the first government in 1991, but after 1994 a series of brief coalitions, often including the Communist Party, governed Nepal until the May 1999 elections permitted the Nepali Congress Party to govern without a coalition. But prime minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai proved too ill to deal with Nepal's depressed economy and with the Maoist guerrilla force (“People's War”) afflicting Nepal since 1996; he resigned in March 2000 to be replaced by Giriji Prasad Koirala. On June 1, 2001 Crown Prince Dipendra murdered his parents and eight other members of the royal family, after which he shot himself. His uncle became King Gyanendra. In the turmoil, the Maoist rebels increased their depredations. The accession of Sher Bahadur Deuba as prime minister in July 2001 brought a harder line against the Maoist rebels: no negotiations before surrender. (Both China and India support the government hard line.) In Oct. 2002, King Gyanendra suspended the constitution, appointed Lokendra Chand as interim prime minister to open dialogue with the Maoists. Secret talks and quickly-broken truces led nowhere. Chand resigned in May 2002 with the rebels holding about 4o percent of the country. Surya Bahadur Thapa replaced him.

Ireland, a collection of warring Celtic chieftainships, was converted to Christianity by St. Patrick in the fifth century. Over the next two centuries, Ireland became a great center of monastic Christianity, sending missionaries to Scotland, England, and the Continent. While the Roman Empire decayed, Ireland was a center of peace, culture, and learning. Viking invasions in the ninth and 10th centuries caused substantial damage and overturned the rule of the great monasteries and their secular allies. By the time an Irish monarchy was reestablished by Brian Boru in 1014 and the surviving invaders were integrated into Irish society, Ireland had become an isolated, poor backwater on the periphery of Europe. Trade gave rise to English commercial interests in Ireland and to Henry II's claim to overlordship of Ireland in the 12th century. Henry VIII declared himself king of Ireland and introduced the Reformation there. Large-scale Scottish immigration to Ulster began during the reign of Elizabeth I. Penal laws were applied, banning Catholics from public life and making the Mass an act of treason. A rebellion in 1641 was crushed by Oliver Cromwell over the course of a decade, ending with a massacre of thousands of Irish at Drogheda. After William of Orange's “Glorious Revolution” of 1688, the Irish supported James II, who was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Following these events, British economic sanctions destroyed Ireland's flourishing export trade in wool. “Plantations” were established by British and Scottish Presbyterian landlords and farmers on lands seized from Irish Catholics. Much of the native aristocracy fled into exile, and the Gaelic language declined to near extinction. A separate Irish Parliament, dominated by the Anglo-Irish establishment, was instituted in 1782, but it had little power. In 1798 a popular uprising led by Wolfe Tone, with inspiration and aid from revolutionary France, was put down with great loss of life. In 1800 Ireland and England were joined by the Act of Union, whereby Ireland was ineffectively represented in the British Parliament. After popular agitation led by Daniel O'Connell, the Catholic Emancipation Act was enacted by Parliament in 1829, though mandatory tithes continued to support the established Anglican church until 1869. Under absentee landlords, the Irish population was reduced to a subsistence diet based largely on potatoes. When a potato blight struck the country in the 1840's, disaster ensued. Between 1846 and 1851, one million people starved to death, and 1.6 million emigrated, most to America. In the late 19th century, a home-rule movement under Charles Stewart Parnell won wide popular support. A Home Rule Act finally was passed by Parliament in 1914, but its effect was postponed for the duration of World War I. The Land Purchase Acts of the early 20th century enabled dispossessed peasants to buy land from absentee landlords, creating a rural economic basis for an independent Ireland. The country's economy, based largely on agriculture and pasturage, began to recover. (Industry, principally shipbuilding and textiles, was largely confined to Northern Ireland.) The postponement of home rule led to the Easter Rebellion of 1916; brutally suppressed, it was followed by the “Troubles,” a period of guerrilla warfare lasting to 1920. In that year the Government of Ireland Act established six of Ulster's nine counties as Northern Ireland, an integral part of the United Kingdom but with its own home-rule Parliament. The south's refusal of similar status led to the passage on Dec. 11, 1922, of the Irish Free State Act, by which Ireland became an independent dominion within the British Commonwealth. The Fine Gael (People of Ireland) party governed until 1932, when Eamon De Valera, as the head of the Fianna Fail (Soldiers of Destiny) party, was elected president, holding that office until 1948. In 1938 the Constitution was revised to sever all connections with the British government except for an “external association” with the British monarchy. The outlawed Irish Republican Army (I.R.A.) pressed for forcible reunification of Ireland and carried out attacks on British interests in both Ireland and Northern Ireland. Ireland remained neutral during World War II, and its government objected to British military activities in Northern Ireland. But it was generally sympathetic to the Allied war effort, especially after the United States entered the war in 1941. In 1949 Ireland severed all ties to the British Crown, becoming a fully independent republic. The Fianna Fail won a majority in the republic's first elections, and De Valera became prime minister. In 1954 a coalition government under John Costello took power. De Valera was elected president of the republic in 1959. During the 1950's, Ireland developed a moderate welfare state with the support of both the Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. In the 1960's attention turned to industrial development: zinc and lead mining, and export-oriented production of textiles, ceramics, and machinery. Ireland was admitted to the E.C. in 1973. Beginning in the late 1960's, civil rights demonstrations led frequently to civil disorders and an increase in I.R.A. guerrilla activity in the north. While the 1970's were a boom period for the Irish Republic, sectarian violence and terrorism in the north left over 2,500 dead. The 1980's saw the establishment of an Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council (1981) and the Hillsborough accords (1985) between the Thatcher government and the Fine Gael-Labour coalition, which gave Ireland a consultative role in Northern Irish disputes. The government of Charles Haughey, leader of Fianna Fail, elected in 1987, faced economic problems, including high inflation and unemployment, forcing Haughey to form a coalition government in the spring of 1989. After serious losses in June 1991 local elections, and amid charges of corruption, Haughey resigned in 1992. His successor, Albert Reynolds, faced a deep recession with unemployment rates of about 20 percent. In June 1992, a national vote strongly supported the E.C.'s Maastricht Treaty. Reynolds' coalition fell in Nov. 1992, but he created a new coalition between Fianna Fail and Labour. In 1993, Reynolds and U.K. prime minister John Major announced the “Downing Street Declaration” that Sinn Fein, the political arm of the I.R.A., would be invited to participate in negotiations on Northern Ireland in return for the I.R.A.'s promise to halt terrorism and violence. In 1994, the I.R.A. announced a cease-fire in its 25-year-old effort to expel British troops from Northern Ireland. Preliminary talks began optimistically, but bogged down over the British demand that the IRA disarm and the I.R.A. demand that Britain withdraw its forces from Ulster. In 1996, the I.R.A. announced an end to the 17-month-old cease-fire less than an hour before setting off a powerful bomb in East London, injuring 100 people. And in June, an even stronger bomb exploded in Manchester, injuring 200 and casting serious doubt on Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams's ability to control the more militant members of his party. Meanwhile, Ireland's governing coalition fell in Nov. 1995, and was replaced by an odd coalition with John Bruton of Fine Gael as prime minister. The new government passed legislation permitting Irish doctors to provide information about foreign abortion providers and sponsored a referendum that overturned the consitutional ban on divorce with remarriage. The Dail elections of June 1997 turned Bruton's coalition out of office, replaced by a new coalition of Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats with Fianna Fail's Bertie Ahern as prime minister. In April 1998 came the breakthrough agreement (overwhelmingly approved in referendums in Northern Ireland and the Republic in May): extensive home rule in a Northern Ireland remaining part of the U.K. with some Republic of Ireland participation and with all paramilitary groups disarmed. When the deadline of Feb. 1, 2000 came and went without the I.R.A. or any other armed group disarming, Great Britain suspended the government that had been functioning for only 10 weeks (since Dec. 2). But when the I.R.A. in May pledged to put its arms “beyond use” and permit inspections, the Ulster Unionist Party accepted and the new government was functioning again by May 29. On July 26, the inspectors reported to Tony Blair that inspections had begun and that arms dumps were secure against use. Yet the refusal of the I.R.A. and other paramilitary groups to disarm led (on July 1, 2001) to the resignation of Protestant leader David Trimble as first minister, once again jeopardizing the peace accord. But Trimble and the U.U.P. returned with confirmation that the I.R.A. had decommissioned some weapons in October and April—June was marred by militia violence in Belfast. Meanwhile, in the Republic, Fianna Fail became the first ruling party since 1969 to win re-election. In the spring of 2003 the issue of I.R.A. disarmament again caused Britain to suspend the Northern Assembly yet again.

Mountainous and landlocked, Afghanistan has been a crossroads of trans-Asian trade and conquest since antiquity. A part of the Persian Empire, Bactria was conquered by Alexander the Great, and became independent in the third century B.C. before falling to the Parthians in the next century. In the seventh century A.D., a flourishing Buddhist civilization there fell to Islamic conquests. Genghis Khan overthrew the 11th-century empire of Mahmud of Gazni in the early 13th century, and Afghanistan was the center of Tamerlane's empire in the late 14th century. Thereafter, the region was divided among various tribes and petty kingdoms. Modern Afghan history began with the establishment of a united emirate by Ahmed Shah Durrani in 1747. In the 19th century, Russia and Great Britain contested domination of Afghanistan. The British Afghan Wars of 1838–42 and 1878–80 left Afghanistan unconquered but within Britain's sphere of influence. Afghanistan achieved full independence from Britain in 1919 under Amanullah Khan, who proclaimed himself king in 1926. Modern reforms were instituted by Amanullah and his successors Mohammed Nadir Shah (1929–33) and Mohammed Zahir Shah (1933–73). The monarchy fell to a military coup in 1973, and Mohammed Daud Khan established a republic. In 1978 pro-Soviet leftists took power in a coup, and, ostensibly at the government's invitation, Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in December 1979 to put down widespread popular revolts against Communist rule. In the ensuing civil war, the government's forces and their Soviet allies (with an eventual troop strength of more than 100,000) controlled the cities and main transportation routes, but guerrilla forces contested the countryside. In 1988 the Soviet Union began a withdrawal of its troops, completed by February 1989. The rebel factions failed to achieve a united front and the pro-Soviet government confounded predictions that it would fall soon after the Soviet departure. The government fell on Apr. 15, 1992, and rebel troops entered Kabul. A respected religious leader, Sibghatullah Mujaddidi, was named interim president, with the backing of a coalition of forces dominated by rebel commanders. However, Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of the fundamentalist Hizbe Islami faction, declined to join the coalition, and fighting broke out in and around Kabul. On June 28 Mujaddidi turned over his power to the Leadership Council, which then elected Burhanuddin Rabbani as president. Fighting for control of Kabul continued between forces loyal to the Rabbani government and those backing Hekmatyar. Other factions later joined the fighting, and Kabul was subjected to continual rocket attacks in late 1992 and into the spring of 1993. Hekmatyar was named prime minister in an attempt to make peace. Fighting broke out again in early 1994 with Rabbani's followers getting the upper hand after fierce battles in Kabul. By early 1995, the U.N. had brokered a scheme uniting the nine major factions in a council to which Rabbani would turn over power. But it was quickly undone by the emergence of a fundamentalist Islamic militia called the Taliban, 20,000 strong and composed of students from the Islamic schools. Taliban forces took over most of the country and established a fundamentalist regime based on Islamic law. In Oct. 1996, three remaining groups of opposition forces formed a loose Northern Alliance and kept up sporadic fighting; but by 1999 the Taliban controlled over 90 percent of Afghanistan's territory. The Taliban then consolidated its power and began to enforce a strict Muslim code of behavior. In 2001, the U.N. reported a precipitate drop in opium poppies grown in Afghanistan (producer of 75 percent of the world's opium). A second ban, in Feb. 2001, on all statues in the country led to the destruction in March of 1,400-year-old Buddhist cliff carvings in the region of Bamiyan, despite a wave of world protest. In Sept. 2001 Afghanistan became the focus of world attention when the U.S. demanded the Taliban turn over the terrorist leaders suspected of plotting the attack on the World Trade Center. The Anglo-American air strikes that began Oct. 7 led to the fall (Nov. 13) of Kabul to the Northern Alliance. The interim government under Hamid Karzai organized a Grand Council of about 1,600 members which elected Karzai to lead a transitional government until elections in 2004 for a permanent government. In Aug. 2003, NATO forces took command of the international peacekeepeers; the Karzai government seemed to be holding on amidst the rivalries of tribal chieftains and warlords. But a U.N. report of Oct. 2002 noted that Afghanistan had again become the world's foremost opium producer.

The Mossi empire dominated the area of what is now Burkina Faso, a landlocked nation in western Africa with few natural resources and poor agricultural conditions, from as early as the 11th century. They ruled the region, often resisting Muslim invaders, until modern times. The region was hardly visited by Europeans before the 1880's, but by 1896 the French had captured the Mossi capital city of Ouagadougou and established a protectorate over the area. The French created Upper Volta in 1919, naming it for the upper basin of the Volta River. Upper Volta became a self-governing state with the French Overseas Community in 1958 and gained independence Aug. 5, 1960. After a brief period of military rule, the nation ratified a new constitution on June 14, 1970, and made a peaceful transition to civilian rule based on the French model. In 1980 the constitution was overthrown and a military government was set up. There was another coup on Aug. 4, 1983, and a government was established patterned after the Libyan government of Muammar al-Qaddafi. On Aug. 14, 1984, Upper Volta officially changed its name to Burkina Faso. Two attempted coups against the government of Capt.

Bantu peoples migrated into the region beginning in the 15th century; the Mashona dominated until the early 19th century, when they were displaced by the Matebele. Portuguese slave traders from Mozambique were active in Zimbabwe from the 16th to the mid-19th centuries. Mineral concessions were granted to Cecil Rhodes by local rulers in the late 19th century, and the region became a British protectorate in 1888. Salisbury (now Harare) was founded in 1890, and the territory comprising Zimbabwe and Zambia was named Rhodesia in 1895. Rhodesia was governed by the British South Africa Co. until 1923, when it was partitioned into Northern and Southern Rhodesia. Northern Rhodesia became a British colony; Southern Rhodesia, rejecting union with South Africa, became a self-governing (and whiteruled) state within the British Empire. Southern Rhodesia had been heavily settled by whites from Great Britain, South Africa, and elsewhere, who developed extensive farms and ranches, forest products industries, and rich mines. The country prospered but with little native participation in government. In 1953 Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland were joined in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Increasing agitation for black participation in government, especially in the north and in Nyasaland, led to the dissolution of the federation in 1963; Northern Rhodesia subsequently became independent as Zambia, Nyasaland as Malawi. In 1961 Southern Rhodesia adopted a constitution that guaranteed the continuation of white rule. White resistance to black political demands led to the rise of the Rhodesian Front party, whose leader, Ian D. Smith, became prime minister of Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia). After British-led negotiations for a biracial political compromise broke down, the Smith government on Nov. 11, 1965, issued a unilateral declaration of independence, which was declared illegal and invalid by the British government. The U.N. condemned the Smith government and imposed economic sanctions,and in May 1968 voted to impose a trade embargo on Rhodesia. In 1970 a new constitution effectively barred black participation in national politics. By 1974 mounting pressure from other African countries led the Smith government to enter into serious negotiations. Guerrilla warfare pitting black nationalist groups against white settlers and mercenaries raged sporadically throughout the country, and many white settlers emigrated. A 1977 British-American proposal for majority rule provided the basis for a settlement. An “internal settlement” was announced in April 1978 by Smith and three major nationalist leaders: Bishop Abel Muzorewa, leader of the United African National Congress, the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, former leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), and Chief Jeremiah Chirau. The settlement was rejected by the Patriotic Front that united ZANU (now led by Robert Mugabe) and Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). Elections were held in April 1979 and Bishop Muzorewa assumed office on June 1 as prime minister of “Zimbabwe-Rhodesia,” but the Patriotic Front continued to oppose the government. On Dec. 10 the “Zimbabwe-Rhodesia” Parliament dissolved itself, and the country reverted briefly to British colonial rule. On Dec. 21 all parties agreed to a cease-fire and to a period of transitional British rule leading to independence. Elections held in 1980 resulted in a clear majority for Mugabe's ZANU party. Zimbabwe became independent, with Mugabe as prime minister, on April 18. As Mugabe embarked on an ambitious program of national reconstruction, Nkomo became leader of the opposition. Guerrillas linked to ZAPU, with Nkomo's tacit leadership and with alleged support from South Africa, continued to engage in sporadic warfare against Mugabe's government, and banditry disrupted the countryside. The elections of 1985 increased ZANU's majority in Parliament. In 1987 the constitution was amended to strengthen the presidency and to end the separate role of blacks and whites in government; new elections were held for black members of Parliament to fill seats formerly reserved for whites. Guerrillas renewed attacks on white-owned farms. In Dec. 1987 Mugabe and Nkomo agreed to merge ZANU and ZAPU (ZANU-PF), creating a de facto one-party state under Mugabe. A presidential election was scheduled for 1996, but in 1995, the Rev. Ndonga Sithole, leader of the opposition Zimbabwe African National Union, was arrested and charged with plotting to kill Mugabe. Amidst a fuel crisis, 60 percent inflation and 50 percent unemployment, Zimbabwe voters in Feb. 2000 rejected a new constitution granting Mugabe 12 more years and power to seize white farmlands without compensation. But, with government approval, squatters began seizing white farms and preventing the tobacco harvest (30 percent of Zimbabwe's export earnings). June elections gave 57 of 120 seats contested to the opposition, sufficient to block any plan for a new constitution. But throughout 2001 Mugabe continued his plan to seize white-owned farms and began to arrest his political opponents. Court-packing, press controls, prohibition of assemblages, banning of non-governmental election-monitors, arrests of opponents—all preceded March 2002 presidential elections in which Mugabe claimed 1.7 million votes to 1.3 million for his principal opponent, Morgan Tsuangirai. Torture and rape by the army drove tens of thousands of Tsuangirai's supporters to flight. Mugabe seized further white farms amidst the worst famine in 60 years. A wave of arrests—over 300 members of opposition Movement for Democratic Change, including Tsuangirai, six members of Parliament, and the mayors of Zimbabwe's two largest cities—followed a weak attempt at a general strike in June 2003.

Bantu peoples—including Luba, Lunda, Ngoni, and others—moved into what is now Zambia between the 15th and the 19th centuries, displacing or absorbing aboriginal populations. Occasional Portuguese explorers from Angola and Mozambique entered the region, and Angolan slave-raiders were active in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, but serious European influence did not begin until the mid-19th century. At that time British missionaries and merchants arrived, most notably David Livingstone and Cecil Rhodes. Local rulers granted mineral concessions to Rhodes in both Northern and Southern Rhodesia (now Zambia and Zimbabwe). Rhodesia was declared a British sphere of influence in 1888; a British protectorate was established in 1891 and enlarged in 1894–95. The borders of Northern Rhodesia were established in 1911. The country was administered by the British South Africa Co. until 1924, when direct colonial rule began. Large numbers of British settlers arrived and developed farms and ranches and mined the region's substantial copper deposits. A railroad was built linking Northern Rhodesia with Elizabethville in the Belgian Congo (now Lubumbashi, Zaire). In 1953 Northern and Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) were joined with Nyasaland (now Malawi) to form the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The country entered a period of unrest with native peoples demanding greater participation in government, while white settlers clung to their privileged positions. As the result of an election in 1962, the federation was dissolved in 1963. A National Assembly was created on the basis of a broader, multiracial electorate. Northern Rhodesia became independent as the Republic of Zambia on Oct. 24, 1964. Relations between Zambia and white-ruled Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia) became strained in 1965 in a dispute over ownership and administration of the railway that spanned both countries. A new constitution was promulgated in 1973, creating a stronger presidency and a unicameral legislature; the United National Independence party was made the sole legal political party. Opposition parties were allowed to form again starting in December 1990. Pres. Kenneth Kaunda, in office after Zambia's independence, led a moderate government that won the support of both whites and blacks. Zambia's economy did not fare well as the price of copper, the nation's main earner of foreign exchange, declined around the world causing massive foreign debt and labor unrest. The I.M.F. demanded reforms as a condition for future aid, and in 1987 Pres. Kaunda announced a program of economic restructuring. In 1990 his government survived an attempted coup precipitated by a doubling in the price of the staple food, maize meal. At the end of 1991, Kaunda was defeated by Frederick Chiluba, head of the new Labor party. Chiluba's economic reforms helped Zambia repay more than $1.2 billion in outstanding debt, prompting the I.M.F. to restore its eligibility for international loans. But political problems resurfaced when Chiluba's government found a way to block Kaunda from winning in the 1996 presidential election. Kaunda was shot and wounded by a sniper in Aug. 1997 as he continued to criticize the government. In Oct. 1997 a failed coup attempt by junior army officers was blamed on Kaunda who was arrested in Dec. and put on trial in Jan. He was freed in June and all charges dropped probably on condition that he leave politics for good. In March 1999 Zambia's High Court declared him not a citizen. Pres. Chiluba honored his pledge not to run for re-election and the Dec. 2001 election was won by Levy Mwanawasa. The new president began a serious investigation into official corruption and Parliament (June 16, 2002) stripped Chiluba of his immunity and he was arrested in Feb. 2003 on charges of stealing millions of dollars.

Major trading partners: Brazil, Argentina, U.S. Uruguay was known as the Banda Oriental del Uruguay (Eastern Shore of the Uruguay River) during the colonial period. Although the Spanish first explored the area in 1516, they did not immediately settle there. Instead, the Portuguese founded the Colonia de Sacramento, near Buenos Aires, in 1680. They did not permanently establish the settlement of Montevideo until 1726. Under the leadership of José Gervasio Artigas, Uruguayans fought against both the Portuguese and the junta of Buenos Aires between 1811 and 1814 in an effort to establish their independence; in 1815 they proclaimed the Autonomous Government of the Eastern Provinces. In 1817 the Portuguese again took control of the region, but Uruguayan nationals ousted them in 1828. A new constitution for the country was promulgated in 1830; however, domestic rivalry among elites soon led to civil war. The two contending factions, Liberals (Colorados) and Conservatives (Blancos), wore red and white armbands, respectively. Civil war continued through the 1840's and 1850's, until the victory of the Colorados in 1865. In the War of the Triple Alliance (1865–70), Uruguay allied itself with Argentina and Brazil against Paraguay. The consequence of the war for Uruguay was independence from the other regional powers. The Colorado party dominated Uruguayan government from 1865 until 1958. Waves of European immigrants transformed Uruguayan society during the latter half of the 19th century, and by 1880 immigrants made up almost half of the population. The last civil war between the Blancos and the Colorados took place in 1904; the Colorados won victory under Pres. José Batlle y Ordòñez, one of Uruguay's political legends. Batlle inaugurated a labor and social-welfare reform program that created Latin America's first eight-hour working day as well as progressive legislation on women's rights. Impressed with the Swiss plural executive Federal Council during his stay in Switzerland, Batlle believed such a structure could help Uruguay avoid the Latin American hazard of caudillismo (authoritarian rule). Batlle proposed the idea of a plural executive, and a version of the idea became part of the constitution in 1919. The new constitution provided for both a president and a collegial National Council, both of which would make up the executive structure of the government. In 1933 a military coup by Pres. Gabriel Terra sought to dissolve both the legislature and the National Council and to reestablish the single executive presidential system. He managed this by sponsoring a constituent assembly that drew up a new constitution in 1934. In a 1951 plebiscite, Uruguayan voters approved a return to the plural executive system, and a new constitutional order reflecting this went into effect the following year. The debate over the form of the executive was not over, however; in 1966 the public voted for yet another constitution, which once again established the single president as the executive power. Uruguay's economy began to falter during the 1950's. This, combined with the expansion of governmental bureaucracy tied to the country's social welfare programs, led to increasing popular discontent. In 1958 the Blancos won two successive victories at the polls. A candidate from the conservative wing of the Colorado party, Jorge Pacheco Areco, regained the presidency for the traditional ruling party in 1967, but neither the Blancos nor the Colorados were able to deal with Uruguay's deteriorating economy or with its growing political unrest. Uruguay's politics became increasingly polarized during the 1960's and into the 1970's. The leftist National Liberation Movement (MLN or Tupamaros), formed in 1967, began urban guerrilla activity that included robbery and kidnapping. The Tupamaros, many of whom were young and middle class, embarrassed government officials and were largely successful in eroding the public image of the civilian government. Tupamaro activity generated violence from the military and police, and as the political situation deteriorated in the early seventies, the government granted the military increasing authority. By 1973 the military was in control of the country, and they dissolved the Congress. The military allowed Pres. Juan María Bordaberry to remain in office until 1976, at which time they installed Aparicio Méndez in the presidency. It was Bordaberry, however, who proposed the dismantling of the political parties in 1976. Uruguayan military rule was brutally repressive, and the armed forces perpetrated many human rights abuses. By some estimates, the Uruguayan military regime had the world's largest number of political prisoners in proportion to the population. In 1980, Uruguayans rejected in a plebiscite the army's constitution, which would have amounted to continued de facto military control. So began a slow process in which the military tried to bargain with civilian political elites while promising to restore civilian rule. Finally, in 1984, Colorado party candidate Julio María Sanguinetti won a civilian presidential election. Sanguinetti approved a general amnesty for the leaders of the military regime, but also had success in attracting foreign investment and righting the Uruguayan economy. He was unseated five years later by National party candidate Luis Alberto Lacalle, who further liberalized trade. But his austerity on social problems led voters to overturn some of his reforms by referendum. In 1994 elections, Sanguinetti won back the presidency. In Nov. 1999 the Colorado candidate, Jorge Batlle, pledged to continue the pro-market reforms of Sanguinetti, defeated in a run-off the (left-wing) Broad Front candidate, Tabare Vazquez, who had led in the first round.

The northern Sudan, the ancient land of Nubia, was loosely controlled by Egypt in antiquity and incorporated into the Arab world by the Islamic expansion of the seventh century. The southern Sudan was part of tribal black Africa, under no external control but subject to continual raids by slave traders from the north. Ottoman Egypt conquered the northern Sudan in 1820–21; British influence in Egypt in the 19th century extended into the Sudan as well. In 1881 Muhammed Ahmed ibn Abdalla, a religious leader known as the Mahdi, united northern and north-central Sudan and led a resistance movement against Anglo-Egyptian control. Khartoum, defended by British general Charles George Gordon, fell in 1885, but the Mahdi died soon thereafter, and his revolt came to an end. An Anglo-Egyptian force under Kitchener regained control in 1898; Anglo-Egyptian joint rule was established in the Sudan in 1899. Great Britain and Egypt granted self-government and self-determination to the Sudan in 1953, and a Sudanese parliament was seated in 1954. Full independence came in 1956. Gen. Ibrahim Abboud took power in a bloodless coup in 1958 but was forced to resign after riots in 1964. In 1969 a new military coup installed a ruling Revolutionary Command Council and instituted a socialist regime. The council's leader, Gen. Muhammed Nimeiri, became prime minister. Disputes between Marxists and non-Marxists, and between arabized northerners and black southerners, led to continual difficulties. In 1972 Sudan's three black southern provinces were granted local autonomy. Another attempted coup in 1976 was put down by the Nimeiri government, and hundreds of prominent citizens were executed. In 1983 attempts by the Nimeiri government to institute Islamic law throughout the Sudan led to riots in the south and the imposition of a nationwide state of emergency in 1984. Popular unrest was exacerbated by drought and famine in 1985. On Apr. 6, 1985, Nimeiri was overthrown in a coup by Gen. Suwar El Dahab. After a brief period of rule by a transitional military council, a civilian cabinet was installed, and free parliamentary elections were held in 1986. In June 1989 the government was overthrown in a coup led by Lt. Gen. Omar Ahmed al-Bashir. The Bashir government renewed the fight against the southern rebels, and supported the imposition of Islamic law throughout the nation. Within three years the civil service, the military, the judiciary, and the educational system were under the control of Muslims and their political organization, the National Islamic Front headed by Hassan al-Turabi who was also the leader of parliament and the most powerful figure in Sudan. All opposition parties, newspapers, and unions were banned and a stepped up military campaign against christians in the South was launched. In Oct. 1990, the U.S. government stopped aid to the Sudan, which openly supported Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. In 1991, the U.N. suspended relief efforts to help the estimated 7.1 million Sudanese threatened by famine. In 1993, the U.S. added Sudan to its list of states that sponsor terrorism, and in 1995, the U.N. endorsed an accusation that Sudan was sheltering the Islamic militants who attempted to assassinate Egyptian Pres. Hosni Mubarak. The government in 1995 announced plans to free all political prisoners and to hold national elections in 1996 but an increase in violence against the government by rebels in the south delayed them. In 1997 the government made peace with some rebel factions, promising a referendum on self determination. The main force of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), led by John Garang, continued to fight. Another famine in 1998 brought a ceasefire as aid workers transported huge amounts of food to over 300,000 in the south. In Aug. 1998 the U.S. launched cruise missiles at Khartoum to retaliate for the bombing of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and to destroy what it said was a chemical weapons plant. Since July 1998, both the SPLA and the Sudanese government have declared a series of cease-fires to permit international food relief. The rebels lost some international support as Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea became embroiled in wars of their own. The Sudanese government's “restoration” of a multi-party system at the start of 1999 was met with skepticism by the opposition. Throughout 1999 Pres. Bashir sought some sort of reconciliation with opposition parties and with the southern rebels. In December he struck against Turabi, declaring a state of emergency, dissolving parliament dismissing the entire government, and replacing it with his supporters. In Jan. 2002 a cease-fire and in July a peace accord signed in Nairobi brought hope at last that the war might end. Through the Fall of 2003 the peace accord has held.

The ancestors of today's aborigines arrived from Southeast Asia as much as 40,000 years ago. Thereafter, aborigine culture evolved in isolation except for some contact between the peoples of the northern coast and New Guinea. Australia was first sighted by Europeans at the beginning of the 17th century. In the 18th century, it was visited by the Dutch, who named it New Holland. The eastern coast was systematically explored in 1770 by Capt. James Cook, who claimed it for Great Britain. British settlement began in 1788, with the landing of about 700 convicts near Sydney. Australia remained a penal colony during the first half of the 19th century, during which time the continent was explored and separate colonies established. Aboriginal populations were displaced and in some areas (most notably the island Tasmania) totally exterminated. Discovery of gold in Victoria in 1851 created a gold rush that greatly accelerated immigration. By 1900, the three mainstays of the Australian economy—livestock, mining, and wheat growing—were firmly established. In 1901, a commonwealth was established consisting of a confederation of the various states except for the Northern Territory, which was added in 1911. The British Crown is represented by an appointed governor-general; the national government is a parliamentary system, but much local authority resides in the separate states. Comprehensive social welfare legislation was passed by the state and national governments soon after the commonwealth's formation. The population is highly educated and enjoys a generally high standard of living, but most aborigines are detribalized and live in considerable poverty. Australian troops fought with distinction in both world wars. A Japanese threat to Australia in 1942 was averted by Allied victory in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Australia and the United States are firm allies, and Australian troops joined U.S. forces in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf War and the invasion of Iraq. Australia administers several external island groups and claims territory in Antarctica. The abandonment of discriminatory immigration practices in 1973 led to a new wave of immigration, particularly from Asia. In the process Australian economic ties to Asia and the Pacific Rim have expanded considerably. New exploitation of mineral resources has in many cases been accomplished with Japanese investment or with long-term export contracts to Japan. Australia has undergone considerable industrial development in the past three decades. After 10 years in office, Prime Minister Bob Hawke was ousted by his own Labour party in 1991 and replaced by Paul Keating. Keating's government was reelected in 1993 elections, despite a persistent economic slump. But continued high spending and taxes took their toll, and in 1996, 13 years of Labour rule ended. A coalition of the more conservative Liberal and Nationalist parties captured 94 of 148 seats in the House of Representatives. The popular Liberal party leader John Howard became the new prime minister. In Oct. 1998 elections, the Liberal-Nationalist coalition maintained its control of the House of Representatives. In the interim, Australia's Constitutional Convention voted (in Feb. 1998) to proclaim Australia a republic, severing its residual ties to the British Crown. But in a 1999 referendum, voters rejected the republic 55 to 45 percent. With respect to aboriginal claims to Australian land, the government carried a Native Title Bill in July 1998, giving Australia's state governments authority to rule on the issue. Howard and the Liberal-Nationalist coalition gained a third straight term in Nov. 2001 elections, although Labour gained control of every state government. The Howard government's decision to participate in the Iraqi war brought a (purely symbolic) vote of “no confidence” in the Senate; the real “no confidence” vote in the House failed by 82–63. By April 2003 Australian troops were already withdrawing, refusing to take part in any peacekeeping force. Australia"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: northwestern Africa.

Iron Age civilizations flourished on the middle reaches of the Niger River from about 200 B.C. The kingdom of Ghana arose about A.D. 750 on the strength of the gold trade with North African Berbers. Ghana was overthrown by the Muslim Almoravids, who ruled only 11 years, though Islam remained a major influence from that time. From 1200 to 1400, the Kingdom of Mali was dominant in the region and was renowned throughout Islam and even in Christian Europe for its wealth and power; when Mansa Musa's retinue stopped in Cairo en route to Mecca, it carried so much gold that the price of gold fell 20 percent. By the end of the 14th century, the Mali empire had been eclipsed by the Songhai (Soyinka) empire, centered on the Niger River cities of Gao and Timbuktu. The Songhai empire collapsed after Timbuktu was sacked by Moroccans in 1591. It fragmented into a series of smaller states, and power shifted from the desert fringe back to the Niger valley, bringing with it a further spread of Islam. French exploration of Mali led to conquest in 1896 and the creation of the colony of French Sudan in 1898, governed from Dakar, Senegal. Timbuktu declined in importance, and Bamako became the country's principal urban center. Malians were granted French citizenship and limited self-rule in 1946. In 1958 the territory became autonomous within the French Overseas Community. In 1959, with French support, the French Sudan and Senegal formed the Federation of Mali, which became independent on June 20, 1960. Senegal seceded from the federation almost immediately, and Mali became an independent republic on Sept. 22, 1960. Modibo Keita was elected the country's first president. Keita's program of radical control of society and the economy by the central government provoked discontent, and he was overthrown in 1968 by military officers led by Lt. Moussa Traore. Traore's Military Committee of National Liberation ruled until 1979 when it was reorganized under a new constitution as the Malian People's Democratic Union. Traore was ousted in a 1991 coup and a transitional government under a civilian prime minister, Soumana Sacko, set up multiparty elections for June 1992. Alpha Konaré was elected president and his Alliance for Democracy in Mali party won 76 of 116 legislative seats. In 1995, the government reached an agreement in its longstanding dispute with the ethnic Tuareg nomads in the northern part of the country. Pres. Konaré's government has succeeded in reviving the economy (cotton and gold production rank among the top in Africa) and winning praise from the World Bank. Political opposition, though small, turned violent in 1997 and caused a cancellation of the results of elections in April. Opposition parties claimed the Government had fixed the elections and boycotted new ones held in May that gave Konare victory. He governs unopposed in the National Assembly and many fear political instability is possible. Yet Konare bowed to a constitutional provision barring a third term and voters in May 2002 gave 65 percent of the votes to Amadou Toure.

Portuguese trading stations were established starting in 1505, and Portugal developed an extensive coastal trade in gold and ivory. Mozambique also served as a way station for Portuguese trade to East Asia. Despite competition from other European nations, Portugal maintained control of the Mozambique coast. Settlement by sizable numbers of Portuguese immigrants began in the late 19th century. Mozambique was organized as a colony, sometimes called Portuguese East Africa, in 1885; boundaries in the interior were defined in 1891. Economic development of Mozambique in the 20th century remained almost entirely in Portuguese hands. By the 1950's native peoples began to protest Portuguese rule; a rebellion of the Frelimo (Front for the Liberation of Mozambique) guerrilla movement began in 1961. Rebels controlled most of the northern part of the country by 1964. Fighting continued for another decade. Following the Portuguese revolution of 1974, Portugal agreed to independence for Mozambique, and many Portuguese settlers returned to Portugal, leaving the country bereft of administrative personnel and infrastructure support. Mozambique became fully independent on June 25, 1975. A Marxist Frelimo government took office, with Samora Michel as the country's first president. The new government formed agricultural collectives and nationalized most private land and industry as well as all social services. In the late 1970's, fighting broke out between Mozambique and Rhodesia. When Rhodesia achieved independence (and changed its name to Zimbabwe) in 1980, relations between the two governments improved. But a rebel movement, Renamo (Mozambique National Resistance), dedicated to overthrowing the Frelimo government grew stronger during the 1980's. In 1986, following the death of Samora Michel, Joachím Chissanó became president. His government reintroduced some private agriculture, loosened ties to the Eastern bloc, and appealed to the West for economic assistance. In 1987 a U.N.-led relief effort began. In 1989 Mozambique signed a cooperation agreement with South Africa, which cut off its aid to the Renamo insurgents. But fighting continued into 1990. In Nov. 1990, Mozambique adopted a new constitution widening individual rights and freedoms, including abolition of the death penalty, freedom of the press and speech, and an independent judiciary, as well as establishing multiparty democracy, a presidential regime, and free-market economy. On Oct. 4, 1992, Pres. Chissanó and Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama signed a cease-fire; the U.N. dispatched 7,500 military and civilian personnel to oversee the disarmament and organize elections. Mozambique's first multiparty elections were held in Oct. 1994. Pres. Chissanó was elected with 53 percent of the vote while his Frelimo party took 129 of the Parliament's 250 seats. (Renamo carried all but nine of the remaining seats.) Chissano was re-elected in Dec. 1999 with Frelimo taking 133 seats. Mozambique is rich in agricultural land and mineral resources. Nevertheless, years of communism, drought, and civil war have left the country poor and dependent on foreign aid. In 1992 the worst drought in memory brought the nation to a virtual standstill, as an estimated 1.8 million people became dependent on donations of food from outsiders for survival. In recent years the I.M.F. has helped enormously with loans and planning advice but Mozambique remains one of the poorest nations. Devastating floods in March 2000 set back much of the progress that had been made. Mozambique"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: northeastern South America.

Although the region was visited by Europeans in the 15th century, Guyana was only colonized in the early 1600's by the Dutch.

After slavery was abolished, indentured servants from the East Indies were brought to work the land, and their descendants are in the majority today. The People's National Congress was in power from 1964 to 1992, and socialist policies dominated the political landscape. Most of the country's large companies were nationalized, so despite its having the purest bauxite in the world, some gold, and conditions favorable to agriculture, it remains poor, dependent on foreign aid and remittances from overseas workers for much of its revenue. In 1992 Cheddi Jagan of the People's Progressive party won the presidency, but attempts to privatize the sugar and bauxite industries have failed.

In the presidential elections in Dec. 1997, Mrs. Jagan won election in her own right, with 56 percent of the vote, but her appointment of Hinds to be Prime Minister did nothing to stop the rioting and demonstrations by followers of the opposition People's National Congress.

From around 3000 B.C. nomadic ancestors of the Berbers inhabited Algeria, as the expanding Sahara desert displaced prehistoric grasslands and forests. The Phoenicians established trading centers in the Mediterranean coastal plain around 1200 B.C. Those centers were taken over by the Romans beginning around 200 B.C. With Roman support the Berber chief Masinissa formed the kingdom of Numidia in what is now northern Algeria. From 46 B.C. to about A.D. 640, the area was controlled successively by the Romans, Germanic Vandal tribes, and the Byzantine Empire. In the eighth century A.D., the Islamic conquests spread Arab culture to Numidia. Most of the Berbers converted to Islam. The blend of Berber and Arab culture in Algeria gave rise to a flourishing and rich Islamic civilization in the coastal plain, while Tuareg and other nomadic peoples controlled the sparsely inhabited interior. Around 1500 the Christian kingdom of Spain captured Algiers and other coastal cities. In 1518 Barbarossa, a Turkish sea captain, captured Algiers and drove the Spanish out. In so doing, he joined Algeria to the expanding Turkish Ottoman Empire. Piracy became a key source of income for the Ottoman cities of Algeria. In the early 1800's, France, along with England and the U.S., began military operations to suppress piracy in the Mediterranean. In 1830 France invaded Algeria, putting an end to Ottoman rule and establishing their own administration. Algeria was ruled as part of France itself. Many French settlers (colons) migrated to Algeria. Both they and the native Algerians were considered citizens of France, but the colons were granted substantial political and economic advantages over the indigenous population. In 1847 a rebellion led by Abd-al-Qadir, a powerful Muslim leader, was suppressed by the French. In 1848, all of Algeria was conquered by the French and legally confirmed as part of France. During World War II, many Algerians joined the Free French, hoping that their display of loyalty would be rewarded with greater self-rule after the war. Those hopes were disappointed, as French administration was resumed in 1945. In 1954 the Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN) began a guerrilla war against the French in Algeria. They were opposed by French police and military forces and by the Secret Army Organization (OAS), an underground movement of colons who favored continued French rule. As the FLN gained strength, by 1958 French premier Charles de Gaulle established a policy designed to prepare Algeria for self-rule. Algerian independence was proclaimed on July 3, 1962; a million colons fled to France. A power struggle within the new Algerian government was resolved when Ahmed Ben Bella became the country's first premier in 1963. In 1965 Ben Bella was deposed by Col. Houari Boumidienne, who ruled as the head of a military government. In 1967 Algeria declared war on Israel, broke with the West, and established close relations with the U.S.S.R. Since the early 1970's, relations with the West, and particularly with France, have improved (mainly because of oil). The first free, multiparty elections were held on June 12, 1990. The Islamic Salvation Front, which advocates turning Algeria into an Islamic Republic, won overwhelming control of local assemblies. In 1991 it won 188 seats in Parliament out of 231 up for election and seemed poised to win control of the government when the army interceded to keep the old power structure in place. On June 19, 1992, Pres. Mohammed Boudiaf was assassinated, presumably by Islamic fundamentalists. The military's High Security Council, knowing the Islamic parties would win any free election, postponed a return to democracy. In January 1994 the High Security Council replaced the collective presidency of the High State Council with Gen. Liamine Zeroual. November 1995 saw the first contested presidential election since 1962, with Gen. Zeroual winning over 60 percent of the vote as major opposition groups boycotted the election. Elections in June 1997 produced Algeria's first mutli-party parliament since 1962, but the ruling military council still remained in control and in August Islamic fundamentalists killed over 300 in one night of terror. These vicious assasinations continued into 1998 with hundreds more having their throats cut over several nights. Civil strife and assassinations have claimed the lives of over 40,000 since 1992. In Sept. 1998 Gen. Zeroual announced that elections would be held in Feb. 1999 and he would not be a candidate. By the time the elections were held in April, all candidates had withdrawn from the race save one, the army-backed Abdelaziz Bouteflika. His new government reached an accord with the rebel Islamic Salvation Front: in return for the end of the uprising, Pres. Bouteflika pledged to release thousands of militant Islamic prisoners on July 5, Algeria's national holiday, and to submit the peace agreement to a referendum. In Sept., 98 percent of voters favored the agreement that gave amnesty to militants who surrendered. When the amnesty period ended (Jan. 2000), the government claimed that 80 percent of the rebels had surrendered—probably an exaggeration—then commenced a major army offensive against remaining rebels, now organized as the “Armed Islamic Group” (GIA). While the GIA remained unconquered into 2002, the government was mending fences with the Berber people (who constitute about 1/3 of Algeria's population), recognizing their Tamazight language as a legal language in April. In May, the FLN won 199 seats in the 389-seat National Assembly Algeria"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: landlocked country in Southeast Asia.

Inhabited by the Thai-speaking Lao people in the river valleys and by Hmong and other tribal people in the highlands, Laos historically had little national cohesion and was dominated by its more powerful neighbors, Siam (Thailand) to the west and Vietnam to the east. In 1893 France forced Siam to recognize Laos as a French protectorate; the country was thereafter incorporated into the French Union of Indochina. Laos was occupied by Japan during World War II but saw little major fighting. In 1946 Laos was united under the Luang Prabang dynasty and was granted local autonomy as a constitutional monarchy in 1949. During the final phases of the Indochina War against French colonialism in 1953–54, Vietnamese Communist (Vietminh) incursions reinforced the position of the Laotian Communist party (Pathet Lao) in Laotian politics. Following the French withdrawal in December 1954, Laos became an independent nation and was admitted to the United Nations in 1955. The creation of a coalition government under Prince Souvana Phouma in 1962 temporarily resolved a turbulent political situation; an international agreement signed in Geneva that year guaranteed Laos's neutrality. The Pathet Lao withdrew from the coalition in 1964 and renewed its armed uprising against the government, with North Vietnamese support. American planes bombed Vietnamese supply lines along the Ho Chi Minh trail, and American agents recruited Hmong tribesmen as irregular troops to attack Pathet Lao positions. The Pathet Lao nevertheless made steady gains, especially after 1970. In 1973, Prince Souvana Phouma ordered a cease-fire, and in 1975 the Pathet Lao took control of the capital, Vientiane. The Lao People's Democratic Republic was proclaimed on Dec. 3, 1975. Large numbers of Hmong and other tribal people fled to Thailand. Subsequently, Laos was strongly dominated by Vietnam, which stationed significant numbers of troops in the country. In 1989, in Laos's first election since the communist takeover, a Supreme People's Assembly was elected specifically to approve a new constitution, which it did in 1991; the constitution confirmed the Lao People's Revolutionary party as the sole legal political party. Single-party elections in 1992 did little to alter the country's political climate, though observers predicted changes as the Communists began to pass from the scene. In 1995 Laos signed a treaty with Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam to establish a Mekong Commission to regulate water use among the four nations. In 1997 Laos was admitted to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Laos"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: landlocked country in north central Africa.

The Sao and other ancient peoples built centers of civilization near Lake Chad that flourished for many centuries until they were displaced by the medieval kingdoms of Kanem-Bornu, Baguirmi, and Ouaddai. From about 1400 onward, Chad became a meeting ground between the Muslim cultures of the Sahara and the Sahel and the black African societies of the tropics. Between 1500 and 1800, Arab slave raiders were active around Lake Chad, supplying slaves for European traders on Africa's west coast. French military forces reached Chad from West Africa in 1891 and fought a series of battles over the next two decades with the Arab rulers of the region. A French governorship of Chad was established in 1905 (based in Brazzaville, the Congo), but the country was not brought entirely under French control until 1914. Chad was incorporated into the federation of French Equatorial Africa in 1910 and was organized as a colony within the federation in 1920. French Equatorial Africa was dissolved in 1959, and Chad became an autonomous member of the French Community. Full independence followed on Aug. 11, 1960; François Tombalbage became Chad's first president. In 1965 the Muslim northern and eastern parts of the country rebelled against the southern-led government; despite the aid of French troops, the government was unable to suppress the rebellion, and a long civil war ensued. Tombalbage was overthrown in 1975 in a military coup led by Gen. Felix Malloum. Efforts to broaden the composition of the national government broke down, and in 1979 Prime Minister Hissein Habre broke with the government and led northern forces against the national army. A cease-fire was negotiated under international auspices, and a National Unity Transitional Government (GUNT) was installed in 1979, but civil war broke out again in 1980. Pres. Goukouni Oueddei sought Libyan aid in restoring order; a contingent of 7,000 Libyan troops occupied the country until 1981. They were replaced by an international peacekeeping force organized by the Organization of African Unity. Civil war broke out again in 1982, and northern forces occupied the capital. A new republican government under the presidency of Hissein Habre was proclaimed on June 7. OAU forces withdrew, and Habre's government soon controlled all of the country except for a few northern areas held by GUNT. In 1983 GUNT launched a counterattack and regained some territory with the aid of Libyan forces. French and Zairian troops were sent to aid Habre's forces. In Sept. 1984 France and Libya agreed to the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Chad, but Libyan forces remained. GUNT forces controlled the country north of the 16th parallel; Libyan forces occupied the Aozou Strip, along the border, with the apparent intention of annexing it to Libya. Between 1984 and 1986 Habre persuaded most Chadean dissident forces to rejoin the national government, and in Nov. 1986 he launched a campaign to recapture the north. The Chadean forces won a series of victories, and in May 1988 Libya's Col. Qaddafi declared an end to the 20-year war with Chad. In Nov. 1990, forces led by renegade Gen. Idriss Deby launched attacks from Sudan and ousted Pres. Habre. Deby, who favors multiparty democracy, proclaimed a provisional government and suspended the constitution. A national charter calling for a new constitution and elections to be held within 30 months came into force in March 1991. Deby functioned as president after that, suppressing two attempted coups in 1992, and legalizing opposition parties. Deby's “Higher Transitional Council” remained in command until presidential elections were held in June 1996, which Deby won. He was re-elected in May 2001.

A landlocked country in Africa's central region, the Central African Republic is one of the least-developed countries in the world. Most of its people are farmers, and the nation has little manufacturing, few reliable roads, and no railroad. Europeans first came to the area in the early 1800's in their search for slaves, but it was not until 1889 that the French established an outpost as the current capital city of Bangui. The region was organized as the territory of Ubangi-Shari five years later. In 1910 it was incorporated into French Equitorial Africa along with what are now the countries of Chad, the Congo, and Gabon. The country was granted internal selfgovernment by the French under its present name in 1958 and became a member of the French Overseas Community. Independence was achieved on Aug. 13, 1960. The first prime minister, Barthelemy Boganda, was killed in an airplane crash in 1959 and was succeeded by his nephew, David Dacko. Dacko was elected to a seven-year term in January 1964, but an army coup in 1966 overthrew his government. The head of the army, Jean-Bedel Bokassa, was installed as president. Named president for life in 1972, in 1976 Bokassa declared himself emperor and changed the name of the country to the Central African Empire. Dacko returned to power in 1979, however, and Bokassa went into exile in France. The name of the country was changed back to the Central African Republic. A multiparty political system was reinstated in March 1981, but army officers threw Dacko out of office again six months later and banned all political parties. Opposition parties were legalized in 1991, and Bokassa was released shortly before elections in 1993, elections that made Ange Félix Patassé president. He tried to reduce the army's power but has been met with several rebellions requiring the intervention of peacekeepers from neighboring states. After surviving numerous coup attempts, Patassé was overturned in March 2003 by fired army head General Francois Bozize who suspended the constitution and proclaimed himself president.

Peru was the site of the civilization of the Inca empire before the arrival of Europeans. The Incas had extended their control over most of the Andean region by the late 15th century. The civilization was advanced in terms of its ability to provide for the welfare of its subjects and was in possession of sophisticated knowledge in a number of fields, including medicine. By the time of the arrival of the Spanish conqueror Francisco Pizarro in 1532, the empire was already in decline, and a combination of plague and civil war in the decade prior to the appearance of Europeans no doubt made the empire more vulnerable to Spanish conquest. Inca resistance to Spanish domination was not quelled until the execution of Tupac Amarú in 1571. European-borne diseases such as smallpox and measles devastated the Indian population of the region. Because of the great wealth of precious metals discovered by the Spanish and the adaptability of a sedentary indigenous civilization to the imposition of Spanish imperial control, Peru quickly became a major focal point of Spanish colonialism; they founded Lima in 1535. The viceroyalty of Peru, established in 1544, originally served as the political and administrative nerve center of Spanish colonization of South America. For nearly two centuries, Lima was the seat of power and wealth for the whole region. Peru was “liberated” by Simón Bolívar and José de San Martín in 1821 when Bolívar's army defeated the royalist forces at the battles of Junín and Ayacucho. In the 40 years after independence, the presidency changed hands 35 times, and the country generated at least 15 different constitutions. Only four of the presidents of the period were constitutionally chosen, and the vast majority were military figures. In 1829 Peru tried and failed to annex Ecuador; in the 1830's an attempt at political federation between Peru and Bolivia collapsed with the Chilean invasion of 1839. A political movement in favor of civilian rule, the Civilistas, began to organize by the 1860's. Chile defeated Peru in the War of the Pacific (1879–83), and Chileans occupied Lima and its port city of Callao for two years. The Peruvian government was deeply in debt after the war, resulting in the loss of ownership of much of Peru's infrastructure and natural resources to foreigners. Peru experienced a period of civilian leadership between 1895 and 1930. Pres. Augusto B. Leguía (1908–12, 1919–30) extended his rule in an extra-constitutional manner until 1930, when Col. Luis Sánchez Cerro seized power; he ruled until his assassination in 1933. Gen. Oscar Benavides succeeded Cerro and managed to restore confidence in the economy. In 1939 civilian banker Manuel Prado was elected to the presidency, and the military allowed him to complete his term in office, which expired in 1945. During Prado's administration, Peru went to war with Ecuador and was victorious, seizing a great deal of territory. Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre founded Peru's most prominent political party, the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA), in 1924. As initiated, the party put forward an “anti-imperialist” platform aiming at nationalization of land and reconstruction of society in favor of oppressed people. Haya de la Torre was apparently fraudulently deprived of a presidential electoral victory in 1931. The following year Apristas (APRA supporters) seized Trujillo and killed some military personnel. By way of revenge, the army massacred 6,000 Apristas. The result was a continuing enmity between the Peruvian armed forces and the APRA party lasting until the 1980's. Although APRA clearly had majority support, the party was not allowed to take power until 1985. The Peruvian military, led by Gen. Juan Velasco Alvarado, seized power in 1968 and embarked upon a course of reform that included the nationalization of Standard Oil's International Petroleum Company holdings. The Peruvian military took steps to restructure economic and political power in the country by joining the Andean Pact and undermining the power of the traditional agricultural elite in the country by sponsoring an agrarian reform that mobilized peasant sectors of the population. The presidency of Peru returned to civilian leadership under Fernando Belaúnde Terry (1980–85). In 1985, the military allowed the APRA presidential candidate, Alan García Pérez, to take office. García promised to spend no more than 10 percent of the country's export earnings on payment of Peru's huge outstanding foreign debt and he was popular during his first years in office. But his public support was undermined by a growing insurgency sponsored by the Sendero Luminoso (“Shining Path”) Maoist guerrillas and by runaway inflation. On June 10, 1990, political novice Alberto Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, defeated the well-known writer Mario Vargas Llosa for the presidency. Throughout 1991 and 1992, Shining Path's influence spread, demoralizing and almost paralyzing the government, and at a cost of 25,000 lives. But in April 1992, Fujimori implemented a “zero tolerance” policy toward terrorism, dissolving the legislature and proclaiming martial law. The capture in September of Abimael Guzmán Reynoso, Path's founder-leader, broke the back of the insurgency. The movement lived on, but diminished in numbers. Meanwhile, economically, Fujimori pursued free-market reforms, taming runaway inflation and privatizing state-run dinosaurs, so that by 1994 the Peruvian economy was growing at a rate of 12 percent, fastest in the world. In April of that year, Fujimoro was elected to a second term with 64 percent of the vote. The dramatic liberation in April 1997 of 600 prisoners held for ransom in the Japanese ambassador's compound by another radical terrorist group maintained the president's repute. In Nov. 1997, Peru completed negotiations with Ecuador (the treaty being signed in Oct. of 1998) ending a 50-year old border conflict. But all these achievements were accompanied by a rather ham-handed authoritarian streak which cost Fujimori much esteem. In elections for Congress, held in April 2000, his Peru 2000 party carried a plurality of seats but he himself just failed of a majority in the presidential race. A week before the May 28 run-off, his remaining opponent withdrew, claiming the election was a fraud; the final tally brought Fujimori only 51 percent. His July 28 inauguration was marred by serious rioting, with six dead and many public buildings in Lima burnt. While in Japan, Fujimori resigned, but Congress refused to accept, so it could remove him for abandoning office and dereliction of duty. In June 2001, in a close run-off against former president Alan Garcia, Alejandro Toledo was elected president, the first Indian elected president in Peru's history. he was able to decentralize the government in 2002 and sucessfully prosecute Fujimori's right-hand ma, but strikes by teachers and farmers in 2003 led to a state of emergency and the use of troops to bring order.

Yemen—in ancient times Sheba or Saba—is strategically located in the southwestern corner of the Arabian peninsula, near the southern end of the Red Sea. In biblical times and for many centuries thereafter, Yemen dominated the caravan trade in spices, gold, and other luxury goods from India and Africa to the Middle East. The Islamic unification of Arabia in 628 resulted in the incorporation of Yemen into Arabia as a whole, but many local uprisings broke out over the course of the following three centuries. In the 10th century, control passed to a line of Yemeni kings who were simultaneously imams of the Zaidi sect of Islam; the Zaidi imams ruled until 1962. Aden was the most important port of the ancient kingdom of Sheba and retained that status under the Zaidi imams of Yemen. Portuguese activity around Aden began in the 15th century; from the mid-16th century, control of the port was disputed by the Portuguese, the Yemeni kings, the Ottoman Turks, and, later, the British. In 1839, Aden was made a British Crown Colony; the Hadramaut region of southern Arabia, north and east of Aden, became the British Protectorate of Aden. The colony and protectorate were both administered as part of British India. Yemen came under the control of the Ottoman Empire from the mid-16th to the mid-17th centuries, and again from 1849 to 1918. The Turks were expelled at the end of World War I, and Yemen became an independent kingdom in 1918. The kingdom's independence was threatened by a Saudi invasion in 1934 and by a 1954 dispute with Great Britain over the status of Aden, which was the key to British military power in the western Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf after India's independence in 1947. Imam Ahmed came to the throne of Yemen in 1948, following the assassination of his predecessor. Most of Yemen's large Jewish population was evacuated to Israel in 1949–50. A palace coup against the imam in 1955 failed, but after his death in 1962, his successor was quickly ousted and the country was proclaimed the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) under the leadership of Brig. Gen. Abdullah al-Salal. A struggle for independence began in Aden and the protectorate in 1963, with two rival groups competing for power. The National Liberation Front (NLF) gained the upper hand over the Egyptian-backed Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, as both groups waged guerrilla war against the British. British forces withdrew in 1967, and South Yemen became independent. The nation's territory included Socotra and adjacent islands off the Horn of Africa, which had been British possessions since 1876. In 1969 a leftist faction of the NLF seized power, nationalized key industries, and instituted a socialist regime. In the mid-1970's, South Yemeni troops aided leftist guerrillas in Oman, and fought in Ethiopia against Eritrean rebels. Subsequently Pres. Salem Robaye Ali took a more moderate stance and improved relations with Oman and Saudi Arabia. He was overthrown in a coup in June 1978 and executed. The succeeding government was overthrown on Jan. 13, 1986; on Feb. 8, Hasin Said Numan became prime minister. In North Yemen, civil war between royalist and republican factions lasted until April 1970, when a coalition republican government was formed with the aid of Saudi mediation. Col. Ibrahim al-Hamidi came to power in a military coup in 1974; he was assassinated in 1977. Pres. Ali Abdullah Saleh assumed office in 1978, after the assassination of Pres. al-Gashmi. Border skirmishes between North Yemen and South Yemen broke out during 1972–73. After several years of uneasy peace, South Yemen launched a full-scale war against the north on Feb. 24, 1979. Arab League pressure quickly led to a truce. Relations improved during the 1980's and North Yemen and South Yemen merged as the Republic of Yemen on May 22, 1990. Ali Abdullah Saleh, president of North Yemen, became the new country's president. San'a was proclaimed the capital of the United Yemen, though Aden remained its most important economic center. The Gulf War forced the repatriation of tens of thousands of Yemeni workers from Kuwait and other Gulf states; later Saudi Arabia expelled 850,000 more to express its displeasure with Yemen's unenthusiastic stance toward the Gulf War. These repatriations deprived Yemen of a most important source of foreign exchange, and severely damaged the economy. Yemen held its first general election since unification on Apr. 27, 1993, and a coalition government was formed. In Feb. 1994, fighting began and a full-scale civil war broke out in May. But in July the capture of Aden by government troops ended the conflict and Pres. Saleh has ruled in relative peace since. The first direct presidential electrion was held in Sept. 1999 but the Socialist Party was not allowed to field a candidate so Saleh won easily. On Oct. 10, 2000, over 50,000 protested in Aden against U.S. support for Israel; two days later, the U.S. destroyer Cole, refueling in Aden, was attacked, leaving 17 dead and 39 wounded. The Saleh government permitted F.B.I. attendance at the questioning of witnesses; but the F.B.I. (and Navy) investigators became a new object of attack, by the terrorist “Islamic Army of Aden,” in June. However, the F.B.I.'s response, attempts to arm its investigators with rifles and heavy weapons, provoked the U.S. ambassador's banning the F.B.I. team leader from Yemen.

Before the arrival of Europeans in the mid 1530's, indigenous habitation of the territory that would become Chile included the Araucanian population in the south and peoples under the influence of the Inca Empire in the north. The Spanish founded the cities of Valparaíso in 1536, Santiago in 1541, and Concepción in 1550. Chile was under the authority of the Viceroyalty of Peru, established in 1544. Between 1810 and 1818, fortunes of the Chilean independence movement ebbed and flowed, culminating in the victory of Bernardo O'Higgins and the separatist forces in 1817. Independence was finally achieved in 1818. From 1818 to 1833, Chile underwent a period of political instability due to power struggles among elite Chilean families. In 1833 a strong presidential-dominant constitution was written under the influence of leading political figure Diego Portales that set the form of government in Chile until 1891. Chile expanded its territory at the expense of Peru and Bolivia, first in a war with the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation (1836–39) and later as a result of the War of the Pacific (1879–83). A civil war was fought in 1890–91 between forces of the president, José Balmaceda, and the Chilean Congress over the issue of the limits of presidential authority. The defeat of the presidential forces led to the establishment of a congressional-dominant parliamentary system. The checks on policy initiative resulting from the parliamentary system left government deadlocked in the face of mounting social and political problems arising at the turn of the century. The occurrence of a number of bloody strike actions crystallized political debate around social issues such as better wages and working conditions. The immobilized parliamentary system was unable to respond to these problems. In 1925, when Congress failed to allocate funds or military pay, the forces overthrew the parliamentary government. A new constitution was drawn up that same year that moved governmental structure toward presidential dominance. Nevertheless, political instability continued until 1933, when the new constitution was implemented. The Chilean balance of political power from 1958 until 1973 remained almost equally divided among parties representing the right, the center, and the left of the political spectrum. In order to prevent an electoral victory for the leftist parties, forces on the right allied themselves with the centrist Christian Democrats in the 1964 election, and this resulted in the victory of Christian Democratic presidential candidate Eduardo Frei Montalva. The program of the Christian Democrats included agrarian reform and attempts to organize Chile's urban poor. It was believed that these stances would benefit the Christian Democrats at the polls in the 1970 presidential election. As in 1958, the 1970 election fielded three presidential candidates who represented the political right, center, and left. The leftist Popular Unity coalition candidate, Dr. Salvador Allende Gossens, won with 36.3 percent of the vote, but only after bitter debate did Congress recognize Allende's victory. The Allende government nationalized the foreign-owned copper industry, but an international boycott of Chilean copper imposed in retaliation for this action seriously hurt the country's economy. The government also nationalized the coal and steel industries as well as 60 percent of private banking. The Popular Unity government found itself unable to control peasant seizures of land and factory takeovers by workers. The copper embargo, land and factory seizures, government subsidies to the poor for basic goods, and runaway inflation resulted in a deterioration of the national economy that particularly affected the middle classes. Members of congress from the center and right had hoped to gain enough seats in the 1973 elections to impeach Allende, but instead the Popular Unity made impressive electoral gains. In order to bolster the legitimacy of the Popular Unity administration in the eyes of political opponents, Allende resorted to inclusion of military officers in the government. On Sept. 11, 1973, segments of the military led by commanders of three of Chile's four armed forces took control of the government, killing Allende in the process. Gen. Augusto Pinochet Ugarte emerged as the new president. The junta announced the arrest of some 13,000 persons, many of whom then lost their lives in a wave of brutal repression. (Mass graves were discovered in the desert in 1990, and in 1991 a commission reported that between 1973 and 1990, more than 2,000 people were killed by the government.) In March 1974 the dictatorship published its Declaration of Principles, which included a laissez-faire economic orientation, anti- Marxism, and nationalism. A new constitution was approved by plebiscite in 1980. The two-phase evolution of Chile's political structure included an authoritarian “transitional period” between 1980 and 1989 and implementation of a new political structure thereafter. The constitution created a presidential system with very extensive executive powers and a “guardian” role for the military. In an Oct. 1988 plebiscite, Chileans rejected continuation of Pinochet rule and called for an end to the dictatorship. On Dec. 14, 1989, Patricio Aylwin Azocar of the Christian Democratic party (one of a 17-party alliance) was elected president with over 55 percent of the vote; he took office in March 1990, ending 17 years of military dictatorship. He was succeeded by Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle in March 1994. In recent years, Chile's economy has expanded, exports have increased, and it has succeeded in lowering its large external debt. Although exports are still dominated by copper, other minerals and manufactures have gained in importance. In 1996, Chile joined Mercosur, a free trade agreement among six of the largest South American nations. In 1997 the U.S. agreed to sell Chile advanced fighter jets, ending a 20-year ban. In March 1998 Gen. Pinochet resigned as head of the armed forces after 25 years and was sworn in as senator-for-life. In Oct., while in Britain, Pinochet was arrested after Spain sought his extradition for the murder of Spanish citizens. A long legal minuet ended in Jan. 2000 when Britain's Home Secretary declared Pinochet unfit to stand trial. Only days later, in a run-off presidential election, the candidate of the center-left Concertacion Coalition, Ricardo Lagos Escobar, took 51.3 percent of the vote. Though Lagos was the first Socialist president since Allende, he supports a market economy. In 2003 Chile and the U.S. signed a free trade agreement eliminating tarriffs on 85% of all goods.

Arab trading settlements in Somalia were established in the seventh century and gradually evolved into independent sultanates. Portuguese traders established settlements and forts along the coast during the 15th and 16th centuries. In the early 19th century, Great Britain arranged through local treaties to use harbors along the Somali coast and gained control over the northern part of the country by 1840. The border between Somalia and Ethiopia was demarcated by a treaty between Great Britain and Ethiopia in 1897. In 1885 the sultan of Zanzibar granted commercial advantages to Italy, and in 1897 and 1908 Italy gained control over southern Somalia. During the early 20th century, an uprising against British rule was led by Mohamed Abdullah. Abdullah was defeated by the British with help from his local rivals but is now regarded as the father of Somali nationalism. The Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1936 gave Italy a dominant position in the Horn of Africa. In the early phases of World War II, Italian troops drove the British from British Somaliland, but a 1940 counterattack led to British occupation of all of Somalia by 1941. After World War II, as discussions of Somalia's future continued, Britain handed over the Ogaden and neighboring territories to Ethiopia. A U.N. pact of 1949 created an Italian trusteeship in the former Italian Somaliland. Italy terminated its trusteeship and British Somaliland, a U.K. protectorate, achieved independence on June 26, 1960. On July 1 the two entities joined to become Somalia. The new country was plagued by clan-based rivalries, with the Somali Youth League emerging as a unifying national force. In 1969 Maj. Gen. Mohamed Siad Barre took control, established a ruling Supreme Revolutionary Council, a socialist regime, and relations with the U.S.S.R. In 1972 Somali forces began border raids into Ethiopia's Ogaden region, peopled largely by ethnic Somalis. The Somali army invaded the Ogaden in 1977. The Soviet Union switched its support to Ethiopia, and with Soviet aid and Cuban troops, Ethiopia drove back the Somali invasion. Over a million refugees fled from Ethiopia into Somalia. The United States was Somalia's principal source of military and economic aid after 1978. In May 1988, the Somali National Movement captured a number of cities in the northwest and held them against the army. In the summer of 1990, the United Somali Congress began a peaceful antigovernment movement around Mogadishu. In Dec. 1990, this flared into a brief but bloody civil war that resulted in the ouster of Pres. Barre on Jan. 26. The Somali National Congress proclaimed a provisional government, but it was not recognized either by the United Somali Movement, which threatened secession, or the Somali Patriotic Movement, which controlled much of central and southern Somalia. The continued unrest made it difficult to deliver humanitarian aid despite the efforts of Western governments and nongovernment organizations to do so. An estimated 50,000 people were killed between 1988–90. Despite U.N. attempts to initiate peace talks, widespread clan and tribal warfare led to a complete breakdown of government authority in 1991–92. A severe drought helped to create over two million refugees, and widespread starvation gripped the nation. Relief workers were prevented by warring armed factions from distributing emergency food supplies. An estimated 300,000 people died in 1991–92. In Dec. 1992, the United States began Operation Restore Hope, sending 28,000 troops to secure distribution of food and aid. The U.S. presence deterred the factions from further open hostilities and brought warring leaders to the peace table. The U.N. took over the operation but led by the followers of Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, Somali renegades ambushed U.S. troops and downed a helicopter leading to a U.S. withdrawal in March 1994. The last UN troops left Mogadishu a year later. Clan warfare reignited in March 1995, and in June, Aidid declared himself president for life. However, no country recognized any Somali government and in Aug. 1996 Aidid was shot and killed. His son, a former U.S. Marine, replaced him but brutal clan violence continued. In Dec. 1997 a tentative peace agreement was reached among the major factions. Peace settled in during 1998, helped by the flooding that killed 2,000 and made 200,000 homeless. Increased inter-clan fighting in Sept. 1999 threatened to cause crop shortfalls and famine yet again. During the summer of 2000, however, a group of leaders met in Djibouti and formed a new government with Abdikassim Salad Hassan as president. But by March 2001 many warlords met in Ethiopia to form an opposition group and by May new clan warfare erupted. Thus Somalia has devolved into (at least) four separate states.

In ancient times various cultures flourished in the Arabian peninsula, particularly along the western rim, in cities devoted to trade between the Gulf of Aden and the eastern Mediterranean, and in such agricultural and trading centers as Yemen and Oman. Cultural and political unity was lacking, however, until the rise of Mohammed, the prophet of Islam. In A.D. 622 Mohammed fled from Mecca, the center of Arabian paganism, to the nearby city of Medina; the Islamic era dates from that year. Preaching from Medina, Mohammed gained converts to Islam throughout Arabia. His army captured Mecca in 630, converting its sacred shrine, the Kaaba, to an Islamic place of worship. By 632, when Mohammed died, all of Arabia was unified under Islamic rule. In 661 the Caliphate, the ruling body of early Islam, moved from Medina to Damascus. Thereafter Arabia was nominally unified under Islamic rule—but in practice was usually divided among various principalities in the arable areas and trading centers, and under tribal rule in the arid interior. Mecca fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1517, but Ottoman control of Arabia was never complete. The rise of the Wahabi sect of Islam in the 18th century posed a challenge to Ottoman rule. In the 19th century, the Saud family rose to leadership in the Wahabi movement and established a kingdom in Nejd, the central region of Arabia, with a capital at Riyadh. In 1902 Ibn Saud (1880–1953) consolidated his family's control at Riyadh and in 1912–13 led a new Wahabi revolt against the Ottoman Turks. During World War I, the British aided Ibn Saud's rebellion in the Nejd, along with that of Ibn Saud's rival Hussein ibn Ali in the Hejaz, in the mountains of western Arabia along the coast of the Red Sea. A British protectorate was established in both regions in 1915, and Great Britain maintained a dominant position in Arabia after World War I. In 1924 Ibn Saud captured Hussein ibn Ali's capital at Mecca, and he proclaimed himself king of Hejaz in 1926 and of Nejd in 1927. Ibn Saud consolidated his control over the following two years, and his kingdom was formally recognized by Great Britain in 1927. The country was renamed Saudi Arabia in 1932. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy based on Islamic law; it has no written constitution and no parliament. The king exercises sole authority and rules in consultation with a Council of Ministers. Islamic law is enforced; alcohol is prohibited and the public activities of women severely restricted. The Saudi kings have great power within the Islamic world through their control over the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and their administration of the annual Muslim pilgrimages to those cities. The discovery of oil in eastern Arabia in the early 1930's rapidly transformed Saudi Arabia from an impoverished nation to a center of great wealth. In 1933 an exclusive concession for the exploitation of Saudi Arabian oil was granted to an American-chartered corporation, the Arabian-American Oil Company (Aramco). For many years wealth remained concentrated in the hands of the Saudi clan, and little change was felt in the desert interior, where Bedouin nomads continued to raise sheep and camels. Large numbers of Yemenis, Palestinians, Pakistanis, and other foreign workers are employed in the oil fields. Saudi Arabia remained neutral during most of World War II but declared war on the Axis powers in March 1945; in the same year, it became a founding member of both the United Nations and the Arab League. Ibn Saud became a leader of Arab anti-Zionism and contributed a small contingent of troops to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. That policy was maintained by Ibn Saud's second son and successor, King Faisal, who instituted a policy of providing large annual subsidies to Egypt and other Arab League states following the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. In 1973 King Faisal sent Saudi units to fight in the Arab-Israeli War of that year. He played a leading role in organizing the 1973–74 Arab oil embargo in an effort to force the United States and its allies to take a harder line with Israel. King Faisal was assassinated by his nephew, Prince Faisal, on Mar. 25, 1975, and was succeeded by King Khalid. Little change in policy resulted. In 1979 Saudi Arabia denounced the Camp David talks and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and led the Arab League effort to ostracize Egypt within the Arab world. Saudi Arabia has consistently opposed leftist and radical movements in the Arab world, sending troops to help put down leftist rebellions in North Yemen and Oman in the 1970's. Saudi kings have taken a moderate approach toward relations with the West. Following the transfer of Aramco assets to full Saudi Arabian ownership during 1973–76, Saudi Arabia used its leading position within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to argue for a policy of stable production and prices. This moderate policy has been rewarded by the willingness of the U.S., Great Britain, France, and other Western nations to sell arms—including jet fighters, tanks, and other sophisticated weapons—to Saudi Arabia despite Israeli protests. The multibillion-dollar arms trade has helped to offset the Western oil trade deficit with Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia experienced repeated disturbances in the 1980's. Muslim fundamentalist terrorists seized the Grand Mosque at Mecca on Nov. 20, 1979, provoking a crisis for the Saudi monarchy. On July 31, 1987, Iranian pilgrims rioted in Mecca and were fired upon by Saudi security forces; 402 persons died, including 275 Iranians. Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini denounced the Saudi government and said it was unworthy of being the guardian of Islam's sacred shrines. A longtime supporter of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Saudi government gave the PLO $850 million during the 1980's, but ceased when the PLO backed Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. During the Persian Gulf War, King Fahd granted permission to station U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia to guard against a possible Iraqi attack. The Saudis promised the United States $16.8 billion and Egypt $1.5 billion to defray the costs of the war. Little ground fighting took place on Saudi soil, but massive oil spills threatened the operation of crucial desalination plants in the Persian Gulf. Since the war, Saudi Arabia has played a prominent and pivotal role in the diplomatic efforts of the United States and its allies to reach a permanent accord in the Middle East. In 1996 King Fahd, ailing from a 1995 stroke, temporarily ceded power to his legal successor, Crown Prince Abdullah. In June, terrorists bombed an apartment complex in Dhahran, killing 19 American soldiers stationed there and wounding more than 300 people. U.S.-Saudi relations were greatly strained when the 9/11 attacks were revealed to have been perpetrated by Saudi citizens. In May 2003 terrorist attacks in the form of four suicide bombings occurred in Riyad in two days.

The Spanish discovered the fabulous silver deposits of the region and established their presence in the area in the cities of Sucre (1538) and Potosí (1545). From the early colonial period on, Bolivia—then called Upper Peru and part of the Viceroyalty of Peru—depended heavily on the export of minerals. The exploitation of tin and later oil and natural gas has had an important economic and political impact on the country's development. In 1776, Upper Peru was transferred to the new Viceroyalty of La Plata centered in Buenos Aires. Upper Peru began agitating for independence in 1809, but it was not until liberation by Símon Bolívar (for whom the country was renamed) in 1825 that Bolivia became the last Spanish possession in South America to achieve independence. During 1836–39, Peru formed a brief union with Bolivia, until Chile broke up the confederation. Bolivia has lost much of its original territory to its neighbors. The dictator Mariano Melgarejo sold large chunks of territory from 1865 to 1871. After the War of the Pacific (1879–84), Bolivia lost its access to the sea. And in the 1932–35 Chaco War with Paraguay, Bolivia lost more territory in the east. Bolivia has suffered from Indian/non-Indian racial and cultural divisions, and political rivalry between the elites from the Potosí region and those from La Paz and Santa Cruz. Conservatives of the silver-mining southern region of Potosí controlled the government until their ouster in 1898 by the Liberal tin interests of the La Paz region, who presided over a period of stable republican politics that lasted until the Great Depression and the Chaco War. One of the results of the Chaco War was the fragmentation of the Bolivian military into competing factions in the struggle for power between conservative landowners and middle-class reformers. In 1941 the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR) was formed with the aim of transferring control of the country from conservative landowning elites to the middle sectors. The leadership of the movement found itself outpaced by revolts sponsored by workers and peasants; the MNR incorporated these elements into its program. When the 1952 revolution brought the MNR to power, its leadership, which included the future four-time president Victor Paz Estenssoro, embarked on a reformist political program. The military overthrew the MNR in 1964, and civilian rule was not restored until 1982. Paz Estenssoro was again elected to the presidency in 1985. Jaime Paz Zamora, leader of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, gained the presidency in 1989. In June 1993, MNR candidate Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada won the presidential election. An advocate of free-market economic reform, as planning minister (1986–88) he reduced the country's hyperinflation rate from 25,000 percent to 15 percent. In January 1995, Bolivia sought membership in the newly-formed Southern Common Market (of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay). But opposition to free-market reforms brought a general strike by the leftist Bolivian Workers' Confederation. The government declared a state of siege in April 1995, and suspended civil liberties. Further privatization plans led to another general strike in 1996, with 50,000 demonstrators in the streets of La Paz. Faced with widespread rioting and looting, the government granted large raises to government employees. Presidential elections in 1997 led to a run-off (settled in Congress) in which retired general Hugo Banzer Suarez, military dictator from 1971 to 1978, was elected president, pledging to continue economic reforms while ensuring that the poor benefit from the reforms. His government was confronted in April 2000 with nationwide riots over a planned increase in water rates and a general strike by the Workers Confederation. Timely retreats ended the protests. Banzer's resignation in August 2001 for reasons of health brought elections in June, with Congress again having to choose between the top two finishers; by the narrowest of margins, ex-president Sánchez de Lozada topped Socialist Evo Morales, head of the coca workers' union.

The Kongo and Ndonga flourished south of the river; north of the river, in what is now the Congo, the Loango, Teke, and Bobangi were dominant. Some of these states were weakened beginning in the 16th century by the Portuguese slave trade, although the Loango benefited from it through the 19th century. With the weakening of Portuguese power, the French became the dominant European power in western Africa. In 1883 they established a protectorate over the Teke kingdom, which they renamed Middle Congo. The treaty with the Teke king was concluded by Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, for whom the capital was named. In 1910 the French confederated their protectorates of Gabon, Middle Congo, Ubangi-Shari (later the Central African Republic), and Chad to form French Equatorial Africa. The territory became an important base of Free French activity during World War II, in acknowledgment of which Gen. Charles de Gaulle granted French citizenship to the territory's inhabitants in 1946, and local power was devolved upon advisory assemblies. The Republic of the Congo attained full autonomy upon the dissolution of the confederation of French Equatorial Africa in 1959, and the nation gained full independence on Apr. 15, 1960. In 1963 Pres. Fulbert Youlou was driven from office by violent labor unrest; the military took control and installed a provisional civilian government led by Alphonse Massamba-Debat, who was elected president for a five-year term. In 1968 Massamba-Debat was overthrown in a military coup and replaced by Capt. Marien Ngouabi, who in 1969 reorganized the Congo as a People's Republic. Despite its Marxist-Leninist stance, Congo remained strongly linked to France, its main source of trade, aid, and foreign investment. Ngouabi was assassinated in 1977 and replaced by a military committee of the Congolese Labor party led by Gen. Joachim Yhomby-Opango, who resigned and was arrested for treason in 1979. He was succeeded by Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who was reelected to a third five-year term in 1989. In 1990, Congo began a relatively smooth transition to multiparty democracy and opposition parties were legalized as of Jan. 1, 1991. Pascal Lissouba was elected president in Aug. 1992. In June 1997, however, heavy fighting erupted in Brazzaville when Lissouba tried to have his rival, Sassou-Nguesso, arrested just weeks before a new election on the grounds that Sassou-Nguesso was planning a coup. He was and he succeeded, with oil money to buy arms and pay off rivals until by April 2001 a sort of peace and stability ensued, enough to elicit an E.U. loan.

Botswana, occupying a high and relatively arid tableland in southern Africa, was traditionally occupied by diverse groups of farmers, pastoralists, and hunter-gatherers. European missionaries arrived from South Africa in the early 19th century. In the late 19th century, native peoples resisted the encroachment of Afrikaners from the Transvaal; in response the British government established a protectorate in what was then called Bechuanaland in 1886. The southern part of the protectorate was organized as a Crown Colony and ultimately passed under the control of South Africa. During the 20th century, the territory remaining in the protectorate saw a steady evolution of local rule. In 1920 two advisory councils were established to represent the interests of native and European inhabitants. In 1934 British authorities promulgated regulations establishing the powers and jurisdictions of native chiefs and the functions of native councils and courts. Local fiscal powers were established soon thereafter. In 1951 a joint (native-European) advisory council was set up, and 10 years later an elected legislature met under the provisions of a new constitution. In 1963–64 the British government accepted Botswanan proposals for self-government. A new capital was established at Gaborone in February 1965; a new constitution came into effect in the following month, and Botswana became fully independent on Sept. 30, 1966. Since independence, Botswana has been a multiparty, multiracial democracy that has remained untouched by the political turmoil affecting most of its neighbors. In Oct. 1999 National Assembly elections, voters gave the Botswana Democratic Party, the ruling party since 1966, 33 of the 40 seats, ensuring President Mogae of five more years. Botswana is one of the most prosperous countries in Africa. It is the world's largest producer of diamonds; revenues from diamond exports have been wisely managed, leading to significant budgetary surpluses in recent years. Tourism, bolstered by Botswana's large herds of big game, is the country's major nonmining industry. But the nation's AIDS epidemic (30 percent of the adult population is in fected with H.I.V.) threatens to undermine the gains made over the past three decades.

Christopher Columbus made his first landfall in the Americas in the Bahamas Oct. 12, 1492. Though the Spanish never settled the islands, they enslaved and removed to Hispaniola 40,000 of the indigenous Arawaks by 1508. Their shallow seas (baja mar) made the islands a haven for pirates in the 17th century—as well as during the Civil War, Prohibition, and for drug smugglers today. British colonization of the Bahamas began in 1629 and continued slowly over the next two centuries. Tourism has been the mainstay of the economy in this century, but high unemployment is a continuing problem. Parliament relaxed restrictions on offshore banking to stem the flight of international capital prompted by allegations of government corruption and involvement in drug trafficking. In 1992 the government of Prime Minister Lynden Pindling was defeated after 25 years in office, largely because of corruption charges.

Various Nama and Bantu peoples migrated into the area more recently. British and Dutch explorers and traders began to penetrate Namibia in the 18th century. In 1872 Great Britain occupied the area around Walvis Bay and in 1884 annexed it to the Cape Colony. Also in 1884 Germany claimed most of South-West Africa; negotiations between the two powers resulted in German acceptance of Britain's claim of Walvis Bay and British acceptance of Germany's claim to the rest of the coastal region with a sphere of influence in the interior. During World War I, British troops from South Africa occupied South-West Africa in 1915. In 1920 South Africa received a League of Nations mandate to administer the area. In 1946 when the United Nations succeeded the League, the United Nations proposed that South Africa continue its administration under a U.N. trusteeship. South Africa refused and annexed South-West Africa. The proposed U.N. trusteeship was revoked by the United Nations in 1966. At the same time, the South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), operating from bases in Zambia and Angola, began guerrilla actions against South African troops in the region. In 1968 the United Nations formally renamed the territory Namibia and appointed an 11-nation council to supervise its affairs and devise a plan leading to independence. In 1971 the International Court of Justice upheld the U.N.'s authority over Namibia and ruled that South Africa's continued occupation of the territory was illegal. In 1975 South Africa convened the Turnhalle Conference, which proposed a plan for Namibian independence based on the racial-separation principles of apartheid. This was rejected by the United Nations, and in 1978 the U.N. Security Council approved Resolution 435, which called for a general cease-fire to be followed by U.N.-supervised elections. In response, South Africa unilaterally held elections in Namibia, which were boycotted by SWAPO and other African organizations and rejected by the United Nations. In 1982 South Africa declared that it would enter into talks about the future of Namibia only after Cuban troops were withdrawn from Angola. In 1983 South Africa launched a major military operation against SWAPO forces in Angola. In October 1984 Angolan president dos Santos agreed to work out a plan for withdrawal of Cuban troops as part of a settlement in Namibia. In June 1985 South Africa granted limited local authority to a Namibian government made up of a coalition of parties, excluding SWAPO. In 1987 South African troops occupied southern Angola (to aid Angolan rebels), and in early 1988, fighting between South African troops and Namibian rebels in northern Namibia and southern Angola intensified. A new round of talks on the future of Namibia between South Africa, Cuba, and Angola, mediated by the United States, began in May 1988, and on Dec. 13, 1988, the three parties agreed on a plan for Namibian independence and a pullout of Cuban troops from Angola. In January 1989 the Cuban withdrawal from Angola began. On Apr. 1 U.N. Resolution 435 went into effect in Namibia, and a U.N. peacekeeping force arrived to supervise the transition to independence. Elections were held in November 1989: SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma won an overwhelming victory, and opposition leaders pledged their support. A Western-style democratic constitution was adopted Feb. 16, 1990, and full independence came on Mar. 21. The first elections under the new constitution were held in December 1994 with SWAPO gaining even stronger control of Parliament. In November 1999 elections, Sam Nujoma won a third term as president with 77% percent of the vote while SWAPO took 76% of the votes for the National Assembly.

The population of Mauritania is divided between an Arab and Berber majority in the north and various black African peoples in the south and southwest. From the ninth through the 15th centuries, southern Mauritania was part of the kingdoms of, successively, Ghana, Mali, and Sanghay. In the 1050's, a puritanical Muslim sect, the Almoravids, arose in the Tidra Islands. Between 1054 and 1086 they conquered Ghana, Morocco, Western Algeria, and Spain; they were eclipsed in the next century. Portuguese trade on the Mauritania coast began in the early 15th century; the Portuguese remained dominant until about 1600 when their control was contested by the British, French, and Dutch. France established a protectorate in 1903, and the area was made a French colony in 1920. In 1958 Mauritania became a self-governing republic within the French Overseas Community. In 1959 Mokhtar Ould Daddah was elected prime minister, and the country became fully independent on Nov. 28, 1960. A new constitution was adopted in 1961, establishing a presidential form of government. The four major political parties were combined into a single party in 1965. Morocco claimed Mauritania as part of its sphere of influence; after talks about unifying the two countries broke down, Morocco recognized Mauritanian independence in 1970. Spain relinquished its claim to the Spanish Sahara in 1976. The southern part of that territory was annexed by Mauritania, while the larger northern section was annexed by Morocco. Rebels of the Polisario Front proclaimed the independent state of Western Sahara, and in 1980 Mauritania relinquished its claims to its portion of the Western Sahara, signed a treaty with Polisario, and resumed relations with Algeria, Polisario's chief backer. In 1978 Ould Daddah was removed from office in a military coup and was replaced as president by Lt. Col. Haidalla. He in turn was overthrown on Dec. 12, 1984, by Chief of Staff Maaouya Ould Sid' Ahmed Taya. Taya normalized relations with Morocco and held regional and local elections in 1986 and 1987 in a first step toward the restoration of democracy. Border incidents erupted between Mauritania and Senegal in 1989 and Mauritania expelled 40,000 black Senegalese workers. Racial and religious strife has severely hampered the country's economy. Taya introduced multiparty elections in 1991 and a new constitution was approved; Taya and his Democratic and Social Republican party won the presidency and control of the legislature in 1992 and again in 1997 Mauritania"},{"year":"1938","title":"P N Youtz, dir, repts on condition 2 MUSEUMS FOUND IN DECREPIT STATE","excerpt":"Neglect and Decay Reported at the Brooklyn and the Children's by Youtz THREAT OF DANGER SEEN Director Warns City Must Act Quicklyto Provide Money for Repairs Building Plan Dropped Brighter Side Is Seen"},{"year":"1955","title":"Cheops' solar ship and surrounding site deteriorates from exposure to dry desert air","excerpt":"neglect and official inaction blamed DAMAGE UNARRESTED AT CHEOPS SHIP SITE"},{"year":"1998","title":"For residents of America's 17,000 nursing homes, conditions have improved since 1987, when Congress set stringent Federal standards.

It is partly concerned with wives who are tired of their husbands and therefore seek relaxation at some afternoon club where they dance with paid partners and bootleggers who own houseboats on Long Island Sound.The last chapter gives Malcolm McGregor, who impersonates Bob Ward, plenty to do. An elderly woman proposes marriage to him and he is forced to tell her that he is in love already. Then, after a few heated words from the elderly woman, Bob goes to Sally Smith's home, where he learns from Sally's mother that she is worried about the girl, who is supposed to be at the Sea Foam Club, a place frequented by the élite of bootleggery. Now at that moment the spectators are well aware that Sally is leaving the Sea Foam Club, just about the time that Bob is speculating as to whether he has enough money to ride in a taxicab. Hence when Bob arrives at the exclusive organization, where they make too much noise for a deaf woman, he is informed that the party to which Sally lent her presence has left for a houseboat. Again the spectator knows that Bob is on the wrong tack, for that rascal. Tom Mannion, has craftily arranged to take Sally aboard his own houseboat, and moreover, in the storm the craft has broken away from its moorings.But no hero is worth his salt if he can't find a houseboat on Long Island Sound on just such a night as that is. Other men tell Bob that if they are going to be drowned it will be in a bath tub and not in the Sound, but fearless Bob leaps into the fast motor launch and steers for Tom Mannion's houseboat, or where it ought to be. He discovers what has happened, but soon finds the bootlegger's helpless water mansion. No time is lost by Bob in climbing aboard, but no sooner does he set foot on the slippery deck than he is attacked by Mannion, who had tried to embrace Sally. But all's well that ends well, even though Sally and Bob are drenched.In the Sea Foam Club there is a character known only as the Man About Town. He is of that type who may be offensive in ordinary social circles, but he never neglects his cigar. It is in his mouth while he is riding in an automobile and also during dinner. He is first perceived in evening clothes, but the instant he boards his houseboat he reverts to type by appearing as a bartender.The sole redeeming feature about this photoplay is the presence of May McAvoy in the rô1e of Sally. She is pretty, but appears to be somewhat startled at the happenings in this story.Vincent Lopez and his orchestra are to be seen and heard in shadow form throughout the medium of the Vitaphone.

Baker 3d as his ear on Capitol Hill, to a negotiating posture, lest he weaken his bargaining position. His aides had warned him against the danger of ''negotiating with himself'' by offering terms for a budget settlement before Congressional leaders could produce one of their own.   But there was danger that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress would be unable to reach a deal of their own unless the President took a hand in it. The Democrats were especially wary of agreeing to cuts in Social Security or other entitlement programs, and then finding that the President had moved to blame them for hurting the aged and the poor. And they hesitated to expose themselves to the possibility of a Presidential attack for undermining the nation's defenses or aggravating the recession by raising taxes.

Can it any longer be considered a useful instrument of national security? These questions gain particular force from the nuclear freeze movement and from debates in America on the MX missile and in Europe on intermediate-range nuclear missiles.   Renewed interest in arms control comes none too soon. Indeed, for too long the idea of trying to limit weap- ons has been given second place to the development of nuclear weapons programs, as though the two approaches were antithetical.  They are not. During the past two decades, arms control has made a major contribution to American national security. But its potential can be explored much further - provided interest and effort are sustained. Somewhere along the line, the rational effort to impose limits on nuclear arms ran into heavy seas. Two important agreements have never come before the full Senate for ratification: the Threshold Test-Ban Treaty, lowering the limits on testing to 150 kilotons, and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty, which puts severe constraints on any nuclear explosion. In addition, the SALT II treaty was shelved in 1980.
