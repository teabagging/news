Kate Winslet is Clem, the brash, loquacious bookstore employee who meets Joel (Jim Carrey) as he wanders the streets alone on Valentine's Day. The two of them fall in love under a glum, flannel cloud cover that could use some eternal sunshine.  After they break up, Joel's ego is bruised when he finds out that Clem has had all memories of him erased from her mind. Devastated, he goes for the same treatment. Mr. Kaufman has conjured the film equivalent of a Philip K. Dick Hallmark card. The movie has all of the knickknacks of a Kaufman script, including a nerdy, socially inept protagonist. In the case of &quot;Mind,&quot; this translates into Joel's being the least developed character. Mr. Carrey does get to show some aplomb in the final scene, when Joel acts out the most mature sentiment ever found in a Kaufman script, that having one's psyche purged isn't necessarily a good thing. What becomes of the broken-hearted, after the conversation has dimmed, is that they get over it. And by concluding with an adult realization, the film lets sunlight peek through the gloom, in more ways than one. — Elvis Mitchell Washing That Girl Out of His Head"},{"year":"1933","title":"Por, with rev of book, Human Nature New Short Stories by Edith Wharton","excerpt":"HUMAN NATURE.

His new confrontational oil paintings on wood, in which the figures are usually depicted at or near actual size, are easy to hate, unsettling to look at and difficult to ignore. Some are unbearably awful,  but others home in on an American heart of darkness with unusual accuracy.         The artist's subjects now include vilely bestial humans, pathetically anthropomorphized animals and squalling newborn babies subjected prematurely to  glamour make-overs. All are rendered in an overwrought, detailed realism that is as mannered, precise and caustic as the high-tech objects that earned Mr. Bickerton his first short-lived reputation.

This is accomplished quite successfully in \\"The Deceiver,\\" the current pictorial attraction at the Broadway. Most of the sequences in this offering afford a certain amount of entertainment and it is safe to assert that none of those who witness this picture will be any more successful than Captain Dunn is in pointing out the slayer of Reginald Thorpe, an actor who is found dead in his dressing room, with a knife in his back.But when it comes to considering Thorpe's character, one cannot help thinking that he is a peculiarly inconsistent scoundrel. It happens that Thorpe is impersonated by Ian Keith, who gives such an interesting performance that, in spite of Thorpe's shady doings, which include more than a mere suggestion of blackmail, one regrets his removal so early in the film. Either the authors or the producers have painted Thorpe a bit too black, for it is hardly credible that a successful actor would stoop to blackmail. His various affairs with women are believable, but it is quite another matter to have him willing to dispose of a woman's letters for $10,000.This is one of those narratives where the least said about some of the incidents the better, for a word too much might rob this production of its interest. It opens with a knife thrower throwing knives around a dummy. Tony Hill, Thorpe's understudy, essays his skill at knife-throwing and the missile strikes the dummy in the middle of the back, where it had been said this junior player might like to strike Thorpe. Hence when Thorpe is found lifeless with a knife in his back, suspicion falls on Tony, especially when it is brought out that Tony and Thorpe had pummeled each other late that afternoon. But, of course, Tony is as guiltless as Ina Fontanne, with whom he is in love.Thorpe is murdered on the eve of his leaving for Hollywood. He is a matinee idol and is singularly successful in his portrayal of Othello. There is a surprise for the audience in the scenes from the Shakespearean drama, but like some other happenings here, one feels rather a doubting Thomas.In some respects this film is mindful of \\"The Spider,\\" inasmuch as the action takes place before the footlights and back stage. Here, however, the audience does not enter into the more or less exciting doings. This narrative is based on one called \\"It Might Have Happened,\\" by Bella Muni and Abem Finkel. Perhaps it might, but hardly the way it is set forth here.Besides Mr. Keith's good work, there are competent performances by Dorothy Sebastian, Natalie Moorhead, DeWitt Jennings, Greta Granstedt and Lloyd Hughes.On the stage is \\"Hot Harlem,\\" a song and dance revue with Negro performers. It is in twelve scenes and those who like tap dancing and Negro singing will probably find it entertaining. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Humor and Excitement. Romance in the Abruzzi. Movietone News."},{"year":"1940","title":"In these dark and depressing times, when it seems almost that Western civilization hangs perilously by the thread of the Maginot Line, it is a great comfort to be reminded of the courage, the strength and the fortitude of the little Frenchmen who live behind that bastion. It is good to have some one recall that the elder sons of France, even in the most modest walks of life, are knotty citizens with irrepressible spirits and a tenacity that nothing can shake. And this reminder is passed on to us in a cheerful and deeply affectionate fashion in the French film \\"The Mayor's Dilemma,\\" now showing at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse.In France they called it \\"Les Otages\\" (\\"The Hostages\\"), which is somewhat less banal, though not a great deal more enlightening, than the title they have put on it here. But at least the original title does possess a certain bold and heroic implication which the picture has—an implication which is all the more gratifying because it is little men, undistinguished men, frightened but resolute men, who are the hostages, the heroes. The Mayor is not the whole show.The action all takes place in a gentle and peaceful village in the valley of the Marne in August, 1914—though it might just as well be today. The Mayor, a modest tradesman, and the local aristocrat have been feuding for many years, while the daughter of one and the son of the other secretly make love. Suddenly war is declared, the mobilization order is posted, and in the dark of night, while the Town Council argues a minor point, a German cavalry troop arrives in town.Surprised in a lovers' tryst, the aristocrat's son kills a Uhlan trooper and then escapes to the French lines, while the Mayor buries the soldier's body and covers up his tracks. But the deed is discovered and the German captain demands five hostages from the village to be held for execution if the assassin is not found.And this is the story, then. Pride forces every man in the village—even the drunken poacher—to offer himself as a hostage. Rank in the case of the Mayor and the aristocrat, lot in the case of the others, governs the selection. In the early morning, five hostages—the village bailiff, the barber and the policeman making up the number—go out to meet the Germans, limply singing the \\"Marseillaise.\\" They are imprisoned, the hour of doom draws nigh, each little man faces death in his own particular way. And at the last moment the famous taxicab army arrives and they are saved.Obviously, it is in the character of the men that the story is told—the story of a nation united, and the painful allegory of futile strife. And with the French actors flavoring the characters like a great chef mixing a fine sauce, the result is deliciously pointed. Charpin, as the Mayor, is as firm as a cobblestone, blending humor and resolution in his stout portrayal of a village custodian. Saturnin Fabre as the aristocrat, Larquey as the bailiff, Dorville as the poacher—all are excellent, and so, for that matter is this heart-warming picture. As an anti-war preachment, it has a lot of grimmer and tougher fare backed off the map.

It is one of those pictures which compel a reviewer to discard his glossary of catch-phrases and say, very simply, \\"It has everything.\\" Swift, sudden drama","excerpt":"humor and pathos; action, significance, movement and suspense.\\"The Last Night\\" is the story of Moscow on the eve of the October revolution of 1917, when the face of Russia, like the standard barber pole, was streaked with Red and White and changing constantly. It is not a new political phase of the revolution we are seeing, for the Russian cinema has told and retold its history until we are more familiar with it than our own, but it is a treatment which has humanized, rather than idealized, the workers' uprising. For the first time, we—the vicariously interested spectator—are made to feel that Bolsheviki were men, not gods; that the Whites were men, not devils.Director Yuri Reisman and a remarkable cast have created a telling cross-section of Moscow to submit to the erosion of revolution. In following that swift torrent, his cameras have exulted in scenes of smashing action, of riots, ambuscades and pursuits. But as his current runs, it brings into ever more stern relief the jagged individualities of the men and women who stand firmly in the revolutionary stream or are swept away. It is their drama, as well as Russia's, and it is an excellently contrived one.Not basically, but importantly, it is the conflict between two families: the Leontievs, who rule the mills the barracks and the soirees, and the working-class Zakharkins, who have nothing but their stubborn courage, their fatalistic devotion to a principle. As the picture opens, the youngest Zakharkin, a cadet at the military school, is entranced by the gay Lena Leontiev. He rescues her later when machine-guns rattle in the square. But he dies rather than fight with her kind. Old Zakharkin regards the senior Leontiev with respect and a certain friendship. He confesses as much when he stands guard over his former employer. But politically they are enemies; he has no use for the man. And later Leontiev shoots him down.The impersonality of it is what has made the picture so desperately dramatic. It comes through again and again, in the talk of the White officers, in the fact that, but for a martyr's speech, a battalion of soldiers would have marched to kill the Reds instead of aiding them, in the resignation of men to the death of their kinfolk. The approach is heroic, and the picture is resolved heroically and without bombast. That is unusual in the Soviet cinema.The cast is uniformly excellent, so there is no point in singling a few for special praise. Mr. Reisman's direction already has been complimented Scores, scene and titling (you will have no difficulty following the dialogue) are in the best tradition.
