The golden age of this jaunty style didn't occur until the mid-1920's. Worn with voluminous ''Oxford bags'' trousers, these little blazers were the last word on college campuses from California to Cambridge, the perfect counterpart to the short-skirted flappers of the era.

They pocket the difference -- or pay it, if they guessed wrong.         Despite short-sellers' recent bad luck, investors in a soaring market can still learn from them. Indeed, if the Dow falters, their perspectives may be much in demand.

''The producer price figure was a little lower than anticipated, but retail sales and industrial production were in line with Street estimates,'' said Raul Nicho, an economist at Money Market Services, an economic information service firm in Belmont, Calif.

By Thibaut de Saint Phalle. Illustrated. 315 pp. New York: Praeger Publishers. Cloth, $34.95. Paper, $14.95. IT is curious so little has been written about the Federal Reserve System of the United States, whose main responsibilities are to control credit and the flow of money and to regulate private financial institutions. Great attention has been lavished on monetary policy and Government regulation of banking, yet these subjects are inextricably linked to the Federal Reserve System. To Thibaut de Saint Phalle's credit, ''The Federal Reserve: An Intentional Mystery'' seeks to fill the historical void, as well as provide a timely guide to issues now before Congress. His book is welcome because it treats a subject critical to our economic welfare, raises vexing questions, clarifies connections among diverse institutions and practices (most important, between domestic and international finance) and is written in language accessible to nonexperts.   Thibaut de Saint Phalle, an attorney with experience in the academic world and in business, has a unique perspective. He believes that United States monetary policy and financial regulation are inadequate because of legal deficiencies originating in the 1913 Federal Reserve Act, which created the Federal Reserve System - America's central bank","excerpt":"shortcomings of individuals engaged in making and carrying out policy; and the circumvention of national and international regulatory control that has attended the communications revolution and the internationalization of financial markets.

Her few works achieve a sharply individual tone, a singular blend of lyrical grace and modernist violence.    \\"American Visionary\\" was the tag that Cheryl Seltzer and Joel Sachs, Continuum's directors, chose for the evening. For once, the phrase applies.  Crawford makes nonsense of the standard chronology of 20th-century music. Her early works inhabit a lushly dissonant medium derived not from Schoenberg but from Scriabin.  The violin sonata of 1926, performed by Renee Jolles (violinist) and Ms. Seltzer (pianist), opens with stark dissonances but finds an ecstatic lyrical tone.

Instead, the guest conductor, Maxim Shostakovich, summoned the heavy artillery immediately, presenting Aaron Copland's \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\" in touching tribute to the Brooklyn-born composer who had died the Sunday before.   But if Haydn was slightly overwhelmed by all of the ruckus around him, he was in no way mishandled. Mr. Shostakovich led a sprightly account of the symphony, drawing on period practice without following it slavishly.

For this tale of a small circus owner tormented with lust and jealousy over a youthful bareback rider who is unfaithful to him with another man bears an almost morbid resemblance to Jannings' old silent film, \\"Variety.\\"Mr. Bergman has slavishly copied the styles of the early Swedish and German films that had to do with passion and frustration in putting together this account, even to the point of working in a flashback sequence that is done in the silent technique. He dotes on close-ups of ugly, sweaty faces","excerpt":"shots of puddles spattered with rain; angle views of disheveled women, and silhouettes against the twilit sky.He also dotes on exposing emotions in long and elaborate scenes of people clutching at themselves, panting hotly or going out into the barn and patting a horse. He has, too, a running symbolism; the circus ownerHagen daughter and fan—Letty.a big, puffy manHagen daughter and fan—Letty.is juxtaposed to a caged bear, which he shoots at the climax, when he hasn't got the nerve to kill himself.As you can see (if you've been around a long time), the shade of Mr. Jannings hovers nigh.This kind of picture making has a certain poetic quality that is effective in some atmospheric stretches, such as the setting up of the pitiful little circus in the rain or the snooping of the wistful bareback rider in the wings of a theatre stage. (She goes there to rendezvous with a ham actor who seduces her with jewelry and then taunts her fat boy-friendHagen daughter and fan—Letty.that being the general tenor of the story and the kind of picture this is.)But the total effect of so much lushness and moody symbolism to tell a tale that is utterly maudlin and old-fashioned is at first oppressive, then provocative of laughs. An audience yesterday was mildly hooting at some of the more elaborate bits.Ake Groenberg as the circus owner had them laughing at him toward the end, when he was wallowing and heaving in torment after being humiliated by the seducer of his girl. And Anders Ek also drew a few chuckles as an aged clown who had been through something of the same sort with his woman and had jumped his trolley, as a consequence.There was no laughing at Harriet Andersson, who plays the circus girl. She has a figure that attracts attention of an entirely different sort. You are permitted to see a good bit of it, especially when she goes to be seduced, but not as much, we suspect, as Mr. Bergman intended. It appears that some scenes have been cut. Miss Andersson also acts rather nicely the naive and clumsy girl.This picture has English subtitles, some of them surprisingly blunt. But it could really do just as well without them.
