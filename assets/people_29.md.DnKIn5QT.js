But bias against women still pervades the legal profession, an American Bar Association panel said in a report last week, citing steep gender disparities in pay, promotion and power. The problem is a sticky floor as much as a glass ceiling: The income gender gap  opens up within the first year of practice, and among top legal officers of corporations ranges as high as 35 percent. And tougher times for lawyers have meant fresh setbacks for women. From law schools, where nearly half the students are female but the faculty remains overwhelmingly male, come reports that the performance of some women is suffering because of a resurgence of overt male hostility. In law firms, women's already lower rates of promotion to partner have dropped more sharply than men's in the recessionary 1990's.          None of this is exactly a secret to many of the nation's 208,000 women lawyers, now 23 percent of the profession. But evidence in the report may come as a shock to some of their male counterparts. In focus groups held at an A.B.A. meeting last year, male lawyers feeling the pinch of diminished job prospects complained that, these days, women get all the breaks.

''According to recent surveys, business executives in New York judge the personal income tax the greatest single burden imposed by the state,'' said the report by the Governor's Council on Fiscal and Economic Priorities. The income tax, with a maximum rate of 10 percent, makes it difficult for New York corporations to attract executives and high-salaried managers and technicians when other states tax at lower rates or have no personal income tax, the panel reported.

By Michael Parenti. 258 pp. New York: St. Martin's Press. $16.95. FREEDOM of the press, A. J. Liebling wrote, belongs to the man who owns one. Taking Liebling's maxim as his point of departure, Michael Parenti, the author of ''Democracy for the Few,'' has written a forceful though flawed critique of the American news media. By documenting patterns of conservative bias in a dozen major news stories in the printed and broadcast press, ''Inventing Reality'' provides a valuable rebuttal to the drumbeat of criticism of the news media from the right. Unfortunately, Mr. Parenti is so simplistic and doctrinaire in accounting for this bias that he makes his book easy to dismiss.   The function of the press, Mr. Parenti says, is to ''recreate a view of reality supportive of existing social and economic class power.'' Major newspapers and networks accomplish this by advancing the class interests of their corporate owners, who dictate the politics of the press. Only editors who share their outlook get promoted","excerpt":"reporters, eager to please editors, censor themselves.
