The scene well illustrates rap's feeling that it has been ostracized by rock-and-roll's mainstream, and it also shows how popular music now evolves by reacting against itself. That's why the scene was included in the series. But it also says a lot about the pitfalls inherent in the documentation of rock-and-roll. Those same scenes of Buddy Holly, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis are shown in previous episodes of the PBS documentary. They also pop up in \\"The History of Rock 'n' Roll,\\" another 10-part series, which was produced by Time-Life and broadcast earlier this year on commercial television, and in just about every other audiovisual attempt to trace the evolution of rock since its inception four decades ago.

This documentary, about the rock star who died at 27 from an overdose of barbiturates, combines fragments of interviews with Mr. Hendrix's father, friends and acquaintances, with chunks of his performances at the Monterey Pop Festival, Woodstock, the Isle of Wight and others — without attempting a necrological high.Mr. Hendrix's famous guitar-burning sequences—when he beckons the rising flames with encouraging fingers — are interspersed with the moments when he plucked the strings with his teeth or smashed the instrument, glimpses of him in flagrante delicto with an amplifier, the exhalation of \\"Sssock it to me\\" and his parody of the national anthem. Throughout, the reminiscences are fond, reflective, rather gentle. His father recalls him strumming a broom as if it were a guitar","excerpt":"Little Richard says, \\"At times' he used to make my big toe shoot up in my boot,\\" and several pronounce him shy. Early on, his admiration for Bob Dylan is underlined, and he sometimes appears like a black Mick Jagger. Later, he reminds you of no one.Despite every success, he seems to have fallen between stools: An American who depended on England for his first major recognition, a black man who worried about his black friends' opinion of his music. We're told that black radio stations were at first reluctant to play his recordings, stating that his style did not \\"relate,\\" while white stations thought it too rugged. The conflicts mount steadily. Decked in the ruffled shirts and sequined boleros and jeweled headbands, he said that he didn't care what the public thought. But the friends stress that being conspicuous troubled him. Some think that he wanted to shed his spectacular act and \\"just get people to listen to the music.\\"While the ravages of promotion and the isolation of stardom are evoked, as well as \\"the load of leeches\\" that fed on him, one young woman says that Mr. Hendrix was no more self-destructive than a passenger on a plane that crashes. That image lingers. Yet it's difficult to weigh, since his black friends feel that he had \\"a fast fuse\\"—a sense shared with many black people that life wouldn't be long, that it was likely to burn out quickly. While this movie doesn't tell us quite enough about Jimi Hendrix the musician, it does convey some of the talent and the anguish and the exuberance that were there.

When a comparatively small number of good performanc es are thus recognized, a great many other memorable appearances auto matically become downgraded or lost, left out of the almanacs, remembered only by the trivia experts.   Following is a reminder of some particular performers, an even dozen, who, for one reason and another, made 1981 a good deal brighter than it might have been, though they appeared in films that (1) tended to overwhelm the contributions of the people in them, (2) were not especially memorab le in themselves, or (3) were mostly ignored by th e public. The actors are recalled in no special order ofimportance, b ut they are performances that stay in the memory and deserve note.

The shelter was written into the Internal Revenue Act of 1978 under Section 401 K.

Upon withdrawal at retirement, the individual can get more favorable tax treatment than with an I.R.A.   While the new section is silent on limits, they are apparently the same as those governing profit-sharing plans, namely 15 percent of income.

They will reminisce warmly about the special tensi ons generated by workingin front of live cameras with no chance for c orrecting flubs. Storiesabout missed cues and missing props are endle ss. As it happens, though, records of a good many of those progr ams do exist to prove that the special tensions too often produced little more than obvious nervousness and stilted movements on the part of the actors crammed into tiny sets.   The ''live'' label is still being marketed cleverly in today's programming. There are those shows that get the word ''live'' right into their titles: NBC's ''Saturday Night Live,'' for instance, or public television's ''Live From the Met'' and ''Live From Lincoln Center.''

As the band smashed through the metallic sludge of \\"Searching With My Good Eye Closed,\\" a track from Soundgarden's third album, \\"Badmotorfinger\\" (A&M), Mr. Cornell began hopping around the stage like a baboon, then jumped into the audience. The wild fans held him above their heads and rolled him around. Mr. Cornell's shirt disappeared within seconds. When the guitarist Kim Thayil's solo ended, the crowd hoisted Mr. Cornell back to the front lines. He climbed onstage and finished the song.    Throughout the show, Soundgarden never let its connection with the audience waver. Whether Mr. Cornell was crouching down to look people in the eye, charging about manicly or hitting his guitar strings with his fist, he always played to the crowd: there was nothing casual about the band's performance, nothing taken for granted.

Thirty-five years ago almost to the day, Jerry Lee Lewis's \\"Whole Lot of Shakin' Going On\\" reached No. 3 on Billboard's pop chart, and the Killer's career was at its peak. Less than a year after that, it was over. A handful of country hits, lots of pills and four wives later, Mr. Lewis, unrepentant and unreliable as ever, remains one of the last outposts of rock-and-roll's original hellfire. As an early reference point, Mr. Lewis's benchmark 1964 recording \\"Live at the Star Club, Hamburg\\" (Rhino) has just been issued for the first time in the United States. Show time is tomorrow at 8:30 and 11:30 P.M. Tickets are $30 for reserved seating and $20 for standing room.

Charlie to Charlie    \\"A Tribute to Charlie Parker,\\" Charlie Watts Quintet with strings, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. The Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts's \\"Tribute to Charlie Parker\\" is jazz for beginners as well as aficionados; the project actually began, in the 1960's, as a children's book on the life of this saxophonist. In these club dates, as well as on a new album (Continuum Group), Mr. Watts translates Parker's work with graceful expertise: from \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" to Parker's \\"Dewey's Square,\\" the arrangements, with Peter King on saxophone, are faithful and fluent in tone. And in jazz, as in rock, Mr. Watts's drumming has an implacable sureness and lightness of touch. Tonight through Sunday at 9 and 11:30 P.M. Tickets for table seating are $30, with a $5 minimum; admission to the bar is $20.

Saturday morning brings a visit to the Beatles Museum and Information Center on Mathew Street for a look at memorabilia and films, as well as an opportunity to buy appropriate souvenirs.

Why was Mr. Kean not wearing a bicycle helmet? He should know that not only must he wear a helmet to protect his own life, but also that as a public figure, he should be pictured as a role model to advocate a cause he pledged to support.   Two years ago, Mr. Kean agreed to serve as the honorary chairman of the National Council of Jewish Women West Essex Division Bycycle Safety Task Force. The task force, which has since been expanded, is dedicated to providing bicycle safety education for children and parents.   I am co-chairwoman of the task force, which was formed after the death of my 7-year-old son in 1988. Hit by a car while riding his bike only two blocks from home, Jonathon sustained massive head injury and died after lying in a coma for a week in the hospital.   I am a staunch supporter of bicycle helmets, which might have saved his life. In order to promote the wearing of these crucial pieces of equipment, I have been relating my tragic story to assemblies of children in various school districts and recreation departments. Pledged to saving young lives, I have been impressing upon the children and parents in the audience that what happened to my son could be prevented by the use of a helmet.   Statistics show that approximately 1,000 people die in the United States every year as a result of bicycle-related trauma -- more than two-thirds of these victims, or 600, under the age of 15. Over 75 percent of these deaths involve head trauma.   Protective helmets have been found to be up to 85 percent effective in preventing head injuries, including the more mild injuries involving concussions. And, while helmets will not prevent bicycle crashes from occurring, they can save the life of even the most skilled cyclist.   The Bicycle Safety Task Force is working toward making bicycle helmets mandatory in our state. We support Assemblymen Cimino and Cooper's bill that would require helmets for all bike riders.   We would like to see New Jersey become a lighthouse state in promoting mandatory bicycle helmet legislation. We hope former Governor Kean and Gov. Jim Florio back this bill.

GRANDMA AND ME, by Mercer Mayer (for Macintosh and Windows","excerpt":"Living Books, $39.95 suggested; ages 2 to 5) was the first in the series and remains the standard-bearer of the Living Books line. The protagonist is Mr. Mayer's well-known Little Critter, an unflaggingly cute little fellow whose bloodlines apparently descend from chipmunk and woodchuck. In this episode, Critter's sprightly Grandma accompanies him on a beach outing. The story harbors very little conflict -- save a tussle with a crab -- but much charm. The viewer can choose to have the story read aloud, much as it might have been before electronic media, or watch it unfold in a more free-form style. As each virtual page appears on the screen, a voice reads the brief text (each word lights up as it is sounded), and then the real fun begins. The screen becomes a playground; almost every character and object on the screen is now a \\"hot button\\" for an amusing animated sequence; touch the sand castle, for instance, and a little phalanx of bugs marches out over a drawbridge.

As the film makes almost too clear in its climactic hunting sequence, preparing to kill an animal is much more than a sport for people like Wes. It is a rite of purification and a sexual substitute.

Breaking those rules, doing things differently, requires a certain daring. It is when designers design for themselves or are given a free hand that the interiors best reflect the occupants' personal idiosyncrasies and functional needs.    For some people, a sparse interior is more a matter of choice than of circumstance. ''What I tried to do,'' said Robert Currie, a designer, ''is unfurnish my apartment. For me, luxury is having a space with nothing in it. I don't feel that every corner, every plane, every surface has to be covered. In fact I believe in the exactly opposite approach. Rather than filling up a space, I pull things out until it gets down to the bare essentials.''   To accommodate what Mr. Currie defined as the main functions of his loft - eating, sleeping and entertaining - the designer was not afraid to place rooms unconventionally, and he situated the bedroom area near the window with the view, where others would place the living-room area. ''It's important to wake up to something that's esthetically pleasing,'' Mr. Currie said. ''And I don't consider it a bedroom. Rather, it's just another place to go to in the apartment.''

Susan E. Johnson, in white pants and striped shirt, who comes into Mrs. Cordischi's room to adjust her intravenous tubes, is a far cry from the traditional white-capped nurse. Not only does she administer to her patient, who suffers from chronic asthma, but she also draws up a 24-hour plan of nursing care that she supervises while she herself is on duty and that other nurses follow in her absence.  Miss Johnson, 24 years old, is a ''primary nurse,'' one of a new breed of medical professionals who have come into being to offset the increasing fragmentation of patient care and nursing accountability.  Contributing to the need were several factors: the spread of team nursing, wherein each nurse does only one task during an entire shift, the rapid advance of medical technology and the continuing shortage of nurses resulting from fewer people being attracted to or staying in a profession which, they feel, does not let them fully practice the healing arts they acquired at nursing school.

What I had was a position on video- cassette recorders. I was against them. It seemed to me that the fundamental idea of the VCR - which is that if you go out and miss what's on television, you can always watch it later - flew in the face of almost the only thing I truly believed - which is that the whole point of going out is to miss what's on television. Let's face it: Part of being a grown-up is that every day you have to choose between going out at night or staying home, and it is one of life's unhappy truths that there is not enough time to do both.\\n\\nFinally, though, I broke down, but not entirely. I did not buy a video-cassette recorder. I rented one. And I didn't rent one for myself - I myself intended to stand firm and hold to my only principle. I rented one for my children.

But not until he was 23, trying to play major league baseball with the Minnesota Twins, did he learn that the abnormal movements and sounds he could not control had a name and a physical cause -- Tourette syndrome. Even then, the Twins' management insisted that his problem was really stage fright and forbade him to take the medication prescribed to curb the symptoms caused by this inherited neurological disorder.   Likewise with Dr. Carl Bennett, a Canadian surgeon who began having tics at 7. They were soon followed by movements that were either involuntary or compulsive, strange hoots and utterances and sudden rages during which he could not help throwing things. Yet, Dr. Bennett, now 54, whose remarkable life is described in Dr. Oliver Sacks's new book, \\"An Anthropologist on Mars\\" (Alfred A.

Its third program is devoted entirely to canine attitudes, human perceptions thereof, and the distinct possibility that much of what we think of as doggie behavior is actually doggie-owner delusion on a grand scale. Pet fanciers of any kind will find this an illuminating show.    The longest and most ambitious of the program's three films is \\"The Wonderful World of Dogs,\\" by the Australian director Mark Lewis, whose \\"Cane Toads\\" was such a treat. Mr. Lewis can hardly be blamed if the family dog is not quite a match for the huge, controversial, hallucinogen-producing toads that were his earlier film's subject. As it is, he finds a lot to work with among the dogs and dog-minded people of quiet Mosman, Australia, where one dog-obsessed woman has tried everything from barbecue skewers to mothballs to keep dog droppings away from the one small tree on her tiny lawn. She loudly laments the carelessness of these dogs' owners, and wonders why her neighbors resent her latest method: covering the lawn with empty plastic soda bottles to keep the dogs at bay.
