Mr. Davis played his final performance in the revival at the Marquis Theater on Sunday amid reports that he was being dismissed because of discord between him and other members of the cast and the production team. A telephone message left for his agent was not immediately returned. Until Mr. Goulet joins the production at a date in April to be determined, the role of Georges is to be played by an understudy, John Hillner. Mr. Goulet, who made his Broadway debut in 1960 as Sir Lancelot in ''Camelot'' opposite Richard Burton and Julie Andrews, won a Tony Award in 1968 as best actor in a musical for ''The Happy Time.'' His most recent Broadway credits include ''Camelot'' in 1993 and ''Moon Over Buffalo'' in 1995.    India Cracks Down On TV Content    Reacting to increasing concern over programming content called obscene by parents and women's groups, the Indian government has suspended the broadcasting rights of a television movie channel, Agence France-Presse reported. The government also warned other broadcasters that they risk punishment similar to that meted out to the channel, Cine World, which was ordered off the air for a month. Information and Broadcasting Secretary Navin Chawla said, ''Through this action, which is the first of its kind, the ministry has come down strongly on those purveying obscenity, and this can include cable operators as well.'' He told the Press Trust of India, ''The government is serious on this issue, and it will keep a close watch on channels engaging in such activities.'' He said a regulatory body, with power to permanently cancel broadcasting rights, was being established to monitor the content of India's 100-odd private channels.

Specifically, Chairman James E. Lee has been called a loser - a chief executive who just did not have enough fight in him and refused to use all the defensive options in his arsenal. \\n\\nI find this reaction distorted because it focuses on ''survival at all costs'' rather than on the proper responsibilities of managers in public corporations. \\n\\nTo understand the prevailing sentiment toward Gulf on Wall Street, a little background might help. Gulf incurred some disfavor among professional traders when it abandoned its 1982 attempt to buy Cities Service. In the midst of a takeover contest, government scrutiny of the deal for possible antitrust violations cooled Gulf's ardor and Mr. Lee was quoted as saying he ''had no stomach for this kind of thing.'' As a result, many Wall Street risk arbitragers who had bought Cities Service stock in anticipation of a successful takeover suffered losses as the stock plunged. Indeed, several ''arbs'' have been quoted as being pleased that Gulf is being taken over and supported T. Boone Pickens' takeover bid to make up for earlier losses.

Using a band that included ukulele, cello, accordion, bass, drums and four horns, he conjured up a polite, near-Victorian world where people wore varsity sweaters and liked sweet white jazz. The music would have sounded fine in a Woody Allen movie.    Though the music occasionally went dull and gray, Mr. Hoffman captured a mythical America where pride in industry hadn't ruined the rivers or the air and the future seemed bright. The band never quite reached any rhythmic intensity, but when it does, the mixture of Victorian propriety and rhythmic drive will produce something new.

And now a new project -- a complete edition of the composer's music, to be published under the auspices of the Kurt Weill Foundation for Music -- could push this rich body of work more firmly into the spotlight.    Over the last decade, several of Weill's stage works -- particularly \\"The Threepenny Opera,\\" \\"The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny\\" and \\"Street Scene\\" -- have taken on new lives in the world's opera houses. And works that had been fairly obscure, like the two Symphonies, the Violin Concerto and the Cello Sonata, have had multiple recordings. Other obscure pieces turn up occasionally in chamber, choral and symphonic concerts.

The Houston Grand Opera put on Weill's near-forgotten American masterpiece last night in a splendidly natural production directed by Francesca Zambello. Realizing how good \\"Street Scene\\" is barely advances its fortunes, however.

In fact, said Criswell, it was the Colts that gave him a chance to play pro football.    \\"I was one of the replacement players for the Colts during the strike of 1987 and I got a chance to play against the Jets and Mark Gastineau and Scott Mersereau,\\" the 6-foot-7-inch, 291-pound offensive tackle, in his fourth pro season, said after today's practice with the Jets.   \\"I had been out for almost a year and I was working in California at a health center when the strike came and I finally got a shot at Indianapolis. That was my first-ever tryout.\\"    Although he was cut when the regular players came back after three games, Criswell was signed by the Jets as a free agent in the spring of 1988. He played 15 games that fall, starting 12 at left tackle after Dave Cadigan, a No. 1 draft choice was injured. Criswell eventually bumped Cadigan to guard, starting all 16 games at tackle last season and all 13 so far this season.    Criswell is the only current N.F.L. player out of tiny Graceland College in Iowa, which has led to some amusing speculation about whether or not he was part of the Paul Simon tour or the Elvis Presley shrine.   \\"It's a small religious school that was a two-year college before the war,\\" said Criswell, who points out that Bruce Jenner, the former Olympic decathlete, also came out of the school. \\"I'm a pretty good Elvis fan, though. In fact, that was the first concert I ever went to. My mom took me when I was a kid. She's a big Elvis fan.\\"  Time for a Raise?     When the league's salary list came out this week, it showed that Brian Washington, the Jets' strong safety, was not only the lowest-paid Jets starter this year, but was also making less than some players who have not played a down this season.    Washington, who took a leave from football after being waived by Cleveland and was signed by the Jets last season, had returned with a base salary of $75,000 plus an $11,000 signing bonus.    Meanwhile, he was surrounded by high-priced players, sitting next to Erik McMillan, the All-Pro free safety who is making $525,000 this season, and Freeman McNeil, the running back making $900,000. Two stalls away was Tony Eason, a reserve quarterback making $1.25 million.    So Washington moved his locker to the opposite side of the room, saying, \\"That was the high-rent district over there.\\"   His new neighbors?    Tony Stargell, a rookie cornerback, who earns a $140,000 base salary and $172,000 bonus, and Travis Curtis, Washington's replacement at strong safety, who is paid $240,000, with an $83,000 bonus. Don't Be Fooled by Record     One might think that with a 4-9 record, the Jets would hardly have any candidates in the balloting for the Pro Bowl. They have six: McMillan at safety","excerpt":"Kyle Clifton at linebacker; Al Toon at wide receiver; James Hasty at cornerback; Joe Prokop at punter, and the sentimental favorite, Pat Leahy, the place-kicker.   Leahy is 39 years old and is the team's career leading scorer (1,343 points), as well as its leader in games played (232). He has never been to a Pro Bowl in his 17 seasons, but he is 20 for 22 on field goals this season, a perfect 22-22 on points after and keeping his fingers crossed.  Haight Eager for Action     Mike Haight, the starting left guard, sprained a toe in the Jets' first meeting with the Colts in Indianapolis this season. The injury caused a shake-up on the offensive line.    Haight said he was feeling better after participating in full-squad drills today, and added that the offensive line coach, Larry Beightol, had told him he would be starting again. But he was still listed as questionable for Sunday. When Coach Bruce Coslet was asked today when he would know if Haight was ready to play, he replied, \\"About when they're playing the national anthem.\\" PRO FOOTBALL: Notebook; Criswell Ponders Big Break on Colts"},{"year":"1956","title":"\\"The Happiest Millionaire,\\" a comedy by Kyle Crichton, opens at the Lyceum Theatre at 8 o'clock tonight.

But what if victory became elusive?\\n\\nOf course the climactic invasion of Kyushu, its launch set for Nov. 1, 1945, never happened. The United States instead used atomic bombs to devastate two Japanese cities, and 50 years ago this week the emperor told his people they must \\"bear the unbearable\\" -- surrender. Yet the long-feared, never-realized battle for the island remains the most important of the \\"what ifs\\" that must be contemplated in weighing the morality of the decision to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \\nAn Armada\\n\\n\\nThe invasion plan was extensive and elaborate. Half a million American soldiers, sailors and airmen were to assault the island's southern beaches, backed by an armada of 3,000 ships, including 22 battleships and more than 60 aircraft carriers including escort carriers. For three years Douglas MacArthur's army forces had fought their way up from the South Pacific while Chester Nimitz's navy brilliantly spearheaded a long amphibious campaign across the Central Pacific.
