Commissioned for the opening of the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center (an event whose silver anniversary was celebrated by the company earlier this week), it was an extraordinary flop. Franco Zeffirelli created a production so overwrought and overstocked that it broke the stage's brand new turntable (creating a logistical mess for many operas that first season). He also wrote a libretto confusingly excerpted from Shakespeare's already knotty play. And finally, Barber's music was roundly rejected by many critics.   This was a catastrophe for the much-honored composer, who later attempted to rescue the work from oblivion with a new, condensed version, done with the help of Gian Carlo Menotti and first performed at the Juilliard Opera Center in 1975. This time Zeffirelli's name was removed from the libretto, and while critical reaction was more muted, it was still largely disapproving.

Existing bonds are still callable after 25 years, the Treasury noted.    The move was taken to accommodate the growing market in long-term securities that are stripped of their coupons and sold to investors at deep discounts.    Many investors prefer taking a chance that these ''cheap'' bonds will appreciate toward maturity rather than clip taxable coupons twice a year. For these investors, the Treasury's call provision meant that they might not enjoy the anticipated price rise in the final five years of the bond's life.

Curtis Hoerbelt has patented a new form of chess that uses a flat board with 28 rows arranged in the shape of a vortex. Half of the rows have five black squares, the other half, five white squares, and each row spirals out from a central circle. It looks like a two-dimensional tornado or whirlpool viewed from the top.    Mr. Hoerbelt, an industrial mechanic in Lancaster, N.Y., was one of several inventors who patented new board games this week. Others included a game in which players compete at making corporate takeovers and a trivia game built on guessing idiomatic American expressions.

This season, the deliberately disheveled hairdo is the height of style.

What Oribe does is set, tease and arrange a coif the usual way. Then he coaxes some pieces and tendrils to drop out of place. Oribe invented this degage hair style for the spring Chanel showing in Paris. Some of the models, particularly the exotic Yasmin LeBon, who appeared with two large hunks of hair obscuring her eyes, looked quite startling. But as Oribe explained, this was purposeful exaggeration to create runway drama. \\"All Karl Lagerfeld, the designer, asked me to do,\\" he said, \\"was make the girls feel wonderful -- and they did.\\" By Design","excerpt":"New Twists in Hairdos"},{"year":"1985","title":"MANY corporations are becoming embroiled in libel suits, and that is forcing  many businesses to pay closer attention to important new developments in libel law.

Movies"},{"year":"1951","title":"So long as the flame of romance sputters in imaginative minds—and we rather suspect it will sputter for quite some time to come—there will no doubt he speculation as to what did actually occur in the famous Austrian hunting lodge at Mayerling on the night of Jan. 30, 1889. For it was there, the following morning, that the body of Crown Prince Rudolph was found alongside that of his notorious mistress, Marie Vetsera, a 17-year-old girl. The story is that bullet holes were found in the lifeless couple's heads. Was it suicide or was it murder that accounted for their demise? And why?Two slightly different explanations were offered some fifteen years ago in a play by Maxwell Anderson and in a French picture titled \\"Mayerling.\\" Mr. Anderson came to the conclusion, in his play, \\"The Masque of Kings,\\" that political intrigue drove the lovers to the final frustration of suicide. In \\"Mayerling,\\" however, it was nothing but beautiful, passionate love, finally forbidden by the Emperor, that caused the inseparable couple to make their ends. Not only was this explanation more satisfying to romantic taste, but it was made all the more appealing by Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux in the tragic roles.Now, after wars and desolation, comes yet another film from France which offers what is claimed to be the genuine and \\"unconjectured\\" story of Rudolph and Marie. \\"The Secret of Mayerling,\\" which opened at the Paris yesterday, concludes that the lovers were murdered by an assassin on orders from Berlin. This assassin was dispatched to do the mischief when the evidence became fairly clear that Rudolph was plotting a rebellion with dissident elements in countries to the east and had gone to Mayerling to parley, with the approval and support of Marie.How credible is this story, we cannot begin to tell, since we are not acquainted with the \\"new documents\\" on which it is said to be based. The only reports that we have of new evidence in this case cast the whole thing in a surprising and decidedly unromantic light. One, the eye-witness story of Archduke Johann, bared in 1945, maintains that quite a rowdy party transpired at Mayerling on that fateful night and that Marie, in a rush of jealous fury, conked her lover with a bottle of champagne. When it was obvious that she had killed him, a loyal valet shot her dead in mad revenge.And the memoirs of Count Carl Lonyay, published in 1949, paint a picture of Rudolph and his mistress which rather explodes the pretty legend of ideal love.Be that as it may, this new drama, which was written by Jacques Remey and Jean Delannoy, who also directed, makes it all seem a very tragic and touching affair—a cynically engineered alliance between a bored and blasé young prince and a beautiful, starry-eyed maiden which was obstructed when it was found to have gone too far. It also maintains that young Rudolph, despite his licentious ways, was a passionate champion of freedom and an enemy of his tyrannical old man.Concerning political intrigue, the drama is not too clear, and this reviewer is blankly bewildered as to why a German assassin struck the blows. However, there is nothing bewildering about the intricacies of the romance between the happy young parties to it and the conniving by which it is arranged. The script and M. Delannoy's direction are not only explicitly clear but the staging and acting of the romance have a beauty and rhythm that are sure.With Jean Marais playing Rudolph and the lovely Dominique Blanchar as Marie, the film has two principal players who give a high romantic finish to the roles. M. Marais is handsome, reckless and exquisitely idealized, while the Blanchar miss makes the young Vetsera into a charmingly gay and nubile girl. Claude Farrel is poised and commanding as the scheming countess who \\"arranges\\" the romance, while Debucourt, Jacques Dacquine and Michel Vitold are excellent as Habsburg bigs.Some beautiful settings and beautiful scenery, photographed in an autumnal haze give an air of majesty and sadness to this familiar but still fascinating tale. Good French dialogue is meagerly translated in English subtitles that barely state the case.Alongside of \\"Mayerling,\\" we'd rate it a few pegs behind that wistful film but definitely worth the attention of all those who like to dream and sigh.

Chrissie Hynde, the group's singer, songwriter, and rhythm guitarist, has a 14- month-old daughter, Natalie, whose father is the leader-songwriter of The Kinks, Ray Davies. ''I'm not the kind I used to be, I got a kid, I'm 33,'' Miss Hynde sings, on the current Pretenders album, referring, perhaps, to her earlier reputation as a brash bon vivant.\\n\\n The changes affect more than Miss Hynde.

Warner. $92.95. Laser disk, $24.98. 1 hour, 47 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.    As the straight-arrow captain of a B-17, Matthew Modine pilots a predictable cross section of American types on one last mission over Germany in World War II. Borrowing from William Wyler's fine 1941 documentary about a bomber crew, Michael Caton-Jones's film is a wan imitation, resembling the \\"sort of service films Hollywood made during the war, with some contemporary gaucheries standing in for the sentimental cliches\\" (Canby). The Tall Guy  1990. RCA/Columbia. $89.95. LD, $34.95. 1:32. CC. R.    Playing an elephant man, Jeff Goldblum wears Dumbo ears and a phallic trunk in Mel Smith's film about the misfortunes of a hapless American actor in London. A team of British television and theater personalities blends Monty Python sharpness with music-hall gags to make a modest comedy, \\"always wickedly endearing, thanks to the off-kilter characters\\" (Maslin). Sibling Rivalry  1990. Nelson. $94.98. LD, $34.98. 1:28. CC. PG-13.    After ardently coupling with her brother-in-law (Sam Elliott), Marjorie Turner (Kirstie Alley) watches the fellow expire from a heart attack. How to cover up the indiscretion with her family? The film is almost half over before the screwball elements come together. \\"Ms. Alley, with a flair for dithering characters like this one, is often given too much reaction time and not enough to react to\\" (Maslin). Funny About Love  1990. Paramount. $91.95. LD, $34.95. 1:51. CC. PG-13.    Gene Wilder is Duffy Bergman, a successful political cartoonist at once enraptured and terrified by the notion of fatherhood. On hand to assist him through his fears and efforts at conception are Christine Lahti and Mary Stuart Masterson. \\"Leonard Nimoy, whose direction accentuates the material's cuteness in every possible way, nonetheless glimpses a reasonably serious side to this story\\" (Maslin). Aguirre, the Wrath of God  1973. New Yorker. $59.95. 1:34. German with English subtitles. No rating.    Klaus Kinski makes a civilized if murderous conquistador in Werner Herzog's rich, tactile film about a mad attempt to establish El Dorado in the Amazon jungle. Few survive the wilderness or one another. \\"Mr. Herzog views the proceedings with fixed detachment. He may even be slightly amused. Mainly he is a poet who constantly surprises us with unexpected juxtapositions\\" (Canby).   AND KEEP IN MIND    AKIRA KUROSAWA'S DREAMS -- A young boy wanders through fairy tales that are \\"absolutely stunning to look at and listen to\\" (Vincent Canby). 1990. Warner. $92.95. Laser disk, $34.98. 2 hours. Closed captioned. PG.   FLATLINERS -- Medical students temporarily shut down vital bodily functions. The director, Joel Schumacher, has created a \\"stylish horror film that thrives on its characters' guilty secrets\\" (Caryn James). 1990. RCA/Columbia. $91.95. LD, $34.95. 1:51. CC. R.   GHOST -- The deceased returns to his lover in a ghost story that \\"veers repeatedly from the somber to the broadly comic\\" (Janet Maslin). 1990. Paramount. $99.95. LD, $29.95. 2:22. CC. PG-13.   HENRY AND JUNE -- Philip Kaufman's film about the three-way relationship of Henry Miller, his wife and Anais Nin is \\"overpowered by Nin's passionately overheated style\\" (Maslin). 1990. MCA/Universal. $91.95. LD, $39.98. 2:16. NC-17.   THE LAST PICTURE SHOW -- Peter Bogdanovich's film about life and coming of age in Anarene, Tex., is an \\"adventure in rediscovery of human values\\" (Canby). 1971. RCA/Columbia. $59.95. LD, $34.95. 1:58. CC. R.   PACIFIC HEIGHTS -- John Schlesinger's film about yuppie landlords (Matthew Modine and Melanie Griffith) is a \\"lot more entertaining than an application for a second mortgage\\" (Maslin). 1990.

WILD AT HEART -- Drawing from early Pop Art, David Lynch's film about the nightmarish odyssey of two lovers (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern) creates a \\"frieze of melodramatic characters and events\\" (Canby). 1990.

Closed captioned. R.    Peter Bogdanovich's film is a lovely, leisurely pan shot across life and coming of age in Anarene, Tex. The year is 1951, Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) are football co-captains, and Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd) is the homecoming queen. Interlocking stories of love and loss are treated with such humor and sympathy that they become an \\"adventure in rediscovery of human values\\" (Vincent Canby). Henry and June  1990. MCA/Universal. $91.95. LD, $39.98. 2:16. CC. NC-17.    The sex outdoes the drama in Philip Kaufman's film, set in Paris in the 1930's, about the three-way relations of the novelist Henry Miller (Fred Ward), his wife, June (Uma Thurman), and the diarist Anais Nin (Maria de Madeiros). Missing is Miller's raw, reckless immediacy, overpowered by Nin's passionately overheated style. \\"The film is deeply in harmony with her thoughts at their most fulsome and hyperbolic, and with her idealistic embrace of sexual liberation as the pursuit of truth\\" (Janet Maslin). Miller's Crossing  1990. CBS/Fox. $92.98. 1:54. CC. R.    Meant to emulate oldtime gangster movies, this film by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, often brings to mind \\"Dick Tracy\\" but without that film's wit or class. As a suave crime boss, Albert Finney battles a rival through a simple yet hard-to-follow narrative of \\"random effects and little accumulative impact\\" (Canby). Wild at Heart  1990. Media. $89.98. 2:05. CC. R.    On a run to Tuna, Tex., Lula (Laura Dern) and Sailor (Nicolas Cage) follow their own yellow brick road through a bizarre, violent hell. David Lynch's cockeyed epic draws from early Pop Art, creating a \\"kind of frieze of melodramatic characters and events, which sometimes enrich the film and sometimes have no pertinence except as found objects\\" (Canby). The Plot Against Harry  1990. New Yorker. $79.95. 1:21. No rating.    Harry Plotnik is a glum Jewish gangster seeking respectability as a family man in Michael Roemer's funny, sharply drawn film, which was made in 1969 but not released until 1990. \\"The mid-60's types who populate the film, from street hoods and call girls to comically dolled-up suburbanites, have been made that much more colorful by two intervening decades\\" (Maslin). AND KEEP IN MIND     AKIRA KUROSAWA'S DREAMS -- A young boy wanders through fairy tales that are \\"absolutely stunning to look at and listen to\\" (Vincent Canby). 1990. Warner. $92.95.

Even in rehearsing his company of talented and attractive dancers, Gallman's Newark Dance Theater, this choreographer-director camouflages his creative forces by maintaining a low-key, casual demeanor. \\n\\nAt a recent run-through at the Harlem School of the Arts in preparation for the company's performances on Friday, Saturday and next Sunday at the Mary B. Burch Theater at Essex County College in Newark, Mr. Gallman's insistence on excellence and commitment to professionalism were veiled in a soft voice and gentle manner. Nevertheless, his messages -- about the shape of an elbow or exactness of position -- were clear, and his dancers went through the full program of five works with practically no breaks. \\n\\nMore international than the original home-grown troupe, the classically trained performers, who paint the dancescape with ballet, modern dance and jazz movement, come from the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Trinidad, Puerto Rico and Portugal as well as New Jersey and New York. \\n\\nTheir sweat shirts, bearing the words Howard University, \\"Porgy and Bess\\" and Africa, speak of black pride, and their vigor and dynamism reflect their professional pride. Both aspects are thrown into high relief in \\"Precious Memories,\\" which Mr. Gallman choreographed in 1980. The work depicts the role of the church in the black community in sequences that range from the deeply affecting \\"Mother's Prayer\\" to the humorous \\"Senior Choir.\\"\\n\\nWhile much of the repertory is thematically connected to the black experience, a good part defies such definition. \\"The Call,\\" a 1984 work by Mr. Gallman, will feature Sheryl Pollard in a compelling solo inspired by the Brazilian \\"Legend of the Niad,\\" in which a beautiful forest creature lures men to their death with her mysterious call.\\n\\nFrom her perch atop a ladder, with white silk plumage cascading to the floor, she waits in solitude for a victim. The score by Milton Nasciemento pulses with jungle sounds, enhancing the exotic atmosphere. \\n\\nIn \\"Enigmatic Ocean,\\" choreographed for the company by Andre Tyson, liquid movement erupts into galvanic leaps and turns in what Mr. Gallman describes as a metaphor for life. \\"The mood of the piece reflects the mood of the ocean,\\" Mr. Gallman said. \\"It has all the colors of life. The ups and downs, the happy and sad.\\" \\n\\nIn \\"Shells,\\" by Elbert Watson, a former principal dancer with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, three men limn the male psyche and experience. From the swagger and bravado of the adolescent to the grief that maturity can bring, \\"Shells\\" traverses territory infrequently explored by choreographers. Gregory Hinton applies his dramatic powers to an emotional landscape filled with agony. \\n\\nMr. Hinton is a focal point again in \\"Behind the Garden,\\" which will have its world premiere on Friday. Inspired by a verse from Corinthians, the work projects a vision of paradise that includes Eve, or Mother Nature, tending her garden and three men as birds of paradise.\\n\\nAs the snake, Mr. Hinton uses a Gallman signature image of evil, splayed fingers, and exploits the concentrated power of his energy to ooze seductive charm. In one memorable sequence, he pulls himself along the floor, one leg extended forward, one leg bent behind his head in an acrobatic \\"attitude.\\" \\n\\nTo mount a new work after losing all State Arts Council funds speaks of Mr. Gallman's security in the company's status. After receiving the largest award for a modern dance troupe the previous year ($195,000), the ensemble filed its application late and lost out this year. \\n\\nBut the company's performances pay for themselves, Mr. Gallman said, and his 250-student school and corporate and private financing enable it to function. As one of 10 companies selected to perform last January in the Man-Made Festival at the prestigious Joyce Theater in New York City, and with other appearances on the national scene slated for the coming months, Gallman's Newark Dance Theater enters the decade from an enviable place. \\n\\nFor Mr. Gallman, who shuttles between New York City and Newark with an ambitious schedule of rehearsals and classes, giving youngsters an alternative to the bleakness of their urban surroundings continues to energize him. \\n\\n\\"When I go to Newark and I'm a little tired and I see 25 kids at the barre looking at me with those big bright eyes and I look back 12 years and there were those same kids there, I realize a decade ago I touched people's lives and gave them a place where they could become what they dreamed about,\\" he said.\\n\\n\\"I feel I have ancestral voices around me and that I have to listen to them and pass on what I have to each generation, not just one decade. So that 50 years from now you'll come in and say, 'The old man's still at it, producing dances.' \\" \\n\\nPerformances on Friday and Saturday begin at 7:30 P.M. and on Sunday at 4 P.M.

This may be savvy marketing, but it does little to bring living composers and audiences closer together.         That said, the concert on Monday night was a strong program, compellingly performed.

The players -- David Harrington and John Sherba, violinists, Hank Dutt, violist and Joan Jeanrenaud, cellist -- played works written for them recently by composers from six countries.

Superficially, that seems to be true. Yes, there are all those black sitcoms like \\"Living Single\\" and \\"Fresh Prince of Bel Air\\" (now in its final countdown), but their characters tend to be rigidly segregated from white society and most of their performers are curiously ignored when it comes time for Emmy Award nominations. Is it purely by chance that the one comic to emerge as a superstar from \\"In Living Color,\\" Fox's former variety show dominated by black performers, was a white man named Jim Carrey?         Television, though, to its credit, keeps on trying, however awkwardly. Two new prime-time sitcoms, ABC's \\"Buddies\\" (Wednesdays at 9:30 P.M.) and \\"The Show\\" on Fox (Sundays at 8:30 P.M.) do make gestures in the direction of racial integration. In \\"Buddies,\\" white John (Christopher Gartin) and black Dave (Dave  Chappelle) have been friends since grade school and, now partners in a video business, even live in the same apartment house, which is owned by Dave's father.
