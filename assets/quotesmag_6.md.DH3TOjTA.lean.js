That may seem premature, but the band's \\"Time Capsule Tour\\" follows the release of \\"Hope Chest\\" (Elektra), a compilation of songs originally released on independent labels in 1982 and 1983. The band is touring with John Lombardo, who quit 10,000 Maniacs just before the band found a wide audience with the 1987 album \\"In My Tribe.\\" Mr. Lombardo opened the concert with his current group and sat in with 10,000 Maniacs on older songs.    The concert revealed the differences between early and current 10,000 Maniacs. It has always been a folk-rock band, steeped in the British folk-rock of the 1970's, with songs that revolve around Natalie Merchant's reedy voice and bookish lyrics. But where the current 10,000 Maniacs concentrates on stately, chiming songs, the early band was more eclectic, dipping into reggae for one song, garage-rock stomps for another, a Caribbean lilt in a third.

Takashimaya took ownership of the site in 1988, paying the owners, Edison Brothers Stores of St. Louis, approximately $30 million for Chandlers Fifth Avenue Inc., which owned the property where both the shoe and jewelry stores had leased space.    The company had established an earlier retail presence in New York in the mid-70's when it opened a specialty store at 509 Fifth Avenue, near 42d Street.

I'm not sure if this is a movie or a friendly corporate merger. &quot;Returner&quot; begins in the middle of a pitched battle, where the rag-covered Milly (Anne Suzuki) crouches to stay below the gunfire. She travels from the distant future &#151; 2084 &#151; to end up in the near past: 2002, the Japanese release date of the film. Her trip drops her right in the middle of another gun battle, a gang war between the cold-blooded Mizoguchi (Goro Kishitani), who shoots crying children to silence them, and the revenge-minded Miyamoto (Takeshi Kaneshiro).  Miyamoto's innate integrity is obvious, since he has the placid, slightly exaggerated good looks of an anime hero and hair so impeccably styled each strand must have been treated individually. He's essentially a gunslinging ronin, and Milly needs him to avert the future war. He's not easily convinced, despite her futuristic rags and magical powers. He probably figures if she can't do much to enliven the second-hand Xerox of a script, then the future's not worth much anyway. Takashi Yamazaki, who wrote the screenplay with Kenya Hirata, does a credible job of handling the hand-to-hand combat and spinning-in-mid-air gunplay. But the competent and lavishly produced martial sequences aren't nearly enough to compensate for a dead-on-its-feet story. &quot;Returner&quot; is a smorgasbord that seems to have been picked out of a dumpster. It clumsily combines a fish-out-of-water story with bits lifted from sources including the &quot;Terminator&quot; movies, &quot;Star Wars,&quot; &quot;Starman,&quot; &quot;Close Encounters,&quot; a couple of Pink Floyd albums and H. G. Wells.

He is Christopher George of Mount Sinai, a member of the faculty of the State University at Stony Brook and the director of research for the nonprofit Institute for Advanced Studies of World Religions, situated on the Stony Brook campus.   The 40-year-old Dr. George, a native of Worcester, Mass., who holds a Ph.D. in Sanskrit from Columbia University, who lived for three years in a Buddhist monastery in New Jersey, who journeyed 12,000 miles by van from Germany to Nepal on a Fulbright grant while working on his doctorate, says that not knowing Chinese was actually no impediment to developing a Chinese word-processing system.   ''In English,'' he noted, ''we have a 26-letter alphabet, so that with 26 symbols we can write pretty much anything we want, and we can give one symbol on each key of a typewriter and type along merrily.

But Mr. Sexton studied classical languages as an undergraduate at Columbia University, and he has often wished that a church in Jersey City, where he lives and works as a lawyer, would return to the sacred language. Last month, he and four other young Catholics here went from church to church, looking for a priest who would agree to offer a weekly Latin Mass. After several turned him down, the priests at St. Anthony of Padua, a 112-year-old church with Polish roots, agreed to give it a try.

The drummer, Steve (Skeeta) Charlot, attached funk, disco and reggae rhythms to the shuffling beat of Wilfred (Caveman) Pierre's rubboard, or metal washboard.

Opera    ''L'ITALIANA IN ALGERI.'' That the young tenor Juan Diego Flórez, the new prince of bel canto opera, made a dashing, boyish, and vocally dynamic Lindoro in the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Rossini's ''Italiana in Algeri'' was to be expected. The surprise here was the performance of the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina in the title role of the Italian girl, Isabella. Who knew that this artist, whose rich voice and smoldering presence are so suited to weighty roles in Verdi and Mussorgsky, would have had the right comic touch and impressive coloratura technique for Rossini's sassy heroine? Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's stylish 1973 production could not have seemed fresher or funnier. The veteran Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto made a wonderfully blustery Mustafa, the Bey of Algiers who yearns for an Italian wife. And James Levine's tender and lithe conducting made clear how much he loves this score. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000.

Ms. Larmore's Angelina, as the Cinderella is called here, is different: more mature and elegant, and perhaps a touch smoother vocally if not as uncannily precise in coloratura.
