''We were just simpatico right away,'' Ms. Cochran said. ''I said to her, 'A lot of people ask, what can D.T.W. do for me?' I was thinking, what can we do for D.T.W., to really support the artists?'' On Thursday, audiences can sample the fruits of this conversation at ''The Barnard Project.'' The first-time collaboration between D.T.W. and Barnard features dance majors from the college performing works by three choreographers, all of whom are in residence at Barnard. In ''Flowers and Snow,'' David Parker reworks ''Nut/Cracked,'' last year's naughty take on ''The Nutcracker.'' Donna Uchizono revisits ''Butterflies From My Hand'' (above, with August Pozgay, left, Julie Bakshi, Betsy Coker and Rachel Krol), expanding it from a quartet to a dance for seven, and Ori Flomin completes the program with ''Walking City, Standing Square,'' a new dance inspired by the sculptor Alberto Giacometti. Going mainly on instinct, Ms. Cochran said, she and Ms. Edwards chose these three from a pool of applicants. Then, after trying to ease as many of the production stresses as they could, they stepped away to let choreographers and dancers figure things out for themselves. Process ''is not really given a chance to bloom'' these days, Ms. Cochran said, adding that she sees the project as being ''about the future -- of the choreographers, the students and my relationship with D.T.W.''
