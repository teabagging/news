The strong dollar, apparently coupled with the expectation of an increase in disposable income resulting from the Federal income tax reduction scheduled to take effect July 1, has created an unexpected surge in the number of applications. In March, according to the Department of State, more passport applications were filed than in any month in history, and by April, 212,000 applications were awaiting processing, compared to 87,000 in 1981.   Compounding the situation are fewer clerks to handle the load and a new computerized passport production system in Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles that is manifesting a propensity for the sort of malfunctions that sometimes accompany new technology.   The issuance of new passports has been delayed as much as three weeks, and that's not counting additional time for mailing. Under normal circumstances, the State Department tries to deliver within about six working days. The agency notes that applications are processed in the order of stated departure dates and urgent requests can frequently be processed sooner. Passports for emergency travel can usually be issued in a matter of hours. The department is advising travelers to apply for passports as far in advance as possible.

His show Vox Rox is broadcast Saturdays from 12:30 P.M. through 7 P.M. on WVOX, which reaches most of the county. Those who tune their AM dials to 1460 usually hear community bulletins, talk shows featuring local residents and middle-of-the-road pop music. During Matt's hours, though, the station puts out not just rock, but the specific rock the young disk jockey loves most: that amalgam of ear-rending noise and outrageous theatricality known as heavy metal.\\n\\n''I think of the typical VOX listener as a nice lady in bathrobe and slippers, seeing her husband off to work in the morning,'' he said. ''My listeners are age 12 to 25, real 'head bangers' - heavy metal freaks. Some might wear stuff like the bands do - leather, metal studs, real long hair. Others dress more normal, but theyre definitely into the music.''

As a thick drumbeat pounded in the foreground, the guitarists played power chords and driving rhythms.

But the importation, which leans heavily on the musical classics, the ballet and glimpses of an interesting puppet show for support, is neither extraordinary in the treatment of its story nor in its acting. The sad case history of a venerable puppeteer, buffeted by fate and personal tribulations, who inspires and teaches a budding pianist is, like the puppets, largely mechanical and obvious.The attempt of the producers to create suspense in the opening reels of the picture is not successful. It is fairly apparent from the outset that old, day-dreaming Victorio, demoted from puppeteer to night watchman and muttering about having been a \\"criminal,\\" once knew real greatness. The field of that renown becomes fairly clear when he takes Dario, a poor but gifted pianist under his wing and allows him to practice backstage after hours. The denouement, which, in flashback, reveals the old man as a quondam eminent conductor, whose ballerina daughter died while performing in a strenuous ballet he composed, is not precisely surprising. And the intent to portray the old man's overpowering love for his art is rarely projected.Enrique Muino's characterization of Victorio is broad. He is a man given to much wild-eyed staring, introspection and flamboyant declamation. Dario Garzay, the concert pianist, who tells the story—both English titles and a narrator are used to translate the Spanish dialogue—is merely a fervent but uninspired figure. Italo Bertini, as the manager of the puppet troupe","excerpt":"Hector Mendez, as a sculptor who unwittingly helps reveal Muino's past, and Linda Lorena, as the ill-fated ballerina, are adequate in brief appearances.

Also, hedging bonds on a day-to-day basis can be difficult, because of the quarterly expiration dates of the contracts, which affect their values as much as rate moves.   For example, a manager of a portfolio of long-term fixed-income bonds would normally sell short a equivalent amount of Treasury bond futures.
