The $6.7 billion jump in M-1, which includes all currency in circulation and all kinds of checking accounts, indicated that the money stock would show substantial growth in November, reversing a decline in October. That, in turn, suggested to investors that the Federal Reserve could halt its recent efforts to lower interest rates, analysts said. CREDIT MARKETS","excerpt":"Interest Rates Rise for 2d Day"},{"year":"1984","title":"Interest rates rose modestly yesterday in quiet trading, as major investors remained on the sidelines and traders were cautious in the face of rising short-term rates.     ''A lot of people spent the day in meetings,'' said one government securities dealer, ''but the real cause of the inactivity is the lack of conviction about future rate changes.''    The lack of conviction stems from the ambiguous nature of recent economic data, which show that economic growth is slowing, but not necessarily enough to bring about lower interest rates.    ''It would be a mistake to assume that overall business credit demands are on the wane'' just because the economy is less robust than earlier in the year, said Abraham Gulkowitz, vice president at the Bankers Trust Company. In the latest issue of Prospects for the Credit Markets, Mr. Gulkowitz said business credit demands should continue to expand, particularly in the commercial paper market, while consumers are still in good financial condition. ''All in all,'' he said, ''business, consumers and government should continue to keep upward pressure on interest rates through the remainder of the year.''

Trading in the end-of-the-year market was light, however, and analysts said that the rise in interest rates was likely to be temporary.   In line with the rate increases, the price of long-term bonds fell nearly a point. The Treasury's 30-year, 11 3/4 percent bond was quoted late yesterday at 102 15/32 offered, down 31/32 of a point, for a yield of 11.46 percent, up from Monday's 11.43 percent.

The money supply increase, which followed a suprisingly large $6.7 billion rise a week earlier, was close to the change forecast by economists.    ''Even though the money supply increase locks in monetary growth for November, there was some relief that the increase was not larger,'' said William Sullivan, senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds.

And all through this period, what economists call real interest rates -- the difference between interest rates on borrowed money and the inflation rate -- have remained high. High real rates are usually seen as a threat to economic activity and an obstacle to a strong recovery after recession.    Such concerns are justified, most economists say. The real test of the impact of interest rates is their level in relation to the inflation rate. The closer the two rates are to each other, the greater the likelihood that salaries and prices will rise sufficiently to offset the cost of a loan. Sometimes interest rates on loans can be falling, but if the inflation rate is falling even faster, the real cost of the loan rises.
