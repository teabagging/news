But Lina Wertmuller excels in conveying both, in \\"The Seduction of Mimi,\\" which was made before her \\"Love and Anarchy.\\" Her films are deeply political, and her characters dwell in realms where politics cannot be escaped — whether in Mussolini's Italy or modern Sicily. \\"Mimi,\\" a furious farce that won her the best-director award at Cannes in 1972, concerns a young laborer who lurches between the local Mafia and the Communists — when all he really wants is a personal life. The movie opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse.Mimi refuses to vote for the Mafia's candidate in his town's elections, hence he loses his job. He believes in the rights of working people, yet he makes a half-baked Communist because he's eager to earn well, to provide for his child. Meanwhile, he shuns the wife who displeases him in bed and falls violently in love elsewhere. He thinks of himself as \\"a civilized man.\\" But when his neglected wife cuckolds him, all his energies surge into plotting vengeance against her lover — an obsession that has horrendous consequences for Mimi and puts him again at the mercy of the Mafia.In Mimi, Miss Wertmuller has created a sympathetic character who's also capable of barbarity, a likable person who can (and does) behave like a monster. It's her talent to be honest about cruelty","excerpt":"she also specializes in vulnerable people. Of course, the double standards of Sicily are stressed: a man is admired for having a mistress, yet he goes berserk when his wife hits the hay with another man; at the same time, none of his male friends would marry a divorced woman. Throughout, the bitterness is shot with comedy, while the macho code of revenge appears as a disease, and lunacies are committed in the name of \\"honor.\\"Although Miss Wertmuller emphasizes that women are steadily humiliated in Sicilian society — while showing that men are also victims of their country's traditions — her own feminism seems inconsistent at moments. Some of her scenes and characters embody strictly male fantasies — such as the titillating fight between two prostitutes in \\"Love and Anarchy,\\" or the transformation of Mimi's girlfriend from a gutsy, independent person into an ideally patient, faithful, adoring handmaiden. And there's a passage of searing brutality when Mimi seduces the fat, aging wife of his own wife's lover. His disgust at the grotesque body — which is filmed from angles that make it all the uglier — makes you wonder if the director occasionally relishes the degradation of other women.But whatever Miss Wertmuller's commitments, \\"Mimi\\" is one of the best films of this season. And it's far more substantial than \\"Love and Anarchy\\" — a movie that did absorb and touch me, even though I hardly believed a moment of it. (There, the insistence on love at first sight and the oozing innocence of the lovers seemed too artificial to swallow. Yet the absurd romanticism was enjoyable as well.) sistence on love at first sightIn both of the Wertmuller movies, the film maker's harsh judgments of people emerge in a style that's visually delectable. As Mimi, Giancarlo Giannini runs a range of moods from misery to delight or defiance and surpasses his performance in the other picture; a number of the same actresses (especially Elena Fiore and Mariangela Melato) are splendid. \\"Love and Anarchy\\" appears as the more commercial work: the splashy sex scenes sometimes seem like an apology for the political discussion. But in \\"Mimi,\\" politics and sex are so well balanced that all the raw emotions and the devastating jokes ring true.

And neither, unfortunately, are they as well known as their male counterparts. Ms. Robinson, a British bibliographer, set out to correct this situation by producing a reference guide to \\"all the first-hand travel accounts ever written by women\\" and published in the English language. But then, luckily for the reader, she committed what she charmingly calls \\"the bibliographer's cardinal sin\\" -- she started to read the books themselves. The result is a less comprehensive but far more engaging work, an annotated ramble through a surprisingly large chunk of history in the company of ancient pilgrims (the fourth-century abbess Etheria, who, lacking a Baedeker, merely used her Bible to map a route through the Holy Land), modern daredevils (the Hon. Mrs. Victor Bruce, the first woman known to be charged with speeding, who was still test-driving for the Ford Motor Company at the age of 78) and eternal eccentrics (Margaret Fountaine, a parson's daughter whose \\"three great passions\\" were \\"travel, butterflies, and Unsuitable Attachments\\").

Any dedicated reader of travel books is bound to have a few quibbles with her selections (Lola Montez and Florence Nightingale, but no Sybille Bedford?), although sheer gratitude for discoveries like \\"An English Girl's First Impressions of Burmah\\" by Beth Ellis (\\"one of the funniest travel books ever written\\") is likely to win out.

She attended King's College, Durham University, from which she was graduated with first-class honors in physical chemistry in 1933. Following graduate work at her home university, she came to this country and worked for two years at Radcliffe and at Harvard as a recipient of the Augustus Anson Whitney Fellowship from King's College, and as a Ross Sidgwick Fellow of the British and American Associations of University Women. She received her M.S. in chemistry from Radcliffe in 1937 and her Ph.D. from King's College in the same year. Following her return to England, she became a member of the senior research and administrative staff in the War Department, carrying on research in diagnostic explosives and working with mist dissolving for aircraft, the results of which were recognized as important in the British war effort. She was then appointed His Majesty's Inspector of Factories in the Ministry of Labor and National Service, the first woman to occupy the post. In 1940, Edna Ferrell returned to the United States and married Caryl Parker Haskins, the founder of Haskins Laboratories, a private non-profit research laboratory established in 1935. Edna Haskins published several works on her chemical research in alkalimetal hydrides by atomic hydrogen and her investigations of electrolytic dissociation. She and her husband Caryl shared a consuming interest in entomology. Together, they were responsible for some of the most important research in ant biology to date, coauthoring a number of conclusive works, together and with others. Edna Haskins was deeply interested in foreign affairs","excerpt":"she and Caryl Haskins traveled the wold extensively.

In selecting \\"Reno\\" for her first appearance, the producers must have realized this, because she is called on to bolster a production which amounts to very little with her and would be nothing without her.Adapted from Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr.'s novel of the same name, \\"Reno\\" is a none too happy mixture of journalism and fiction concerning the goings-on in the divorce mills of Nevada. Its machine-made narrative is an example of what may happen in the process of raising a state of facts to the level of an artistic theme.Miss Roland, as Felicia Brett, goes to Reno to seek a divorce from her husband (Montagu Love) whose relations with another woman are a public scandal. Mr. Brett follows and tricks her into a compromising situation with her girlhood sweetheart, Dick Belden (Kenneth Thomson). On the basis of this he threatens to have the child taken from her, but in a wild and improbable ride down a mountainside he is killed and his widow is enabled to marry Dick Belden.To the screening of this story, Warner Brothers have brought a number of capable players, including Sam Hardy. Judith Vosselli and little Douglas Scott, in addition to Montagu Love and Kenneth Thomson. Miss Roland is called on to sing a theme song called \\"As Long As We're Together,\\" which she renders in a pleasant voice. The \\"we\\" of the song, it should be said, refers both to Miss Roland and her little son and to Miss Roland and Mr. Thomson.

In the course of Bresson's short tale, both Marie and Balthazar will endure a crucible of suffering &#151","excerpt":"she at the rough hands of a punk in a black leather jacket, the donkey at the equally rough hands of various vicious masters. The critic J. Hoberman has observed that &quot;Balthazar&quot; is about a donkey in about the same way that &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; is about a whale, but it is also true that this is a story about an animal. Inspired by a passage from Dostoevsky's &quot;Idiot,&quot; Bresson makes Balthazar the moral center of his film, perhaps because, unlike Marie and the rest of the men and women in this fallen world, the donkey doesn't need to die to achieve grace. (It's worth noting that Bresson used a Schubert Sonata as &quot;a kind of language for the donkey's soul.&quot;) Over the years, some critics have classified Bresson's work as unapproachable, even punishing. For these professional philistines the idea that movies can be serious, more than tricks and trashy entertainment, is apparently anathema. Don't you believe it: &quot;Au Hasard Balthazar&quot; is a masterpiece of the art, but a masterpiece that stirs the heart and soul as much as the mind. &#151; Manohla Dargis The Screen: 'Au Hasard, Balthazar':Bresson Feature Opens at the New Yorker"},{"year":"1946","title":"Treynor, B","excerpt":"She Ate Her Cake Danny & Pinkie"},{"year":"1930","title":"Lewis says Mrs McCormick cannot win by sex appeal","excerpt":"she attacks his alleged connection with Thompson HOT FIRE EXCHANGED IN ILLINOIS CAMPAIGN; Lewis Says Mrs. M'Cormick 'Can't Win on Sex Appeal'--She Pounds Thompson on Deal Charge."},{"year":"1948","title":"V Kellems factory workers pay taxes she refused to withhold","excerpt":"she attacks law KELLEMS' WORKERS PAY; File Second Quarter Installments as Employer Scores Tax Law"},{"year":"1950","title":"resolution condemning propaganda offered by Chile, UN CHILE ASKS FREE PRESS","excerpt":"She Attacks War Prapaganda in New Propasal to U.N."},{"year":"1925","title":"Describes production of coffee in Colombia COLOMBIA'S PLACE IN COFFEE EXPORTS","excerpt":"She Attained Second Place With 130,000,000 Pounds Shipped Out in 1904."},{"year":"1931","title":"Mrs M Hicks killed in hold-up attempt, Sacramento SHOT KILLS WOMAN BANDIT.","excerpt":"She Attempted to Hold Up Gasoline Station in California."},{"year":"1960","title":"Taft, W H: beaten to death, Pasadena, apparently by wife","excerpt":"she attempts suicide AEROJET EXECUTIVE SLAIN IN CALIFORNIA"},{"year":"1950","title":"Angel Street: Actors Equity counsel clarifies role at arbitration hearing on L Day and R Aldrich contract dispute MISS BROWNSTEIN'S ROLE","excerpt":"She Attended Arbitration as Observer, Not Representative"},{"year":"1935","title":"Engaged to J Fargo MISS FARGO ENGAGED TO H.

Beloved wife of Takashi and mother of Hannah Meagan, age 15. Born November 1, 1954 in Atkinson, Nebraska, Maureen was the daughter of John and Dolores Keating, the second of eight children. A resident of Chappaqua, NY since 1997, Maureen lived in Tokyo (1991-1996) and Manhattan (1987-1991)","excerpt":"she attended secondary school in Atkinson, Nebraska and moved to Minnesota to attend St. Benedicts University in St. John. She earned a bachelors degree from Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas where she pursued a Master's degree in public Administration. Stricken as a toddler with a particularly severe strain of polio in 1956, Maureen developed an amazing ability to face hardship and triumph over adversity. She did not just deal with this lifelong disability, which worsened over time, she used it to propel herself and others forward--always with vigor, grace, dignity, a rapier wit and wicked sense of humor. Besides her family and her friends, her PASSION WAS POLITICS. Maureen, a lifelong active Democrat and fierce proponent of equal opportunity, was widely respected for her forcefulness and skill. A powerful change agent, she worked tirelessly for the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and witnessed the White House signing in 1988. While in Tokyo, as President of Democrats Abroad, she invigorated the party globally and was elected to attend the 1996 Democratic Convention in Chicago. Her skills as a political operative are widely valued and will be sorely missed in New York State. Maureen is survived by her husband Takashi and daughter Hannah of Chappaqua, parents John and Dolores Keating of Atkinson, Nebraska; mother-in-law Misuzu Tsuchiya of tokyo; Irish twin Mary Rose and husband Gene Schaaf of Bassett, Nebraska; brother Phillip of Omaha, Nebraska; brother Patrick and wife Eliza of Istanbul, Turkey; brother James and wife Natalie of Cody, Nebraska; brother Matthew and wife Jill of Kearney, Nebraska; brother Gerard and wife Janet of Geneva, Illinois; sister-in-law Kumi and husband Toshiyuki Misu of Tokyo; nieces, Sarah Schaaf, Yuria Misu, Kaitlin Keating, and Reese Keating; nephews Mark Schaaf, Andrew Schaaf, Ian Keating, Taiki Misu, Jake Keating, Zach Keating, Adam Keating, Alec Keating, Jack Keating and Dalton Keating; great-nephew Taylor Schaaf and great - niece Hailey Schaaf.

GARLICK ' /tIED UP:STATE","excerpt":"She Becomes ide of William Bogle'in Wappingers Falls Presbyterian Church"},{"year":"1921","title":"SOME of those who went to see William De Mille's production of \\"Miss Lulu Bett\\" at the Rivoli last week were agreeably surprised. Mr. De Mille's picturization of \\"What Every Woman Knows\\" had indicated that he was capable of transferring a novel or a play to the screen without doing violence to its story, and those known to be in the cast of \\"Miss Lulu Bett\\"—Lois Wilson, Theodore Roberts, Milton Sills and Ethel Wales, especially—had shown in previous pictures that they were competent players, so a reasonably faithful rendition of Miss Zona Gale's novel and play was expected, by the preferably optimistic at any rate. But no matter how faithful to its original a motion picture version of anything may be, if it is just that it can be only negatively good. No matter how well done it is, it remains a substitute, something offered in place of its original, and it possesses none of the vitality of its original. To achieve any degree of individual distinction, a photoplay must be pictorially dynamic, it must possess some cinematographic quality, not only to compensate for the absence of the spoken or written words that characterize the stage play or the novel, but to assume independent character on its own account.It was just this independent character that was not expected in the motion picture version of \\"Miss Lulu Bett,\\" because, as a rule, it is absent from screen adaptations. And it was because \\"Miss Lulu Bett\\" revealed this character to a considerable degree, or in many of its scenes, that it was agreeably surprising. Of course, it remains an adaptation, and is too dependent upon words to be called a complete motion picture production, but, compared with other photoplays as they come and go, it may be counted exceptionally cinematographic, and in a number of its scenes it is completely expressive by means of motion pictures alone. Thus it takes rank as an entertaining and significant screen work.Undoubtedly the greater share of credit for this should go to Mr. De Mille, for he, surely, was chiefly responsible for the expressive settings, the independent pantomime and the illuminating side-shots (such as that of the bugs in the kitchen sink when Lulu is away) which enrich the photoplay. He was aided, presumably, by Miss Clara Beranger, the scenarist, and others of his staff, but it was his own work as the director in charge that counted for most in the production of the picture, one imagines, and therefore \\"Miss Lulu Bett\\" is put down as one of the best things he has ever done.Still, it would not be what it is without the personality and performance of Lois Wilson in the title rôle. Miss Wilson has done noteworthy work on the screen in other pictures, her Maggie in \\"What Every Woman Knows\\" being an especially vivid characterization, but never before, it seems, has she been quite so clear and convincing as she is in the rôle of Lulu Bett. Avoiding the easy way of sentimental appeal, denying herself the theatrical effectiveness she might have obtained through illogical contrasts and violent action, she has put a true character on the screen by the accuracy of her appearance and the expressiveness of her pantomime. In other words, she acts the part","excerpt":"she becomes Lulu Bett for the time being, which is from the beginning to the end of the photoplay, and it may be noted that many actresses might have been Lulu Bett in the beginning but few of them would have remained Lulu Bett to the end, even, as Miss Alison Smith has pointed out, to the way she wears her hat in the final scene.The others in the cast are satisfactory. Theodore Roberts has been more eloquent than he is in the rôle of Dwight Deacon, but his performance is sufficiently effective, nevertheless, and Ethel Wales makes the old grandmother a definite, if somewhat broadly outlined, character. Milton Sills is agreeable, if rather general, as the school teacher, and there's no important fault to find with the work of Helen Ferguson, Mabel Van Buren, Clarence Burton, May Giraci, Taylor Graves and Charles Ogle, who have more or less to do with the telling of the story, which is too familiar, surely, to need detailing here.ONE of the regrets of the motion picture reviewer's life is that circumstances compel him to see so many photoplays that he doesn't want to see and to miss others that he would really like to look at. It is especially regrettable when conflicting engagements prevent his attending the exhibition of a worthwhile production, and this is the case with respect to the present writer and the Swedish Biograph Company's photoplay, \\"Sir Arne's Treasure.\\" This picture has been shown several times hereabout in recent weeks, and reports have indicated that it is a work of special merit, but the present writer has not yet found himself free to go to see it. There has been no account of it in these columns, therefore.Now, however, an account may be given, for Mrs. Frances Taylor Patterson, instructor in photoplay composition at Columbia University, having seen the picture and having noticed that it has not been reviewed here, has written concerning it, as follows:\\"The Swedish Biograph Company has produced a picture called 'Sir Arne's Treasure' which seems to me to be a revelation in motion picture production. Since it is based upon a story by Selma Lagerlof, it cannot be said to be a photoplay in the purest sense of the word—it was not composed in the language of the screen as were 'The Golem,' 'The Cabinet of Dr. Callgari' and 'Passion.' It is an adaptation rather than an original photoplay. Nevertheless, I have never seen a production which approaches more nearly to consummate art. Pictorial beauty, histrionic beauty and dramatic beauty are consistently sustained through all its scenes. The lights and shadows in some of the interiors are reminiscent of Rembrandt. This picture is fluid art. The scenes move with a smoothness and har mony of motion that are admirable. There is an air of quietude, of dignity in the sequence, with never a note of exaggeration, or of over-sustained repose. The characters are not puppets, no mere marionettes who dance as the director pulls the strings. They are living people; they are personalities created in pantomime, which is the language of the screen.\\"The play dramatizes the snowy wastes and icy fastnesses of the north country. The ice-locked firths and bays are used symbolically and bring about the unraveling of the plot. Beauty which we usually associate upon the screen with the scenics and nature pictures is here used to dramatic purpose. The play is frankly a tragedy built along the lines of the Greek tragedies, moving inevitably toward catastrophe. But the tragedy is logical; it satisfies our sense of dramatic justice. There could be no marriage between Elsa and Sir Halmar, who is the murderer of her little sister. Little Elsa, thrown over her lover's shoulder, receives the batonet thrusts of the men-at-arms and gives her life for her lover. But he, after his long vigils with her dead body in the hold of the ship, gives himself up, and the ice breaks and the bays and firths open wide to the sea.\\"The picture is a period picture set in a kingdom of the north 350 years ago. The attention to detail in settings, costumes, customs and properties is remarkable.\\"I first saw this picture at the Town Hall and was so struck with its beauty that I secured a print to exhibit and analyze before my classes in photoplay composition here at Columbia. A second viewing bears out the impression of the first. I have not seen the picture reviewed in your columns or elsewhere. In fear lest such outstanding artistry go unnoticed, I take this occasion to call the picture to your attention. It embodies the Swedish contribution to the gallery of Italian, German, French and Norwegian pictures now being exhibited in our theatres.\\" SCREEN; TWO CURRENT PICTURES"},{"year":"1936","title":"40th anniversary breakfast CHIROPEAN INSTALLS MRS.

The ship ordered by the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line was to have begun cruises in the Caribbean in May. The delay has forced Royal Caribbean to cancel its 1991 European cruise program to maintain its presence in the Caribbean and to Alaska and Mexico. It has also affected the traveling plans of thousands of people.   Damaged cabins on several decks in the forward third of the ship are being replaced at the yard, the Atlantique in St.-Nazaire, said a Royal Caribbean official. The bridge and part of the hull are also being repaired. At the time of the fire on Dec. 3, construction of the vessel had been substantially completed, and sea trials were to have begun Dec. 21.   Royal Caribbean's 1,000-passenger Song of Norway is remaining in San Juan, P.R., and continuing seven-night cruises to Barbados, until the Monarch of the Seas is ready to take over the route toward the end of the year. The Song of Norway was to have moved from San Juan to the West Coast in April to operate seven-night Alaska and Mexican Riviera cruises. The line's Sun Viking, which holds 728 passengers, was scheduled to cross the Atlantic in April to begin a season of cruises in Europe. She will now transfer instead to the West Coast to operate the Alaska and Mexico programs.    A spokesman for the cruise line said passengers had reservations for the Monarch for as far as a year beyond its originally scheduled maiden voyage from San Juan in May. Passengers who had reserved cabins are being offered cruises, often at discounted fares, on other Royal Caribbean ships or a cruise, at a reduced fare, on the Monarch in late 1991 or in 1992. The line hopes to resume operations in Europe next year.    The Monarch of the Seas is the second of three megaships ordered by Royal Caribbean. The first was the Sovereign of the Seas, delivered in 1988","excerpt":"she can carry about 2,500 passengers and does one-week Caribbean cruises from Miami.

They have their own inviolable truths: the lines of the foul lines in the late innings when the infielders have to protect against extra-base hits; the angles of the corners in the outfield when the outfielders, chasing a ball in the corner, are moving away from the infield, and away from their throwing strengths. Seeing her pictures, I think again of Roberto Clemente, and I understand why he was so brilliant, so quick, so powerful, so athletic that he could go against the angles into the right-field corner, away from his strength, but still spin and throw to the plate.

And as far as Metro has surpassed her surroundings (the ballroom set has already been advertised as considerably bigger than the one at Versailles) Norma Shearer has surpassed the Queen herself, whose tragic and ineffectual figure was probably not nearly so much the dramatic center of all stages, especially with old Louis XV and the du Barry still extant??? as Miss Shearer invariably contrives to be.To say that the Habsburg minx as Miss Shearer plays her is spotlighted would be to express it feebly","excerpt":"she casts so deep a shadow, not only over France and Europe but on the rest of the cast, that at times it is necessary to look again in order to verify their familiar visages. Even John Barrymore, skulking in the general penumbra of self-effacement, is hard to recognize as the brilliant and domineering old tyrant whose reign was a practical endorsement of his great-grandfather's much-plagiarized epigram: \\"I am the State!\\" Only Tyrone Power as the romantically rather far-fetched Count Axel de Fersen is permitted to approach the luminous bounds of that divinity which hedges the Shearer throne, and he does so timidly, with due deference, and with the tender consciousness not so much of love as of second-billing in his eyes.But after all, it's the queen's story (by Claudine West, Donald Ogden Stewart, Ernest Vajda and Stefan Zweig) and Miss Shearer seems to have been stuck with it as much as anybody. Her sincere efforts to breathe life into a weak script and to discount a marked unsubtlety of direction by personal histrionics are everywhere apparent, and it would not be fair to assume that any other screen actress could have made this particular Antoinette more real than she has done. She laughs, minces, coquettes, sheds tears and at last ages with such courageous thoroughness that after the rapid execution sequence it was only by a process of deductive reasoning that we managed to determine the startling fact that it must have been she. What more could any actress do?It was morally necessary to review Miss Shearer first; now, because it is frankly second in importance, let us consider the picture. Primarily, of course, it must be duly noted as a state occasion, with all the length and much of the solemnity of such affairs, and automatically listed as among the year's more impressive offerings. Expensiveness in itself is impressive, and besides being the product of much expense, study and sincere effort to reanimate a dead world, \\"Marie Antoinette\\" has one sequence, that of the flight to Varennes—the fore-doomed effort of the royal family to escape across country, disguised as travelers from Russia—which crackles with suspense, pity and terror. And the final, sentimental scenes in prison, except for one or two jarring notes like the Midwestern accent of the young Dauphin, are almost touching.As a whole, though, the script must be blamed for what, with the history of an era to draw from, is a surprising ineptitude of characterization. By whose authority do the authors treat a Barrymore (not to mention a Bourbon) like a nonentity? Dare to show us du Barry, the most amusing woman in France, as a middle-aged bore? Paint Louis XVI even blacker than history does as a neurotic imbecile, and force the conniving Duke of Orleans to appear as a roughed caricature of Joseph Schildkraut? As for Tyrone Power, frankly, we have a special crow to pick with Metro about him. We accept the Swedish Count Axel de Fersen; we don't even contest his authenticity as the only romantic interest in the Queen's life, but for Mr. Power, we want to see documents.

(Knopf, $25.) A satirical but often touching Russian novel whose indomitable heroine, Aglaya Revkina, an ancient, irreformable Stalinist, loathes the wimps and consumers who wrecked Communism","excerpt":"she cherishes a discarded statue of Stalin in her apartment for 40 years.    ORDINARY WOLVES, by Seth Kantner. (Milkweed, $22.) A smart, authentic first novel by a writer born and raised in Alaska; its hero, Cutuk Hawcly, is dragged to Alaska by a Luddite father who mixes ecological concerns and Eskimo values as he raises his children in a kind of bunker miles to the north of civilization.    SERIOUSLY, by Lucia Nevai. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) This assured first novel lands its yearning young heroine, Tamara, in upstate New York, rebounding from a life deranged by her crazy mother, who burned the house down and with it herself and Tamara's father and younger sister. Her story unfolds episodically, building toward a moment that finds her surrounded by admirers and ex-lovers.    THE PERSISTENCE OF MEMORY, by Tony Eprile. (Norton, $24.95.) Part fable, part coming-of-age story, Eprile's first novel concerns Paul Sweetbread, a burdened, divided South African Jew with something of a crush on the great blond Afrikaner brutes who served with him in his country's endless, unforgettable ''Border War'' in Namibia and Angola.    PUBLIC ENEMIES: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34, by Bryan Burrough. (Penguin Press, $29.95.) A colorful history of the mobile, heavily armed, self-glamorizing desperadoes called forth by the Depression and of the government's response, organized by the rigid, brilliant, incorruptible and ultimately creepy J. Edgar Hoover.    JEROME ROBBINS: His Life, His Theater, His Dance, by Deborah Jowitt. (Simon & Schuster, $40.) A grand survey of the great and deservedly popular choreographer of ballet and Broadway, as well as a personal examination of a radically unhappy man; at 57 he could call himself ''a Jewish ex-commie fag who had to go into a mental hospital.''    THE MISSING PEACE: The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace, by Dennis Ross. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $35.) A virtual encyclopedia of the ''peace process'' as seen by the special envoy who was the central figure in American Middle East policies for 12 years under two presidents, Clinton and the first Bush. In the end, he blames Yasir Arafat as one principal cause of the failure so far; the other, he says, has been the unwillingness of either side to grasp the needs of the other.    THE AMERICANIZATION OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, by Gordon S. Wood. (Penguin Press, $25.95.) An engaging study of the most engaging founder, a practical activist who founded the library, fire company, insurance company, hospital and university in Philadelphia, but also a flirtatious rogue who spent 25 of his last 33 years being wined, dined and celebrated in Europe, especially in Paris.

She won't ignore the arrangements of premise, conclusion. She says never dismiss the talk of the tune. Every singsong she treats as a crowd of words, and she is vigilant, gulping, ready for trouble.

What is needed in response to the devastation wreaked by AIDS, Mr. Watney says, is \\"a symbolic language appropriate to our losses, and Bleckner has provided us with one.\\" Many of the artworks reproduced in the book display that language, while some also reveal what Thomas Crow, an art historian at the University of Sussex, calls in another essay Mr. Bleckner's \\"friendliness to emblems of sentiment.\\" Another profound influence on Mr. Bleckner's work is photography, and Mr. Crow offers a fascinating discussion of, among other things, the controversial correspondence between the glossy surfaces of Mr. Bleckner's paintings and the coating on photographic prints -- a relationship that, he suggests, offends some purists. Lisa Dennison, the curator of collections and exhibitions at the Guggenheim Museum, cites the significant role Mr. Bleckner has played in re-establishing the canvas as a space for portraying images of light. Noting the many influences on Mr. Bleckner, Ms. Dennison finds that the memento mori iconography prevalent in so many of his paintings \\"provokes associations of nostalgia, melancholy, remembrance, loss and, most explicitly, death\\"","excerpt":"she connects Mr. Bleckner's imagery with that of such fin-de-siecle Symbolists as Gustave Moreau and Odilon Redon.

(Random House, $23.95.) A gifted journalist's elegant excursion through and around Chekhov, finding ''wild and strange'' objects in his stories where others have often sighted only delicacy, modesty and candid, well-behaved shades of gray.    LONDON: The Biography, by Peter Ackroyd. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $45.) A prodigiously researched history that is neither top-down nor bottom-up but cross-sectional: shunning traditional chronology and players (aristocrats are scarce), Ackroyd instead offers a London defined by a set of recurring motifs -- smell, sound, speech, fog, fire, ghosts and plague are a few of them.    NEW AND COLLECTED POEMS: 1931-2001, by Czeslaw Milosz. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $45.) In the winter of his 70-year career, Milosz appears to be locked in insoluble argument with himself: where he once credited poetry with the power to rescue mankind from the void, he now demurs, maintaining that language is inadequate to the task of capturing verity. But if that is so, is not his latest assertion itself suspect?    THE DIARIES OF KENNETH TYNAN, edited by John Lahr. (Bloomsbury, $32.95.) Notes from the final decade of a scintillating British journalist (chief theater critic of The New Yorker, 1958-60) who loved show business and every other form of exhibitionism but subsided into disappointment, illness and melancholy before his death at 53 in 1980.    WHY DID I EVER, by Mary Robison. (Counterpoint, $23.) In Robison's first novel for a decade, Monica Breton has three ex-husbands she can't quite remember and two children she loves immensely but can't figure out how to help","excerpt":"she defends herself, painfully, with wit and irony, Ritalin and lots of rules for living.    AUSTERLITZ, by W. G. Sebald. (Random House, $25.95.) A middle-aged Welsh architectural historian discovers that he is really the son of Holocaust victims from Czechoslovakia in this rich, gloomy novel by a writer who has specialized in characters crippled by the past.    COLLECTED STORIES, by Saul Bellow. (Viking, $30.) Though most of these 13 stories already appear in other Bellow collections, this batch offers a worthy immersion in his shorter fiction, which works just like his longer fiction: things happen, people think about them, then (often with a burst of unexpected clarity) the fun takes over.    THE FEAST OF THE GOAT, by Mario Vargas Llosa. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) The suspense in this novel starring Gen. Rafael Trujillo, dictator of the Dominican Republic for 30 years, comes from wondering which of the book's nightmare characters will succeed him.    HATESHIP, FRIENDSHIP, COURTSHIP, LOVESHIP, MARRIAGE: Stories, by Alice Munro. (Knopf, $24.) Things may be bad for the people in Munro's stories, but they test what can be said in favor of life in dire circumstances, not by comforting or defiant formulations but by attending for whatever may come up in the way of a favorable sign.

MISS KELLER FINDS A 'FLAW' IN SHAW"},{"year":"1932","title":"There is nothing in \\"The Wiser Sex,\\" the present picture at the Paramount, that recalls in the remotest way the clever writing of Clyde Fitch, and yet this film story is said to be an adaptation of his play, \\"Her Confessions.\\" The introductory scenes rather lead one to expect a narrative inspired by Samuel Seabury's recent activities in connection with the Hofstadter legislative committee, but soon it developes into a somewhat clumsy melodrama, with dialogue that is beyond even the ken of the competent cast to make effective.Melvyn Douglas impersonates David Rolfe, a brilliant young lawyer who is bent on cleaning up this city. He announces that he has no political aspirations, but that he wants to rid the metropolis of gangsters and racketeers. Rolfe is elated at capturing Benny Morgan, an underling of Harry Evans, the leading malefactor. This gangster chieftain keeps track of Rolfe's movements and when he hears that the special investigator has gone to Long Island to visit friends, he puts his most reliable men on his track. The idea of having a big truck run Rolfe down while in his car fails. In subsequent proceedings it seems as though Rolfe had to do something silly, so as to inject some excitement into the picture.The blond Lilyan Tashman impersonates Claire Foster, Evans's wife without benefit of clergy. She employs her wiles to lure men into Evans's gambling rooms and prevails upon them to risk their money. One of her victims is Rolfe's cousin, Phil Long, who looks upon Claire as a sort of Rebecca of Sunnybrook. This dense Mr. Long cannot imagine Claire doing wrong, let alone living with one of the city's principal criminals. When his eyes are opened he goes forth to kill Evans, but through a convenient but far from convincing twist of affairs, Long is killed and Evans is only winged.Rolfe decides to look up Long, and as he happens to enter the apartment immediately after the shooting, Claire takes advantage of his presence to call up police headquarters, with the consequence that the man who was eager to clean up the big city finds himself behind bars accused of murdering his cousin. Things look dark for him during the trial until Margaret Hughes, played by Claudette Colbert, assumes charge of affairs and poses as a gay young person, similar to Claire","excerpt":"she discovers what's what, and, as one anticipates, Rolfe and Margaret are in each other's arms in the final fade-out.Some astonishing liberties are taken with legal procedure, and in one instance one would imagine that there was nothing serious going on, so happy are Rolfe and Margaret. But it chances that Rolfe's life is in jeopardy at the time of the interview and embrace. They are cool customers, these lovers in film melodramas.Miss Colbert is charming, but often she might have been photographed to better advantage. Mr. Douglas does all that is humanly possible with his part, and Lilyan Tashman is, as usual, capable in her artificial rôle. William Boyd is another stanch supporter of this production.Pola Negri is appearing on the stage in a sketch by Jack Lait. This offering is called \\"So This Is Love,\\" and during it Miss Negri, arrayed in a white satin skirt and red velvet coat, sings the same song she rendered in her film, \\"A Woman Commands.\\" Melvyn Douglas and Claudette Colbert in a Melodrama of Gangsters and the Inevitable Romance."},{"year":"2000","title":"Public Lives column profiles career of former singer Ronnie Spector Greenfield","excerpt":"she discusses 13-year lawsuit over royalties from songs she recorded that has been resolved in her favor; photo (M) Ronnie Spector, Just Walking in a Rainbow"},{"year":"1934","title":"Int on radio MARY PICKFORD TURNS TO RADIO","excerpt":"She Discusses a New Art And Hopes Television Will Hurry"},{"year":"2003","title":"Michael Kimmelman article on accompanying legendary former art dealer Virginia Dwan on visit to Beacon, NY, where Dia is opening new museum of works by many artists once featured at Dwan's galleries","excerpt":"she discusses art, her galleries, which closed in 1971, and her current interests; photos (L) The Forgotten Godmother Of Dia's Artists"},{"year":"1999","title":"Public Lives column profiles Fraidy M Aber, program director of Hudson River Trust","excerpt":"she discusses becoming advocate for swimming in river; photo (M) A River Swim, Anyone?

Together with some other girls, she is in the care of the Red Cross lady, and a new life is about to begin for her, a French life. This is only right and proper, for, despite her German-sounding name, Frida herself is French. Was she not born at the Hotel-Dieu in Paris? Does she not speak French without an accent? Yet because of some madness characteristic of the grown-up world, she has been living in the Rue des Jardins Saint-Paul, a street of ''disgusting'' refugees, where even her mother speaks a strange tongue called Yiddish. Frida has blond curls and blue eyes. She is 6 years old. But the year is 1942, and Frida is Jewish. The train gathers speed, and soon the outskirts of Paris are left behind. She takes her doll from its ''carriage'' and throws the old shoe box away. Everyone here is French. No one must be given cause to laugh at her.

Roundabout's revival of Somerset Maugham's comedy of manners stars Kate Burton and Lynn Redgrave (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300.    'DRUMSTRUCK' Opens June 16. . The gimmick of this new spin on ''Stomp,'' which includes 11 percussionists from West and South Africa, is that every audience member plays his or her own drum during the show.

A bittersweet comedy about six lonely Londoners trying to connect (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street (212) 279-4200.    Broadway    'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and on-stage alterego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising soufflé of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:45)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary, sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE ARGUMENT' Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of the post-9/11 play ''Omnium Gatherum,'' aims to personalize another hot-button issue here, but it's not likely that any serious thought, old or new, is going to be provoked by this whiny debate between two uninteresting types about the ever-sensitive topic of abortion. He wants the baby","excerpt":"she doesn't. It is hard to care (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212)353-0303. (Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the mass killings of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'BFE' Julia Cho's insightful drama about the agonies and comforts of isolation centers around a 14-year-old Asian-American girl (Olivia Oguma) who feels she isn't beautiful. The main characters force themselves to reach out to others, but all fail in some essential way (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Anita Gates)    'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, child-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Miriam Horn)    'FLIGHT: THE RISE AND FALL OF CHARLES LINDBERGH' Garth Wingfield's droning bio-play transforms Charles Lindbergh's journey from tickertape hero to disgraced Nazi sympathizer into a sort of talking newspaper, minus op-ed pages, lively writing and the weather report. With Gregg Edelman playing the everyman pilot turned celebrity, and Brian D'Arcy James on hand to personify a series of slimy reporters (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)    * 'HOWIE THE ROOKIE' Mark O'Rowe's blood-and-guts-filled comic yarn, which features two baroque monologues climaxing in sudden, irresistible bursts of mayhem, tells a gangland story set in working-class Dublin. Despite being overproduced, the play packs a wallop (1:50). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444.(Jason Zinoman)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Reopening Thursday at the Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200.(Neil Genzlinger)    'MISS JULIE' Anders Cato directs a new adaptation by Craig Lucas. Marin Hinkle, as Miss Julie, and Reg Rogers, as her father's uppity valet Jean, spar and flirt, humiliate each other and humble themselves as expected, in the traditional kitchen, with the designated disastrous results. Chances are you won't believe a word of it (1:35). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs. Oliver Goldsmith's 1773 comedy mocks the snobbery of the London upper class, while piling on the slapstick, mistaken identities and farce Irish (2:30). Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Slight but pithy, this humorous revue of 18 songs with lyrics by Mark Campbell and music by 18 different composers takes a sardonic and explicit look at gay life in New York: ''Sex with an actor. What was I thinking?'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. In repertory with ''Score.'' (Anne Midgette)    'TABLOID CALIGULA' Three excellent performances set off Darren Murphy's dark comedy, about a London thug hooked on Alexander the Great, in which the author has a lot of fun with language and the art of storytelling (1:30). Part of the Brits Off Broadway festival at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200.(Andrea Stevens)    'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Preyskyakov brothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Citigroup Center, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444.(Genzlinger)    'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters, affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, (212)239-6200. (Gates)    'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'DAY IN THE LIFE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE' Talent and passion are overcome by banality in the first musical by the Broadway actor Josh Walden, who wrote the music, book and lyrics, choreographed the show, and directed. While the music and dance show occasional flair, the same cannot be said of the lyrics or book, a clichéd exhuming of the secrets behind 1950's facades (1:00) . Flamboyan Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4080. (Horn)    'KNOCK ON WOOD' Thanks to Steven Spielberg and Bob Dole, the bar is fairly high these days for war stories, and Samuel Calderon comes nowhere near clearing it with ''Knock on Wood,'' a monologue about his perfectly ordinary service in the Israeli military during the Yom Kippur War. He sees a few moderately distressing sights, his friend is injured, and that's about it (1:30). 13th Street Repertory, 50 West 13th Street, (212)352-3101. (Genzlinger)    'MARATHON 2005, SERIES A' A long, too often dreary evening of plays by a pair of Tony winners, John Guare and Warren Leight, and a pair of actress-playwrights, Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros and Leslie Lyles. Ms. Gersten-Vassilaros contribution, ''The Airport Play,'' is the briefest and, perhaps not coincidentally, the best of the bunch (2:15). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, (212)352-3101 (Isherwood)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street , (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100.

(Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'HENRY FLAMETHROWA' John Belluso's timely drama about a girl in a coma who may or may not heal the sick engages the issues raised during the Terri Schiavo media circus. It's a thought-provoking play (starring Tim Daly), but unfortunately, there are no characters in it you can believe in. Loosely based on a true story, this timely drama is about a girl who has been in a coma for several years and her brother who plans to disconnect her breathing ventilator and allow her to die (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)    'IVANOV' Jonathan Banks staging of the Chekhov classic Ivanov with the National Asian-American Theater Company has an impressively consistent tone, notwithstanding some needless mood music. Not all the acting rises to the level of Joel de la Fuente, who is marvelous in the lead role, but enough does to make the show well worth seeing (2:30). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 17 Lexington Avenue, at 23rd street, (646)312-4085, closing tomorrow. (Jonathan Kalb)    'THE MAIDS' It is no small feat to find the chill in Jean Genet's 1947 play about two maids who fantasize about killing their boss, but Jean Cocteau Repertory manages it. Credit an eye-opening performance by Amanda Jones as Solange, the dominant of the pair (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'MORTAL LADIES POSSESSED' Linda Marlowe's admirable but difficult one-woman show is based on a 1974 collection of Tennessee Williams's short stories. The adaptation is sometimes awkward and the transitions hard to follow, but she captures the characters' pathos and fragility nicely (1:20). 59E59Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Gates)    * 'THE PASSION OF THE CRAWFORD' For his slight but still tasty new show, John Epperson has decided to allow his voiceless alter ego, Lypsinka, to commune intimately and at length with one of her spiritual forebears, Joan Crawford. The centerpiece is a pointed but never vicious re-creation, or rather an interpretation, of a live interview Crawford gave at Town Hall in 1973 (1:30). Zipper, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'THE PULL OF NEGATIVE GRAVITY' A Welsh man with no seeming interest in politics is badly injured in the Iraq war and discovers that returning home will not be so easy. In this bruising, intimate and overly familiar play, which is part of the Brits Off Broadway festival, Jonathan Lichtenstein beautifully portrays how the war destroyed one rural family (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    'SCORE' The subject of this one-man show is Leonard Bernstein and music, and the performer, Tom Nelis, and the director, Anne Bogart, ''get'' Lenny -- now brilliant, now flamboyant, now superficial, now physically responding to recorded music (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200, closing on Thursday. The show is in repertory with ''Songs From an Unmade Bed.'' (Midgette)    'UNCLE JIMMY'S DIRTY BASEMENT' This strange brew of Catskills humor, heavy metal and filthy-minded puppets has developed a cult following downtown, and its bizarre band rocks out to some of the most bombastically silly songs since Spinal Tap's ''Big Bottom.'' But when the music stops, the show meanders without an involving story (1:15). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, (212)477-5288, closing tomorrow.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (Not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali) A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)    'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish) This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)    'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    'DOMINION PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST' (R, 115 minutes) The solemn, high-minded attempt to redeem ''The Exorcist'' franchise is the movie equivalent of retrieving the eggshells, coffee grounds and banana peels from the trash and presenting them as art; the ingredients still stink. (Holden)    * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'THE HOLY GIRL' (Not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)    'HOUSE OF WAX' (R, 105 minutes) Not the depilatory sequel to ''Beauty Shop,'' but rather a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price creep show, with Paris Hilton, Elisha Cuthbert and a bunch of guys menaced by maniacs in the Louisiana backwoods. Grisly and slow. (Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy, and Robert Duvall (as the father of Mr. Ferrell's character and a rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson, you'll win big, anyway. (Scott)    'KINGDOM OF HEAVEN' (R, 145 minutes) A plaintive period epic from Ridley Scott, starring Orlando Bloom, about the bloody orgies of piety known as the Crusades. The film proves yet again that it takes an actor as self-serious as Russell Crowe to carry the weight of Mr. Scott's ambitions; it also takes a story Mr. Scott himself can really believe in. (Dargis)    * 'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) A film about a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)    'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese) This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    'THE LONGEST YARD' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In this crummy remake of the 1974 film of the same title, Adam Sandler stars as the former N.F.L. quarterback Paul Crewe, who years earlier was booted out of the league for shaving points and is now charged with leading a team of prisoners against a team of guards. In the original film, directed with seriocomic facility by Robert Aldrich, Crewe was played by Burt Reynolds with effortless charm and the tightest pants this side of Tony Orlando. The Aldrich version was recently released on DVD and makes for a nice evening in. (Dargis)    * 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French) A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)    'MADAGASCAR' (PG, 86 minutes) Like many computer-animated features, this one, about four celebrity-voiced animals exiled from the Central Park Zoo -- expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals. These, in the end, are not enough to compensate for the lack of interesting narrative, real characters or jokes on subjects other than flatulence, excrement and contemporary pop culture. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)    * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'THE NINTH DAY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in German) A somber, thought-provoking moral thriller, in which a Roman Catholic priest from Luxembourg, temporarily released from Dachau, finds his conscience tested when the Nazis try to co-opt him. Interesting ideas, insufficiently dramatized. (Scott)    'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'PALINDROMES' (Not rated, 100 minutes) The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)    'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes) This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)    'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes) It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)    'SAVING FACE' (R, 91 minutes) The amiable romantic comedy examines the lives of three generations of Chinese-Americans living in New York exudes a palpable love for its characters but ends up betraying its hard-headedness with instant, feel-good solutions to their problems. (Holden)    'SEQUINS' (No rating, 88 minutes, in French) In this decorous trifle from France, the young actress Lola Naymark stares into space with moist, empty eyes, tossing her red hair like a pony fretfully swishing away late-summer flies. Ms. Naymark's enviable hair, with its springy curls and poetically inflamed color, accounts for much of this film's visual enchantment and interest. (Dargis)    'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes) Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame that the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)    * 'STAR WARS III: REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    'WALK ON WATER' (Not rated, 104 minutes) The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Dana Stevens)    'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (Not rated, 45 minutes) A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Kids will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful by this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity. (Ned Martel)    Film Series    AWARD-WINNING ART/FOREIGN FILMS+ FESTIVAL (Through June 30) ''Or (My Treasure),'' an Israeli drama that won the Camera d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, plays tonight through Tuesday at Makor/92nd Street Y.

(Sinagra)    THE CORAL (Thursday) This British band's psychedelic pop has yet to find the glorious meeting of newfound structure and early chaos it would need to take listeners by storm. Still, the amiable lads seem to be gesturing toward trendy punk-disco these days, which isn't a bad move . 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $16, $18 at the door. (Sinagra)    COWBOY JUNKIES (Tomorrow) Nearing the 20-year mark, this soporific alt-country group nurtures a base of vaguely alienatied yuppy fans still intrigued by the band's relatively safe journey to country's dark side, and the sibling tension between its singer, Margo Timmins, and her guitarist and songwriter brother, Michael. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, (212)777-6800, $35. (Sinagra)    ROBERT CRAY BAND AND MARCIA BALL AND JEREMIAH LOCKWOOD ((Tonight) Robert Cray, who brings convincing passion to songs about a tortured conscience, meshes blues with Memphis soul.

(Pareles)    DICK DALE (Tomorrow) Dick Dale, king of the surf guitar, provides no polite nostalgia trip to the mid-1960's. He's out to summon elemental forces with the stomping beat of his band and his heavily reverbed, brusquely attacked guitar lines, along with the dive-bombing, tremolo glissandos that literally melt his guitar picks from the heat of their friction on the strings. 7 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144, $20.50, $25.50 at the door.

(Pareles)    ELECTRELANE (Tonight) The spacey European art-pop favored by this British band, played on vintage analog equipment and influenced by 1970's German electronic rock, hasn't been in vogue since the late 90's, but the group plays it with verve, often subverting its music's sheen with messy garage-rock heft. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, $15. (Sinagra)    JOHN FOGERTY (Wednesday) The Creedence Clearwater Revival's songwriter, guitarist and singer's wild-eyed wail and the distilled twang of his guitar remain undiminished, the sound of a mythic backwoods Southland where barefoot girls dance in the moonlight. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, (212)777-6800, $75. (Pareles)    THE FUTUREHEADS, HIGH SPEED SCENE, PITTY SING (Monday) Vying with Bloc Party for the mantle of least derivative dance-punk revival band, the Futureheads' reverence for the music of polestars like XTC and Wire extends beyond sonic mimicry, adding nuance to pro forma punk panic. 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $20. (Sinagra)    THE FUNKY METERS (Tonight and Thursday) The Funky Meters include Art Neville on keyboards and George Porter Jr. on bass from the Meters, the band that was the cornerstone of New Orleans funk.

(Sinagra)    GRÁDA (Wednesday) Though they play their guitars, fiddles, flutes and bodhrans in the traditional Celtic style, this young Dublin group has set itself apart by composing original music, innovating on Irish, Breton and Eastern Eurpoean styes while staying recognizably within the forms. 7:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26 Street,Chelsea, (212)576-1155, $15, $18 at the door.

(Pareles)    JURASSIC 5 (Tuesday) Reaching back to rap's old school era of simple funky beats and sing-along choruses, this nostalgic California group was popular in the late-90's when hip-hop fans tired of Puff Daddy's sampling of whole songs and mainstream rap's increasingly money-grubbing aesthetic. 11 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $25.50, $27 at the door. (Sinagra)    KEANE AND REGINA SPEKTOR (Tuesday) Keane is a piano-drums-vocals band that piles on one hooky melodic flourish after another as if to distance ifself from the artiness of its main influence, Radiohead. The music of the bill's opener, The Russian-born singer-pianist Regina Spektor, goes down less smoothly, bringing punk immediacy into a caberet setting, reveling in knotty rhymes and unhinged melodrama. 7:30 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, (212)465-6741, $39.50 and $29.50. (Sinagra)    KEREN ANN (Thursday) This Dutch-Javanese, Russian-Israeli chanteuse Keren Ann applies her velvety voice to jazz-inflected, rainy day urban valentines.

(Sinagra)    THE KILLERS, LOUIS XIV (Tomorrow) Maybe it's their Las Vegas roots, maybe it's the singer Brendan Flowers' glam charisma or maybe its their simple nostalgic perference for the MTV version of the 80's over their peers' more complicated recollections. Whatever the reason, the Killers are the pop smash of the neo-New Wave boomlet. 5:30 p.m., Central Park Summerstage, $32.50, $35.

(Sinagra)    LOSERS LOUNGE: THE CURE VS THE SMITHS (Tonight and Tomorrow) A true treasure, the city's tireless pop tribute outfit takes advantage of the current post-punk revival and ongoing adoration of the mope-rock heros Morrissey and Robert Smith, both of whom offer endless options for loving parody and stylistic license. 8 p.m. and 11 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132, $17, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    LUCERO (Tuesday) The Arkansan Jim Nichols's convincingly weathered singing, an earthy growl that fits nicely in the groove of his band's wistful, ragged road rock. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, $13, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)    STEPHEN MALKMUS (Tuesday) The abstract poetic songwriting and quirky, blazing guitar work of the former Pavement frontman are still worth checking out. Recent work has increasingly seemed geared for cultists, while moving closer to universal topics like family, aging and commitment. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, East Village, (212)777-6800, $22.50, $25 at the door.

The clever Philadelphia hip-hop producer Diplo is responsible for her popular underground mix ''Piracy Funds Terrorism'' (Hollertronix), which lays her vocals on music as diverse as 80's new wave and Brazillian baille funk. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, South Village, (212)243-4940, $20. Sold out.

(Pareles)    TRAVIS MORRISON (Sunday) This singer-guitarist's former band, the Dismemberment Plan, played virtuoso fusion-rock. Its transcendent quality was the anguished, cutesy break-up lyrics, written and sung, by Mr. Morrison. Though artier and more pretentious on his own, he manages to remain winsome. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $10. (Sinagra)    STEVIE NICKS AND DON HENLEY (Tomorrow) Most will come out to this show to see the Fleetwood Mac star Stevie Nicks, who continues to fascinate though her vocal range has narrowed, edging those rich lows into raspier territory. One assumes that she and Don Henley of Eagles fame will perform their hit 80's duet ''Leather and Lace.'' 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., Garden State Parkway Exit 116, (732)335-0400, $26 to $126.

(Sinagra)    GRAHAM PARKER & THE FIGGS (Tonight) Emerging from England just before the arrival of punk-rock, Graham Parker used the sturdy structures of soul and 1960's rock as he spat out angry, articulate songs that chafed against dishonesties large and small.

(Pareles)    SAM PREKOP (Tonight) One of the Chicago musicians who pioneered mid-90's jazz and electroinc post-rock music, the singer and guitarist Prekop is a smooth, if overly genteel singer, and fluid player.

(Sinagra)    IKE REILLY (Sunday) This St. Paul rocker's visceral, outlandishly catchy 2001 album, ''Salesman and Racists'' (Universal), captured a certain kind of in-the-cups cockiness and bar-clown wit that almost made the listener overlook its macho nudges and winks. Mr. Reilly and his band tear it up live. 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $10. (Sinagra)    DUKE ROBILLARD (Tomorrow) Duke Robillard, a guitarist and singer, founded Roomful of Blues in 1967, and in his solo career since leaving the band he hasn't forgotten the suave swing of vintage jump blues; he also played lead guitar on Bob Dylan's album ''Time Out of Mind.'' 7:30; Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 576-1155, $18, $22 tomorrow.

(Pareles)    SPOON, THE CLIENTELE (Wednesday and Thursday) The Austin indie standout Brit Daniels's latest album, ''Gimme Fiction'' (Merge), is a tougher nut to crack than 2002's nearly flawless jitter-rock ''Kill the Moonlight'' (Merge), but live his tight group listens to each other, as the vibe swings from slacker angst to caffeinated bravado. 7 p.m., Webster Hall,125 East 11th Street, East Village, (917)577-2499, $18, $20 at the door.

''Koyaanisqatsi'' (''Life Out of Balance'') was performed yesterday, but ''Naqoyqatsi'' (''Life as War'') is to be shown tonight and ''Powaqqatsi'' (''Life in Transformation'') concludes the cycle (albeit out of order) tomorrow.

Oestreich)    LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and Sunday) Avery Fisher Hall may seem a bit of a comedown for the proud residents of the acclaimed Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, but Esa-Pekka Salonen and the orchestra will presumably cope gamely in two programs of works by Ravel, Mussorgsky, Ives, Shostakovich and John Adams.

This weekend, it's Schubert's much-admired ''Trout'' Quintet and a Sextet by Krzysztof Penderecki. 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330, $28. (Eichler)    GEORGE PERLE'S 90TH BIRTHDAY CONCERT (Tuesday) Those who assume that music steeped in 12-tone technique is by definition complex and forbidding should listen to the bracing and witty works of George Perle, whose 90th birthday will be celebrated in a concert by a stellar group of musicians, including the pianist Horacio Gutiérrez, the violinist Curtis Macomber and the soprano Lucy Shelton. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330, $25; $10 for students. (Tommasini)    RIVERSIDE SYMPHONY (Thursday) You can usually count on the Riverside Symphony to present involving performances of adventurous programs, and this program looks to be no exception. Haydn's ebullient Piano Concerto No. 4 in G is paired with a Neo-Classical contemporary work that looks back to Haydn: Honegger's Concertino for Piano and Orchestra. Shai Wosner is the soloist. The New York premiere of David Crumb's ''Vestiges of a Distant Time'' and Mendelssohn's ''Italian'' Symphony frame the program.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizzazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)    * GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)    * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ALL THE MIGHTY WORLD,' through Aug. 21. In one of the medium's shortest great careers, Roger Fenton helped establish photography as both an art and a profession in masterfully composed landscapes, portraits and still lifes that, for all their prescience, also express a profound ambivalence about the very notion of progress Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Smith)    MET: 'MAX ERNST,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)     MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)    * MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'EL BARRIO,' through June 12. A snapshot of El Barrio -- East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem -- as seen through archival images and pictures by the contemporary photographer Hiram S. Maristany taken at a revolutionary political moment in the 1960's and early 70's. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'CHRIS MARKER,' through June 13. Made entirely on the computer, ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' -- a two-channel, eight-screen DVD with which this French underground film legend makes his New York debut as an installation artist -- gives the horrors of World War I an eroded beauty and haunting pertinence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Smith)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Michael Kimmelman)    * QUEEN SOFíA SPANISH INSTITUTE: 'FROM GOYA TO SOROLLA,' through July 30. More than 75 pictures from the Hispanic Society, celebrating its centenary; starting with Goya's grave portrait of Pedro Mocarte, they track an arc to figures like Francisco Núñez Losada and salon virtuosi like Ignacio Zuloaga and Joaquín Sorolla. 684 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)628-0420. (Kimmelman)    STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI: 'AFRO-MUSES,' through July 3. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Kimmelman)    * STUDIO MUSEUM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art or music that this country has produced. (See above.) (Smith)    UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    WHITNEY AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, the artist's ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    ANTHONY CARO Four tabletop pieces from the 1970's and 80's, masterly exercises in balletic form and balance in rusting steel, by this reigning British standard-bearer of modernist abstract sculpture. They are elegant and a serious pleasure. Mitchell-Inness & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, through June 11. (Kimmelman)    GEORGE CONDO His latest sculptures are gnarly heads and busts, vehemently modeled in clay and cast in gaudy gold bronze, that bring the droll nastiness and lush physicality of his more satirical paintings fully into three dimensions. Skarstedt Fine Art, 980 Madison near 78th Street, (212)737-2060, through June 10. (Smith)    HUBERTUS GOJOWCZYK: 'THE BOOK AS OBJECT' If Joseph Cornell had been a librarian, he might have produced sculptures like the fantastically altered books that this Polish artist creates. Glass eyes stare out from the pages of one old tome; the corner of another morphs into a waxy brain. Achim Moeller, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through June 24. (Johnson)    * RICHARD WATHEN A young British artist plugs some 21st-century energy into 18th-century portraiture, painting with a matte, flat delicacy that gives familiar poses a new-born freshness, and not only when clothing is subtracted. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through June 16. (Smith)    Galleries: 57th Street    DON COLLEY: 'FALL GUYS & ZEITGEISTS' Whether or not you like his images of thuggish clowns and romantic skies, you have to admit that Mr. Colley's new pieces are technically remarkable. They appear to be small, beautifully worked encaustic paintings, but they are, in fact, kiln-fired glazed ceramic tiles. George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212)644-5665, through June. (Johnson)    EMILY NELLIGAN AND MARVIN BILECK: 'CRANBERRY ISLAND, DRAWINGS AND PRINTS' Using only charcoal and eraser on ordinary letter paper, Emily Nelligan has for more than 50 years focused on a tiny part of Maine called Great Cranberry Island, one of several specks off the coast near Mount Desert. Restricting her palette to reticent blacks, whites and grays, she conveys the spirit, changes and constancies of a pure, unsullied wilderness. Marvin Bileck, her husband, has concentrated on the island's factual here-and-nowness, rendering piled-up rocks, tangles of trees, deep woods and their tweakings by nature in meticulous drawings and etchings. She's a wizard at mood, he's a master of specifics. Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212)755-2828, through June 17. (Glueck)    Galleries: Chelsea    DEAN BYINGTON Skillfully blending the handmade and the mechanical, the paintings of this San Francisco artist use patterns suggestive of lacy wallpaper and images from 19th-century engravings to evoke landscapes and their not always peaceful inhabitants. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)255-8450, through June 18. (Smith)    SOPHIE CALLE: 'EXQUISITE PAIN' Ms. Calle's complicated, two-part installation telling the story of the painful end of a love affair in words and pictures is absorbing but her programmatic intellectualism muffles the emotional dimension. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212)255-1105, through June 25. (Johnson)    ROBBERT FLICK: 'TRAJECTORIES' With the cinematic idea that successive views give a dynamic sense of place, Mr. Flick mounted a video camera in his car window. He packs the results in grid formation on big sheets that give off the vibes of a country road, a city street, a desertscape. The whole is more than the sum of its tiny parts. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)989-7600, through June 18. (Glueck)    NEETA MADAHAR Large, handsome, eerily unreal color photographs of real birds attracted to a free-form grid of tree branches by a shifting cast of birdfeeders. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through June 11. (Smith)    RICHARD PRINCE A well-chosen assortment of works from the past 25 years by the influential Neo-Pop semiotician includes joke paintings, car hood sculptures and photographs of scruffy upstate New York landscapes. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through June 18. (Johnson)    'SCULPTURE' This judicious small selection of three-dimensional works includes a rustic dream house by Vito Acconci; videos showing through an antique Asian iron gate by Nam June Paik; big, smooth white birds by Hiraki Sawa; and an amazing, life-size stainless steel tree by Roxy Paine. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through June 25. (Johnson)    JEFF SONHOUSE: 'THE PANOPTIC CON' As sharp visually as they are politically, Mr. Sonhouse's compact, finely painted Pop-Surrealist portraits depict masked African American men in colorful tuxedos with hair made of real matches, steel wool and other materials. In some, subjects are shown twice, mug shot style: face-forward and in profile. These slyly incendiary works probe the mystique of the mythic scary-sexy black dude. Kustera Tilton, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, through June 18. (Johnson)    STURTEVANT: 'PUSH AND SHOVE' The artist known for copying works by Warhol, Johns and other contemporary artists presents a darkly elegant installation of fake Duchamps, including a ceiling of 1,200 scrotum-like coal bags, a urinal, two bottle racks and a snow shovel. Perry Rubenstein, 527 West 23rd Street and 526 West 24th Street, (212)627-8000, through June 18. (Johnson)    KARIN WEINER: 'FRONTIERA' A camp site of cardboard logs, stuffed fabric stones and a rag rug around a television set; suspended stuffed clouds like ornate patchwork mattresses; a mound of stuffed antlers; and collages of countless flowers comprise this industriously zany artist's second solo. ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 229-1088, through July 29. (Johnson)    JEAN CLAUDE WOUTERS: 'PORTRAITS & NUDES -- SPIRIT' Through a process of re-photographing his prints, this French artist creates large, black and white photographs that are so pale it may take a second to see the ghostly image of a nude torso or, more hauntingly, the larger than life face that seems to gaze at us from an ethereal realm. Meyerowitz, 120 Eleventh Avenue, at 20th Street, (212)414-2770, through June 18. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    * MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a recreation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)    * 'ALBERT0 CASADO: TODO CLANDESTINO, TODO POPULAR,' This young artist uses a technique involving painting on glass and aluminum foil to create shimmering, faux-kitsch works about politics, religion and ordinary life in Cuba. Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-0473, through June 25. (Johnson)    MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, who have meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith)    'GLASS, SERIOUSLY' This fine selection of artworks in glass, picked by the independent curator Lilly Wei, includes teardrops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained-glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)    * JULIO GONZÁLEZ This small but illuminating, 43-piece exhibition surveys the career of a sculptor who, late in life, taught Picasso how to work with metal and then went on in the 1930s to create playful, Cubist-style, welded iron assemblages that transformed modern sculpture. Instituto Cervantes, 211 East 49th Street, (212)308-7720, through June 18. (Johnson)    JUDY LEDGERWOOD: 'SPRING FEVER' With a boldly insouciant touch and vibrantly dissonant colors, this Chicago-based artist makes grid-based pattern paintings using heraldic overtones and punchy mandala compositions of squished balloonlike shapes. Tracy Williams, 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212)229-2757, through June 24. (Johnson)    MAKE IT NOW: NEW SCULPTURE IN NEW YORK This survey of work by nearly 30 young and youngish artists is overly cautious but nonetheless gives an interesting account of the diffuse field of sculpture (which includes photography, video, ceramics and painting in this case); tracks the current cross-fertilization between assemblage and appropriation art and offers enough glimmers of new talent to be worth a visit. Sculpture Center, 41-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, through July 31. (Smith)    MALCOM MORLEY: THE ART OF PAINTING After 30 years, Malcolm Morley returns to the Photo Realist painting style he helped found in the mid 1960s, further exploring the tensions between reality, the art of painting and the act of looking and demonstrating that fidelity, taken far enough, turns into something else. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, Meatpacking District, (212)999-7337, through June 25. (Smith)    * AURIE RAMIREZ A remarkable self-taught artist creates a candy-colored but complex universe (in watercolor) of androgynous, dark-haired beauties who usually wear frock coats and pinstriped pants. Her first show anywhere dovetails nicely with smaller debuts of the bristling cannibalizations of texts, images and found materials by Peter Gallo and the collage drawings of an artist known only as Carter. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)924-4212, through June 11. (Smith)    Last Chance    * ASIA SOCIETY AND QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'EDGE OF DESIRE.' A highly selective, multigenerational survey of different kinds of contemporary art being made in India; embracing craft, folk and tribal traditions as well as popular culture and academic modernism. The smaller portion is at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212)288-6400; the more expansive and varied section at the Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700, closing on Sunday. (Cotter)    BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'CHERISHED POSSESSIONS.' More than 100 choice objects from that vast attic of family relics, historic New England, from a box with two worm-eaten pieces of 17th-century bread to a grand Copley portrait. Thanks to bright captioning, this show conveys a sense of family connection with the objects. 18 West 86th Street, (212)501-3000, closing on Sunday. (Glueck)    TINA BARNEY The photographer known for her large, sumptuous color photographs of rich people often caught in situations of subtle psychological tension presents portraits shot in Spain and Germany that are included in her book ''The Europeans.'' Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212)431-0166, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'BASQUIAT' Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame (usually on the same surface) with a loquacious style that mixed mediums and gave visual voice to the glories, history and pain of blackness. Despite a few glitches, this generous retrospective provides an exhilarating account of his short, innovative career. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000, closing on Sunday. (Smith)    IAN COOPER With a series of works that focus on the child star of the ''Poltergeist'' movies, this young artist adds his distinctive preoccupation with popular culture and the spirit world to the black-on-black, Goth-leaning current in new art. Cue Art Foundation, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-3583, closing tomorrow. through June 4. (Smith)    * WYNNE GREENWOOD AND K8 HARDY Wynne Greenwood is best known as the one-person rock trio called Tracy and the Plastics. K8 Hardy is a founder of the gay feminist art collective LTTR. For this show, they collaborated on a video called ''New Report'' in which they play anchorwomen for an alternative television news channel. Reena Spaulings Fine Art, 371 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006, closing on Sunday. (Cotter)    GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' through June 8. Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering, 81-foot-tall construction, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections; there is not much to the work beyond that. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LARRY CLARK' The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture, and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000, closing on Sunday. (Johnson)    REUBEN NAKIAN: 'TERRA COTTAS, 1955-1983' The large semi-figurative bronze sculptures of Nakian (1897-1983) often figure in the history of Abstract Expressionism, but this well-selected exhibition suggests that he should be best remembered for his small terra cottas -- fraught with Classical themes, sexual energy and fast-working bravura. Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212)752-1223, closing tonight. (Smith)    * 'PROVIDING FOR THE AFTERLIFE: BRILLIANT ARTIFACTS FROM SHANDONG' The archaeology boom in China continues, and the 50 objects from Han dynasty tombs in this show are being exhibited in the United States for the first time. China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street, (212)744-8181, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)    LARRY RIVERS Boldly setting up as a figural painter in the holy days of Abstract Expressionism, Rivers (1923-2002) early on produced portraits, nudes and takeoffs on historical events. This bulging retrospective covers work from the early 1950's to his death, ending with the rather forgettable fashion images of his last years. At his best, he was a painter to reckon with. Marlborough Gallery, 40 West 57th Street, (212)541-4900; Marlborough Chelsea, 211 West 19th Street, (212)463-8634, closing tomorrow. (Glueck)    AIDA RUILOVA: 'LETS GO' A participant in the last Whitney Biennial and P.S. 1's current ''Greater New York,'' Ms. Ruilova makes short and briefly gripping multi-screen video works in a style you might call Neo-Goth Surrealistic Cubism. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212)445-0444, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    JULIAN SCHNABEL This excellent selection of 21 large and mostly early paintings includes some of the very works that made Mr. Schnabel the most hotly talked-about artist of the Neo-Expressionist era. C & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212)861-0020, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)   The Listings: June 3 -- June 9"},{"year":"2005","title":"Selective listings by critics of The New York Times of new and noteworthy cultural events in the New York metropolitan region this week. * denotes a highly recommended film, concert, show or exhibition.    Theater    Approximate running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Previews and Openings    'WORK' Opens tomorrow. Corporations take another beating in this satire of the cubicled life. Directed by Jim Simpson (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)226-2407.    'B.F.E.' Opens Tuesday. A kooky Asian-American family tries to escape its stifling home life, while a serial killer stalks its neighborhood in Arizona (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.    'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Opens Wednesday. Elaine May's three one-acts make up a new comedy on Broadway (remember those?) about married couples and aging singles looking for love. It's being called a play ''about life in the new millennium.'' Daniel Sullivan directs (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.    'BIRDIE BLUE' Previews start Thursday. Opens June 23. S. Epatha Merkerson stars as the title character in this memory play about a woman whose life changed tragically on the day that Martin Luther King Jr. was killed (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422.    'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' Opens June 15. Is it a comic tragedy or a tragic comedy? Renew that old debate at Tom Donaghy's new adaptation of Chekhov's last play (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200.  'THE CONSTANT WIFE' Previews start today. Opens June 16. When a wife discovers that her husband is cheating with her best friend, she takes unusual measures. Roundabout's revival of Somerset Maugham's comedy of manners stars Kate Burton and Lynn Redgrave (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300.    'DRUMSTRUCK' Opens late May/early June. The gimmick of this new spin on ''Stomp,'' which includes 11 percussionists from West and South Africa, is that every audience member plays his or her own drum during the show. David Warren directs (1:25). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.    'MANUSCRIPT' Previews start Wednesday. Opens June 12. A manuscript holds the key to success and fame in Paul Grellong's comedy, directed by Bob Balaban (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200.    'THE PARIS LETTER' Opens June 12. A repressed Wall Street investment banker (is there any other kind?) has a long, hard fall in Jon Robin Baitz's new drama, which spans four decades (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212)719-1300.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)    'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising soufflé of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:45)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary, sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE ARGUMENT' Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of the post-9/11 play ''Omnium Gatherum,'' aims to personalize another hot-button issue here, but it's not likely that any serious thought, old or new, is going to be provoked by this whiny debate between two uninteresting types about the ever-sensitive topic of abortion. He wants the baby","excerpt":"she doesn't. It is hard to care (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212)353-0303. (Isherwood)    'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the mass killings of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, child-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Miriam Horn)    'FLIGHT: THE RISE AND FALL OF CHARLES LINDBERGH' Garth Wingfield's droning bio-play transforms Charles Lindbergh's journey from tickertape hero to disgraced Nazi sympathizer into a sort of talking newspaper, minus op-ed pages, lively writing and the weather report. With Gregg Edelman playing the everyman pilot turned celebrity, and Brian D'Arcy James on hand to personify a series of slimy reporters (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)    'HENRY FLAMETHROWA' John Belluso's timely drama about a girl in a coma who may or may not heal the sick engages the issues raised during the Terri Schiavo media circus. It's a thought-provoking and ambitious play (starring Tim Daly), but unfortunately, there are no characters in it you can believe in (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)    *'HOWIE THE ROOKIE' Mark O'Rowe's blood-and-guts-filled comic yarn, which features two baroque monologues climaxing in sudden, irresistible bursts of mayhem, tells a gangland story set in working-class Dublin. Despite being overproduced, the play, displaying traces of David Mamet and Quentin Tarantino, packs a wallop (1:50). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444. (Zinoman)    *'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE MAIDS' It is no small feat to find the chill in Jean Genet's 1947 play about two maids who fantasize about killing their boss, but Jean Cocteau Repertory manages it. Credit an eye-opening performance by Amanda Jones as Solange, the dominant of the pair (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, (212)279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MISS JULIE' Anders Cato directs a new adaptation by Craig Lucas. Marin Hinkle, as Miss Julie, and Reg Rogers, as her father's uppity valet Jean, spar and flirt, humiliate each other and humble themselves as expected, in the traditional kitchen, with the designated disastrous results. Chances are you won't believe a word of it (1:35). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)    'MORTAL LADIES POSSESSED' Linda Marlowe's admirable but difficult one-woman show is based on a 1974 collection of Tennessee Williams's short stories. The adaptation is sometimes awkward and the transitions hard to follow, but Ms. Marlowe captures the characters' pathos and fragility nicely (1:20). 59E59Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Anita Gates)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    *'THE PASSION OF THE CRAWFORD' For his slight but still tasty new show, John Epperson has decided to allow his voiceless alter ego, Lypsinka, to commune intimately and at length with one of her spiritual forebears, Joan Crawford. The centerpiece is a pointed but never vicious re-creation, or rather an interpretation, of a live interview Crawford gave at Town Hall in 1973 (1:30). Zipper, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE PULL OF NEGATIVE GRAVITY' A Welsh man with no seeming interest in politics is badly injured in the Iraq war and discovers that returning home will not be so easy. In this bruising, intimate and overly familiar play, which is part of the Brits Off Broadway festival, Jonathan Lichtenstein beautifully portrays how the war destroyed one rural family (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. (Zinoman)    'SCORE' The subject of this one-man show is Leonard Bernstein and music, and the performer, Tom Nelis, and the director, Anne Bogart, ''get'' Lenny -- now brilliant, now flamboyant, now superficial, now physically responding to recorded music (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. The show is in repertory with ''Songs From an Unmade Bed.'' (Anne Midgette)    'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Slight but pithy, this humorous revue of 18 songs with lyrics by Mark Campbell and music by 18 different composers takes a sardonic and explicit look at gay life in New York: ''Sex with an actor. What was I thinking?'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. In repertory with ''Score.'' (Midgette)    'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Preyskyakov brothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters, affecting but derivative music, humor that ranges from tired to classic, too much sentiment and just enough irreverence, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, (212)239-6200. (Gates)    'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'KNOCK ON WOOD' Thanks to Steven Spielberg and Bob Dole, the bar is fairly high these days for war stories, and Samuel Calderon comes nowhere near clearing it with ''Knock on Wood,'' a monologue about his perfectly ordinary service in the Israeli military during the Yom Kippur War. He sees a few moderately distressing sights, his friend is injured, and that's about it (1:30). 13th Street Repertory, 50 West 13th Street, (212)352-3101. (Genzlinger)    'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'UNCLE JIMMY'S DIRTY BASEMENT' This strange brew of Catskills humor, heavy metal and filthy-minded puppets has developed a cult following downtown, and its bizarre band rocks out to some of the most bombastically silly songs since Spinal Tap's ''Big Bottom.'' But when the music stops, the show meanders without an involving story (1:15). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, (212)477-5288. ( Zinoman)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street , (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause (2:30). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'THE FALL' Through Kenneth Nowell's looking glass, Hamlet is reversed, and a daughter, Jill, is driven mad by her mother's ghost. Was the mother's expected death natural or an act of murder by her father, who too quickly married her mother's sister? A strong cast and superb director, Kate Marks, manage a tone that teeters effectively between the tragic and the hilarious, and one is left unexpectedly shaken (1:40). The Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212)307-9467, closing on Sunday. (Honor Moore)    'KING A' Het Laagland's variation on the legend of King Arthur for children features five energetic actors, 40 tiny chairs, several a cappella musical numbers, occasional swordplay and frequent inspiring affirmations. The show is inventive and full of physical energy, but in the end may be a little too talky for its intended audience (1:20.) New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Gates)    'MEMORY HOUSE' Dianne Wiest's warm, engaging performance provides the juicy filling in Kathleen Tolan's play about a tense standoff between a mother and her teenage daughter over their differing philosophies of life. As she bakes a pie -- from scratch, mind you -- Ms. Wiest performs the still more challenging feat of keeping our sympathies keenly attuned to the appealing emotional undercurrents in Ms. Tolan's slight but sensitively drawn two-hander (1:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'A PICASSO' Jeffrey Hatcher's play is a formulaic two-hander set in occupied Paris in 1941. Pablo Picasso (Dennis Boutsikaris) is brought in for interrogation by the severe Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), who works for the German cultural ministry (1:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    *'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    *'THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD' Working off a template popularized by Anna Deveare Smith, this engaging, smart and scrupulously balanced docudrama is an oral history of the gentrification of Carroll Gardens. Deanna Pacelli convincingly portrays an F Train full of ethnic types who document how the neighborhood moved from crack to baguettes (1:00). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at East Ninth Street, East Village, (212)477-5288, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'A LOT LIKE LOVE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A film that isn't half bad and every so often is pretty good, filled with real sentiment, worked-through performances and a story textured enough to sometimes feel a lot like life. (Manohla Dargis)    'THE AMITYVILLE HORROR' (R, 89 minutes) Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, this remake of the soporific 1979 horror flick is a modest improvement on the original. But this time don't get attached to the family dog. (Dargis)    'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (Not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali) A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)    'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish) This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)    'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    'DOMINION PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST' (R, 115 minutes) The solemn, high-minded attempt to redeem ''The Exorcist'' franchise is the movie equivalent of retrieving the eggshells, coffee grounds and banana peels from the trash and presenting them as art; the ingredients still stink. (Holden)    *'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    *'FUNNY HA HA' (Not rated, 89 minutes) Twenty-somethings looking for love, direction and fulfilling work -- this smart, cheaply made first feature is low-key, note-perfect and sneakily artful. (Scott)    *'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)    *'THE HOLY GIRL' (Not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)    'HOUSE OF WAX' (R, 105 minutes) Not the depilatory sequel to ''Beauty Shop,'' but rather a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price creep show, with Paris Hilton, Elisha Cuthbert and a bunch of guys menaced by maniacs in the Louisiana backwoods. Grisly and slow. (Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    'JIMINY GLICK IN LALAWOOD' (R, 90 minutes) This frantic comic hodgepodge built around Martin Short's popular Comedy Central character is an intermittently funny free-for-all that suffers from attention deficit disorder. (Holden)    'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy, and Robert Duvall (as the father of Mr. Ferrell's character and a rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson, you'll win big, anyway. (Scott)    'KINGDOM OF HEAVEN' (R, 145 minutes) A plaintive period epic from Ridley Scott, starring Orlando Bloom, about the bloody orgies of piety known as the Crusades. The film proves yet again that it takes an actor as self-serious as Russell Crowe to carry the weight of Mr. Scott's ambitions; it also takes a story Mr. Scott himself can really believe in. (Dargis)    'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) A film about a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)    'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese) This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    *'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French) A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)    'MA MÈRE' (NC-17, 110 minutes, in French) Avid sensation-seeking in this film is such a grim affair that after a short while, the spectacle of its aimless characters bending themselves out of shape in the pursuit of depravity mutates from titillating to pathetic to laughable. (Holden)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MINDHUNTERS' (R, 106 minutes) This thriller reimagines Agatha Christie's ''Ten Little Indians'' as ''Eight Little Profilers'': a team of would-be F.B.I. agents, isolated at a training compound to solve a simulated crime, soon realize that a real serial killer walks among them. The film may find a cult audience among fans of schlock cinema seeking a giggle and a scream. (Dana Stevens)    'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)    *'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'PALINDROMES' (Not rated, 100 minutes) The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)    'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes) This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)    'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes) It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)    'SHAKE HANDS WITH THE DEVIL: THE JOURNEY OF ROMÉO DALLAIRE' (no rating, 91 minutes) The unsettling documentary follows Lt. Gen. Roméo Dallaire, the Canadian commander of the tiny United Nations peacekeeping force stationed in Rwanda in 1994 as he returns to that African country 10 years after mass slaughter of 800,000 during his watch. (Holden) 'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes) Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame that the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)    '6IXTYNIN9' (R, 118 minutes) The Thai director Pen-ek Ratanarjuang's propulsive black comedy follows an unemployed secretary (Lalita Panyopas) as she struggles to begin a new life with money stolen from a local gangster. Despite drama-school performances and clear signs of budget constraint (most of the action takes place inside the same modest apartment), ''6ixtynin9'' ramps up the body count with energy, wit and a sustained awareness of the economically depressed world outside the frame. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    *'STAR WARS III: REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    *'3-IRON' (not rated, 87 minutes; in Korean) A pop fable of urban loneliness that showcases the Korean director Kim Ki-Duk's witty sense of form. It's a thoroughly modern movie with elements of silent film, a love story shot with horror-film techniques, and a charming blend of style and sentiment. (Scott)    *'TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE' (R, 95 minutes) This intimate portrait of the legendary octogenarian cinematographer Haskell Wexler, filmed by his son, is an artistic father-son power struggle for control of a movie being made. It is the richest documentary of its kind since Terry Zwigoff's ''Crumb.'' (Holden)    *'À TOUT DE SUITE' (Not rated, 96 minutes; in French) This downbeat homage to the French New Wave is a small, nearly perfect film that follows the sad chain of events when a headstrong 19-year-old art student goes on the lam with a Moroccan bank robber. (Holden)    '2009 LOST MEMORIES' (R, 136 minutes; in Korean and Japanese) A beautifully designed and ambitious example of Korean cinema, this film confronts the political and racial enmity between Korea and Japan with astonishing directness and originality. Blending action, time travel and heartfelt drama, the film posits a future in which Japan has conquered Korea and won World War II. (Catsoulis)    'WALK ON WATER' (Not rated, 104 minutes) The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Stevens)    'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (Not rated, 45 minutes) A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Kids will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful by this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity. (Ned Martel)    'XXX: STATE OF THE UNION' (PG-13, 94 minutes). A wildly silly action flick in which all that stand between the American people and the yoke of tyranny are big guns, bigger breasts, the thud-thud-thud of commercial rap and the multiplatform artist known as Ice Cube (né O'Shea Jackson). (Dargis)    Film Series    THE BEST OF THE AFRICAN FILM FESTIVAL (Through Tuesday) BAMcinematek's festival schedule includes ''Dirt for Dinner'' (2000), from Nigeria and Germany, about the first black German policeman, who turned to crime; ''Madame Brouette'' (2002), a feminist melodrama from Senegal; and ''Soldiers of the Rock'' (2003), about miners in South Africa.

(Jon Pareles)    *BEENIE MAN, VYBZ KARTEL (Saturday) Two of dancehall reggae's biggest names come to town for what should be a manic, exuberant night of shouting and singing, by turns silly and ferocious. Vybz Kartel specializes in witty, rapid-fire narratives, whereas Beenie Man is less single-minded: an astonishingly versatile performer, he can go from a pop sing-along to an a cappella sex rhyme to an infectious dance track in a matter of minutes -- and often does. 10 p.m., Elite Ark, 900 Sheffield Avenue, at Wortman Avenue, Canarsie, Brooklyn, (718)649-6535. $40 in advance sold out; only $50 tickets left. (Kelefa Sanneh)    BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Wednesday) Boasting zero members from Brazil and only one girl (the multilingual surrealist jazz singer Sabina Sciubba), this downtown quartet, arising from the arty Nublu club scene, plays its erotic, electronica-inflected reggae and bossa novas on keyboards, computers, bass and drums. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800. $20; $25 at the door.

(Pareles)    CORDERO (Tomorrow) Mixing the open atmospherics of the Southwest with the gritty feel of the Brooklyn art scene, the bilingual Ani Cordero, who has worked with Calexico and Giant Sand, and her band make guitar rock that gives urban brashness some borderland mystery. 11:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. $10. (Sinagra)    CHARANGA SOLEIL (Tonight) Pulling together an Afro-Caribbean diaspora, Charanga Soleil mixes the courtly Cuban charanga (for a group including flute and violin) with touches of Congolese guitar rumba, West African kora, Haitian rara drumming and more.

The Other Music record store brings him into town for a performance and extended DJ set. 9 p.m. to 4 a.m., APT, 419 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)414-4245. $5.(Sinagra)    *ROBBIE FULKS (Wednesday) The latest album of curveball Chicago country by Robbie Fulks once again prompts head shaking as to why this off-off-Opry wiseacre isn't a more famous songwriter (or at least a little bigger and richer). As alt-country fans know, he's a crackerjack guitarist and a charismatic performer to boot. 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. $10; $12 at the door. (Sinagra)    GLASS CANDY (Tonight) With a name that brilliantly recalls suburbia's deadliest home décor, these theatrical Portland no-wavers appropriately perform their fractured dance music in Lit's hipster dungeon. 9 p.m., Lit Lounge, 93 Second Avenue, near Fifth Street, East Village, (212)777-7987. $6. (Sinagra)    GOLDIE LOOKIN' CHAIN (Monday) If the idea of eight puerile Ali G dress-alikes rapping about whose mother has a penis appeals, these cheeky Welshmen deliver, slinging silly rhymes over thin, ironic beats. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. $15; $17 at the door. (Sinagra)    JUAN LUIS GUERRA (Tonight and Saturday) This Dominican merengue superstar guitarist has also gained fame as a sometimes controversial populist spokesman on Latin American social issues. Increasingly, his music has incorporated Afropop rhythms into the traditional merengue form. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741. $59.50-99.50.(Sinagra)    HALLUCINOGEN ( Tonight) Since the 1999 release of ''Twisted'' (Twisted), a hallmark of electronica's psychotropic Goa trance style, Hallucinogen's Simon Posford has moved further into a slicker, more cleanly produced brand of dance dub. 10 p.m., Spirit, 530 West 27th, Chelsea, (212)268-9477. $30.

(Sinagra)    *THE HOLD STEADY (Tomorrow) This great Brooklyn band is to celebrate its great new album, ''Separation Sunday'' (French Kiss), with a free concert in a Williamsburg record shop; arrive early, so you can see Craig Finn's face while he delivers his sly but urgent rants over 1970's-era riff-rock. 3 p.m., Sound Fix, 110 Bedford Avenue, at North 11th Street, (718)388-8090. Free. (Sanneh)    *THE HOMOSEXUALS (Monday and Tuesday) Though this seminal London band's stylistic forays placed them on a par with other polestars of 70's and 80's British art punk, they never rose to name-drop prominence. Last year's three-disc compilation of everything they ever recorded (they never released a full-length LP) gave them some deserved due. Monday at 7:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)420-1466. $15; $18 at the door.

(Sinagra)    *KRAFTWERK (Wednesday) Back in the 1970's, four German rockers billed themselves as ''the man-machine.'' They abandoned standard instruments for blipping synthesizers and ticking synthetic drums and sang in determinedly emotionless voices about the robotic pleasures of the modern world. They returned in the late 90's to capitalize on the techno scene they helped inspire, and they have recast their old songs from analog to digital. 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)564-4882. $45; $47 day of. (Pareles)    LADYBUG (Tonight) The soothing yet strong female rapper from the groovy mid-90's ''hip-hop bebop'' group Digable Planets will release a solo album before her old trio tries a reunion later this year.

For years, though, he was a fixture in San Francisco's indie scene. Lately he's been doing his own thing. The poppers Kim and Matt fill out the bill. 8 p.m., Sin-e, 148 Attorney Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212)388-0077. $10. (Sinagra)    LEO NOCENTELLI, ZIGABOO MODELISTE, ROBERT WALTER AND DOUG WIMBISH (Tonight) Leo Nocentelli has been scratching the backbeat and teasing the blues for decades as the guitarist in the Meters, the great New Orleans funk band.

(Sinagra)    ROCK AND ROLL CIRCUS (Sunday) The downtown party mavens Georgie Seville, DJ Justine D., Michael T. and friends celebrate their fifth year of libidinous holiday eve dress-up bashes. There's a circus theme, but you suspect that the DJ's will stick to the preferred mix of disco and danceable post-punk, both old and neo. 10 p.m., Roxy, 515 West 18th Street, Manhattan, (212)645-5156. $15 with Web site discount; $25 without. (Sinagra)    SOUKOUS STARS (Sunday) Soukous is the Congolese music that sends guitars twining over a lilting rumba beat, and the Soukous Stars include the guitarist Lokassa Ya Mbongo; the bassist Nguoma Lokito; and the more recent addition, the guitarist Chico Mawatu, not to mention four female dancers. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)239-6200. $20.

(Sinagra)    *WIDE RIGHT (Today) One of the more winsome singer-guitarists around is this rocking bar band's chatty, no-nonsense frontwoman, Leah Archibald.

(Sinagra)    THE WRENS (Tonight) They may write about life in their home state, New Jersey, but it's not with a Fountains of Wayne smirk.

(Dunning).    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    *AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION: AFRICAN-AMERICAN ART FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)    AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE: NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN JEWELRY ARTS OF THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Smith)    *ASIA SOCIETY AND QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'EDGE OF DESIRE: RECENT ART IN INDIA,' through June 5. A highly selective, multigenerational survey of different kinds of contemporary art being made in India; embracing craft, folk and tribal traditions as well as popular culture and academic modernism. The smaller portion is at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212)288-6400; the more expansive and varied section at the Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700. Also at Queens: ''Fatal Love.''(Holland Cotter)    BARD GRADUATE CENTER FOR STUDIES IN THE DECORATIVE ARTS, DESIGN AND CULTURE: 'CHERISHED POSSESSIONS: A NEW ENGLAND LEGACY,' through June 5. More than 100 choice objects from that vast attic of family relics, historic New England, from a box with two worm-eaten pieces of 17th-century bread to a grand Copley portrait. Thanks to bright captioning, this show conveys a sense of family connection with the objects. 18 West 86th Street, (212)501-3000. (Glueck)    *BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'BASQUIAT,' through June 5. Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame (usually on the same surface) with a loquacious style that mixed mediums and gave visual voice to the glories, history and pain of blackness. Despite a few glitches, this generous retrospective provides an exhilarating account of his short, innovative career. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Smith)    *BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments, representing 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. (See above.) (Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES: DESIGNING FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizzazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)    *EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustín Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    *SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW: HILLA REBAY AND SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim Museum's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' through June 8. Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering, 81-foot-tall construction, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections; there is not much to the work beyond that. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)    *QUEEN SOFíA SPANISH INSTITUTE: 'FROM GOYA TO SOROLLA,' through July 30. More than 75 pictures from the Hispanic Society, celebrating its centenary; starting with Goya's grave portrait of Pedro Mocarte, they track an arc to figures like Francisco Núñez Losada and salon virtuosi like Ignacio Zuloaga and Joaquín Sorolla. 684 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)628-0420. (Kimmelman)    INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LARRY CLARK,' through June 5. The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture, and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Ken Johnson)    *JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12, 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Cotter)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEFINING YONGLE: IMPERIAL ART IN EARLY-15TH-CENTURY CHINA,' through July 10. Sequestered in the exquisite Chinese decorative arts galleries, this show is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!: SELF-TAUGHT ARTISTS, THE BIBLE AND THE AMERICAN SOUTH,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, Minnie Evans, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Johnson)    *MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'EL BARRIO: PUERTO RICAN NEW YORK,' through June 12. A snapshot of El Barrio -- East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem -- as seen through archival images and pictures by the contemporary photographer Hiram S. Maristany taken at a revolutionary political moment in the 1960's and early 70's. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'CHRIS MARKER,' through June 13. Made entirely on the computer, ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' -- a two-channel, eight-screen DVD with which this French underground film legend makes his New York debut as an installation artist -- gives the horrors of World War I an eroded beauty and haunting pertinence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Smith)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)    NEUE GALERIE: 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' through June 6. More than 100 faces shot by 35 photographers. It's a savvy show that homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)    *STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI: 'AFRO-MUSES,' through July 3. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Kimmelman)    STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art or music that this country has produced. (See above.) (Smith)    THE UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO: VISION AND CONTINUITY,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER: BLACK SUN,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    ANTHONY CARO Four tabletop pieces from the 1970's and 80's, masterly exercises in balletic form and balance in rusting steel, by this reigning British standard-bearer of modernist abstract sculpture. They are elegant and a serious pleasure. Mitchell-Inness & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, through June 11.(Kimmelman)    *'PROVIDING FOR THE AFTERLIFE: BRILLIANT ARTIFACTS FROM SHANDONG' The archaeology boom in China continues, and the 50 objects from Han dynasty tombs in this show are being exhibited in the United States for the first time. China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street, (212)744-8181, through June 4. (Cotter)    JULIAN SCHNABEL This excellent selection of 21 large and mostly early paintings includes some of the very works that made Mr. Schnabel the most hotly talked-about artist of the Neo-Expressionist era. C & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212)861-0020, through June 4. (Johnson)    *RICHARD WATHEN A young British artist plugs some 21st-century energy into 18th-century portraiture, painting with a matte, flat delicacy that gives familiar poses a new-born freshness, and not only when clothing is subtracted. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through June 16. (Smith)    Galleries: 57th Street    DON COLLEY: 'FALL GUYS & ZEITGEISTS' Whether or not you like his images of thuggish clowns and romantic skies, you have to admit that Mr. Colley's new pieces are technically remarkable. They appear to be small, beautifully worked encaustic paintings, but they are, in fact, kiln-fired glazed ceramic tiles. George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212)644-5665, through June. (Johnson)    LARRY RIVERS Boldly setting up as a figural painter in the holy days of Abstract Expressionism, Rivers (1923-2002) early on produced portraits, nudes and takeoffs on historical events, like his sendup of the corny 19th-century painting by Emanuel Leutze, ''Washington Crossing the Delaware.'' This bulging retrospective covers work from the early 1950's to his death, ending with the rather forgettable fashion images of his last years. At his best, he was a painter to reckon with. Marlborough Gallery, 40 West 57th Street, (212)541-4900; Marlborough Chelsea, 211 West 19th Street, (212)463-8634, through June 4. (Glueck)    AIDA RUILOVA: 'LETS GO' A participant in the last Whitney Biennial and P.S. 1's current ''Greater New York,'' Ms. Ruilova makes short and briefly gripping multi-screen video works in a style you might call Neo-Goth Surrealistic Cubism. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212)445-0444, through June 4. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    TINA BARNEY The photographer known for her large, sumptuous color photographs of rich people often caught in situations of subtle psychological tension presents portraits shot in Spain and Germany that are included in her book ''The Europeans.'' Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212)431-0166, closing June 4. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    DEAN BYINGTON Skillfully blending the handmade and the mechanical, the paintings of this San Francisco artist use patterns suggestive of lacy wallpaper and images from 19th-century engravings to evoke landscapes and their not always peaceful inhabitants. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)255-8450, through June 18. (Smith)    IAN COOPER With a series of works that focus on the child star of the ''Poltergeist'' movies, this young artist adds his distinctive preoccupation with popular culture and the spirit world to the black-on-black, Goth-leaning current in new art. Cue Art Foundation, 511 West 25th Street, (212)206-3583, through June 4. (Smith)    CHERYL DONEGAN: 'OLD, TEMPORARY' While video-projected images of colorful, cheap toys unfold on the wall, a woman's maniacally cheerful voice recites a rapid-fire litany of affirmations composed for Amway salespeople: ''I am the best at what I do. There is no one better. I get the job done,'' and so on. It is funny and scary. Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212)255-0979, through June 4. (Johnson)    ROBBERT FLICK: 'TRAJECTORIES' With the cinematic idea that successive views give a dynamic sense of place, Mr. Flick mounted a video camera in his car window. He packs the results in grid formation on big sheets that give off the vibes of a country road, a city street, a desertscape. The whole is more than the sum of its tiny parts. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)989-7600, through June 18. (Glueck)    NEETA MADAHAR Large, handsome, eerily unreal color photographs of real birds attracted to a free-form grid of tree branches by a shifting cast of birdfeeders. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through June 11. (Smith)    RICHARD PRINCE A well-chosen assortment of works from the past 25 years by the influential Neo-Pop semiotician includes joke paintings, car hood sculptures and photographs of scruffy upstate New York landscapes. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through June 18. (Johnson)    MICHAEL RYAN Using his training in the art of decorative marbleizing, this self-taught painter creates dreamy, primordial landscapes sparsely populated by bizarrely abstracted animals and people. Together, the brushy painting and the visionary imagery create a scary, feverish feeling. Andrew Edlin, 529 West 20th Street, (212)206-9723, through June 4. (Johnson)    'SCULPTURE' This judicious small selection of three-dimensional works includes a rustic dream house by Vito Acconci; videos showing through an antique Asian iron gate by Nam June Paik; big, smooth white birds by Hiraki Sawa; and an amazing, life-size stainless steel tree by Roxy Paine. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through June 25. (Johnson)    STURTEVANT: 'PUSH AND SHOVE' The artist known for copying works by Warhol, Johns and other contemporary artists presents a darkly elegant installation of fake Duchamps, including a ceiling of 1,200 scrotum-like coal bags, a urinal, two bottle racks and a snow shovel. Perry Rubenstein, 527 West 23rd Street and 526 West 24th Street, (212)627-8000, through June 18. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    *MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a recreation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)    *ALBERTO CASADO: TODO CLANDESTINO, TODO POPULAR,' This young artist uses a technique involving painting on glass and aluminum foil to create shimmering, faux-kitsch works about politics, religion and ordinary life in Cuba. Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-0473, through June 25.(Johnson)    MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, who have meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith)    'GLASS, SERIOUSLY' This fine selection of artworks in glass, picked by the independent curator Lilly Wei, includes teardrops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained-glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)    *WYNNE GREENWOOD AND K8 HARDY Wynne Greenwood is best known as the one-person rock trio called Tracy and the Plastics. K8 Hardy is a founder of the gay feminist art collective LTTR. For this show, they collaborated on a video called ''New Report'' in which they play anchorwomen for an alternative television news channel. Reena Spaulings Fine Art, 371 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006, through June 5. (Cotter)    JUDY LEDGERWOOD: 'SPRING FEVER' With a boldly insouciant touch and vibrantly dissonant colors, this Chicago-based artist makes grid-based pattern paintings using heraldic overtones and punchy mandala compositions of squished balloonlike shapes. Tracy Williams, 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212)229-2757, through June 24. (Johnson)    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through October. (Johnson)    *AURIE RAMIREZ A remarkable self-taught artist creates a candy-colored but complex universe (in watercolor) of androgynous, dark-haired beauties who usually wear frock coats and pinstriped pants. Her first show anywhere dovetails nicely with smaller debuts of the bristling cannibalizations of texts, images and found materials by Peter Gallo and the collage drawings of an artist known only as Carter. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)924-4212, through June 11. (Smith)    DON SUNSERI: 'PIECES FOR A WALL' The appealing small painted and sculpted abstractions made out of found pieces of wood, metal and cardboard in this one-wall exhibition look like the result of a collaboration between Elizabeth Murray and Richard Tuttle. It is interesting to learn that Sunseri, who died in 2001, was once married to Ms. Murray. The Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, near Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)614-0505, through June 16. (Johnson)    Last Chance    'ALEXANDER THE GREAT: TREASURES FROM AN EPIC ERA OF HELLENISM,' Alexander (356-323 B.C.) and his age are evoked in this concentrated show of art and artifacts displaying portrait busts of this legendary Macedonian emperor, ancient coins, advanced Macedonian weaponry and pottery. Onassis Cultural Center, 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212)486-4448, closing tomorrow. (Glueck)    VICTOR BURGIN: 'THE LITTLE HOUSE' This video meditation on architectural beauty and conflicting male and female desire by a veteran English artist is one of the best, least didactic works of his career. Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)462-2668, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    'EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY' Among more than 70 narrative paintings, drawings and prints by a wide range of 20th-century artists are works by Max Beckmann, James Ensor, John Heartfield, KatheKollwitz, Sue Coe, Martha Rosler and Eric Fischl. Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, (212)245-6734, closing today. (Johnson)    AMY GARTRELL: 'HOT HANDS, COLD HEART' The tribulations and infatuations of youth are the subjects of drawings, felt banners and an installation involving faceted glass charms and a lugubrious tree that would have done Edward Gorey proud. Daniel Reich, 537A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212)924-4949, closing tomorrow. (Smith)    JAMES GOBEL: 'RIDICULE IS NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF' Fat Rococo-era fops pose on a striped floor against a background of snow-covered rocky peaks in a campy, mural-scale confection made of neatly assembled pieces of colored felt. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212)352-2238, closing today. (Johnson)    *JACK GOLDSTEIN A hero of the Pictures generation revered by the new Pop artists and theorists of the 80's. His films from the early 70's (from 20 seconds to 5 minutes long) have a cool, deadpan quality recalling early videos of William Wegman. Ed Ruscha-style paintings of lightning storms from the 80's, here and at Metro, are thrillingly cinematic. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, through June 11. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-7100, closing today. (Johnson)    TERAO KATSUHIRO, SHINKI TOMOYUKI, YOSHIMUNE KAZUHIRO, YUMOTO MITSUO Four artists, from a Japanese center for the artistically talented but mentally disabled, appear possessed of naïve but intense imaginations and formal predilections bordering on compulsive. Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, SoHo, (212)925-1200, closing on Tuesday. (Johnson)    'L.A.' A group show that reflects the sprawl and vitality of the Los Angeles art scene is also so desperately crowded that it seems superfluous, especially given the high profiles of half of the 48 artists. Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)243-3159, closing today. (Smith)    *METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS' Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression as she captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some absurdly theatrical galleries, where her work reveals that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, closing on Monday. (Kimmelman)    MUSEUM FOR AFRICAN ART: 'RESONANCE FROM THE PAST' Roughly 90 sculptures, along with a few bead and fabric pieces, from the African holdings of the New Orleans Museum of Art. They make a savory anthology, with plenty of textbook staples, and some surprises. 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-7700, closing on Sunday. (Cotter)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'THOMAS DEMAND' A generally stellar midcareer survey of this 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, taking his own cinematic works. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400, closing on Monday.(Kimmelman)    ADAM PENDLETON: 'DEEPER DOWN THERE' This young conceptualist lifts verbal phrases from modern African-American literature and music and neatly silkscreens them onto single-color canvases, creating a coolly provocative blend of romantic poetry, identity politics and formalist abstraction. Yvon Lambert, 564 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-3611, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)    *WAYNE THIEBAUD: 'SINCE 1962: A SURVEY' In the early 60's, Mr. Thiebaud arrived at the buttery, thick still-life paintings of commercial food products that perfectly combined formalism, realism and Pop. This excellent small retrospective shows how he got there and some of the places he has been since. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212)987-4997, closing today. (Johnson)    QIU SHIHUA: 'INSIGHT' At first, the canvases by this painter from Shenzhen, China, look like nothing more than slightly scuffed expanses of raw fabric. Look again and you discover peaceful, luminously misty landscapes realized with amazing subtlety. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)414-1169, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    JOHN F. SIMON JR.: 'ENDLESS VICTORY' Mesmerizing animated patterns driven by sophisticated software programs and running on laptop screens; they would make excellent screen savers. One plays inventive variations on Mondrian's ''Victory Boogie Woogie.'' Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (646)336-7183, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    JOAN WALLACE, 'VIOLENT POP PAINTINGS' Each of three videos set into white monochrome panels shows a white-frosted cake exploded in slow motion by a shotgun blast. Ms. Wallace invites us to read this as a commentary on Modernist purity, the shooting of Andy Warhol and the assassination of President Kennedy. Dinter, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212)947-2818, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TIM HAWKINSON,' closing on Sunday. On the gee-whiz meter, Mr. Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800)944-8639. (Kimmelman)    'WILDER' This tribute to the Los Angeles dealer Nicholas Wilder (1937-1989) presents works by 28 artists who were shown at his gallery from 1965 to 1979. The all-star lineup includes Dan Flavin, Agnes Martin, John McCracken, Richard Tuttle and Cy Twombly. Parrasch and Washburn galleries, 20 West 57th Street, (212)246-5360 and (212)246-5300, closing today.

Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300.    'KICKER' Opens Monday.

Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)868-4444.    'PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES' Opens Tuesday. Procrastinators around the world despise Alan Ayckbourn, the English writer whose 67th play receives its New York premiere. A bittersweet comedy about six lonely Londoners trying to connect (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200.    'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' Opens Wednesday. Is it a comic tragedy or a tragic comedy? Renew that old debate at Tom Donaghy's new adaptation of Chekhov's last play (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200.    'BORDER/CLASH: A LITANY OF DESIRES' Opens Thursday. Staceyann Chin, an original cast member of ''Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam,'' tells her story in this autobiographical solo show (1:30). The Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100.    'THE CONSTANT WIFE' Opens Thursday. When a wife discovers that her husband is cheating with her best friend, she takes unusual measures. Roundabout's revival of Somerset Maugham's comedy of manners stars Kate Burton and Lynn Redgrave (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300.    'DRUMSTRUCK' Opens Thursday. The gimmick of this new spin on ''Stomp,'' which includes 11 percussionists from West and South Africa, is that every audience member plays his or her own drum during the show. David Warren directs (1:25). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.    'PEOPLE ARE LIVING THERE' Opens Thursday. Millie's lover runs off with a younger woman on her 50th birthday in this 1969 drama, a rare early Athol Fugard play not about apartheid. The setting has been moved from South Africa to New Jersey (1:30). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.    'BIG TIMES' Previews start tomorrow.

Epatha Merkerson stars as the title character in this memory play about a woman whose life changed tragically on the day that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422.    'MY SWEETHEART'S THE MAN IN THE MOON' Previews start Wednesday. Opens June 19. Don't touch Harry K. Thaw's wife. Stanford White learned that the hard way, and this play with music documents how the architect was murdered and the subsequent media circus (2:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212)868-4444.    Broadway    'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Though its opening odd-couple-on-a-dance-floor skit shows promising charm, this evening of three sketches from the first lady of neurotic comedy, Elaine May, mostly feels terminally torpid in the way that overworked and familiar material often does, even from comic geniuses. Daniel Sullivan directs an ensemble that notably features Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter and onstage alter ego) and the invaluable J. Smith-Cameron. (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.(Ben Brantley)    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' (Tony Award, Best Musical Revival 2005) Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising soufflé of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005 and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether that voice fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    * 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2005) Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:45)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary, sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)    'THE ARGUMENT' Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of the post-9/11 play ''Omnium Gatherum,'' aims to personalize another hot-button issue here, but it's not likely that any serious thought, old or new, is going to be provoked by this whiny debate between two uninteresting types about the ever-sensitive topic of abortion. He wants the baby","excerpt":"she doesn't. It is hard to care (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)353-0303.(Isherwood)    'FLIGHT: THE RISE AND FALL OF CHARLES LINDBERGH' Garth Wingfield's droning bio-play transforms Charles Lindbergh's journey from tickertape hero to disgraced Nazi sympathizer into a sort of talking newspaper, minus op-ed pages, lively writing and the weather report. With Gregg Edelman playing the everyman pilot turned celebrity, and Brian D'Arcy James on hand to personify a series of slimy reporters (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)    * 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Lambs Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)    'MISS JULIE' Anders Cato directs a new adaptation by Craig Lucas. Marin Hinkle, as Miss Julie, and Reg Rogers, as her father's uppity valet Jean, spar and flirt, humiliate each other and humble themselves as expected, in the traditional kitchen, with the designated disastrous results. Chances are you won't believe a word of it (1:35). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)    * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'RAIN' Wild, witty, wet and altogether winning. Those words sum up Rain, the new Cirque Éloize show that is ending the season at the New Victory Theater with a figurative and literal splash. This Quebec-based troupe, which opened the New Victory in December 1995, combines high circus arts and ingratiating self-mockery with nostalgic costumes, eclectic music and song, evocative lighting and creative choreography in two hours of fun calculated to please children and adults alike (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs. Goldsmith's 1773 comedy mocks the snobbery of the London upper class, while piling on the slapstick, mistaken identities and farce (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Genzlinger)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100. ( Van Gelder)    'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Slight but pithy, this humorous revue of 18 songs with lyrics by Mark Campbell and music by 18 different composers takes a sardonic and explicit look at gay life in New York: ''Sex with an actor. What was I thinking?'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Presnyakovbrothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' The story is familiar, and the script and lyrics are not especially innovative, but somehow Stephen Dolginoff's pocket musical about the Leopold and Loeb murder case lands like a well-placed punch. Every time Doug Kreeger, as Loeb, and Matt Bauer, as Leopold, blend their voices in close harmony, it's a reminder that evil often looks and sounds beautiful (1:20). York Theater Company, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters and affecting but derivative music, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200.(Anita Gates)    Off Off Broadway    'DISCONNECT' Plant four witty, intellectually stimulating people around a dinner table and you might have an engaging play. Plant four uninsightful, insipid people around a dinner table and you have ''Disconnect,'' a new work by Rob Ackerman that lets some self-absorbed 30-somethings whine for two hours about lost friends and parental beatings of long ago (1:45). The Working Theater, at the East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Genzlinger)    'FLAT' This happily crass send-up of a BBC family drama is perfectly pitched for fans nostalgic for the self-parodying vulgarity of the sit-com ''Married With Children.'' Twelve episodes, quick scenes, stock characters and an opening montage sequence with a jingle that will lodge itself in your cranium, like it or not (1:00). Part of the Moral Values Festival. Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212)868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)    'MARATHON 2005, SERIES B' The second installment in this annual festival of short plays, which includes lively sketches by David Mamet and David Lindsay-Abaire, allows theatergoers the pleasure of hearing famous voices practicing scales, as it were, and of discovering that no matter what key they're singing in, they still sound like themselves (1:45). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101. (Brantley)    'RICHARD AND ANNE' That idiot Shakespeare had it all wrong, according to ''Richard and Anne,'' an unknown script by Maxwell Anderson that is being energetically brought to light by the young actors of Mirror Repertory's training program. Tired of being maligned in productions of ''Richard III,'' the real Richard, no hunched back evident, comes back from the grave to set things straight (2:15). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street, Manhattan, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)    'WORK: A MADCAP TRAGI-PARODY OF CORPORATE AMERICA' Unless you've been living in a cave, Charlotte Meehan's play ''Work: A Madcap Tragi-Parody of Corporate America,'' should sound familiar, starting with its title. But when real life tops fiction, what's left to say? Not much, in this case. And that's the problem (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)226-2407.(Andrea Stevens)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10).

Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    Last Chance    'BFE' Julia Cho's insightful drama about the agonies and comforts of isolation centers on a 14-year-old Asian-American girl (Olivia Oguma) who feels she isn't beautiful. The main characters force themselves to reach out to others, but all fail in some essential way (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday.(Gates)    'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, child-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday.(Miriam Horn)    'DAY IN THE LIFE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE' Talent and passion are overcome by banality in the first musical by the Broadway actor Josh Walden, who wrote the music, book and lyrics, choreographed the show, and directed. While the music and dance show occasional flair, the same cannot be said of the lyrics or book, a clichéd exhuming of the secrets behind 1950's facades (1:00). Flamboyan Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4080, closing tomorrow. (Horn)    * 'HOWIE THE ROOKIE' Mark O'Rowe's blood-and-guts-filled comic yarn, which features two baroque monologues climaxing in sudden, irresistible bursts of mayhem, tells a gangland story set in working-class Dublin. Despite being overproduced, the play packs a wallop (1:50). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. ( Zinoman)    'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'MARATHON 2005, SERIES A' A long, too often dreary evening of plays by a pair of Tony winners, John Guare and Warren Leight, and a pair of actress-playwrights, Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros and Leslie Lyles. Ms. Gersten-Vassilaros's contribution, ''The Airport Play,'' is the briefest and, perhaps not coincidentally, the best of the bunch (2:15). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101, closing tomorrow.(Isherwood)    '700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'TABLOID CALIGULA' Three excellent performances set off Darren Murphy's dark comedy, about a London thug hooked on Alexander the Great, in which the author has a lot of fun with language and the art of storytelling (1:30). Part of the Brits Off Broadway festival at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. ( Stevens)    'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (Not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali) A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)    'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish) This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)    * 'CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY' (No rating, 106 minutes, in Italian) In the contemporary political allegory from Italy, a disgruntled teacher and his family move from the country to Rome where his 12-year-old daughter finds herself the object of a furious tug-of-war between two cliques, one left-wing and bohemian, the other right-wing and materialist. Bold, richly textured, and entertaining.(Holden)    'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)    * 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)    * 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Manohla Dargis)    * 'THE HOLY GIRL' (Not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)    'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)    * 'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) A film about a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)    'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese) This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)    'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)    'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)    * 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French) A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)    'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)    * 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)    'THE NINTH DAY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in German) A somber, thought-provoking moral thriller, in which a Roman Catholic priest from Luxembourg, temporarily released from Dachau, finds his conscience tested when the Nazis try to co-opt him. Interesting ideas, insufficiently dramatized. (Scott)    'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)    'PALINDROMES' (Not rated, 100 minutes) The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)    'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes) This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)    * 'ROCK SCHOOL' (R, 93 minutes) Don Argott's alternately hilarious and alarming documentary centers on the titular founder of the Paul Green School of Rock Music and a handful of tender tots who yearn for a future filled with squealing electric guitars, battered drum kits and fully cranked amps. (Dargis)    'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes) It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)    'SAVING FACE' (R, 91 minutes) The amiable romantic comedy examines the lives of three generations of Chinese-Americans living in New York exudes a palpable love for its characters but ends up betraying its hard-headedness with instant, feel-good solutions to their problems. (Holden)    'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes) Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame that the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)    'THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING PANTS' (PG, 119 minutes) On a shopping trip, four teenage girls find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all four of them, despite their differing shapes and sizes. Deciding the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, wearing them for a week apiece and then mailing them to the next friend. Like the four girls at its center, this fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please film makes up in charm for what it lacks in sophistication. (Dana Stevens)    * 'STAR WARS: EPISODE III -- REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)    'WALK ON WATER' (Not rated, 104 minutes) The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Stevens)    * 'THE WHITE DIAMOND' (No rating, 90 minutes) Werner Herzog, in the jungles of Guyana, observes a small airship and its crew. This documentary is a record of his impressions and discoveries, and an essay on the complexities of nature in its wild and human varieties. It is an unassuming film, but nonetheless full of scenes and images that can only be described as sublime. (Scott)    'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (Not rated, 45 minutes) A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Kids will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful by this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity. (Ned Martel)    Film Series    JAMES DEAN (Through June 23) Fifty years after Dean's death at the age of 24, Film Forum is screening all three of his movies, beginning with Elia Kazan's ''East of Eden'' (1955), in which Dean plays John Steinbeck's tortured bad boy trying to win his father's love.

ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI, THE LILYS (Sunday and Monday) With their hip choral flourishes, kicky grooves and pep-rally shouts, the quirky collective Architecture in Helsinki makes happy baroque pop. Sunday's bill includes the Lilys, whose mercurial Kurt Heasley exuded charisma as both an early-90's shoegazer and later, an Anglophile retro-rocker. Sunday at 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $8 in advance, $10 at the door.

(Laura Sinagra)    THE BAD PLUS (Thursday) This piano-driven power trio's adventurous spirit straddles the boundaries of jazz and rock, and their exuberant forays are way more fun than their cover of Nirvana's ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' would suggest. The players, native Midwesterners all, throw themselves into live shows with prairie-fire earnestness. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $15, $20 at the door.(Sinagra)    ASHA BHOSLE (Tomorrow) In countless Bollywood musicals over the last 50 years, the sweet, high voice of the heroine is dubbed by Asha Bhosle, one of India's most celebrated playback singers. In this ''unplugged show,'' she'll be singing a small fraction of her hits with acoustic instruments, sharing the arena stage with Kumar Sanu and Sudesh Bhosle, who is not related to her. 8 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631)888-9000, $32 to $147. (Jon Pareles)    BLOC PARTY (Tuesday and Wednesday) Many bands steal sounds from the danceable punk of the early 80's, but few do it with the enthusiasm of this British group. It's become a sensation with local fans and for good reason. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600. $20 (sold out) (Sinagra)    CAMPBELL BROTHERS (Monday) The Campbell Brothers are part of the sacred steel tradition of the House of God Dominion church. It turns the steel guitar into a swooping, wailing lead instrument in gospel songs. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $15, $17 at the door. (Pareles)    SLAID CLEAVES (Tomorrow) This singer-songwriter writes thoughtful tunes about characters with pawn-shop wedding rings and cars that burn oil, trying to pull out of downward spirals. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)239-6200; $20. (Pareles)    KIMYA DAWSON (Tuesday) Ms. Dawson's band the Moldy Peaches' adorable dirty-kid rambles created an indie splash in 2001, but this former youth counselor endures on her own as a comedian and poet of geek love and underdog resilience. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103; $8. (Sinagra)    THE DEARS (Tomorrow) This Montreal indie rock band plays lush, urgent guitar songs about panicked slacker dismay over encroaching technology and the loss of an individuality. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15 (sold out).(Sinagra)    GENO DELAFOSE & FRENCH ROCKIN' BOOGIE (Tonight) Geno Delafose, the son of the zydeco accordionist John Delafose, holds on to the traditions of an older generation, pumping waltzes and two-steps on his button accordion. Like Clifton Chenier, he also dips deeply into the blues and rhythm-and-blues but keeps the music's old bayou flavor. 8 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155; $22. (Pareles)    THE GO BETWEENS (Tonight and Tomorrow) Blessed with two stellar songwriters -- the brooding Robert Forster and sublime Grant McLennan -- this Australian band recorded some of the best neo-romantic art pop of the 1980's. Since the duo's 2002 reunion, the disparity in their temperaments has resulted in a more discernable oscillation between light and dark sentiments in the music. Tonight at 10:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $16, $18 at the door (sold out).

(Sinagra)    IRON AND WINE (Thursday) The modern rustic Sam Beame takes a whispery, almost Chet Baker-like approach to folk vocals. Sung atop delicately plucked guitar, his lyrics speak to the sensitive male's concerns about intimacy and mortality. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village (212)353-1600; $18, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    RICKIE LEE JONES (Wednesday) Ms. Jones's Southwestern hippie roots give her urban-bohemian jazz leanings a willful whimsy. This outdoor set will cull from both the swooping reveries and ersatz street-corner jive of her 1970's releases as well as the best of her later albums. 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn; $3 suggested donation. (Sinagra)    JUDAS PRIEST, QUEENSRYCHE (Tonight) Rob Halford has brought his menacing baritone and dog-whistle howl back to the seminal late-70's British heavy-metal band that famously tried to carry on without him.

(Sinagra)    SANTANA, LOS LONELY BOYS (Tuesday) Carlos Santana has been a ''rock-en-espagñol'' progenitor and fusion guitar heavyweight for decades , but one of the most remarkable incarnations has been his recent one as lite-rock collaborator and impresario.

In short, Francesca is a kind of superwoman, a feminist fantasy figure sent back in time 300 years to give Casanova his comeuppance and perhaps collect his heart in the process.

She could be marched off for execution and her fretful gait, her expression, her silences would argue so strongly against any mere universal application of law that the firing squad would fall apart arguing.In \\"French Provincial\\" the young director André Téchiné has sent Miss Moreau trundling down a long, heavily furnished corridor of a movie about the multigenerational rise and fall of a French bourgeois family. By no subtle extension it argues through its particular provincial setting the decline and dissolution of bourgeois France.Miss Moreau implants all kinds of cross-rhythms in Mr. Téchiné's ponderous though talented work, with its air of a nineteenth-century novel. She arrests the predictable playing-out of his cards","excerpt":"she enhances his uneven strengths.\\"French Provincial,\\" which will be shown tonight and tomorrow at Lincoln Center, is set around the fortunes of a family-owned foundry in a small French town. It was founded by Pedret, a young immigrant from Spain who by hard work and a driving vision built it up out of a simple smithy, and married the daughter of a prosperous local family as well.This is told in flashback. Most of the film takes place when Pedret has become the family patriarch, running the business with his three grown sons and dominating the life of the town. One trenchant scene shows the family going to the local movie theater in the same hierarchial fashion that an English squire and his family would go to church.Sturdy as one of his iron boilers, bearded and mystically devoted to the foundry, old Pedret represents for Téchiné the vitality the bourgeoisie once had. The three sons, in different ways, are the class in decadence.There are two marriages. One brings in Régina, a cold, spoiled girl who nests in the family like a leech, and eventually runs off with an American soldier. The other brings in Berthe, the town laundry woman.Berthe — Jeanne Moreau—is vital, passionate and strong. She has an affair with Hector, most likable of the three sons, and when the family intervenes, threatens to leave town.Miss Moreau flickers fiercely, unpredictably, a hawk who lets herself be caught. Take one scene, for example. She has been snubbed by the family, and her laundry business is being boycotted.We see her in her kitchen, making herself dinner. She beats the omelet, muttering banal phrases on the lines of \\"It will pass,\\" \\"What's the difference?\\" She chops salad, she pours wine. Each action is like assembling a bomb. The bomb goes off. In a magnificent Moreanuvian reversal she suddenly sweeps out — abandoning omelet, salad and wine — goes to the foundry, and rallies Hector to defy his family.Old Pedret can't afford to lose Hector, who is the works manager, so he pragmatically decides they must marry. The lesson: The bourgeoisie will co-opt members of the proletariat when necessary.Berthe is new blood: when Pedret dies she takes over. Emotionally she is of the people—at the film's start she gets a job for Pierre, who will eventually lead the workers in strike against her—but she is pulled unwillingly away. Only during the war—when she drives a munitions truck for the resistance group run by Pierre—does some of the old emotional unity come back. As did France's.The war ends. She, not Pierre, gets a medal. Pierre, the militant union man, is won over to the bland new European style of worker-management cooperation. But the foundry itself is going under, in competition with big multinational firms. Only American money can save it. It comes—with Regina and her American lover who also happens to be a big businessman. At the end we see Regina and the American making love under the portrait of old Pedret.By this time the movie has collapsed under the increasingly coarse style that Téchiné adopts to symbolize his thesis of capitalist collapse. It isn't helped by the fact that his Americans, speak English with grotesque French and German accents and look like something out of Krokodil.Miss Moreau lies helplessly in bed. She can do no more to save the foundry: It will probably go on, but it won't be hers or even French. On the other hand, she has almost saved the movie.

EINSTEIN IN LOVE: A Scientific Romance, by Dennis Overbye. (Viking, $27.95.) An antiromance, really, in which Overbye, the deputy science editor of The Times, applies recent discoveries about Einstein to examine both his scientific work and his emotional life; in the end, he portrays the great scientist as a rat with women and an irresponsible father.    ONE DROP OF BLOOD: The American Misadventure of Race, by Scott L. Malcomson. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $30.) A bold effort to erase the border between insider and outsider views of race, tracing the American invention of white and nonwhite categories as well as the racial histories of Indians, African-Americans, white Americans and Oakland, Calif., the author's hometown.    THE QUICK AND THE DEAD, by Joy Williams. (Knopf, $25.) An intelligent, unsettling, audacious, virtuosic, improbable novel that may not want the reader's affection; the protagonist, a motherless girl of 15 in the desert Southwest and an absolutist animal lover, certainly doesn't.    THE BRIDEGROOM: Stories, by Ha Jin. (Pantheon, $22.) Twelve stories set, like the author's novel ''Waiting,'' in provincial (but for American readers, exotic) Muji City, where, as China approaches capitalism, all kinds of tyrannies, personal and institutional, beset inoffensive people who just want to get by.    THE HILL BACHELORS, by William Trevor. (Viking, $22.95.) Short stories, generous and exploratory rather than clinical or satiric, though corrupted or depraved characters are most vivid; often animated and provoked by reflections on the Troubles in Ireland, where Trevor was born, though he has lived in England for decades.    PARIS TO THE MOON, by Adam Gopnik. (Random House, $24.95.) Essays about France, that admirable country, by the Paris correspondent of The New Yorker from 1995 to 2000; written for the magazine but now augmented with new and sometimes more personal material, they make a serious intellectual project of inspecting the details of middle-class life.

In this sequel to ''The Liars' Club'' (1995), Karr elaborates the adolescence that leads her to leave home at 17; the most mundane events (first kiss, etc.) are rendered in gorgeous prose, the sexual adventures are both mild and sweet, and we hear hardly anything intended to characterize the 1960's.

My son immediately asked if he could take a girlfriend instead of his mom. While my husband reassured me that I would see ''Tosca'' someday, all I could remember was my mom's words: ''Your son is your son until he meets his wife. Your daughter is your daughter for the rest of your life.''    With this adage ringing in my ears, I gave away my tickets with great trepidation. So entered Sue, accompanying my son to the performance. The opera must have been great, because Peter has since married Sue and I have a new best friend.    For six years, it has felt as if Sue and I have not stopped talking, laughing, crying and sharing. I am a second-grade teacher in Westport, and Sue has taught second and third grades in Woodbridge and Greenwich. We never tire of sharing lessons and exchanging stories, retreating to a quiet place for our discussions after our husbands have grown weary of ''school talk.'' Over the past year, Sue has shared something else: 13-month-old Madeline Stern, whom we recognize as another best friend in training.     Recently I called my mother with a new version of her saying:    ''Your son is your son until he meets his wife.    ''Then he brings home a friend for the rest of your life.''
