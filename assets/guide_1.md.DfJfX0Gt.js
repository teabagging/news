The tale, which inspired at least 65 composers besides Rossini, concerns the legendary Babylonian queen who helped a lover murder her husband and then unwittingly chose her own son as the replacement king. Hamlet and Gertrude, meet Oedipus and Jocasta. Although in some versions, Semiramide's life is spared -- the Assyrian legend has her disappear in the form of a dove -- the Met's John Copley production opts for a classically bloody ending: the repentant queen is stabbed as she intervenes in a fight between the former lover and the son.

Mexico's Amber Miners Find Risk, Not Riches"},{"year":"2002","title":"THE BEAUTY OF THE HUSBAND: A Fictional Essay in 29 Tangos, by Anne Carson. (Vintage Contemporaries, $12.) This Canadian poet, whose unclassifiable work is steeped in a deep knowledge of Hellenic literature as well as philosophy, fiction and other fields, brings her elusive, free-associative style to bear on the story of a marital breakup and ''the dilemma of desire.'' Last year our reviewer, Daphne Merkin, was struck by Carson's ''refusal to edit out the personal, even at its most pathetically lovelorn,'' and said, ''I don't think there has been a book since Robert Lowell's 'Life Studies' that has advanced the art of poetry quite as radically.''    THE END OF TIME: The Next Revolution in Physics, by Julian Barbour. (Oxford University, $16.95.) Here's a daunting premise: time does not exist. A theoretical physicist replaces the conventional notion of reality with a ''many worlds'' interpretation of the universe that accounts for our temporal experiences even as it refines Einstein's ideas about space, time and gravity. Remarkably, this is ''a wonderfully accessible book'' in which ''Barbour leaves his mark on every topic he considers, including the arrow of time and the origins of the Big Bang,'' Simon W. Saunders wrote here in 2000.    DIRTY HAVANA TRILOGY: A Novel in Stories, by Pedro Juan Guti&#233","excerpt":"rrez. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $13.95.) The supremely macho narrator of this Cuban novel is a former journalist who has fallen out with the Castro regime and been reduced to poverty in Havana, where only marijuana and sex (mostly the latter) keep him afloat. The tale ''is not only entertaining; it's also curiously uplifting as it illuminates the darker places of a society on the brink,'' Karl Taro Greenfeld said in the Book Review last year.    BELLOW: A Biography, by James Atlas. (Modern Library, $16.95.) In his encyclopedic portrait of the writer Saul Bellow (still going strong in his latter 80's), the author beat all the bushes to trace his personal life and achievements, drawing on more than a decade's worth of research. ''A biographer more scrupulous than Atlas is hard to imagine,'' John Leonard wrote here in 2000. ''I could no more stop reading his biography than I could stop reading Saul Bellow after he blew the blinds off the windows in my head.''    ISLAM'S BLACK SLAVES: The Other Black Diaspora, by Ronald Segal. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $14.) Slavery in the Muslim world began long before the Atlantic slave trade but has been much less documented. The author examines its roots, its purposes and its persistence today in places like Sudan and Mauritania. Last year our reviewer, Adam Hochschild, found the narrative bland but said, ''Segal deserves great credit for putting the history of Islamic slavery on the record in a carefully documented way.''    SISTER INDIA, by Peggy Payne. (Riverhead, $14.) This novel's fierce protagonist is a 400-pound American woman who tries to banish a horrific sin from her memory by fleeing to the holy Indian city of Varanasi, where she runs a guesthouse and walls herself off until a violent event frees her from her past. ''Payne has created one of the more unsettling and mesmerizing characters in expatriate literature,'' Deborah Mason wrote here in 2001.    AMONG THE MISSING, by Dan Chaon. (Ballantine, $12.95.) The people wandering through these short stories -- some die, some bear witness, some survive and others simply vanish -- are always coming and going, with little certainty but lots of questions about their inner lives. The collection is unnerving but ''hums with life and wry humor,'' our reviewer, Beverly Lowry, wrote in 2001. The tales ''sneak resolutely up on you, like new weather that hits before you know it.''    BERLIN IN LIGHTS: The Diaries of Count Harry Kessler (1918-1937). Translated and edited by Charles Kessler. (Grove, $17.) A member of the German upper crust, an aesthete with a social conscience, chronicles life in Europe between the wars, and his encounters with such figures as Einstein and Jean Cocteau. ''What distinguishes his diary . . . is Kessler's distanziert tone -- its elegance, precision and shrewdness,'' Iain Bamforth said here in 2000.    THE FORGER, by Paul Watkins. (Picador USA, $14.) This intricately plotted novel revolves around an American painter living in Paris in 1939 who is recruited to forge works by old masters that can be traded to Nazi art dealers for genuine masterpieces. Watkins can ''create a wartime sensibility in which every footfall on the stairs has you holding your breath in anticipation,'' Katharine Weber wrote here in 2000.

(Anchor, $14.) This novel, chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2001, tells two tales -- that of the legendary ''steel-driving man'' John Henry and that of J. Sutter, a black freelance journalist and avid junketeer whose interior crisis of manhood is played out against a backdrop of today's pop-crazed consumer society and the publicity machine that fuels it. The result is a ''funny and wise and sumptuously written'' tale, Jonathan Franzen wrote in these pages.    FARGO ROCK CITY: A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural N&#246","excerpt":"rth Dak&#246;ta, by Chuck Klosterman. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.) In a hymn to the golden age of hair metal bands (think spandex, makeup and power chords), a music and film critic tells of growing up in a farm town where pop Satanism and flamboyant excess were his heartland values. ''As goofy as its subject, 'Fargo Rock City' is part memoir, part barstool rant, and it is ridiculously engaging,'' Eric Weisbard said here last year.    CRAWLING AT NIGHT, by Nani Power. (Grove, $13.) This dark first novel centers on a pair of losers -- a Japanese sushi chef in Manhattan and an alcoholic waitress -- who fall for each other and hit the road in a doomed attempt to restore grace to their lives. Power is ''a formidable young writer,'' Dwight Garner wrote here in 2001, and her book ''casts a squalid, neon-lit kind of erotic spell.''    YEAR OF WONDERS: A Novel of the Plague, by Geraldine Brooks. (Penguin, $14.) The author's first work of fiction unfolds through the eyes of a servant in the household of a rector in a 17th-century English village devastated by twin calamities: the plague, which kills two-thirds of the villagers, and the quarantine the community imposes on itself. ''Brooks has clearly done her homework,'' John Vernon said here in 2001. ''She gives us what we want from historical fiction: a glimpse into the strangeness of history that simultaneously enables us to see a reflection of ourselves.''    BODY OF SECRETS: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency, by James Bamford. (Anchor, $14.95.) The follow-up to ''The Puzzle Palace,'' the author's landmark 1982 account of the N.S.A., tracks the ups and downs of the world's largest spy organization. ''Not only is this the definitive book on America's most secret agency, but it is also an extraordinary work of investigative journalism, a galvanizing narrative brimming with heretofore undisclosed details,'' Joseph Finder said in these pages last year.    THE RIGHT HAND OF SLEEP, by John Wray. (Vintage, $14.) In rural Austria in the 1930's, three characters -- a tormented World War I deserter, the woman he loves and her cousin, the local SS commander -- witness the rise of Nazism. Last year our reviewer, Carey Harrison, called this first novel by a young American of Austrian descent ''a truly arresting work of fiction'' whose ''unfashionable tone, elliptical and odd, authenticates its individuality.''    A LIFE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: Innocent Beginnings, 1917-1950, by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $15.) The celebrated historian crammed an awful lot into his first 33 years, judging from this memoir, including a formidable roster of friendships, a precocious academic career and the Pulitzer-worthy ''Age of Jackson.'' His history of himself includes a wide array of historical and cultural insights, as well as ''generous doses of gossip, bursts of self-mockery and rewarding riffs on a great many subjects,'' Max Frankel wrote in the Book Review in 2000.    THE FAITHFUL NARRATIVE OF A PASTOR'S DISAPPEARANCE, by Benjamin Anastas. (Picador USA, $13.) Sure, there is a disappearance -- a young mixed-race pastor vanishes from his New England parish -- but this seductive novel is mainly about the conspicuous consumption and spiritual malaise of a ''typical'' family in a grossly swollen suburb. The result is ''an extended, sometimes hilarious double take on American culture,'' Jacqueline Carey wrote in these pages last year.    SOLOMON'S SWORD: Two Families and the Children the State Took Away, by Michael Shapiro. (Westview, $18.) Focusing on two notorious custody cases involving child abuse and neglect, a journalism professor examines what happens when the courts separate children from their parents. ''In crisp, heartfelt prose,'' he shows ''indelibly how even the best intentions can go tragically awry,'' Barry Werth said here in 1999.

The Flemish master, it turned out, revised the painting some 20 years after he first executed it, in 1609, adding a self-portrait and changing the Virgin's posture. The discovery prompted the museum to organize an exhibition, which opened yesterday, on the evolution of Rubens's style. The show features a radiographic study showing how the painting looked before Rubens's revisions and has original sketches and an anonymous copy of the 1609 version. The most significant changes in the painting were made to the Virgin, whose beauty ''is more natural and more modest in the definitive version,'' said the exhibition's curator, Alejandro Vergara. Her cloak was also transformed from a soft pink to a bolder red and blue. Rubens revised the painting during his second trip to Spain, from 1628 to 1629. The exhibition runs through Feb. 27.

It is grim and sordid, but at the same time a picture which is enormously helped by its definite dramatic value. There are times when exaggerations occur, but, after allowing for them, it is a narrative which like \\"Today We Live,\\" the first of Mr. Faulkner's literary efforts to be filmed, can boast of no little originality. Whether it will prove a satisfactory diversion for the general run of cinemagoers is problematical.Oliver H. P. Garrett is responsible for the script and Stephen Roberts directed this offering. The principal rôles are acted by Miriam Hopkins, Jack LaRue, William Gargan, William Collier Jr., Irving Pichel and Florence Eldridge. It is a well chosen cast. Miss Hopkins delivers a capital portrayal as Temple Drake, granddaughter of a Southern judge. Temple is a wild, reckless young person, who scorns a sober dance in her native town, preferring to join the inebriated Toddy Gowan, who is scarcely in a fit condition to drive a car. While they are racing along at sixty miles an hour the automobile swerves and leaves the road. Toddy suffers a few lacerations of his face, but Temple is unhurt.It is at this point that the sinister-eyed Trigger (Mr. LaRue) enters the tale. He is a bootlegger who does not hesitate to use his pistol. He has terrified the persons in the squalid, filthy place where Toddy and Temple are forced by Trigger to take refuge. Here one finds Tommy, a weak-minded lad","excerpt":"Ruby Lemar, a pathetic example of white trash, and Lee Goodwin, who, big as he is, appreciates that a bullet is mightier than a fist. Trigger has a habit of showing the whites of his eyes, and never does a smile cross his forbidding countenance. His pistol is always ready. He kills Tommy as if he were a dog and then decides to force Temple to go with him to \\"the city.\\" Lee is arrested for the murder of Tommy, and he prefers to take his chances of hanging rather than mention Trigger's name.Among several stirring scenes in this production is that in which Stephen Benbow, a young lawyer who is in love with Temple, discovers where she has been taken, and he would have been shot by Trigger had not Temple insisted that she had run away with the gangster. Another gripping sequence is the struggle between Temple and Trigger in which she kills him.There are loopholes in the story as it comes to the screen, but the adroitly sustained suspense atones for such shortcomings. Besides Miss Hopkins's clever impersonation, splendid work is contributed by Mr. Pichel as Lee, Mr. Gargan as Benbow, Mr. LaRue as the frightening Trigger, Mr. Collier as Toddy, Sir Guy Standing as Temple's grandfather and Florence Eldridge as the unfortunate Ruby.\\"Nautical Melody.\\"The stage numbers include Vincent Lopez and his orchestra, who perform in \\"Nautical Melody\\" and \\"Drummer's Delight.\\" In the course of this part of the program there are acrobatic stunts by Les Gezzis, two men who won hearty applause, and clever dancing by a troupe of girls.Other performers include Benny Rubin, Tita Coral, Madronna and Dona, Paco Moreno and Bob Ripa.

(AP) AUTO RACING  Peugeot Troika Wins 24 Hours of Le Mans  Defending champion Peugeot swept the top three places in the prestigious 24-hour Le Mans endurance race yesterday in France, holding off a fading challenge by Toyota, whose powerhouse racers were plagued by mishaps and structural problems. Toyota was fourth with one of its TS010 cars. Thousands of racing fans swarmed around the finish area where the Peugeot 905, piloted by Australian Geoff Brabham, took the checkered flag under a beating sun at 4 P.M. (local time), 24 hours after taking off in the grueling annual race. (AP) Martin On Empty","excerpt":"Rudd in Winner's Circle: Mark Martin's empty gas tank was the difference as Ricky Rudd inherited the lead nine laps from the finish and went on to victory in the Miller Genuine Draft 400 at Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich. Martin led for 141 of the 200 laps but knew he was in trouble after making a green-flag pit stop with 55 laps to go. He came out of that pit-stop shuffle on top, but knowing that his Ford Thunderbird, despite being easily the fastest car on the track, could not make it to the end without one last splash of gas. Meanwhile, Rudd, who announced Saturday he will field his own Winston Cup team next season, was able to stretch his final stop to lap 150 and was nearly certain he could go the distance. Steve Hmiel, Martin's crew chief, told his driver over the radio to pit on lap 190, but changed his mind, telling him to take one more lap. It turned out to be a mistake as Martin ran out of gas on the backstretch and had to coast to the pits. (AP) GOLF  Rodriguez Triumphs by Two Strokes  Chi Chi Rodriguez, winner of only one tournament the past two seasons, shot a seven-under-par 65 yesterday to win the inaugural Burnet Senior Classic in Coon Rapids, Minn., by two strokes over Bob Murphy and Jim Colbert. Rodriguez, second on the career Senior PGA Tour money list, birdied four consecutive holes -- 8 through 11 -- to take the lead for good at the Bunker Hills Golf Course. He then parred the next six holes before wrapping up his only title of 1993 with a birdie on 18. (AP) Green Repels Sheehan for Victory: Tammie Green held off defending champion Patty Sheehan to win the Ladies Professional Golf Association Rochester International by one stroke. Green's two-under-par 70 in the final round was a far cry from her career-best 63 Saturday, but it gave her a 72-hole total of 276, her third L.P.G.A. victory and the $75,000 winner's check. She had four birdies and two bogeys in the final round that was interrupted by a half-hour rain delay in the afternoon. (AP) SOCCER  Mexico Ties Argentina in America Cup  Mexico dominated defending champion Argentina but managed only a 1-1 tie in a Group C in an America Cup game yesterday in Guayaquil, Ecuador yesterday. David Patino put the Mexicans ahead in the 15th minute and Oscar Ruggeri tied in the 28th. Argentine goalkeeper Sergio Goycoechea made several good saves in denying Mexico the deciding goal. Argentina leads Group C with 3 points and is in good position to move into the quarterfinals. Mexico, with 1 point, will need a good result Wednesday against Bolivia in order to advance. Colombia, which beat Mexico, 2-1, in the first game, tied Bolivia, 1-1, in a late game. (AP) China Defeats Iraq in World Cup Qualifier: China beat Iraq, 2-1, and Jordan took a 4-0 first half lead en route to a 5-0 victory over Pakistan yesterday in Beijing in the World Cup Asian Zone Group A qualifying tournament. Despite its loss, Iraq will move on to the second round of the Asian Zone qualifying tournament by virtue of its 6-1-1 record. China was next at 6-2-0. (AP) Real Madrid Loss Means Title for Barcelona: In a stunning repetition of last season's dramatic finale, Tenerife shocked Real Madrid, 2-0, yesterday to hand F.C. Barcelona its third consecutive championship of the Spanish league. Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoichkov snapped out of his slump to lead Barcelona to a 1-0 victory over Real Sociedad. Argentine forward Oscar Alberto Dertycia, meanwhile, scored Tenerife's first goal to send it on its way to victory over Real Madrid. The stunning conclusion marked the second season in a row in which Real Madrid entered the final week of the season with a 1-point lead in the standing only to lose to Tenerife and see the title taken from its grasp. (AP) BOXING  Norris Knockdown Gave His Corner a Scare  The official record of Saturday night's super-welterweight championship fight will show that Terry Norris retained his World Boxing Council title by defeating Australian Troy Waters. He won when Waters failed to answer the bell for the fourth round. What the record won't convey is that Norris's camp suffered some nightmarish moments when Waters knocked Norris to the canvas in the second round. The knockdown stunned Norris; his manager, Joe Sayatovich and the 11,646 fans at the Sports Arena. Norris had knocked down Waters in the opening round and then did so again in the third, with a crisp right to the head. When the badly cut Waters was unable to answer the bell for the fourth round, the fight was over. Until Saturday night, Norris had only been knocked down once in his career; in 1989 in a loss to Julian Jackson. Since that defeat, Norris has run off 14 straight victories to improve his record to 35-3 with 20 knockouts.

The visitors wear fur topped by snappy red uniforms. In the children's acute-care units of Yale-New Haven Hospital, smiles are all too often missing. Tuesday afternoons, however, it's another story. Then, an unusual breed of volunteers arrives at the wards, tails wagging, enormous paws on beds, and tongues tickling every little face that leans forward. The canine candy-stripers tour the rooms with their handlers: Chukker and Sirius, golden retrievers, and their respective owners, Barbara McCullough and Marian Spiro","excerpt":"Rufus, a chocolate lab, with Vicki Chave Clement, and Cricket, a mixed breed, with Bonnie King. Each team visits once a month on a rotating basis. The Dog Visitation Program that spreads such cheer through the children's, adolescent and psychiatric pediatric units is a one-year pilot that was started  in March. Its popularity is evident not only in the patient rooms but also in the corridors, where each dog, like a wooly Pied Piper, collects a trail of staffers, visitors and children in wheelchairs. While the dogs obviously share in the enjoyment, they can be distracted. Chukker is reluctant to tear himself away from a nose-level aquarium in the hallway and, Ms. McCullough admitted, \\"We have to turn off television during the visits. Chukker would rather watch the Muppets than visit. He's also very turned on by stuffed animals.\\" Permission to enter a room is always obtained from the parent and care taken that the dog visit is appropriate. For instance, a child who is in the hospital  as a result of a dog attack is not a likely prospect. Usually, however, wan children perk up and reach out to pat when the dogs appear. Most children leave the hospital in less than a week but those who stay longer form a close bond with the dogs. One 8-year-old boy, hospitalized for a liver transplant, was even allowed a visit while in intensive care. \\"It was very touching to see the child reach out to the dog; the only thing he could move was his hand because he had tubes everywhere else,\\" recalled the volunteer program coordinator, Annie Garcia Kaplan. Another child, who had been receiving chemotherapy, could not have a dog in his  room. No problem; he and the dog were held up on opposite sides of the room window, giving each other kisses through the glass. It was Ms. McCullough, a former nurse, who proposed the dog visitations. \\"I'd read about these programs in nursing homes, and I knew about the one at Gaylord  Rehabilitation Hospital,\\" she said. \\"I thought, 'I haven't been back to the bedside in so long and this is the way I want to do it.' But I wanted to do it in the acute care, because I felt the need was so great.\\" She approached the director of volunteer services at Yale-New Haven, Jeannette Hodge, who suggested looking at the program at Newington Children's Hospital, which then helped in the planning. The trial program took more than two years to develop, Ms. Hodge said. \\"It was a very novel idea,\\" she said. \\"There are not a lot of large medical centers like ours doing this kind of program. Most are convalescent homes, children's hospitals or rehab settings. We needed to look at all the ramifications of bringing animals into a setting where many of our patients are very, very sick. \\"The challenge came in being certain that we had thought of everything single thing in terms of vet protocol, screening of the owners, screening of the dog, the timing. All things took time to really think through to be sure we thought of everything.\\" Ms. McCullough also recruited Dr. Eleanor Weir, a veterinarian and professor of  comparative medicine at Yale School of Medicine. Dr. Weir is a Madison resident  as are the dog and owner teams, except for Ms. King who lives in New Haven. In developing the veterinary protocol Dr. Weir talked with colleagues involved in similar programs. An epidemiologist also was consulted to be certain the young patients were not exposed to unnecessary health problems as a result of bringing in animals, and to determine how to screen patients who could not see the animals for medical reasons. \\"The dogs have to go through two types of testing,\\" Dr. Weir said. \\"They have to have passed the Kennel Club Canine Good Citizen's test, which is just to show the dog is well-mannered and will tolerate a certain amount of stress, like hair pulling. They also have a behavioral and physical exam by a vet, for health reasons.\\" The physical exams are rigorous and are repeated every six months to be sure the dogs are not harboring organisms that put the patients at risk. In addition, the dogs, particularly the long-haired golden retrievers who love their daily swim in Long Island Sound, must be arduously groomed and scrutinized for fleas and ticks before each hospital visit. Why are dogs so quick to touch the hearts of children who are otherwise unresponsive? \\"Animals are not threatening,\\" explained Ms. Kaplan. \\"When children come here, unfortunately, they may perceive humans as doing all sorts of poking and examining, but they know the animal is only coming to give them love. They feel the hair, the sense of tranquillity. It also may be that the child misses a pet at home.\\" She recalled the experience of one young patient in the psychiatric inpatient children's unit. \\"He had a serious, aggressive behavior problem and wanted nothing to do with the dog. But once he sat down with the dog, the change was instantaneous. He even insisted on giving it his own stuffed animal. The rest of the day and the next morning, his behavior was perfect.\\" The staff later learned that the boy's own dog had been shot in a housing complex as he watched. If there is any problem with the trial program, it is that there are not more dogs. Everyone wants the visitors. \\"Once while we were going up to the unit with one of the dogs, we ran into a lady here in the hallway,\\" Ms. Kaplan recalled. \\"She insisted we come up to see  her son. But he was in the adult unit and we didn't have permission. This young  man was hooked into a heart monitor and his mother went upstairs, got permission to unhook him, and the next thing we knew, he was down here.\\" Ms. McCullough noted that nurses in neonatal unit staff have requested that the dogs visit to relieve stress there. \\"We hope we can meet these special needs and recruit more dogs once the year's trial is over,\\" she said. Meanwhile, her wish for the program is \\"For children to say their strongest memory of the hospital was that, 'A dog came to visit me.' Then I'll know we've  been a success.\\"    The View From: Yale-New Haven Hospital;Cold Wet Noses That Lift The Spirits of Young Patients"},{"year":"1930","title":"declines to run for Cong SLEMP DECLINES TO RUN.","excerpt":"Rufuses Nomination for Congress in 9th Virginia District."},{"year":"1921","title":"A \\"woman of mystery,\\" according to the view of the police, because she refused to give either her name or address when she was found yesterday morning by two autoists, staggering along a lonely stretch of Riverside Drive, near 198th Street, where she had ...   \\"WOMAN OF MYSTERY\\"","excerpt":"Rufuses to Tell Name or Address and Says Robbers Beat Her at 198th Street."},{"year":"1946","title":"Named Burn-Smith Co vp and Eastern mgr Advertising News and Notes","excerpt":"Rug Advertising Is Down"},{"year":"1932","title":"Death JACOB HORN DIES AT 80.","excerpt":"Rug and Carpet Manufacturer Suc- cumbs on His Birthday."},{"year":"1940","title":"Leases Madison Av store LEASE LARGE SPACE AT 80 MADISON AVE.","excerpt":"Rug and Drapery Importers Take Store, Basement and Two Floors BROADWAY TAVERN RENTED Noted Spot for Lawyers and Business Men in City Hall Area to Be Restored"},{"year":"1960","title":"Ganz, Louis LOUIS GANZ DIES AT 96","excerpt":"Rug and Linoleum Layer 63 Years Worked for One Firm"},{"year":"1930","title":"Rug and upholstery men deny planning wage cut DENY PLANNING WAGE CUTS.","excerpt":"Rug and Upholstery Men Say Union Aims at Philadelphia Plant."},{"year":"1928","title":"BUSINESS WORLD","excerpt":"Rug Auction Starts April 9."},{"year":"1940","title":"AWAIT DISCOUNT PLAN","excerpt":"Rug Buyers Delay Orders Until Smith Company Acts"},{"year":"1937","title":"Wkly linage repts by Advertising Age Advertising News and Notes","excerpt":"Rug Campaign in Roto"},{"year":"1940","title":"Ad plans Advertising News","excerpt":"Rug Campaigns Break Soon"},{"year":"1942","title":"A Smith & Sons Carpet Co and Masland Wilton Mills agree to FPC order to change terms for oriental types TRADE COMMISSION CASES","excerpt":"Rug Companies Agree to Change Terms for Oriental Types"},{"year":"1939","title":"TRADE COMMISSION CASES","excerpt":"Rug Concern Agrees to Quit Use of Misleading Names"},{"year":"1964","title":"The Hightstown Rug Company has sold the plant and 6.6 acres of land it has occupied since 1886 on Bank Street in Hightstown, N.

Filmed in the three-dimensional process, which is superfluous and annoying, in this case, it is an admirable job of screen reporting, a match in the fact-fiction field to the official combat documentary, \\"This Is Korea.\\" released two years ago.With a skeleton crew of technicians, Mr. Crump went to Korea last spring with the idea of doing a picture that would manifest the nature of war and the irony of the expression, \\"A quiet day on the front.\\" The permission and cooperation of the Department of Defense was obtained and the area occupied by the Seventh Division was set as a locale. A cast of \\"actors\\" was assembled from actual Army combat personnel, and Mr. Crump began his brand of shooting, both on the front and in the immediate rear.Adventures of a PlatoonThe line of dramatic action laid down as the basis of the film was that of the perils and adventures of an infantry platoon, sent out under the command of a lieutenant to do a reconnaissance patrol behind enemy lines. And since the cessation of hostilities appeared imminent at the time it was contrived so that the action of the drama would appear to occur on the day of the \\"cease fire.\\"To the credit of Mr. Crump and his associates, including the soldiers who comprised his \\"company,\\" their achievement—though largely re-enactment—must be said to have a harsh, authentic ring. From the routine selection of the detail to undertake the job to the final assault upon a hilltop and the decimation of an enemy force, the operations of the detail are vivid and plausible. And though the soldiers who do the performing demonstrate no professional acting skill, their crude and cryptic behavior is as G. I. as the uniforms they wear or the formidable paraphernalia of rifles and grenades they tote.Viewpoint Is ObjectiveCapt. Roy Thompson Jr. as the lieutenant, does perhaps the most effective job of suggesting individual tension, because of the decisive nature of the role he plays. But other of the men—including some who were subsequently wounded or killed—manifest the personal idiosyncrasies of an average platoon of G. I.'s. No profound human drama is attempted, except in the instance of one man, a Korean attached to the outfit, and this appears slightly contrived. Thus, the viewpoint is kept objective, which is best for such a film. Anxiety is not stirred for any individual, but it is strong for the welfare of the patrol.The one phony aspect of the picture is a bit of occasional by-play worked in when the footage was taken over by Hal Wallis for a Paramount release. This is a scrappy patter of rueful comments in which a group of newspaper correspondents presumably indulge, while waiting at Panmunjom for the armistice on that last day of the war. It is supposed to point up the irony of that final \\"quiet day\\" patrol, but it only points up the irony of trying to gild the courage and sacrifice of men. And the latter is what is presented, in a blunt, honest way, in this film.Incidentally, this is the picture from which the administrators of the Production Code compelled the removal of three \\"hells\\" and a \\"damn.\\" That is certainly an irony about which nothing need be said.Clark, Infantrymen Are GuestsGen. Mark W. Clark, former Supreme Commander of the United Nations Forces in Korea, and nine combat infantrymen who enacted featured roles in \\"Cease Fire!\\" were guests of honor at the premiere last night.After the screening, which was attended by a large audience, including military leaders, Government officials, United Nations delegates and entertainment figures, General Clark and the Korean veterans, numbering one officer and eight enlisted men, were introduced in a stage ceremony and later honored at a Paramount reception at the Astor Hotel.
