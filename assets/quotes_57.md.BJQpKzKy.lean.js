Surrounding well-made, well-played songs, the visual and sonic barrage turns disorientation into pure euphoria.   Curve's focal point is its singer, Toni Halliday. As Debbie Smith, Alex Mitchell and Dean Garcia hunched over their guitars, now and then moving aimlessly amid the flashing lights, Ms. Halliday prowled the front of the stage, casting baleful eyes on the crowd and half-dancing to Steve Monti's relentless drumbeat. In the days before punk-rock, her airy mezzo-soprano would have carried tender tidings, but Ms. Halliday is an heir to Siouxsie Sioux of the Banshees and the Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde.

With the current downsizing of America, however, their voices and messages have regained stunning relevance.         \\"Lifelines\\" is the title of an album Peter Yarrow, Noel Paul Stooky and Mary  Travers released last year.

The daughter of Johnny Cash, she released her first album in 1979 and was immediately recognized as one of country music's freshest singer-songwriters. Those familiar with her much-publicized private life (her marriage to the country star Rodney Crowell, which ended in divorce four years ago, was tabloid manna) will spot bits and pieces of it scattered throughout her first collection of stories and sketches, BODIES OF WATER (Hyperion, $19.95), some of which reads more like autobiography than fiction. But there is no angry score-settling in this pensive book, which takes as its subject the landmarks of a woman's life: love, marriage, childbirth, disillusion, renewal. Unusually for a lyricist, Ms. Cash has a straightforward, sharp-eyed prose style (\\"I was 22 years old, and my feet  were a little too big for my body. . . . I had two cats -- a serious mistake --  as I had been looking for an image and thought they might help\\") and, despite a  few awkwardly self-conscious patches, her first book reads like the work of a far more experienced writer. This is not \\"celebrity\\" fiction: it is a collection of stories that happens to have been written by a celebrity, and it is very good.

This was too bad. Ms. Peebles, a soul singer from Memphis who is starting up a career she abandoned some 20 years ago, was bringing the audience to a consensus, the first step to putting on a classic show. By starting out slowly, and by suggesting emotional commitment without histrionics, by adhering to a type of soul minimalism, she made the large and party-hungry crowd pay attention. Then, with a careful attention to melody and the nuance of each song's narrative, she began tearing the house apart, slowly, using soul as a type of trance music.   Enter a 5- or 10-minute break. But when she started up again, Ms. Peebles hadn't really slowed down that much, and she patiently built momentum. Singing songs like \\"Fear No Evil,\\" from her new album \\"Full Time Love\\" (Rounder), and ending with her biggest hit, \\"I Can't Stand the Rain,\\" she kept the audience involved. And where soul often enough relies on extroversion, the explosive eruption of emotion, she kept things controlled. Even on a capella endings to tunes, Ms. Peebles repeated a phrase, remaking the melody in small increments, where the act was less about extravagance and more about control.

Also known as overtone or harmonic singing, throat singing allows a performer to produce two or three notes at once through careful positioning of the lips, tongue, jaw, velum and larynx. The singer produces a basic note as well as its harmonics, which have a flute- or whistle-like tone.   Tuva, a former Soviet autonomous oblast bordered by Russia and Mongolia, is one of the few places where overtone singing is practiced. Other throat singers, such as the Gyoto Tantric Choir and new-age innovator David Hykes, place the technique in a spiritual context, emphasizing the discipline it requires and its meditative qualities. The singers from Tuva showed another way it can signify: as a means of storytelling and of comprehending the natural world through art, which are classic motivations for folk music.

Ms. Zaremba, who plays the show's titular heroine, is very small, even for a 9-year-old, but her voice, which is pitched somewhere between a bugle and a gym teacher's whistle, is enormous. Never mind that her diction sometimes suggests that her cheeks have been stuffed with M&M's. The kid can belt, and she seems as un-self-conscious as a kitten.   In the old-fashioned American musical, which is what \\"Annie Warbucks\\" frankly aspires to be, big voices out of little bodies are held dear, representing a combination of naivete and aggression that is at the very heart of the form. Innocence at high volume was, after all, what put over the original \\"Annie\\" -- the 1977 Broadway blockbuster inspired by the long-running comic strip \\"Little Orphan Annie\\" -- to which this production is a sequel. \\"Annie\\" was audaciously anachronistic, and after a decade of musical theater dominated by the chillier charm of Sondheim, audiences lapped up its brazen sentimentality.

But the recordings I keep coming back to, though the work of vastly different artists, share one quality: they all reveal another side of Brahms, not the Hamburg heavyweight but the bracing adventurer.    At the top of my list are Peter Serkin's recordings of the piano concertos with the Atlanta Symphony, conducted by Robert Shaw. The Second Concerto is a particular revelation. Mr. Serkin likes to remind people that Brahms wrote this work in the afterglow of two trips to Italy, and that though the music has rigorous contrapuntal writing and surging power, it also has light and exuberance. Those are the qualities he stresses. The work still emerges as something monumental, but for once the monumentality seems to derive from the intricacy of the crisscrossing rhythms, the wondrously layered textures and the audaciously symphonic conception of piano sound, not just bludgeoning massiveness.

His delicate, densely crosshatched ink drawings, suggestive of 19th-century engravings and ironic story-book texts meld into a singular sensibility: gothic, yes, but without a hint of the genre's hysteria.   In fact, the most disturbing element of Mr. Gorey's work is its cool acceptance of all things horrific. \\"With God almighty being flighty and absent frequently,\\" as Mr. Gorey writes, these witty novels in miniature tend less to build to climaxes than to trail off into existential ellipses, leaving a final impression of forbidding stillness.

One woman takes issue with her boyfriend's determination to discipline her naughty new puppy. Another woman seizes upon her husband's new interest in astral projection as a sign of betrayal. A third woman grows disillusioned with her fiance when he's unable to participate in a drunken conversation with a friend.   As orchestrated by Ms. Dark, however, such arguments open out to disclose sinister secrets and the sad misunderstandings that can accrue between women and men. In fact, the real problems of her characters turn out to be serious ones -- physical abuse, adultery, heavy drinking -- or the more subtle but intractable ones of emotional duplicity and resentment.

Despite varying consistency, the chocolate has always been the same -- a tried-and-true collection of original hits and pop and country standards -- but the filling has varied, depending on the nature of Mr.  Nelson's current project. When Mr. Nelson performed at the Beacon Theater last year, the filling was sickly sweet: the orchestra-enhanced ballads of his then-current \\"Healing Hands of Time\\" album. On Wednesday night at the Supper Club, the filling was just right: Mr. Nelson's slick and wistful Tex-Mex-flavored paean to love and loss, \\"Spirit\\" (Island).         As on the album, Mr. Nelson performed without a rhythm section, backed just by piano (played by his sister, Bobbie) and harmonica, guitar and fiddle. Mr. Nelson and his band spent the first hour of the concert slowly and unapologetically warming up. At times it seemed as if they were never going to get it right: Mr. Nelson's vocals were flat and uneven, and his guitar strumming stumbled ahead and behind the tempo.

The first tangible effect of the Senate's overhaul of telecommunications law, experts say, will be chaos: new marketing deals, outrageous prices, bankruptcies, hostile takeovers and schemes to make a quick killing.

There have always been the eccentrics and the out-of-the- ordinary people who make clothes here. But now the English have become a top-notch source of clothing for the world.

Naturally enough with such a group, the talk soon turned to their surroundings: the Victorian splendor of the Linley Sambourne house, built in 1874 for Lady Rosse's ancestor of that name and still containing all its original overstuffed furniture and collections of bric-a-brac against dark-wood paneling and stained glass.   At the time of the gathering, November 1957, houses and interiors of this sort were generally regarded as overdecorated monstrosities, and their destruction was accelerating. By the time the guests left, they and Lady Rosse had decided to found a society to protect the arts and architecture of the 19th century. Whatever their style - from neo-classical to Gothic Revival - such arts have their roots in the supreme self-confidence of a nation that then ruled threequarters of the world. The organization, called simply the Victorian Society, formally came into being on Feb. 25, 1958.
