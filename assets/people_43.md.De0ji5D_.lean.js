A pink-tinted engraving of a huge chateau with rows of Renaissance-style arches extending beneath pyramidal roofs is set within a shallow wooden box, framed by a speckled border evoking a snowfall on a starry night. Real branches rise from the space behind the engraved chateau, looming like a giant forest from a fairy tale. Behind the branches, the back of  the box is lined with a mirror, catching glints of light from the surrounding room.         The same fairy-tale quality is evident in the box constructions of \\"Joseph Cornell: Cosmic Travels,\\" a concurrent exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art.

By Joe Queenan WITH the retirement of Ronald Reagan, the demise of Drexel Burnham Lambert and the collapse of the Japanese stock market, it is generally agreed that the 1980's are over. The 1960's, however, are still very much with us - not only in the presence of porky, recidivist rock stars but in the continuing literary efforts of Tom Robbins, who is back with yet another surrealistic, phantasmagoric, free-association novel that makes you want to dust off those old Firesign Theater records and don those frayed, tie-dyed bell bottoms one last time.   Although Mr. Robbins made his name in the 1970's with his zany novels \\"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\\" and \\"Still Life With Woodpecker,\\" these were very much products of a laid-back, anti-establishment, 1960's mentality. Pastiches of wisecracks masquerading as literature, these gagfests were very funny affairs: flickering signs of gaiety and hope in a doomed culture that was already capitulating to the sinister Ann Beattie and others of an aggressively maudlin disposition.   Mr. Robbins is still a very funny guy, but he - and we - are getting a bit old for comic books. Which is not to say that \\"Skinny Legs and All\\" started out as a laugh riot","excerpt":"seemingly Mr. Robbins intended this compendious compendium to address all the major questions of human existence: Religion, Art, the Future of the Middle East, the War Between the Sexes, the Meaning of Life. Sad to say, Mr. Robbins is not yet ready for the big leagues; he has shown that he can hit the fastball, but he still has plenty of trouble with the curve.   Mr. Robbins begins \\"Skinny Legs and All\\" with his trademark pyrotechnics - ludicrous similes and rivetingly inane dialogue - and as long as the fireworks keep coming, things are just fine. In the first 25 pages we are introduced to Ellen Cherry Charles, an aspiring artist and waitress who is a member of the Daughters of the Daily Special, whose hair \\"did its own stunts\\" and who declares: \\"Some marriages are made in Heaven. . . . Mine was made in Hong Kong.\\" She is driving across the heartland of America, in a vehicle redesigned to look like a roast turkey, with Boomer Petway, her welder husband, who is a native of Colonial Pines, \\"a suburb without an urb,\\" and who has a penchant for asking cowboys whether the proper terminology for their line of work is not, in fact, \\"bovine custodial officers.\\" So far, so good.   However, when he turns from one-liners to the daunting themes of art and religion, Mr. Robbins is seriously outgunned. After Boomer and Ellen arrive in the Big Apple, the welder becomes the darling of the art crowd, with the fowl vehicle fetching a king's ransom at Boomer's first exhibition. Sending up the downtown arts scene is a conceit so shopworn that one wonders what the Seattle-based Tom Robbins was thinking of. (Maybe he was thinking of downtown Seattle.) In addition to modern art, Mr. Robbins also dislikes organized religion, which he, mirabile dictu, has identified as an enemy of wild and crazy guys such as Boomer, Ellen Cherry Charles and himself. This results in a pointless and anachronistic tirade against a bunch of fundamentalist Christians who are plotting to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem, in the hope of provoking the Messiah into a second - or perhaps it's a third - coming. All of this is tied in with an Arab and a Jew who build a restaurant across from the United Nations, and with a talking can of beans, a talking spoon and a talking sock, which have survived in some form since the time of Solomon and have many controversial theories about biblical events. The tin can, the spoon and the sock are all a good deal less funny than the humans, with the exception of the mysterious New York belly dancer Salome, who is not funny at all. (Of course, neither was her biblical forerunner; just ask St. John the Baptist.) Mr. Robbins is at his best when he is being snide, witty or downright juvenile, and at his worst when he is being profound. He is clearly on to something when he has Boomer declare, \\"If God didn't prefer for us to drink at night, he wouldn't have made neon!\\" And he makes a very valid point, overlooked by many anthropologists, when he notes that the switch from B.C. to A.D. in the time of Jesus Christ must have caused many Israelites to miss their dental appointments.   But when Mr. Robbins gets on his high horse, the results are pure bunkum. \\"As long as a population can be induced to believe in a supernatural hereafter, it can be oppressed and controlled,\\" he pontificates. \\"People will put up with all sorts of tyranny, poverty, and painful treatment if they're convinced that they'll eventually escape to some resort in the sky where lifeguards are superfluous and the pool never closes.\\" Oh, hush your tongue, Tommy, this is pure mush, as a look at the Peasants' Rebellion during the Reformation, the life of Oliver Cromwell or the voyage of the Mayflower can attest. What's more, it's not even your mush; it's stolen from Gibbons's \\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\\"   Mr. Robbins should take a tip from Peter De Vries and mass-produce the kind of short, witty books that do not get confused with \\"Anna Karenina.\\" When you can write lines such as \\"She knew the dark side of the moon like the back of her hand. She shopped there,\\" you should write them. But you shouldn't write them for 422 pages. Readers, after all, have other chores.
