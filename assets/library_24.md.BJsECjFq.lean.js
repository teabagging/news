And the list of involuntary retirees strings out to include such venerable National Football League names as Karl Mecklenburg, Neal Anderson, Charles Mann, Dennis Smith, Bill Fralic, et al.\\n\\nBut the real damage from the salary cap is the loss of continuity for pro teams. The N.F.L. Players Association, in its rush to free agency, ceded the owners a $34.5 million ceiling on annual salaries and touched off the greatest migration of bodies since the Potato Famine in Ireland.\\n\\nThis fall, induced by worry about fitting them under the cap, the Giants alone let cornerback Mark Collins slip off to the Chiefs, center Brad Oates to the 49ers, safety Greg Jackson to the Eagles, offensive lineman Eric Moore to the Bengals, running back Lewis Tillman to the Bears and safety Myron Guyton and guard Bob Kratch to the Patriots.\\nWhy It Was Popular\\n\\n I'm reminded of a conversation I had with Y. A. Tittle back in the early 1960's, a generation ago, when pro football sprang upon the land as the most physical and emotional of all team sport exercises, rushing past the college game as the preeminent fall spectacle and even challenging baseball as the national pastime.\\n\\n\\"Let me tell you what made the pros catch on,\\" confided Tittle, the bald Giants quarterback who had become the folksy delight of Manhattan after being acquired from the 49ers for a forgettable lineman named Lou Cordileone. Parenthetically, he was wondering if he could ask the Giants to pay him $25,000 a year.\\n\\n\\"The little old lady from Scarsdale buys a season ticket in the mezzanine, and every Sunday when she comes to watch us play, she knows that Jimmy Patton, No. 20, is going to be back there at safety on defense. And when we got the ball, that's Del Shofner slanting over the middle to catch a pass on a post pattern.\\n\\n\\"In college they're gone after three seasons. But year after year, that little old lady sees the same players out there, memorizes all their numbers, has learned what their responsibilities are and identifies with them. If the other team completes a long one down the right sideline, she knows that Erich Barnes let the guy get behind him. No one has to tell her.\\"\\n\\nThat type of familiarity with the teams and their rosters became the cornerstone of pro football popularity and bred a knowledge and loyalty that pervaded the crowds filling the stadiums.\\nWholesale Turnover\\n\\n That stability no longer exists. True, even back then, the aging process and injuries inevitably brought changes on a team, but they were generally subtle, not the wholesale turnover you see now. The premier stars chase the big bucks (Reggie White to the Packers, Seth Joyner to the Cardinals, Ken Norton to the 49ers) and the owners discard established players who can still contribute but have attained a salary level of half a million dollars or more that makes it impractical to keep them on the roster.\\n\\nBaseball has been pursuing a salary cap to level the playing field for its small and large markets, which have disparate income from radio and television, but that argument doesn't pertain to pro football. The N.F.L. television package, the main income source, makes revenue sharing a fait accompli. Football owners want the salary cap to save them from themselves.\\n\\nStupendous contracts, such as those given Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith of the Cowboys, consume the megabucks of the money allotted under the salary cap while little effort is made to retain other icons who have spent a decade and more with the same team.\\n\\nI'm referring to such as Clay Matthews, who spent 16 years with the Browns","excerpt":"Rickey Jackson, 13 years with the Saints; Albert Lewis, 11 years with the Chiefs. They'll be playing out their careers with other teams this fall.\\nWhy Him for Him?\\n\\n Sometimes, the transitions make little sense. The Raiders dismissed Steve Smith, a veteran fullback, because he was making a million a year. Instead, they picked up Tom Rathman, deemed expendable by the 49ers because his salary was too high. Meanwhile, Smith caught on with Seattle because the Seahawks didn't retain high-priced John L. Williams, a consistent back for a decade. And Williams signed with the Steelers, who needed a fullback when Merril Hoge opted for the Chicago Bears (who scrapped Iron Head Heyward, since picked up by Atlanta).\\n\\nThis ring-arond-the-rosey of interchangeable fullbacks served to reduce their salaries, collectively. But it disregarded the unique chemistry that goes into the composition of a football team and the mutual reliance built over time -- Steve Young knowing exactly where Rathman was going to be on each play, and Rathman bailing him out as Young scrambled.\\n\\nBesides which, that little old lady up in the stands, who has studiously followed the home team all these years, now has her player numbers all scrambled.\\n\\n\\nMurray Olderman, a former syndicated columnist, has written five books about professional football.

Letters to the Editor"},{"year":"1992","title":"After years of skirmishing over European farm subsidies, the Bush Administration fired the first shot today in what may become a trade war, announcing that in 30 days it would begin collecting a 200 percent import tax on all still white wines from the European Community.   The new taxes cover popular wines like Chablis from France, which currently sells for about $13 a bottle","excerpt":"riesling from Germany, about $10, and verdicchio from Italy, about $9. In addition to about $270 million in wine, about $30 million worth of cooking oil and pet food ingredients will also be taxed. Sparkling wines, including Champagne, are not affected.   While the taxes would triple the prices that consumers pay, the impact is not likely to be visible until sometime next year. Importers of wine, French Cognac and other distilled spirits have been stocking their warehouses in anticipation of the trade war, fearful that if they have to sell the wine at higher prices many customers may turn elsewhere -- perhaps to the white wines of California, Australia and South America.  Current Shipments Not Affected    Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said the delay before the taxes were actually collected would allow for the arrival of wine already bought by American importers and would allow time for further negotiations. With one exception, similar delays in the past have not resulted in negotiated settlements and the United States has gone ahead and collected the punitive taxes.   But there is added pressure for a settlement this time because the amount of money and the prestige of the exports involved are greater than in previous disputes.    The United States decided to single out white wines because France, the European Community's leading shipper of white wine to the United States, with sales of $125 million last year, has been the most steadfast opponent of compromise in the subsidies dispute. France's farmers are a potent political force and general elections are scheduled for the spring.    The American decision today means a wine importer in the United States who buys a bottle of European wine for $5 will have to pay a $10 tax, in addition to the Federal excise tax of 7 cents a bottle that is already in place. Retailers usually charge about 87 percent more than the importer's price of the wine, industry executives say, so a bottle for which an importer now pays $5.07 now is likely to be sold by a retailer for about $9.50. When the importer is paying $15.07, the retailer is likely to sell it for about $28.25.    Harry F. Mariani, the president and chief operating officer of the Banfi Products Corporation, a large wine importer in Old Brookville, L.I., said prices could climb this winter as white wine stocks dwindle. \\"Whoever has some white wine left will probably raise the price at the end, even if they didn't pay the tax,\\" he said. Dispute Over Subsidies    Mrs. Hills also released a list of $1.7 billion worth of manufactured goods, including perfume and construction materials, on which the United States may also impose taxes.   The Bush Administration's willingness to impose punitive tariffs rather than find a compromise with the European Community's insistence on continued subsidies is a sign of the Government's determination to punish countries that do not open their markets to American exports.    Over the last 30 years, the United States has repeatedly complained that European farm subsidies unfairly reduce demand for American exports. The disintegration of the Soviet Union and its diminution as a military threat have freed the United States to take a more aggressive stand.   Tran Van Thinh, the European Community's Ambassador to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the organization in Geneva that oversees world trade, said Wednesday that the broad trade talks that have been struggling for six years to try to reduce trade barriers could be severely hurt if the United States went ahead with the taxes.   The European Community challenged the legality of imposing import taxes without GATT's permission. \\"In effect, this constitutes an illegal position according to GATT rules,\\" Frans Andriessen, the European Community's External Relations Commissioner, said today. The foreign ministers of the community's 12 members will meet on Monday in Brussels.   Two GATT panels have ruled that the European Community has violated world trade rules with its indirect subsidies for soybeans, rapeseed and other oilseeds. But the European Community has used its veto to block American efforts to get GATT approval for its retaliatory taxes.  Europeans Refused Arbitration    Robert E. Hudec, the Melvin C. Steen Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota, said the Bush Administration appeared to be on strong legal ground in imposing duties.    \\"If you offer to arbitrate the action you propose to take and the other side turns you down, then under international law you have the right to take the action,\\" he said.   Agriculture Minister Jean-Pierre Soisson of France called today for the European Community to raise taxes on an equal amount of American goods. Mrs. Hills said the community would have no legal basis for such action but refused to say what the United States would do if the European Community did retaliate.   Mrs. Hills said she had not discussed today's move with any representative of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the President-elect. She noted that Mr. Clinton had emphasized on Wednesday that President Bush remained in charge until Inauguration Day. Mr. Clinton strongly supports the strategy of punishing nations that do not open their markets.    The American action today comes after the failure on Tuesday night of talks in Chicago between Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan and Ray MacSharry, the European Community's Agriculture Commissioner. Mr. MacSharry stepped down today as the community's negotiator on GATT agricultural issues.   After France, Italy is the largest exporter of white wine to the United States, with $97 million in sales, followed by Germany with $36 million and Portugal with $5.5 million.   Mrs. Hills identified the 251 wines on the list today as white wines. But as the French Embassy here pointed out to her office this afternoon, several of the wines, such as Sancerre, are also available as red wines. The red wines also appear to be subject to the taxes, given the wording of Mrs. Hills's official order this morning.

D'Angelo's band started with a slow vamp straight from the 1970's, all glimmering electric piano and percussive wah-wah guitar. He arrived, unsmiling, to take over the electric piano and keep the groove simmering. And he sang about longing and lust, with one song about his anger at someone he finds \\"sleeping with my woman.\\" That song, with its all-profanity chorus, and \\"Brown Sugar,\\" in which he sang and rapped about being both satiated and eager for more, are clearly from the hip-hop era.

The tape, made by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, reflects light hitting it at angles up to almost 90 degrees, which makes the trucks visible to vehicles viewing it from unusual angles (lower photo, above). Federal statistics show that there are more than 1,000 fatal accidents a year involving cars hitting the back or side of trucks, 70 percent of them at night. Often the cars drive under the trailers. Industry executives say trailers are most likely to be struck when a truck is making a U-turn, re-entering a highway or turning left at the end of a highway exit ramp. By placing the reflective material at a height where it will reflect auto headlights, Landstar hopes to reduce the accident rate.

Fernandez unveiled a plan yesterday to drastically overhaul science instruction in New York City's public schools, including adding an extra year of laboratory science to high school requirements and more than doubling the number of science periods offered to elementary school students.    Mr. Fernandez said the plan aimed at invigorating science education for all students, not just the most talented, so that the city's public school graduates would be able to get jobs in an increasingly technical society. In particular, Mr. Fernandez hopes the changes will lure more black and Hispanic students into careers in science and engineering, where they make up only 4.5 percent of the professionals.    The plan, which comes at a time when the school system is struggling with overcrowded classes and a shortage of supplies, does not include any estimate of its cost.  Nor does it have a timetable. Mr. Fernandez said a team of school officials would now begin studying those aspects.    Mr. Fernandez's vision will also demand radical changes in how teachers are trained and recruited","excerpt":"right now high schools cannot find enough licensed high school science teachers and elementary schools are hiring teachers who may have taken no college science.   But in forging ahead, Mr. Fernandez is heeding alarms that have been sounded by experts nationwide who are concerned about how poorly American students fare in science in comparisons with those of other industrialized nations. In Chicago, Dr. Leon Lederman, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, started a program two years ago that pulled hundreds of elementary school teachers out of their classrooms for 16 weeks at a time and taught them how to perform beguiling lab experiments.    \\"Teachers can't teach science because they're terrified of it,\\" Mr. Lederman, an alumnus of New York's James Monroe High School, said in an interview. \\"Science is put off to the seventh and eighth period and then they pray for a fire drill.\\"    Leland T. Jones, the press secretary for Mayor David N. Dinkins, said the Mayor, as a onetime math major, applauded efforts to bolster math and science education. But, he added, \\"we need to find good and great ways to pay for them.\\"    Mr. Fernandez is basing his plan on a report issued yesterday by a task force headed by Dr. George Campbell Jr., president of the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering. The report criticized many of the past efforts to draw students to science, which had focused attention on only the most gifted students.    \\"Earlier efforts were too often based on the premise that science ability was innate, reserved for the intellectually elite,\\" the report said. \\"We know now that all students can and must achieve the level of scientific literacy required for life in the 21st century.\\"   The report urged that all high school students be required to take three years of science instead of two, and that those three should be laboratory-based courses like chemistry and physics rather than the more amorphous courses like general science that are now accepted for graduation.    Such a requirement would place far greater demands on New York students than their counterparts nationally. Fewer than half of American students study chemistry and only 20 percent study physics, the report said. Some educators believe that raising the requirements will push more students to drop out, while others believe that students respond well to tougher challenges.    But H. Carl McCall, the president of the seven-member Board of Education that will eventually have to vote on the plan, said he was \\"prepared to take the risk\\" of toughening requirements as long as schools \\"make sure the kids are prepared to meet them.\\"    In elementary school, the report said, at least one period per day, or 45 minutes, should be devoted to science, with the stress on solving problems and on visible or palpable demonstrations and not just on textbook information. The average American student, the report said, is given 19 minutes per day of science in kindergarten through the third grade and, by the sixth grade, the amount rises to only 38 minutes. Raising Requirements    Increasing science instruction in elementary school requires a staff comfortable with doing so, the report said, but it noted that many teachers had taken just one science course in college, and often that was a teaching methods course.    \\"As a result,\\" the report said, \\"far too many people graduate as teachers with the false impression that science is simply a compendium of facts to be memorized.\\"     The report urged the chancellor to talk with officials at the City University of New York -- which trains 80 percent of the city's teachers -- about raising the requirement for an elementary school teacher's license to a minimum of two semesters of laboratory science and one science teaching methods course.     To turn out more licensed high school teachers, the report recommended a City University-based program to retrain teachers of other subjects as science teachers, by requiring them to take three college-level science courses.    The report was democratic; it said almost nothing about programs to help talented students who show an early passion for science. Pointing to the success of New York City high schools in the annual Westinghouse science competition, the report seemed to take as a given that the needs of such students were filled.    However, many experts, including Dr. Lederman, said that not enough was being done for such students, and they reject criticism that focusing on talented students constitutes elitism.

Last night the four musicians were at it again, with an all-20th-century program at the Juilliard Theater that included Roger Sessions's String Quartet No.  2 and the American premiere of Ronald Caltabiano's String Quartet.

The plan would allow private landowners to harvest thousands of acres of trees damaged in a freak windstorm last July. But the plan also contains strict controls designed to safeguard valuable wetlands and protect lakes and streams from erosion.         This is the second time Mr. Pataki has brokered a deal between two implacable foes. Last November his administration persuaded landowners and New York City officials to agree to a plan to protect the city's upstate watersheds. Taken together, these two agreements have done much to atone for the Governor's mediocre environmental record during 1995, when he appointed industry lobbyists  to key environmental posts, diverted funds targeted for toxic dump cleanups and  attempted to repeal a ban on a dangerous pesticide.

However, a sound program to clean up the Everglades without further delay is already in place. It incorporates market incentives, but unlike Mr. Hahn's panacea, it avoids delay and is based on proved technology and the ecological needs of the Everglades.   Florida's plan for the Everglades has two basic components: (1) a best management practice rule, requiring Everglades farmers to reduce nutrient discharges from their farms, and (2) manmade marshes -- called storm-water treatment areas -- to remove nutrients from water that leaves farms before it reaches the nutrient-sensitive Everglades.

In a division ruled by defense, points will be at a premium, and that plays perfectly into Belichick's hands because he will have a superb defense in New England. Belichick can also unleash Tom Brady, the most reliable quarterback in the game. Everyone else will play for the wild card.    1 New England (14-2)  STRENGTHS -- Belichick gives the Patriots an incalculable edge in almost every situation, and he will make the loss of the coordinators Romeo Crennel on defense and Charlie Weis on offense beside the point. Crennel and Weis took their cues from Belichick, so there will not be much upheaval. Belichick will be the de facto offensive coordinator. Does anyone doubt he can handle that as well as he handles defense?  WEAKNESSES -- It is difficult to find one, but the losses of Tedy Bruschi and Ted Johnson at linebacker make the position a point of interest. Bruschi was the soul of the defense, and his versatility will be missed. But the Patriots prepared by adding Chad Brown. Outside linebackers Willie McGinest and Mike Vrabel are exceptional.  OUTLOOK -- The owner, Robert K. Kraft, gave his 2005 Super Bowl ring to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, but his team may just win him a replacement. This is the best-run organization in football, and it shows. The roster is deep, so even the losses of Bruschi, Johnson and cornerback Ty Law can be made up. If Brady stays healthy, the Patriots will contend for another title.    2 Jets (10-6)  STRENGTHS -- Last year's defense, headed by the rookie linebacker Jonathan Vilma, was vastly improved, and this year's unit received a big boost with the signing of Law. If he returns to form after a foot injury that cut short his 2004 season, Law will solidify the secondary. The line lost the veteran tackle Jason Ferguson, but John Abraham and Shaun Ellis are elite ends.  WEAKNESSES -- The Jets lost a host of free agents","excerpt":"right tackle Kareem McKenzie and tight end Anthony Becht may be missed most as blockers in the running game. Running back Curtis Martin, 32, is extraordinary. Last season, he became the oldest player to win the league rushing title. He may have to carry a heavy load if quarterback Chad Pennington's return from rotator cuff surgery is slow and if the offense has trouble adjusting to the new coordinator, Mike Heimerdinger.  OUTLOOK -- The Jets came achingly close to the A.F.C. championship game last season, but they have big questions to answer before they are ready to topple the Patriots. First and foremost is Pennington's health. If he misses games, the Jets have no shot. Even if he is healthy, the offense may need time to get used to Heimerdinger's more aggressive approach. The free-agency losses could take a toll, too. The Jets will certainly contend for a playoff spot, even though their schedule is tougher than last year's.    3  Miami (4-12)  STRENGTHS -- Incredibly, the running game, the source of the Dolphins' disaster last season, is now tilted in their favor. Nick Saban, the new coach, opened the door for running back Ricky Williams to return. If Williams is anything close to what he was, the running game will be the backbone of Saban's offense. The Dolphins chose the best back in the draft, Ronnie Brown, who can step in while Williams tries to return to form.    WEAKNESSES -- Just who is the Dolphins' quarterback? Last year, they traded a second-round pick in this year's draft for A.J. Feeley, but he has to compete for the starting job with Gus Frerotte, who is familiar with the system of the new offensive coordinator, Scott Linehan. No matter who wins the job, it may not be much of an improvement.    OUTLOOK -- Saban's arrival as coach may have long-term benefits -- better discipline and a Belichick-like approach to defense and personnel -- but just as in New England, it could take time for the benefits to kick in.    4 Buffalo (9-7)  STRENGTHS -- The Bills were second in total defense last year, leading in takeaways and ranking third in sacks. They lost defensive tackle Pat Williams but still have the Pro Bowler Sam Adams to anchor the line. Takeo Spikes is a sideline-to-sideline linebacker who fits perfectly in Buffalo's blitz-heavy scheme, and cornerback Nate Clements is the cornerstone of one of the league's best secondaries. The Bills will lean on the defense to keep games close while the offense finds its stride.  WEAKNESSES -- The switch to quarterback J.P. Losman from the veteran Drew Bledsoe is the right decision for the long term. Losman is athletic and mobile and has a strong arm. But an inexperienced quarterback almost always has a learning curve. That will put a greater burden on running back Willis McGahee.  OUTLOOK -- The Bills have a window of opportunity with a defense this good, but the season hinges on how quickly Losman progresses. If he finds his footing quickly, the Bills could threaten for a wild-card spot. But that seems optimistic with a tough schedule.    WEST  KEY TO WINNING DIVISION -- Surviving the schedule. Every team in this division has a strength of schedule that is among the top 10. This is always a fiercely contested division. With San Diego's surprising breakout last season, and improvements by the other three teams, it could come down to the last weekend of play.    1 Kansas City (7-9)  STRENGTHS -- Priest Holmes scored 15 touchdowns in 8 games last season. He will be 32 this season and is coming off a knee injury, but if he stays healthy, Holmes is the heart of the Chiefs' high-powered offense. Larry Johnson rushed for nine touchdowns when Holmes was out last season.  WEAKNESSES -- The defense was a disaster last season, ranking 31st over all and last in passing defense. During the off-season, the Chiefs went shopping, and there are enough talented players -- cornerback Patrick Surtain, safety Sammy Knight and linebacker Kendrell Bell among them -- for the defense to become respectable.    OUTLOOK -- If the defense is not embarrassing, the Chiefs should make the playoffs. If Holmes and quarterback Trent Green remain healthy, the offense, ranked No. 1 last season, is good enough to carry the team. One hurdle to the playoffs: The Chiefs have the fourth-toughest schedule in the league.    2 San Diego (12-4)  STRENGTHS -- A multifaceted offense that can be devastating. Quarterback Drew Brees completed 65.5 percent of his passes for 3,159 yards and 27 touchdowns with just 7 interceptions last season. Brees has tight end Antonio Gates, among the best in the league, as his primary receiver. Then there is LaDainian Tomlinson, who led the league with 17 rushing touchdowns last season.  WEAKNESSES -- The pass rush was abysmal last season, ranking 29th in sacks with just 29. The Chargers allowed the second-most passing yards in the league. The first-round draft pick Shawne Merriman, a defensive end and linebacker, should help.  OUTLOOK -- If the Chargers can survive a brutal early schedule, they should make a run at another playoff berth. But games at Denver, New England and Philadelphia will test their mettle. Despite their run last year, the Chargers were just 2-5 against winning teams, including in the playoffs. Failing to make the playoffs would be a disappointment.    3 Denver (10-6)  STRENGTHS -- The Broncos may have the best linebackers in the game in Al Wilson, Ian Gold and D.J. Williams. They are the guts of a defense that ranked fourth in the league against the run last season. The pass rush from the front four was weak last season. Denver has rebuilt the line, importing several players from Cleveland, so if that group does not find its chemistry quickly, the linebackers could be shouldering even more of a load.  WEAKNESSES -- Jake Plummer's athletic ability earns him an A-plus. But his mistakes haunt the Broncos. He had 20 interceptions last season and completed just 51.5 percent of his third-down passes. He is on the cusp of greatness, but until his decision-making improves, his unpredictability is a detriment.  OUTLOOK -- The team brought in receiver Jerry Rice, who will probably end his career as a Bronco. The latest running back experiment included Maurice Clarett, who was waived. Good story lines, but whether the Broncos make it to the playoffs again hinges on Plummer's performance. If he limits his errors, the Broncos could win the division with their powerful running game and rock-solid defense.    4 Oakland (5-11)  STRENGTHS -- Quarterback Kerry Collins has all the tools around him to make this one of the league's most explosive offenses. Rice and Tim Brown are gone, but Randy Moss's arrival solidifies an offense that also has Jerry Porter, Ronald Curry and running back LaMont Jordan, who came from the Jets. Will the ball get to Moss enough to keep him happy? With Collins's strong arm and Moss's breakaway ability, look for the Raiders to go deep often.  WEAKNESSES -- The defense was terrible last year, and although the system has been overhauled, the lineup that had 25 sacks and forced 18 turnovers, among the worst in the league in each category, has changed little. Tackles Warren Sapp and Ted Washington may be on the downside of their careers, so the Raiders will count on younger players. That could take time.  OUTLOOK -- The schedule is a nightmare -- the Raiders open at New England, then have Kansas City at home before going to Philadelphia -- and even the firepower on offense will not be enough to propel the Raiders to the playoffs. The defense is still a work in progress, and that is bad news in this division.    NORTH    KEY TO WINNING DIVISION -- In a division featuring two of the best defenses in the league (Pittsburgh's and Baltimore's), the quarterbacks may be critical in determining who finishes on top. Pittsburgh ran away with the division last year, based partly on the improbable performance of Ben Roethlisberger. Carson Palmer, in his second year as a starter in Cincinnati, is surrounded by better weapons this season. And if Kyle Boller shows the talent that Coach Brian Billick is convinced he has, the Ravens could be balanced enough to dethrone the Steelers.    1 Pittsburgh (15-1)  STRENGTHS -- Yes, Roethlisberger stayed in Pittsburgh during the off-season to study. The defense led the league in total defense, rushing defense and scoring defense last season and returns every starter.  WEAKNESSES -- Plaxico Burress is now with the Giants, and Hines Ward missed part of training camp in a contract dispute. That could spell trouble at receiver, although Antwaan Randle El performed well when Burress was hurt last season (he had a 149-yard day against the Giants) and will get a shot at starting.  OUTLOOK -- Can Roethlisberger recreate the magic of his rookie season? He has to get better at working against zone defenses, which troubled him late in the 2004 season. If he does, the defense is good enough to carry the Steelers deep into the playoffs again.    2 Baltimore (9-7)  STRENGTHS -- The defense will carry the Ravens. What else is new? Linebacker Ray Lewis has already proclaimed that he wants to be the most valuable player this season. Not the defensive M.V.P -- the league M.V.P. Still, safety Ed Reed, the league's defensive M.V.P. last year, became almost as important to the Ravens as Lewis, after Lewis had to take on blockers in the 3-4 defense. The new coordinator Rex Ryan will use four-man fronts and incorporate the 46 defense made famous by his father, Buddy Ryan. (The 46 emphasizes blitzing and pressure.) Lewis will roam free again. The Ravens upgraded at receiver with the addition of Derrick Mason.  WEAKNESSES -- Though Boller has the confidence of his coach, he has done little to deserve it, and both could be in trouble if Boller does not blossom this season. Boller had trouble reading defenses last season, and the passing offense ranked 31st.  OUTLOOK -- The Ravens did not have much of an offense when they won the Super Bowl after the 2000 season, but they had a once-in-a-generation defense. Now, they need more balance, and their playoff chances depend on Boller's development.    3 Cincinnati (8-8)  STRENGTHS --The offense is built to win. Palmer won four of six games last season before a knee sprain forced him to miss the last three games. He has a good arm, mobility and an array of weapons. Running back Rudi Johnson set a club record with 1,454 yards last season, and receivers Chad Johnson and T.J. Houshmandzadeh are capable of 1,000-yard seasons.  WEAKNESSES -- Coach Marvin Lewis comes from the defensive side of the ball, but his defense could prevent a long-awaited return to the playoffs. Lewis has a new coordinator in Chuck Bresnahan and new talent in the free-agent defensive tackle Bryan Robinson and in David Pollack and Odell Thurman, linebackers from Georgia whom the Bengals took with their first two picks in the draft. The run defense finished 26th last season.  OUTLOOK -- The Bengals have not been to the playoffs since 1990, but this could be the year. One thing to avoid is another 1-4 start, which has doomed their chances the past two seasons. If Palmer emerges, Lewis's rebuilding may finally bear fruit.    4 Cleveland (4-12)  STRENGTHS -- If tight end Kellen Winslow had not been hurt, the receiving corps would have been the team's unquestioned strength. It is still not bad. The first-round pick Braylon Edwards will almost certainly be quarterback Trent Dilfer's No. 1 target by the end of the season.  WEAKNESSES -- The new coach, Romeo Crennel, was Bill Belichick's defensive coordinator in New England, so he has the credentials to make defense the cornerstone of the rebuilding effort. But it will not be easy. Crennel will switch to a 3-4 defense, even though the personnel is not ideal. End Orpheus Roye should shine, but the team is thin at linebacker, so it will be a patchwork job.  OUTLOOK -- Crennel, with his five Super Bowl rings -- three with the Patriots and two with the Giants -- inspires confidence that better days are ahead. But the motorcycle accident that cost Winslow the season precludes a major turnaround this season.    SOUTH    KEY TO WINNING DIVISION -- Jacksonville was vastly improved last season, but every team has to go through the Colts and their high-powered offense to have a shot at winning this division. It will be difficult for Peyton Manning to improve on last season, when he threw for a record 49 touchdowns, but if he maintains his usual excellence, the Colts should remain the class of the division. Look to Nov. 7, when the Colts go to New England with home-field advantage in the playoffs possibly on the line.    1 Indianapolis (12-4)  STRENGTHS -- A frightening thought: Manning might have had as many as a dozen more touchdown passes last season if he had not overthrown receivers or if they had not dropped the ball. Another scary thought is that Manning threw just 10 interceptions last season, but 7 were within the 20-yard line. No other player in the league is as important to his team as Manning is to the Colts, and considering his 112 consecutive regular-season starts, the Colts are in very good hands. The late addition of Corey Simon, the defensive lineman who left the Eagles after a contract dispute, should boost the defense.  WEAKNESSES -- The defense, which showed improvement in 2003, took a step back last season, ranking 29th in the league. The line, anchored by the explosive end Dwight Freeney, had 41 of the team's 45 sacks last season. The pickup of Simon should help. But the linebacking unit is young, and the secondary has been plagued by injuries. If both stabilize, the defense will bounce back. If not, the Colts will have to revert to winning shootouts.  OUTLOOK -- With running back Edgerrin James in a contract year, the time is now for Manning, James and receiver Marvin Harrison. The defense is good enough to complement one of the best offenses the league has seen. If the Colts can finally solve the Patriots and Bill Belichick's defenses, they could make a Super Bowl run.    2 Jacksonville (9-7)  STRENGTHS -- The defense is Coach Jack Del Rio's pride and joy, and it showed last season, when the Jaguars ranked 11th in the league in total defense and 7th in scoring defense. Anchored by the Pro Bowl defensive tackles Marcus Stroud and John Henderson, the Jaguars allowed just 111 yards rushing a game. The linebackers are a weak link, but the secondary has cornerback Rashean Mathis and the hard-hitting safety Donovin Darius.  WEAKNESSES -- Byron Leftwich can be one of the most exciting quarterbacks in the league, and he led the Jaguars to four comeback victories in 2004. But the Jaguars finished 29th in the league in scoring offense. Running back Fred Taylor has been injured enough that he cannot be relied upon to carry the offense. The Jaguars drafted receiver Matt Jones in the first round to give Leftwich another weapon.  OUTLOOK -- The schedule does the Jaguars no favors, with six of their first seven games against teams that made the playoffs last season. Even more troubling are the holes in the passing defense. That is bad news when the Jaguars must face opponents named Manning, Harrison and McNair. Making the playoffs will be a struggle.    3 Houston (7-9)  STRENGTHS -- Receiver Andre Johnson went to the Pro Bowl in his second season, and his presence helped quarterback David Carr set career highs in almost every passing category. Still, if the Texans want to get all they can out of Johnson, they have to find someone to play opposite him, so opponents have another player to worry about covering.  WEAKNESSES -- The offensive line is under scrutiny because Carr has been sacked 140 times in the last three seasons, tied with Drew Bledsoe for the most in the league. The Texans did not overhaul the roster to address the problem. Carr cannot continue to take that kind of battering, especially when facing the defenses of Buffalo, Pittsburgh and Baltimore in the out-of-division schedule.  OUTLOOK -- The Texans have improved in the victory column every year since their inception in 2002, but a defensive overhaul to get them younger, and the holes in pass protection, mean they will probably not make a playoff push until the 2006 season.    4 Tennessee (5-11)  STRENGTHS -- If Steve McNair remains healthy, he is still one of the elite quarterbacks in the league; he had surgery to repair his sternum in December. His favorite receiver, Derrick Mason, is now with Baltimore, but McNair should benefit from the expected emergence of receiver Tyrone Calico, and from the system of Norm Chow, the new offensive coordinator, who stresses protecting the quarterback.  WEAKNESSES -- The exodus of several stars has left the Titans' roster low in experience. Mason, cornerback Samari Rolle, defensive lineman Kevin Carter and tackle Fred Miller were victims of Tennessee's salary-cap trouble. The questions are especially worrisome on the defense, which had its problems last season, ranking 30th in the league in allowing points.  OUTLOOK -- The offense should be better if McNair and other starters returning from injuries stay healthy. But the Titans lost veteran wisdom in their salary-cap purge, and they will not make their fifth playoff trip under Coach Jeff Fisher.   A.F.C.

It is fun to browse through the more than 350 photographs of now-familiar celebrities as they looked 20, 30 or 40 years ago. And it is a pleasure to read Mr. Leonard's graceful analysis of how Sullivan, a newspaper columnist who \\"couldn't sing, or dance, or spin a plate,\\" nevertheless became \\"a Ministry of Popular Culture,\\"\\"a one-man cable television system, with wrestling and Bravo and comedy channels, Broadway and Hollywood and C-Span, sports and music video.\\" However, a book of photographs with even the liveliest text can hardly do justice to the vaudeville-cum-circus that logged 1,087 hours of air time during its 23-year run, from 1948 to 1971. The magic simply cannot be recaptured. Had Ms. Falkenburg and Mr. Solt chosen to include a complete list of Sullivan's 10,000 guests with the dates on which they appeared, or at least an index for the photos (most of them excellent, though all of them are in black and white even though the show was broadcast in color beginning in 1965, a fact not noted in the book), \\"A Really Big Show\\" might have been a useful reference book.
