As the case of surrogate motherhood in Santa Ana, Calif. (news article, Oct. 23), taught us, new technology in fertilization can make more problems in defining who are the parents than it solves by allowing an infertile couple to conceive. So, too, this new fertilization technique using donated eggs is sure to give rise to lawsuits that will vainly try to answer the question, \\"Who is the mother of this baby?\\"   Now it's true that men have been semen donors for years, and the issue of paternity only rarely, if ever, comes up. But with women donating eggs there is much less anonymity, and there is a natural bond that a woman feels to her child.   So it's a sad day for me, and for others who are confronted by these \\"new families.\\" As usual, a sad day for me means a happy one for lawyers. JOSEPH M.

Imagine the benefits that might come to the world if we could develop for Iraq a constitution, as we did for Germany and Japan, that limited its military to an exclusively defensive stance and brought fundamental democratic values into its society. This could be the beginning of an Arab democracy, the first in the world.   The United States and its allies cannot simply go in there, bomb Iraq into the Stone Age, and then bring the troops home and leave Iraq in chaos. We have the responsibility to rebuild Iraq as an independent, democratic state -- or we will have fought not for peace but only for our own short-term interests.   It would be far-sighted and politically timely for Congress to hold hearings and for universities to organize conferences covered by the media in which constitutional scholars and experts on the Middle East and Islam were asked to introduce into international debate possibilities for restructuring Iraq -- and also Kuwait and a possible Palestinian state, for that matter.

By George Soloveytchik. 346 pp. New York: W.W.

Essentially this film is \\"Potemkin\\" in all its original magnificence—a classic among motion pictures and one of the boldest films ever screened. Now a prologue and epilogue have been added and a suitable sound-track affixed. Though somewhat presumptuous, these new fixtures indubitably enhance the great old film.For Eisenstein's historic telling of the story of the Potemkin mutiny in 1905 and of the Odessa revolt which followed is, in \\"Seeds of Freedom,\\" shown as a flashback remembrance of the episode by one of the original sailors of the ship. Now, as a leader of Russian guerrillas behind the Nazi Crimean lines, he tells the story to his followers while they are waiting nervously for an attack. And then, when he has finished the story—the film \\"Potemkin\\"—he leads his followers forth. The sustaining idea is that people fight now for freedom as they fought then and that the counterpart of the Nazis were the Czarists in 1905.On the whole, this modernized version, which William Sekeley supervised, is done with taste and distinction. The musical score and sound effects are excellent, and the dubbing of English voices onto the silent film is generally good. Occasionally, contemporary idioms sound incongruous, as they do in the prologue and epilogue. But the writing by Albert Maltz has strength and heart. And Henry Hull is acceptably convincing as the leader who tells the tale, while Aline McMahon contributes a moving speech which is interpolated in the old film.But it is that old film, \\"Potemkin,\\" which is bone and sinew of the Stanley's attraction. Never to be forgotten are its great scenes—the horrible slaughter of the people on the Odessa steppes, the scenes of the revolt of the sailors and the brilliant sequence showing the cruiser preparing to fight. For those who have never seen \\"Potemkin\\" we heartily recommend this chance. Indeed, for those who have seen it the opportunity to see it again should not be missed.

She has drawn to her, through the years, a world of exiles, wanderers, seekers after learning, pleasure, freedom, art. Nowadays, judging by the variety of motion pictures here, she has welcomed another world, comparatively new—that of the cinema.Apart from the native product and the ubiquitous American, here are films on view this week from Britain, Germany, Russia, even Czechoslovakia. And a Polish picture is listed for presentation soon. As it happens, the two offerings now playing which are most seriously considered by the artistic and critical public are Russian and Czechoslovak. The first is called \\"Tempéte sur I'Asie\\" (\\"Storm Over Asia\\"), a title rather reminiscent of a British play of last season. The Czech picture is known as \\"Seduction,\\" with a secondary title, \\"Erotikon.\\"The critics hailed Pcudovkine, director of \\"Tempéte sur I'Asie,\\" as a new genius who has discovered how to reproduce the most exact \\"rhythm of life\\" out of an apparent confusion and disorder. The result is contrasted with the \\"routine American presentations,\\" to the considerable detriment of the latter. More conservative eyes draw a different conclusion. To them it seems, without making any comparisons, that Poudovkine has merely touched the edge of an excellent cinematographic idea and has somehow let it escape without ever quite getting hold of the vital drama which is concealed somewhere at the centre.\\"Storm Over Asia.\\"\\"Tempéte sur I'Asie\\" does serve, however, to present to Western eyes an actor of unmistakable talent and power, Inkijinoff, a Tartar Valentino, as it seems. Young, striking in appearance, playing with much restraint, he is able to portray a character, originally of utmost primitive simplicity but growing when thrust into a foreign world to a complexity and force which, apparently, only the construction of the picture limits. If one piece of work can be taken as a test, Inkijinoff has a bright future.The story deals with a coup d'état of a foot-loose Russian General cast adrift by the revolutionary muddle of 1918 and wandering with his troops over the face of Asia. He turns up in Mongolia, with the intention of making himself ruler there, and seeks to further his plan by setting up a peasant lad reputed to be a descendant of the great Ghengis Khan as a native Emperor. The young peasant, Timour, played by Inkijinoff, is docile and considerably bewildered by these events. But when a last atrocity is committed before his eyes Timour runs amuck, stirs up the peasantry and starts to sweep Petroff away. This development, breached only in the last five minutes of the picture, is actually accomplished by a frightful windstorm, which overthrows Petroff, his horses and his men, while Timour and his Mongolians ride before the storm, in brief, confused, \\"modernistic\\" flashes.The character of Timour, as Inkijinoff first pictures him, is strangely likable. He is first discovered in his father's wattled tent on the bleak Manchurian plains starting off for the annual fur market, his father being ill, with the family's most valuable possession, a silver fox fur. The sale of this fur for a proper price—put at 500 taels—would insure a year's comfort for Timour's people, but it is not to be. A thieving fur dealer seizes the fox, Timour runs foul of Petroff's guards in trying to recapture it and takes to the mountains.The Stolen Fur.There he joins a band of guerrillas and is eventually captured by Petroff's men. He is ordered shot, and the command is carried out. But the bullet is not fatal, and when Petroff discovers among Timour's effects a talisman indicating that the lad is of the blood of the ancient conquerors he orders the young peasant salvaged. Timour convalesces. Presently, growing accustomed to his new position as a cherished hostage, a means of holding the country for Petroff, Timour perceives his silver fur about the neck of the General's daughter. The thieving dealer has given it to her. The discovery helps to bring about the climax which actually occurs when Timour finds a young Mongolian about to undergo execution.Inkijinoff succeeds in imparting a quiet and simple steadfastness to the rôle of Timour. His stubborn peasant refusal to sell the fur cheap is skillfully filmed. His willingness to join any comrades in the work at hand and his trustfulness of others make several brilliant passages Notable is the sequence in which a corporal of Petroff's army takes Timour out to shoot him. The youth has no knowledge of what is before him, and strides along, his arms bound, but with a happy faith in the corporal, whom he takes for a friend. At the last, the corporal agonizingly orders Timour to turn his back, as one would order a friendly, eager puppy to go home, and fires. It is a poignant scene.The next time Timour appears on the screen he is convalescing. But something else has happened to him besides his wounds. He has grown suspicious. His whole character has deepened, as shown by the capable Inkijinoff. The General's daughter offers him a drink of water. He takes the glass and holds it until his visitors leave the room. Then, though sick with thirst, he pours the water on the floor.Out of minor episodes such as that Poudovkine has built a picture sometimes very gripping, sometimes merely distraught. A minor character, a brigand chief, is finely conceived. There are a number of excellent battle passages, and the wild Asian landscape is beautifully photographed.Authentic Atmosphere.There are indications that the producers have sought to render a true reproduction of manners, customs and mood of the land where their story is laid. One remarkable sequence shows the ceremonious reincarnation of a Grand Llama, with devil horns, clappers, bells, curious head dresses and religious dances featured.In his declared purpose of abandoning \\"outworn\\" forms, the producer has only partially succeeded. The effect as a whole is disjointed and a little clumsy. At the start the picture is far too sluggish, and the entire later development of the plot is crowded into the last few minutes of the action. But it is creating a furor here.\\"Tempéte sur I'Asie\\" is playing at the neat modern Colisée, on the Avenue des Champs-Elysées. It is exhibited at matinée and evening performances in the manner of our high-priced pictures at home. The first part of the program consists of an inferior cartoon, an ancient \\"Western\\" of Harold Lloyd, which was well received last night, and a news reel. After the intermission, but before the main picture went on, a series of advertising films was shown—as is customary here. The audience was cosmopolitan, with a mixture of Mongols present, and the??? \\"baignoires\\" at the rear of the how??? were crowded as well as the \\"s??? pontin???\\"—the seats in the ???isles.The Czech picture, \\"Seduction,\\" of a very different order, the equally interesting. It is a ri??? little comedy, unusually reali??? having particular interest for Amer???icans since its producer, Machaty Czech, learned the trade in Ho??? wood. His career was a strugg??? from which he was rescued by v??? Stroheim. Machaty went home ??? Czechoslovakia in 1925. Next yea??? he produced \\"The Kreutzer Sonata, the following year another picture \\"Schveik,' and in 1928 \\"Erotikon.\\"He, too, seeks to do away with \\"outworn forms,\\" and is considering a picture in sound for his next production, in which, as he says, not merely the essential speech of the characters will be heard but a whole gamut of casual sounds as well.

A new report, analyzing data from the United States Government and the international Red Cross, found that in the 1970's the average number of natural disasters recorded per year was 75, a 50 percent increase over the previous decade. But, comparing the same two decades, the estimated deaths caused by these events climbed fivefold, to 114,000 per year. During the average year of the 1970's, disasters caused disruptions, often costly and wrenching, in the lives of an estimated 44 million people.    Many relief officials are beginning to feel that emergency assistance today is ''like trying to bandage a wound that is constantly growing,'' as expressed by Anders Wijkman, Secretary General of the Swedish Red Cross, which sponsored the study.   Experts attribute the increase in casualties, which is occurring in the less developed countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, to several factors: deforestation, erosion and other ecological stresses are reducing the land's resilience in the face of climatic extremes","excerpt":"poverty is forcing more and more people to live in disaster-prone areas; and the human population is continuing to grow rapidly, intensifying the other forces.
