The Times then was struggling to stay alive and the obvious thing to do was offer what the giant newspapers of the era did: Sunday comic supplements. Ochs, however, had something else in mind. Just three weeks after taking over, he introduced an illustrated Sunday section with feature articles intended to appeal to intelligent readers and printed on coated paper for good reproduction of photographs: The New York Times Sunday Magazine Supplement.         It soon became the turn-of-the-century equivalent of instantaneous TV images  from afar. In mid-1897, the Western world was excited by Britain's opulent jubilee celebration of Queen Victoria's 50th year on the throne, and American readers clamored for every word the press could supply by telegraph. Then, suddenly, pictures! New York was electrified by a 16-page splash of photographs  -- in, of all places, the good gray Times.

News Summary and Index"},{"year":"1953","title":"The depiction of activity in and around a Soviet village hospital in \\"The Country Doctor,\\" Saturday's Artkino import at the Stanley, is one of radiant optimism, perfectly suited to Magicolor tinting. Whether a generally Utopian attitude and background truly reflect the medical spirit and harmony behind the Iron Curtain today is not for us to confirm. Yet it marks every scene of this frank tribute to socialized medication, spanning the arrival of a woman physician at the \\"Hot Springs\\" outpost and her final, triumphant report to a Moscow convention.Also, for all the gaiety and bustling servitude, few of the harsher realities confronting every remote practitioner in the world, party or no party, are touched upon here. And \\"The Country Doctor\\" adds up to an ingratiating pep talk rather than a strong persuader.As such, the picture contains some good, sturdy ingredients. One is a deliberately simple story line, which has the heroine quietly rejuvenating the staff, patients and villagers through nothing more spectacular than a couple of successful operations, the installation of water piping, kindness and decency. The dialogue, written by Maria Smirnova, is brisk and often pungent. Several muted scenes wherein the newcomer and her mainstay, the dying horse-and-buggy symbol who once headed the hospital, are splendid, and the casual insertion of a sweet romance between the heroine and a local agronomist—after the woman relieves him of his appendix—seems most apt.So, decidedly, does a restrained, beguiling performance by Tamara Makarova, as the fine young woman who selflessly wins the love of the entire village. Gregori Belov, as her predecessor","excerpt":"Lev Kapustin, Maria Tushova, Ivan Bulganov and Lena Belsky are convincing as various staff members and local gentry. Not, unfortunately, Alexei Glazov, as a surly, neurotic medico who unaccountably wins support from Miss Makarova, and presumably the U. S. S. R., even after indifferently bungling an operation.However, wholesale cheerfulness remains the order of the day. And this glimpse afforded us of some supposedly representative souls grappling with matters of life and death is a mighty sunny one, often bordering on Gilbert-and-Sullivan jauntiness. Director Sergei Gerasimov gives thoughtful indication now and then of knowing better. So let us hope that the Russians, who know how, approach the subject next time with rolled-up sleeves.
