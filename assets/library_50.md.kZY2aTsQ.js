Tuna tends to stand around too long, growing dark, and the seaweed around the nori sushi is soggy and hard to bite through.  The recent rains had something to do with the dampness of the seaweed, but in the best sushi restaurants these sheets are lightly toasted to restore crispness just before they are used. At Akaihana, despite the seaweed, all sushi with warm eel were good, and so were the fillings in the cone-shape hand rolls, especially grilled salmon skin with rice, cucumber and sesame seeds.

Orion has been suffering recently from a series of disappointing releases.    An Orion spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports.
