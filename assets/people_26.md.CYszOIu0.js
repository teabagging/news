When Baseball Is the Stuff of Dreams"},{"year":"2001","title":"NEWJACK: Guarding Sing Sing, by Ted Conover. (Vintage, $14.) The author, a journalist with a reformer's heart, recounts the year he spent under cover as a rookie correction officer, or ''newjack,'' at Sing Sing prison in Ossining, N.Y., where he struggled to maintain order within the anarchic cellblocks while keeping his own psyche and moral code intact. His report, which won a National Book Critics Circle Award, is a ''moving indictment of our ways of punishment,'' Daniel Bergner wrote in the Book Review last year.    HUNTS IN DREAMS, by Tom Drury. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) The sequel to the author's first novel, ''The End of Vandalism,'' centers on a family in a bleak farming community: an ex-vandal turned plumber, his wandering wife and their two children. The result is a ''somber, American Gothic-type story'' that read together with the earlier work ''gives off a sense of passing time, of that particular pleasure of a multipart novel,'' D. T. Max said here in 2000.    THE ROSE GROWER, by Michelle de Kretser. (Bantam, $12.95.) At the outset of the French Revolution, an idealistic American balloonist descends into a remote Gascon village and becomes involved in the lives of a magistrate and his three daughters, chief among them the quiet middle daughter, who dreams of creating an original hybrid rose. '' 'The Rose Grower' is a lovely, meticulously researched first novel,'' Joanne Harris said here in 2000. Tulip Fever, by Deborah Moggach (Delta, $12.95), is set in Amsterdam during the 1630's, when the tulip market was reaching dizzying heights. The novel revolves around a wealthy merchant and his bride, whose reckless fling with a young artist parallels the city's disastrous obsession with a flower. Last year our reviewer, Catherine Osborne, praised the author's ''sumptuous prose.''    THE TWILIGHT OF AMERICAN CULTURE, by Morris Berman. (Norton, $13.95.) Things ain't what they used to be, according to this impassioned indictment of contemporary life, which finds lots to complain about, from the ''toxicity'' of corporate capitalism to dumbed-down academia. ''If you'd like to combine the anti-multinational rage of a black-clad Seattle protester with the mordant cultural despair of a . . . Jacques Barzun, here is your man,'' Alexander Star wrote here in 2000.    PAST TIME: Baseball as History, by Jules Tygiel. (Oxford University, $14.95.) Each generation has reinvented the national pastime to fit its own perceptions, the author argues in a collection of essays that explore baseball's interaction with America's social and cultural history. ''Tygiel's forte as a historian is his eye for what may appear nugatory or marginal but, when focused upon, illuminates the temper of a given moment,'' Roberto Gonz&#225","excerpt":"lez Echevarr&#237;a wrote here in 2000. The same publisher has reissued Gonz&#225;lez Echevarr&#237;a's Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball, ($15.95), a celebration of Cuba's love affair with the game, which is almost as long and rich (and just as enthusiastic) as that of the United States. He ''describes just how ingrained baseball has been in his nation . . . and how intertwined it was with the American major leagues before Castro's revolution,'' Alan Schwarz said here in 1999.    DISOBEDIENCE, by Jane Hamilton. (Anchor, $13.) This novel about a pianist's adulterous affair with a violinist unfolds through the eyes of her son, who was 17 at the time and is reconstructing his account 10 years later. He learns of his mother's romance by tapping into her e-mail, and keeps it a secret even as his discovery shapes his own nascent sexuality. The result is ''a warm, humane examination of the privileges and pitfalls of American family life,'' Sylvia Brownrigg wrote in these pages last year.    THE TECHNOLOGY OF ORGASM: ''Hysteria,'' the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction, by Rachel P. Maines. (Johns Hopkins University, $14.95.) No snickering, please. The author of this social history maintains that the vibrator, which was designed in the late 1870's, was the last in a long line of devices used by doctors to treat hysteria, a feared disease that was more likely ordinary female sexual desire. ''Maines supports her thesis with thorough, original and surprising'' research, Sarah Boxer wrote here in 1999.    ON SPEC, by Richard Rushfield. (St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95.) This humorous first novel tracks the lives of six young Hollywood hopefuls -- a development girl, an agent, a writer, a studio head, a producer and a bimbo -- as they try to merge onto the fast track. The author ''has complete command of his intricate plot,'' Eden Ross Lipson said here last year.   Scott Veale   NEW & NOTEWORTHY PAPERBACKS"},{"year":"1976","title":"Dr. and Mrs. Jose R.

His name is Thomas Frank, and his prophetic book ''What's the Matter With Kansas? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America'' is No. 11 on the hardcover nonfiction list this week. Frank's book, a biting and sometimes quizzical assessment of why blue-collar voters are embracing the Republican Party, was published back in early summer and quickly went on the list. It fell off but made a comeback in mid-November after reeling Democrats, trying to figure out where things fell apart, began lugging it home from bookstores. Frank's publisher, Metropolitan Books, an imprint of Henry Holt & Company, gets credit for being prepared. ''It did occur to us that if George Bush won the presidency a lot of Democrats might be asking why it happened,'' Holt's publisher, John Sterling, told The Associated Press. ''We made sure we had plenty of stock in our warehouses the first thing after the election.'' It hasn't hurt that Frank has been able to hold his own on both Bill O'Reilly's and Jon Stewart's cable shows. There are now 175,000 copies of ''What's the Matter With Kansas?'' in print.    STAY IN THE NOW: Some Kerry voters aren't ready for refined introspection. They are flocking instead to Gene Stone's primer ''The Bush Survival Bible,'' which arrives with a playful subtitle: ''250 Ways to Make It Through the Next Four Years Without Misunderestimating the Dangers Ahead, and Other Subliminable Strategeries.'' Stone's book is No. 7 on the extended paperback advice, how-to and miscellaneous list. The material in ''The Bush Survival Bible'' ranges from clanging calls to action (''6 Ways to Get Involved in Local Politics'') to soggy self-help talk (''Don't lose your joy,'' ''Stay in the now'') to short essays by writers like Tracy Kidder, Kurt Andersen and Andrew Solomon. Conservatives will find some of this stuff pretty outrageous","excerpt":"liberals may find much of it pretty funny. Stone provides a list of ''9 People Worse Than Bush'' that includes mini-profiles of Torquemada and Ivan the Terrible. And James Howe, the author of the ''Bunnicula'' books for children, contributes a piece called ''10 Things Parents Can Say to Their Children.'' It features this line: ''Who do you want for bedtime reading tonight -- Al Franken, Molly Ivins or Garrison Keillor?'' If the other advice in Stone's book is not consolation enough, he provides a list of ''7 Countries to Move To.'' Coming in at No. 5 is New Zealand, about which Stone writes, ''The people are friendly, the food is fresh, and although neighboring Australia has taken a sharp turn to the right, progressives are welcome here.''

His critics countered that such a system would ''skim off'' the brightest students, promote white flight and leave inner-city schools black and poor. The proposal went nowhere.    Forty years later, inner-city schools have indeed become largely black and poor -- not through vouchers, but because dismal schools have frightened away both the black and white middle class. The voucher debate has re-emerged, but this time focused on means-tested strategies aimed at the poorest of the poor. Three-fifths of the states have choice programs that allow movement among public schools, with about 10 others considering means-tested plans that would afford poor families an escape hatch from miserable inner-city schools.

The latest OPEC decision contrasted sharply with the results of many of the group's traditional December meetings over the past eight years, when it decided on oil price increases that drove up the world's energy costs. No Action on Libyan Demand   Sources close to the oil ministers, who as always met behind closed doors, said the group had also rejected a Libyan request to blacklist American oil companies whose personnel leave Libya in response to a request by President Reagan.  Mr. Reagan urged the companies yesterday to withdraw their personnel promptly and he plans to invalidate American passports for travel to Libya.   The ministers were said to have listened \\"politely,\\" but took no action on Libya's demand that OPEC take unified steps against United States oil companies.  Libya's oil minister, Abdussalam Mohammed Zagaar, was quoted as denouncing the United States for taking an \\"illegal and unfair\\" action.

It all begins at Elaine's, where Woody Allen's character is having dinner with Mariel Hemingway's. (''I'm 42 and she's 17,'' he confesses to his best friend, played by Michael Murphy.) Mr. Allen's MANHATTAN (1979) is still one of the most exquisite black-and-white films ever made and one of the most glorious tributes to New York. The characters, who are involved romantically in various ways, are a lot less admirable than their city. Diane Keaton plays a pretentious, combative writer. Meryl Streep plays one of her most hostile characters ever, Mr. Allen's lesbian ex-wife, who is writing a nasty tell-all book.
