This is especially true in intensive-care units, where every facet of physiological function is monitored, and ventilation is often mechanically controlled. Unfortunately, the medical profession has been slow to apply this humane treatment more widely.   The binding of arms and legs of struggling patients raises important moral and legal questions, and almost always indicates that pharmacological therapy for pain is inadequately dosed or not used at all. Advances in anesthesiology mark the triumph over suffering in the operating room. These lessons must follow the patient into the intensive-care unit.  ARTHUR E. SCHWARTZ, M.D. Asst.

The cure involved restricted reading and conversation, and a prohibition against creative work. Some women apparently responded well, but others -- including Gilman, who was treated for a nervous breakdown -- were driven from boredom to near-madness.   Gilman, however, recorded her response to the regimen in a secret journal, which became the basis of her book. Ronald Perera's new opera, with a libretto by Constance Congdon -- at least the third operatic setting of this story since 1986 -- had its New York premiere on Wednesday evening at the Manhattan School of Music (120 Claremont Avenue, Morningside Heights), where it is to be repeated tonight and tomorrow. Opera composers have long been drawn to stories in which women go mad, an attraction less misogynistic than opportunistic. Mad scenes, traditionally, mean flighty, virtuosic soprano writing, and under the right conditions that means show-stopping applause. But more can be less: the Gilman story is a single extended mad scene, unrelieved by the romance and backstairs scheming that surround the mad scene in (to take the most famous example) \\"Lucia di Lammermoor.\\" Review/Opera","excerpt":"Probing A Woman's Madness"},{"year":"1962","title":"Outer Space: Prospects for Man and Society: ed by L Bloomfield Probing The Blue","excerpt":"Probing Author's Query"},{"year":"1929","title":"Views on sound films quoted from issue of Licht Bild Buhne of Berlin FILM NEWS FROM THE FRENCH CAPITAL.","excerpt":"Probing for Reactions.

It may well be that at this point, nearly 56 years after the composer's death, it's only the music that matters. But Gershwin fans interested in peeking behind the scrim erected by the composer's family will have an opportunity to reconsider the composer's life and times in May, when Joan Peyser's biography, \\"The Memory of All That: The Life of George Gershwin,\\" is due from Simon & Schuster.    The book, like Ms. Peyser's racy 1987 study of Leonard Bernstein, is a psychobiography rather than a musicological study: hints about Gershwin's private and interior life are gleaned from his letters, from his comments as recalled by his associates and from Ira Gershwin's song lyrics, which Ms. Peyser says represent a veiled biography of the composer. Gershwin himself is painted as narcissistic and insensitive, but also insecure and disappointed by his inability to gain a foothold in the \\"serious\\" music world.  The Unacknowledged Offspring    But there is also a good helping of gossip, and the section of the book that will undoubtedly be most widely talked about is Ms. Peyser's discussion of Alan Gershwin, an impoverished songwriter who was born in 1926, whose original name was Albert Schneider and who grew up convinced that he was the composer's son.

The problem, as viewed by the audience, is not so much the young husband's obligations, but the selection of this antiquated stage piece of Thomas W. Broadhurst's as material for the screen.Jim and Rose Powell are represented as being much in love with each other. But when a baby arrives Rose lavishes her affection on the infant and allows Jim to shift for himself in the matter of social diversion. In the offing is Nita Meredith, a bachelor girl, who is ready to admit to any one who cares to listen that she wants to live dangerously, no matter what the cost. Jim and Nita see much of each other and are together the night Jim's baby dies.Jim's wife needs him. His sister, Madge, begs him to return to Rose. In her lonely apartment Nita prays that her lover will stay with her in this hour of her great need. She steals on tiptoe into Jim's home, and is just in time to hear him pledge his love anew to Rose. Sadly she stumbles out into the night.June Collyer, as Nita, has seldom played with such lack of conviction. Charles Starrett, a young Dartmouth student who has begun a career on the screen, appears as the husband, and Eloise Taylor is the wife.Other Photoplays.\\"The Road to Paradise,\\" with Loretta Young, is now on view at the Warners' Beacon.At the Fifth Avenue Playhouse the feature is \\"Gateway of the Caucacus,\\" a Russian travel film.\\"Disraeli\\" is at the Little Picture House today and \\"Sweethearts and Wives\\" will be there from tomorrow until Thursday.At the Hippodrome the feature is \\"The Criminal Code,\\" with Walter Huston.\\"Lightnin'\\" is at the Plaza until tomorrow and \\"Sin Takes a Holiday\\" is to be seen the latter part of the week.The Eighth Street Playhouse is showing \\"The Living Corpse,\\" a Russian silent film.\\"Zwei Herzen Im ¾ Takt\\" is at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse.At the Cameo the feature is \\"Al Yemen,\\" a Russian silent film.\\"Sous les Toits de Paris,\\" a French audible film, is at the Little Carnegie Playhouse.\\"Once a Sinner\\" is at the Roxy, \\"Reducing\\" at the Capitol, \\"No Limit\\" at the Paramount, \\"How He Lied to Her Husband\\" at the George M.

With shallow watering, the water never reaches the deeper plant root. While these deep roots tend to atrophy, the shallow roots near the surface are encouraged to grow. Shallow-rooted plants suffer most from the effects of sunlight beating down on the soil. The temperature of a dark-colored soil that is exposed to the sun's rays may approach 120 degrees near the surface. Shallow-rooted plants will suffer from such conditions more than will those that are deep-rooted. At greater depths, the soil temperature may rise no higher than 65 to 70 degrees.

4-yr-old project, which involves diving to 8,000- to 10,000-ft depths accessible only to most strongly built submersibles, is described as approaching critical stage; US deep-diving ship Alvin and 2 French submersibles are to take part in project; Alvin alone is to make some 30 dives into canyon, where preliminary surveys have shown that volcanic activity, earthquakes and possibly eruptions of scalding water tear open canyon floor; nature of process that is pulling Atlantic apart is considered by many as most fundamental problem in earth science; it is now generally accepted that earth's surface is divided into gigantic moving plates; in Atlantic area eastern plate composed of eastern Atlantic and Eurasia is pulling apart from western plate formed by western Atlantic and N Amer; whereas new ocean floor is manufactured along ridges, old ocean floor is driven down into earth's interior, generating volcanic activity that builds mountains; it is believed by some that mountain ranges on earth have in some way been formed by plate motions, perhaps by forces acting beneath plates or at certain critical points along their rims; study area, of which some 5,000 photographs have been taken by Woods Hole Oceanographic Inst ship Atlantis II, described; 'fish,' or deep-tow device developed by Scripps Inst of Oceanography has discovered magnetic properties of rock underneath ocean floor, which have enabled scientists to identify transition zone between sea floors formed before and after 700,000 yrs ago; detailed contour maps of area have been made possible by variety of devices; some devices described; map of Atlantic site of projected dive U.S.‐French Undersea Project Will Explore Rifting Processes That Are Widening the Atlantic Ocean"},{"year":"2005","title":"Free University, Berlin, researchers develop method of dissecting ancient amber that preserves trapped twig of swamp cypress","excerpt":"process, which is discussed in Proceedings B, involves adding drop of ERL, liquid resin, to amber;
