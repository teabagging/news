If a malaria victim is not reinfected by another mosquito, will he eventually shake off the disease or will it keep recurring throughout his life?    A.It is possible to have malaria for a long time. However, very- long-term chronic infections are characteristic of just one of the four species of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium malariae, which causes the form of the disease known as quartan malaria. The record case of quartan malaria resulting from a single infection lasted 53 years. Tertian malaria, caused by P. vivax or P. ovale, is less persistent but can easily go on for three to five years before it stops. The most frequently fatal form of malaria, caused by P. falciparum, is also relatively short in duration. Recovery from any of these is quicker with the aid of antimalarial drugs, to which, however, immune parasites are reported to be developing. Re-infection is possible with any of these forms, even before the first episode is over. People who are infected often enough but survive eventually acquire, in many cases, enough immunity so that though the parasite is present they suffer no apparent disease effects. There is, however, no crossover in immunity among the four species","excerpt":"immunity to any one has no effect against any of the others.

although State Atty Gen G F Kugler Jr says on Apr 10 that state is still investigating possible violations of state laws, it is understood that any indictments will be initially handed up by Fed grand jury in Newark; Cahill has denied 'any personal knowledge' of any wrongdoing, as has McCrane; investigation repts have not only affected upcoming gubernatorial election, but also appear 6 mos after conviction and prison sentencing of former Sec of State P J Sherwin, Cahill's closest friend and most trusted pol adviser; despite several Repub leaders' fears that Cahill is in trouble, State Sen J H Wallwork Jr has reaffirmed his endorsement of Cahill for re-election less than 24 hrs after he tried to withdraw earlier statement of support, attributing confusion to 'sloppy staff work'; investigations have exacerbated running feud between Cahill adm members, notably Kugler, and US Atty for NJ Stern; Kugler strongly implies that Stern had deliberately attempted to give impression that state had tried to cover up current investigation and that state had deliberately tried to keep any charges away from Fed authorities, news conf; says that IRS agents and state law enforcement officials had been carrying out cooperative investigation into financing of '69 gubernatorial campaign since last June and that Stern made it appear that he started investigation 3 wks ago; Stern, in 2 statements made on Apr 9 and 10, says that he found out about state investigation 3 wks ago when state police detective J Challender told him that state was attempting to cover up charges that allegedly involved McCrane and others; asks why state grand jury has not heard any evidence in case up to now, if, as Kugler claimed, investigation had begun 'as far back as last June'; says categorically that there was 'no ongoing' state and Fed investigation, as contended by Kugler; Kugler says that he will pursue criminal investigation 'no matter who' is involved; Stern calls Kugler pol captive of Cahill adm and says that his dispute with him is 'strikingly similar' to 1 involving Sherwin and charges then that Kugler had attempted to suppress state investigation of Sherwin; State Comm of Investigation held inquiry and absolved Kugler of charges of covering up in Sherwin case, although Sherwin was indicted only after Stern stepped into investigation; Kugler and Stern also disagree on statement of IRS Dist Dir E H Klinsman; Kugler maintains that Klinsman had confirmed in phone conversation that there had been cooperative investigation with state officials, while Stern says that he has 10 witnesses who heard Klinsman refuse to confirm 'any such thing';

Very little happens in this listless, fragmentary little import, which opened yesterday at the World Theatre.A farm girl is lovingly courted by a nice young artist and stalked by a hulking foreman, who violates her. Tongues clatter, the two men fight, the artist leaves and the poor girl sits down on the steps with her lower lip jutting out like a shelf. And that, by way of Finland and the Standard Releasing Organization, is \\"The Milkmaid.\\"Don't be misled by those posters of Anneli Sauli, seen in close-camera silhouette, taking a bare dip in a lake. It's quick and fairly distant. Just as fleeting are some tender close-ups of Miss Sauli and the smitten, flaxen-haired artist, Saulo Haaria, intertwined in a meadow.The picture has two distinctly minor attributes. A sincere effort has been made by the subtitler, Herman G. Weinberg, to imbue the sparse dialogue with a bitter-sweet, poetical irony, befitting transient young love. The photography is pleasantly bucolic simply because the country scenery of northern Finland happens to be pretty and bountiful.Whatever the worth of a novel by Johannes Linnanposki, the transcription by Juho Nevalainen remains little more than a slow, old-fashioned vignette, underscored with sweet strings (for the sweethearts) and harsh rumblings (for the bull-like breathing of the villain, Janno Palo).The acting is mediocre. Obviously the director, Toivo Sarkka, is more interested in posing Miss Sauli against the foliage. It adds up to quite a landscape in a flat, meaningless frame from Finland.

Some of them are mighty persuasive.Best of all, it solves the Whereabouts and reaffirms the pluckiness of the youthful American writer-director Larry Frisch. Six years ago, at the age of 20, Mr. Frisch gave us the excellent \\"H—the Story of a Teen-age Drug Addict.\\" And now, piloting some English-speaking Israeli professionals on home soil, he and the Geva Film Studios have co-produced a good-natured but extremely thin \\"omnibus\\" type picture.When a Jerusalem-bound taxi (a small bus) breaks down, the passengers and the driver jovially reminisce in flashback. One elderly country lady (Bergstein-Cohen) describes her first taste of city life. A brash young soldier (Shy Ophir) tells of his blunering triumph during field maneuvers. A policeman (Nathan Cogan) recounts his out-wittal of an insane bank robber. A young wife (Gilda Doom Van Steyn) bewails an embarrassing mushroom dinner, and the driver (David Segal) demonstrates how an old man learned contentment.None of these episodes is exactly striking, and the only real twist in the lot has already been snugly coined by Somerset Maughan in a short story. Furthermore, with one excruciating exception, the acting seems tentative. The cast's unfamiliarity with English is magnifed by Mr. Frisch's emphasis on dawdling pantomime.However, the excellently photographed contemporary panorama, from the bustling urban thoroughfares to the sweeping rawness of the countryside, is a joy to behold. And it is a long time since any picture has offered such a winning gallery of earnest, expressive faces.Let's just forget the star comedian, Mr. Ophir, whose acting is like a loud case of St. Vitus' Dance. But the pretty Miss Van Steyn, the stalwart Mr. Cogan and the sweet-faced Miss Bergstein-Cohen, seem especially apt good-will ambassadors for Israel.And so, for that matter, should be our own Mr. Frisch, when he finds a little more to say. Screen: 'Tel Aviv Taxi'","excerpt":"Import From Israel Shown at Cameo"},{"year":"1948","title":"There is sure to be a lot of conversation about the Italian film, \\"Furia,\\" which opened last night at the Rialto, so you might as well know here and now that it is an amazingly candid demonstration of the corrupting influence of human lust. But it is likewise so boldly pictorial in recounting an adulterous affair between the wife of an Italian horse breeder and one of his good-looking grooms that one might wonder severely whether its reproaches are entirely sincere.After all, there are other ways of putting a story of concupiscence on the screen than by pushing a lot of pictures of it right into the audience's face or by making such broad and crude suggestions that their meanings cannot be escaped. And there are other ways of showing sin as hurtful than by dwelling on the frank details of same. But, in this particular picture, other ways have been eschewed. Even with censor cuts, the evidence is that interest is less in the wages of sin than in the work.Despite some rather blunt paralleling of human and animal appetites and a few quite picturesque glimpses of Italian farm and village life, it is not a poetic intimation of the great sweep of life in any sense, but rather a candid estimation of the eroticism of the human beast. As such, it may win some admiration for its outspokenness, at least. And certainly its major performance is natural and competent. Isa Pola is remarkably potent and sure as the farmer's wife, while Rossano Brazzi is credibly unstable as the handsome groom. Adriana Benetti is both lovely and sensitive as the innocent girl, while Umberto Spadaro is disgustingly bawdy as an idiot stableman.But it is not a good motion-picture in an artful, cinematic sense. And it is certainly a questionable exhibit, so far as its exhibition goes.

But not nearly enough. And one viewer who never saw the original finds it hard to believe that talk and derring-do relegated Strauss to the background so often and so tantalizingly.The score, whether it's sung or \\"repressed,\\" is still a charming earful, and some of the individual and ensemble numbers are beautifully rendered. If the plot is a broad, absurd one—what operetta's isn't—a personable cast tackles its roles with gusto, if not inspiration.Curt J. Braun's adaptation follows a dashing young Hungarian of bygone days as he reclaims his father's country estate and tangles with a beautiful gypsy and her tribe and a pompous pig-breeder and his beautiful daughter (this one's a red-head).The color is nice indeed, most of the natural settings are striking and the interiors very fetching in décor and costumes. However, Arthur Maria Rabenalt's direction of this Ring Film Corporation release is only so-so.Gerhard Riedmann is the elastic hero, Margit Saad his tribal conquest and Maria Sebald the pig-breeder's daughter. And pigs or no pigs, we'll never understand why the hero pursued the iron-jawed, gypsy instead of a luscious redhead like Fraeulein Sebald.

The plan, in a different form, is equally applicable to the problem of the United States trade deficit.   I believe that our chronic trade balances are the product of:   (1) A shrinking gap between world productivity and United States productivity that has made our high-wage production uncompetitive. The effect of this, welcomed apparently by the conservative-dominated administrations of the last decade, has been to reduce United States real wages by forcing our workers to compete in low-wage world markets.   (2) Trade practices by the Japanese that shelter the Japanese domestic market from internal and external competition to provide a secure break-even for Japanese companies. Most of these practices would be antitrust violations if practiced subject to our laws.   (3) Federal budget deficits that have financed the import boom and alleviated the need for foreign producers to take credit risks to finance their output to us.   The argument made by supply siders for permitting our chronic trade deficits is that any effort to restrain imports or force bilateral trade balances would inhibit competition and suppress productive forces worldwide. These arguments fail to recognize that the social costs inflicted on United States workers and our economy are not reflected in the price of the foreign goods we buy.   If we apply the example of carbon emission permits to international trade, the analogous system would take the form of a statutory declaration that a country will not, except as a conscious national policy, import more than it exports. The declaration would be enforced by issuing to all buyers of United States exports a dollar-denominated permit that would constitute a transferable license to export to the United States a like dollar amount of foreign goods and services. Countries such as Japan that maintain a highly favorable trade balance would have to buy more of our goods or purchase permits on the open market, thus increasing the price of their goods, reducing the net price of our goods in world markets and providing hard currency benefits to poorer countries that import from us.   The permits could be maintained in United States banks that could be drawn on by check or wire transfer to pay the import license over to the Government. Essentially this type of trade quota system has been functioning effectively for years to regulate apparel imports. The difference is that the quota is not based on imports from us.   The net effect of the permit system would be to establish the price that balances our excess demand for foreign goods, eliminating from our economy the social costs of chronic trade deficits. All this could be accomplished without having to concern ourselves one by one with particular offensive trade practices, without having to establish bilateral trade balances and without having to protect any industries specifically. The Administration has called for market-based approaches. How about this one?

Though not without its flaws, &#8220;Between the Lines&#8221; has substance and depth, qualities absent from Ian's adolescent career and her hit song of those years, &#8220;Society's Child,&#8221; a bristling tirade against adult injustice. This precocious hit was followed by &#8220;Janey's Blues,&#8221; &#8220;Honey Do Ya Think?&#8221; and &#8220;New Christ Cardiac Hero&#8221; which zeroed in on dishonesty, exploitation, lack of communication, even suicidal impulses. At 15&#8208;going&#8208;on&#8208;16 Ian became the urchin at large, pinpointing the hypocrisies.of society, ever at the mercy of its mores, wounded by its snubs.
