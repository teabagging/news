A1    President Bush said the sectarian violence was ''a test for the Iraqi security forces,'' but gave no hint whether he was considering a more vigorous response by American military forces to restore order -- or whether the violence might delay their eventual departure.   A7    The crisis has demonstrated the power that the many militias in Iraq have to draw the country into a full-scale civil war, and how hard it would be for the state to stop it, Iraqi and American officials say.   A1    Leaders in the Middle East told Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her visit to the region that they were concerned that Iraq's sectarian violence could spread to other countries.   A7    Saudi Arabia Foils Bomb Attack  A suicide bomb attack on Saudi Arabia's most important oil and gas facility was thwarted when guards fired on two explosive-laden cars, causing them to detonate about a mile from the entrance, the Saudi Interior Ministry said.

A7    Coup Threat Cited in Philippines  President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines said the government had foiled a military coup attempt and declared emergency rule, banning rallies marking the 20th anniversary of the fall of Ferdinand Marcos, the former dictator.   A5    Militants Threaten Nigeria's Oil  Over the last two months a shadowy militant group in Nigeria has mounted attacks on oil facilities and taken more than a dozen foreign oil workers hostage, wreaking havoc on the industry that is the mainstay of Nigeria's economy.   A5    Thai Leader Seeks New Election  Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, facing a storm over a tax-free windfall from the sale of his family communications company, asked the king to dissolve Parliament, forcing an early election.   A3    NATIONAL   A8-11    Governor Says He Favors Bill Banning Abortions  Gov. Mike Rounds said that he was inclined to sign a bill that would ban nearly all abortions in South Dakota, the broadest measure to outlaw abortion anywhere in the country. If the governor signs the bill in the coming 15 days, it will take effect statewide on July 1.   A9    I.R.S. Reports on Charities  The I.R.S. said that it had seen a sharp increase in prohibited political activity among charities and churches in the last election cycle, a trend it aims to reverse as the country begins midterm elections.

A1    SCIENCE/HEALTH    Prostate Cancer Finding  A team of research scientists in Cleveland and San Francisco said that they had discovered a new virus in patients who had a rare form of prostate cancer.   A8    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Holocaust Survivors At Odds With Advocate  For years, Burt Neuborne worked pro bono for Holocaust survivors in a lawsuit that accused Swiss banks of helping the Nazis loot hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Jewish holdings. But a group of American survivors is seething at the lawyer, who recently filed a bill for nearly $4.1 million for his work.

As many homeowners have discovered, the grout (cement) originally used to fill the joints between the tiles may get black and dirty- looking, or even crack out and crumble in places. In addition, the joint between the tile and the top of the bathtub or lavatory sink may need refilling because some of the original grout has cracked out.   This last-mentioned job is probably the most frequently encountered repair problem in tile bathrooms. Expansion and contraction of the structural materials involved may cause the grout to crack out. Another possible cause is that when the tub is filled with water it sometimes ''settles'' slightly - again causing the brittle grout to crack out of the joint between the tub and the tile.

Handles are missing, zippers are broken and leather corners are shredded. But by the time the bags leave the Fordham Repair Center, they should look almost like new, said Mr. Jacob, who started this luggage and handbag repair business in 1953.    \\"There is no such thing as a lost cause,\\" Mr. Jacob said, holding a tattered Gucci bag. \\"If you have the money, we have the talent.\\"    Every job handled by Fordham is different, and Mr. Jacob needs to see the damaged object before estimating repair costs. Simple jobs, like fixing a lock, start at about $10. But badly damaged bags, which can require a complete overhaul, may cost as much as $400.    Picking up a large Vuitton suitcase, Mr. Jacob said, \\"The buckles were strong and we kept the original vinyl.\\" But nearly everything else on the bag is new. The idea is to closely match replacement parts and details with those originally on the bag.   Fordham Repair Center, which is near the Empire State Building, repairs soft luggage, hard-frame luggage, handbags, attache cases and even vintage alligator bags. When necessary, Fordham special-orders parts, as with a piece of hardware that had to be custom-made for a Fendi suitcase. Fordham also cleans luggage, charging $35 to $65.   To extend the life of a suitcase, Mr. Jacob suggests filling the bag to capacity with no empty spaces. \\"Accidents happen, but if treated properly, luggage can last for hundreds of thousands of miles.\\"  Like New     \\"Many times, customers think they need a new suitcase when in fact the old one can be repaired,\\" said Thea Rosen, who, with her husband, Marvin, owns Superior Leather Restorers.    Superior, with shops on Lexington Avenue and West 72d Street, will install new zippers, tabs, buckles, feet and handles","excerpt":"replace worn leather corners, and put in new leather sides. Mr. Rosen will also add wheels and a pull strap for $50 to $75.    The shop repairs handbags, attache cases, leather garments, leather chair seats and leather sporting equipment, including baseball gloves.  Superior, which sells new luggage and handbags, also makes customized luggage covers in heavy duck for $200 and up.    \\"If somebody has been traveling with a bag for 15 years, I can't make it new,\\" Mrs. Rosen said. \\"But I can make it better.\\" She advises travelers to remove shoulder straps and garment hooks from luggage checked onto a plane because it is easy for them to get snapped off.  Still at It     When the late John R. Gerardo opened his luggage repair shop in Manhattan at the turn of the century, much of his business was repairing steamer trunks. Today his sons and grandsons run the business out of the same shop in the Garment District. Most of their repair work is on suitcases, attache cases and garment bags, but they still get an occasional trunk.    \\"People buy Vuitton trunks at auction and want them refinished for coffee tables,\\" said John R. Gerardo Jr., who has worked at the shop for 25 years. \\"We clean out the inside, clean the brass hardware, repair the wood and shellack and varnish everything for a high-gloss finish.\\"   Gerardo, which also sells new luggage and briefcases, will work on zippers, handles, locks, wheels and bindings.

As to why two of the three original female stars, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker-Browne -- two of the three oldest among the eight -- were not invited back for the film, which is to open on Nov. 23, Mr. Columbus said, ''I take the film director's Fifth Amendment on that.'' Here's a look at how the original eight have fared, and how some of them felt about recreating their ''Rent'' roles -- or not.    TAYE DIGGS as Benjamin Coffin III. Mr. Diggs, 33, who starred in the UPN series ''Kevin Hill'' last season, may be the best known of the original cast. He is married to his fellow ''Rent'' and ''Wicked'' alumna Idina Menzel.    WILSON JERMAINE HEREDIA as Angel Schunard. Mr. Heredia, 33, won the 1996 Tony Award for best featured actor in a musical, but only a handful of film and television roles have followed. ''The one thing I think a lot of people forget is that acting is always a hustle,'' Mr. Heredia said. ''You always have to get to the next level, nothing is ever given to you on a silver platter.'' Currently, he said, he was ''trying to break out of the stereotype of being very good at playing a drag queen.''    JESSE L. MARTIN as Tom Collins. Mr. Martin, 36, met the ''Rent'' composer Jonathan Larson while waiting tables at the Moondance Diner on Sixth Avenue. He went on to become a television star as Detective Ed Green on ''Law & Order.'' Ed Green was shot in an April episode so that Mr. Martin could take a leave to film ''Rent,'' but he will return for his seventh season.    IDINA MENZEL as Maureen Johnson. Nominated for a Tony Award for her professional acting debut in ''Rent,'' Ms. Menzel, 34, took one home last year for her performance in ''Wicked.''      ADAM PASCAL as Roger Davis. ''I came at this from a place of being a musician, and for the longest time, that was really all I wanted to do,'' said Mr. Pascal, 34, who had never acted when he auditioned for ''Rent.'' He starred in ''Aida'' on Broadway in 2000 and had what he considered his ''first true acting role'' as the Emcee during the final weeks of ''Cabaret'' at the Roundabout Theater last year. ''I'd like to do more film, and frankly, there's nothing to do in theater,'' he said. ''The material being offered is so atrocious, I have to move into film.''    ANTHONY RAPP as Mark Cohen. ''It was like being home,'' Mr. Rapp, 33, said of being reunited with his fellow cast members. ''Sometimes being at home can be traumatic, but not at all in this case.'' His book, ''Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical 'Rent,''' is scheduled for publication by Simon & Schuster in January.    DAPHNE RUBIN-VEGA, the original Mimi Marquez","excerpt":"replaced in the film by Rosario Dawson, 26. Ms. Rubin-Vega, 36, was not offered Mimi in the film for a straightforward reason, Mr. Columbus said: she was pregnant. ''It was a difficult decision,'' he said, ''but we really had no other choice.'' Ms. Rubin-Vega has performed in ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' and ''Anna in the Tropics'' onstage.    FREDI WALKER-BROWNE, the original Joanne Jefferson; replaced by Tracie Thoms, 30. Ms. Walker-Browne was the oldest of the eight principal cast members, at 33; she returned to the stage as Rafiki in ''The Lion King'' in 2001, and is now working on arts education projects. Why wasn't she offered the film role? ''Because I'm too old for it,'' she said. ''It's as simple as that.'' She said she knew after an interview with Mr. Columbus that he ''was going to do the right thing by this film'' and not offer her the part. She did have one request: ''Keep Joanne black.''
