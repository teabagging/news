But because it is so controversial -- to specifically empower that person to make decisions to remove feeding tubes -- signing documents is not the answer to guiding one's destiny.   People must be sure to clearly inform not only their health care proxy what they want and don't want, but also they must be sure to have such a discussion with their physician, for if one's doctor will not honor one's wishes, getting a new doctor may be the best protection against unwanted medical treatment. Families should also be told about one's treatment preferences because physicians will be very reticent about forgoing medical treatment if the family objects.   The appointment of someone to make health care decisions after one loses decision-making capacity is far preferable to the use of a living will, though the two are not mutually exclusive. A living will requires one to anticipate what treatments one would need and not need and under what conditions. Very few people have the kind of information necessary to write a living will that will be helpful, and even fewer have a crystal ball to anticipate how they will die.   The living will form touted in your Dec. 28 editorial may serve as a useful checklist of items that people should consider, but neither the fact that it appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association nor that it is available from Harvard Medical School overcomes the basic \\"star-gazing\\" problem associated with living wills.   Finally, it is not only important to know one's rights but to be insistent about exercising them. Despite the fact these issues have been publicly debated since at least the Karen Quinlan case in 1975, physicians, health care administrators and their lawyers are often ill informed about the legal right to refuse treatment and will not honor health care directives.   Doctors often claim the fear of liability prevents them from honoring the right to refuse treatment, but the fact is that the risk of liability from following the patient's wishes to terminate treatment is infinitesimally small and there is a greater risk of liability from overriding those wishes.

When the name outgrew the 15-by-5-mile island to encompass the whole state, the island's title reverted to Aquidneck, the original Indian term. Aquidneck's southern profile is shaped by two headlands: the westernmost contains the bustle and opulence of Newport, while its smaller eastern neighbor, a 10-minute drive away, harbors Sachuest Point, a national wildlife refuge teeming with seabirds and wildflowers.

As a songwriter, he twisted blues, country and pop into unpredictable shapes. He was primarily a guitarist, although he was drafted to play drums in the Airplane. But as early as the 1960's, Mr. Spence had been found to be a paranoid schizophrenic. After making his 1969 solo album, ''Oar'' (Columbia), he was institutionalized for many years.

There are some highly improper but interesting ways to improve one's prospects, all based on provoking a reaction from the opponent holding the queen. You can, like P.

The play that bears his name, a bafflingly amphibious blend of history and tragedy, was seldom performed in this century until relatively recently. And most productions and analyses of \\"The Life and Death of King John\\" have tended to emphasize the more dynamic character of the Bastard, the patriotic son of Richard the Lion-Hearted, over John himself, who has all of Macbeth's infirmity of purpose with none of his more Olympian qualities.   The great interest of Robin Phillips's emotionally gripping, if somewhat muddled, production at the Stratford Festival here is that it makes John its unconditional center and, in doing so, presents him as a disturbingly pertinent statesman for our times. \\"Macbeth\\" and \\"Richard III,\\" with their portraits of raveningly ambitious, Machiavellian heads of state, were the perfect choices for politically slanted revivals in the paranoiac heyday of the late 60's and early 70's, the years of Johnson and Nixon. \\"King John,\\" on the other hand, has vital resonance for an age that often sees its politicians less as monsters than mediocrities, distanced from greatness by all-too-pedestrian frailties.

As Ms. Rigg, who also happens to be the regular \\"Mystery\\" host, notes in her introduction, \\"Mother Love\\" is not the standard whodunit usually featured on the series. It is a psychological thriller, offering, she adds pointedly, \\"a challenging role that's impossible for an actress to turn down.\\"   This evening's two-hour installment wastes little time establishing Helena's bad-seed credentials. It opens with a childhood scene, done in black and white, in which little Helena learns that her best school chum has gone to another girl's birthday party. Helena was not invited. Treachery! Disloyalty! These are the most dreadful of crimes, Helena will tell us again and again, and they deserve the severest punishment. Subsequent scattered flashbacks will show little Helena painstakingly preparing a poisonous tart for her wayward chum. Review/Television","excerpt":"Psychological Thriller Opens 'Mystery' Season"},{"year":"1990","title":"To the Editor:   The legalistic hue and cry over the heavy sentence imposed by Federal Judge Kimba M. Wood on Michael R. Milken overlooks the basic fact that she has reintroduced the rack as a form of punishment. Not in the excruciating physical form, but as an elegant psychological torture. She informed Mr. Milken that \\"his sentence could be reduced if he cooperated in future investigations\\" (front page, Nov. 22).   The concept of the provisional sentence has been around for some time, but was raised to an art form in 1973 by Federal Judge John Sirica in the Watergate trials. This crew of felonious incompetents was awarded sentences of 35 and 40 years, but Judge Sirica tempered justice with the observation \\"I don't think the government wants a pound of flesh out of you. . . . So I have told your attorneys that the sentences . . . will depend primarily on whether or not you cooperate\\" with the Senate Investigating Committee.   As a disinterested commentator, I wrote at the time that President Nixon was impeachable: either as a knowing conspirator or as an incompetent, guilty of the old crime of malversation. However, I objected vigorously to Judge Sirica's shortcut to obtain confessions and his savage sentences (three years of community service in the Aleutians would have been about right). But getting \\"bad men\\" was the top priority -- and don't fret about cruel and unusual punishments, the right against self-incrimination and other constitutional trivia.   Mr. Milken, as the incarnation of a \\"decade of greed,\\" seems to be getting the same political justice. Should we junk the Constitution to avenge junk bonds? JOHN P.

As Jordan Lage finds himself increasingly unable to differentiate between the real and the delusory, he is like a Michael Douglas movie character: outwardly normal, inwardly aberrant and soon over the edge. What begins as a private fantasy turns into a nightmare.   Fixated on a woman he sees in a window in a building across the way, he telephones her and makes suggestive and then threatening remarks. While pursuing this nonexistent relationship, he falls in with another woman (Claudia Silver), who quickly becomes his compliant victim. Her apparent masochism is a match for his sadism. The voyeur eventually turns violent, as Mr. Lage puts aside his high-powered telescope and picks up a knife.
