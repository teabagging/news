A program insert notes that the concerts are dedicated to Mr. Druckman's memory, and Mr. Masur remembered the musicians in brief comments from the stage.         In that context, the program -- though it included none of Mr. Druckman's music -- had the spirit of a sober meditation.

Certainly, the quality of the pictures as cinema is average at best, and the dancing that is reproduced in them is generally pretentious and dull.The best dancing in the whole program is done by Margot Fonteyn in a brief bit in \\"The Little Ballerina,\\" which is a feature-length British film. Dancing one scene from \\"Les Sylphides,\\" Miss Fonteyn shows that beauty and grace which should permeate the whole program but which, unfortunately, is not there. Her brief bit is all too fleeting. Otherwise, this undistinguished film spins an artless and sentimental fable about a little London girl who aspires to become a great ballet dancer, like Miss Fonteyn, and eventually gets her chance. Yvonne Marsh is the child who plays the hopeful without any particular charm. Martita Hunt drifts into the proceedings as a ballet teacher but soon drifts out again.The remainder of the program is made up of three unconnected dance films, offered as straight reproductions of artists performing in front of the camera. The first presents José Limon and a company of three doing a dance variation on the theme of \\"Othello.\\" entitled \\"The Moor's Pavane.\\" This is a ritualistic number, filmed in color, with the dancers in costumes performing against a sheer black background. Poor editing destroys the flow of the dance.The second is a dreary solo by Valerie Bettis, entitled \\"The Desperate Heart,\\" and the third again shows Mr. Limon as a dying bull-fighter in a thing called \\"Lament.\\" The latter might be a better title for the entire program.

Nixon has said he rescinded his approval 5 days after he ordered it put into operation; Nixon, in his May 22 statement, gave no hint that Interagency Com on Intelligence, which recommended in 43-page rept that existing restrictions against breaking and entering by intelligence agents be removed, had warned that 'use of this technique is clearly illegal'; NY Times has recd 3 memorandums written by Huston--1 summarizing com's rept to Pres, another informing heads of Fed intelligence agencies that com's recommendations had been approved, and 3d providing Haldeman with background on com's deliberations and with strategy for securing cooperation of then FBI Dir J E Hoover; memorandum sent to Haldeman for Nixon's approval in early July '70 notes that surreptitious entry, even by Fed agents, 'amounts to burglary'...is highly risky and could be embarrassing if exposed; memo says that such burglaries 'would be particularly helpful if used against the Weathermen and lack Panthers' and against unspecified 'diplomatic establishments' but notes that 'deployment of the exec protector force has increased the risk of surreptitious entry' in diplomatic cases; Exec Protective Service, uniformed branch of Secret Service, was created by Pres Nixon in Mar '70 to guard foreign embassies in Washington area; memo says intelligence com also proposed that restrictions against both legal and illegal 'mail coverage' be removed; 'legal' mail cover involves examination, before delivery, of lrs and packages addressed to suspect individuals, and recording of name of sender, date and place of posting and other information that can be obtained without opening seal; memorandum points out that 'illegal' mail covers, or opening of sealed materials before delivery, presents 'serious risks'; Huston says com recommended implementation of such 'covert coverage' on ground that 'advantages to be derived from its use outweigh the risk';

As a result it is almost impossible to find out how long this column must be to fit the space. Literary people often make light of journalists because they have to write to fit the space, but while there are many things about newspaper prose to make light of, fitting the message to the space is not one of them. Sonnets are also written to fit the space, and a great deal of literature that isn't would be improved if it were. It is rare these days to find a biographer or historian who can tell his tale in fewer than 800 pages averaging 500 words per page. This results from the decline of editing in the book trade and the spread of the word processor, which makes it so easy to write that people keep doing it long after their minds have bedded down for the night. This paragraph, written on a word processor and prohibitively long by newspaper standards, illustrates how easy the new technology makes it to keep writing long after the author has forgotten what he started to say, as I have at this point.

The easy answer was that it couldn't be done, and the sound of most small speakers unhappily proved the point. But to some engineers the word ''impossible'' is a spur, and circa 1980 a few imaginative companies - notably ADS and KEF - came up with shoebox-size speakers that perked up the ears of even the most exigent listeners. Experimenting with offbeat cone materials, more efficient magnets, and revving up their computers to ferret out previously unexplored design possiblities, these companies tackled the intractable problems of small speakers. Their efforts toppled the axiom that only big speakers can achieve musical verisimilitude.     Since then, the musical merits of small speakers have increased steadily, and two recent entries stand out as benchmarks in this development. The Wharfedale ''Diamond'' - selling for $95 - proves that even a low-cost minispeaker can approach the warmth and fullness of sound of its bigger confreres. And Celestion's SL-600, priced at $750, demonstrates that when cost is no object, a small speaker can match the big ones in clarity and power. The two models exemplify progress in small- speaker design at the two extremes of the price spectrum.
