There is also the balance of instrumental skills. Though his sense of style remains impressive, Mr. Stern's violin sound is not as strong as it once was. These players have adjusted with great skill, and with evident enthusiasm and respect.

The group has built its reputation partly on its performances of contemporary works. But if the Dvorak, Janacek and Schubert program it played on Saturday evening seemed like a retreat to the comforts of the standard repertory, the works the quartet played were fairly unhackneyed.      The ensemble began with hearty, warm-toned and impulsive readings of six of Dvorak's \\"Cypresses,\\" the composer's quartet version of an early song cycle. Janacek, one of Dvorak's spiritual descendents in the development of a Czech national style, was represented by the first and less frequently played of his two quartets, \\"The Kreutzer Sonata.\\" Inspired by the Tolstoy story, Janacek's four-movement quartet traces the tale's dark psychological mood, rather than its plot. It is also reasonably forward-looking: its quick, abrasive sul ponticello bowing effects have become part of the language film composers use in their scores for thrillers.     The players -- Ida Levin and Nicholas Mann, violinists, Katherine Murdock, violist and Marcy Rosen, cellist -- gave the Janacek a fiery, energetic account. And in the Schubert Quartet No. 15, which closed the concert, they achieved a good balance of gracious phrasing and passionate, soulful playing. In each of the works, though, there were moments when the group's youthful energy seemed slightly out of control. At those times, the quartet's otherwise warm tone tended to turn slightly shrill, and its usually precise ensemble started to fray.

They have re-created in black-and-white and in heretofore classified color footage of \\"flying saucers\\" the astounding events that have perplexed and/or frightened civilians and the military alike since 1947.If \\"Unidentified Flying Objects\\" is not as startling as an imaginary invasion by tiny, green men with pointed heads, it does, however, leave an impression of restrained documentation that is instructive and sobering.Messrs. Greene and Rouse are concerned mainly with illustrating reports of unexplained aerial phenomena that have been seen and photographed, and showing that these observations have been verified by Air Force, Army and Navy experts. Specifically, their \\"story\\" is based on the experiences of Albert M. Chop, a Los Angeles newspaper man who was chief of the press section of the Air Material Command in Washington. He is played in an unadorned manner by Tom Towers.Others portrayed in this quasi-documentary are Capt. Edward Ruppelt, who headed \\"Project Bluebook,\\" the Air Force's designation of its official inquiry into \\"U. F. O.\\", and Maj. Dewey Fournet, Pentagon liaison officer. Warrant Officer Delbert C. Newhouse, Navy photographer, and Nicholas Mariana, Utah businessman, both of whom photographed \\"saucers\\" in flight, and Capt. Willis Sperry, American Airlines pilot who sighted them, \\"play\\" themselves.Naturally, the color clips taken in Utah on July 2, 1952, by Newhouse and those shot by Mariana on Aug. 15, 1950, in Montana are of short duration. But the \\"objects\\"—seemingly small, silvery dots against a brilliant blue sky—are attested as genuine in the commentary of the principals.The film-makers' meticulous depiction of the military's documentation has a tendency to slow matters. But through their obviously sincere effort to show that a vast majority of the more than 2,000 reports checked were proved erroneous, a viewer also would he inclined to go along with the disclosure that about 15 per cent of the reports are still officially designated as inexplicable: that, in effect, unidentified flying objects have been sighted. It must be noted too that the reproduction of the sudden appearance of a flight of fourteen giant, saucer-like, fantastically speedy unidentified \\"objects\\" over Washington International Airport in July, 1952, is more exciting than the foregoing investigations. But the alleged flight, as it is picked up on the radarscopes and as it nearly makes contact with jets sent up to intercept, has a theatrical tension and a spurious quality not present in preceding scenes.\\"Unidentified Plying Objects\\" is not a specially imaginative example of movie-making.

But what has been obscured by the din is an early blueprint of the Bush-Quayle campaign's strategy, particularly its plans for attacking Gov. Bill Clinton.   The formula telegraphed by Mr. Quayle in his speeches, interviews and news conferences relies on the predictable labeling of Mr. Clinton and his Vice-Presidential nominee, Senator Al Gore, as tax-and-spend liberals. But Mr. Quayle also has experimented with a more subtle subtext aimed at reinforcing doubts about Mr. Clinton's character.

But recent moments on the campaign trail suggest that Mr. Quayle is still not sure-footed when he is forced to speak extemporaneously, as he will be in the Vice-Presidential debate on Oct. 13. Next to his convention speech, Mr. Quayle and his aides view the debate as their best opportunity to enhance the Vice President's image, a mission that is crucial to his political future, both this year and in 1996.

Couples, who is averaging $74,916 a start and 68.5 strokes a round this season, put together a bogey-free 67 and took the lead yesterday in the first round of the Nestle Invitational in Orlando, Fla. His five-under-par effort continued a nine-month streak dating to the 1991 United States Open in which Couples has been the most successful player in the world. Couples, competing in his sixth consecutive event, and the other early first-round starters had to wait out a 41-minute rain delay and fought winds gusting to 30 miles per hour. (AP) Spencer-Devlin in the Lead: Muffin Spencer-Devlin, coming off one of the worst years in her pro career in which she battled manic depression, fired a four-under-par 69 to grab a share of the lead in the L.P.G.A. Standard Register tournament in Phoenix. Devlin-Spencer, one of tour's most charismatic and outspoken figures, employed an array of textbook approach shots to take her share of the lead. She is tied with with Meg Mallon and Nancy Scranton. Spencer-Devlin played last season under the influence of carbonate lithium, a powerful anti-depressant, and won just $13,170, the lowest figure since her second year on the tour in 1980.

At one end are the fatty, sugary excesses served up in the cabanes a sucre or sucreries (maple sugar shacks) in the spring.

There is little that is convincing in the episodes, whether they are concerned with the stage act of Carlee Thorpe, who doesn't do much of anything, or in the sight of four men taking aim at a girl with army rifles, loaded, as they suppose, with regulation ammunition.Nancy Carroll gives quite a good performance, nevertheless one wonders in what theatre they could get four men to fire at a girl, even though one of the screen theatre's spectators explains, after the act, that the illusionist is supposed to replace the real cartridges with graphite missiles. And, also, it might seem somewhat dangerous for anybody to stand up against such missiles, considering the short distance the girl is from the rifles.Carlee Thorpe, the conjurer, fascinates a would-be society girl named Hilda Schmittlap, whose family is hindered in its social aspirations through the fact that Jacob Schmittlapp, the father, began life as a truck driver.Carlee, impersonated by Mr. Rogers, plays bridge with the winsome Hilda Schmittlap, and becomes so charmed by her that he neglects the partner in his act. Then comes the hardly inspired idea of the Schmittlaps not knowing that Carlee is on the stage, or that he has a queer act. Claire Jernigan, Carlee's partner, decides to leave him, understanding that the young man is in love with the Schmittlap girl. It seems at first that Claire is much better off, but to lend a bitter touch to her life with another similar performer, this individual browbeats the girl.The dénouement is worked out with all the finesse with which a village blacksmith might accomplish it. A real bullet is in one of the rifles being fired at Claire, and the warning from a woman is too late to stop the pulling of the trigger. But fear not for Claire, for she is only slightly hurt in the arm, and soon the benighted Carlee tells her in the hospital the old, old story and Hilda is cast aside.Another angle to this clumsy piece of fiction is that of having Hilda's wayward brother quite interested in Claire. This idea, of course, helps to bring the silly Carlee to his senses.Mr. Rogers is probably acceptable in the rôle. June Collyer and Nancy Carroll, however, do the best work. Regis Toomey, who portrays Hilda's bibulous brother, gives a performance which reveals that under more natural circumstances he might do highly creditable work.This picture was adapted by E. Lloyd Sheldon, a Harvard graduate, who obviously stoops to conquer his audiences. Whether he succeeds or not depends upon the type of spectators who happen to witness this dull offering.
