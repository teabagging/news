Revivals may be a theater staple, but don't ever expect to see ''Death of a Salesman II: Biff Strikes Back'' on a midtown marquee. Selling popcorn is another no-no. Despite being a profit center for the movie business, popcorn is frowned on by theater people because of its loud, crunching sound, as well as the difficulty of cleaning the kernels off the floor. But those aren't the only reasons that most producers and owners ignore this potentially lucrative concession: according to several Broadway insiders, theater would sacrifice a certain snob appeal if ticket-buyers were licking the butter off their fingertips in the middle of the second act. But some theater owners are starting slowly to change their ways.

He was sentenced to death after a 1986 trial, a punishment that was later commuted to life imprisonment.    Last week Mr. Bokassa, in failing health, was freed by the country's departing military ruler, Gen. Andre Kolingba, who was defeated in elections last month.  As one of his last acts in office, General Kolingba freed all of the country's criminals -- a move his opponents said was retaliation for his defeat at the polls. AUG. 29-Sept. 4: Bokassa Is Back","excerpt":"Loathed African Ex-Dictator Is Unexpectedly a Free Man"},{"year":"1932","title":"For the first showing last night of the film of Vicki Baum's stage work, \\"Grand Hotel,\\" those worshipers of the stars of the Hollywood firmament choked the sidewalk outside the Astor and also the theatre lobby, while policemen afoot and on horse urged the throng to keep moving. And from across Broadway blinding beams of light added to the general excitement.Inside the theatre it was for a time difficult to move but very slowly, for many of those who had tickets pressed into the aisles and behind the orchestra seats with the evident hope of catching a glimpse of one or another cinema celebrity. But once microphone music came from the stage the spectators hastened to their places and soon the introductory scene of the much talked of motion picture was emblazoned on the screen. It was that of the telephone operators in the Grand Hotel and then the pushing and shouting was a thing of the past.It is a production thoroughly worthy of all the talk it has created and the several motion-picture luminaries deserve to feel very proud of their performances, particularly Greta Garbo and Lionel Barrymore. So far as the direction is concerned, Edmund Goulding has done an excellent piece of work, but occasionally it seems as though he relies too much on close-ups. Ne rtheless he has sustained a steady momentum in darting here and there in the busy hostelry and working up to an effective dramatic pitch at the psychological moment. In all, the picture adheres faithfully to the original and while it undoubtedly lacks the life and depth and color of the play, by means of excellent characterizations it keeps the audience on the qui vive.It is indubitably a capital subject to bring to the screen, for it benefits by the sweeping scope of the camera and in swaying from room to room and from the lobby to the telephone switchboard. Mr. Goulding gives some markedly fine photographic effects. But it should be stated that in one scene he permits an extremely gruesome idea to creep in. This will probably be eliminated at some of the future exhibitions.Miss Garbo, of course, impersonates the dancer, Grusinskaya, played on the stage by Eugénie Leontovich. Miss Garbo, possibly appreciating that she was supported by a galaxy of efficient performers, decided that she would do her utmost to make her rôle shine. And she succeeds admirably. She is stunning in her early scenes and charming in the love scene with Baron Geigern, portrayed by John Barrymore with his usual savoir faire. And later, wearing a chinchilla coat, she is gay and lighthearted, for love has beckoned to the temperamental dancer. Grusinskaya leaves the screen hopeful of meeting the Baron at the railroad station, but the audience knows that the good-natured and sympathetic thief has met his doom at the hands of the ignoble Preysing, a part acted by Wallace Beery.It fell to Lionel Barrymore's lot to play Otto Kringelein, the humble bookkeeper who decides in an introductory scene that, as he has not long to live, he will go out of this world in a blaze of glory. Mr. Barrymore brings out every possible note of this sensitive person, who talks with bated breath to the Baron, entertains with champagne and caviar","excerpt":"loathes his employer, the hard-fisted, sensual Preysing, for whom he has worked for a pittance. He is going to die and therefore what cares he if Preysing discharges him? But, instead of passing away, he entrains for Paris with the attractive stenographer, Flaemmchen, who is seen in the person of Joan Crawford. Through Mr. Barrymore's skillful interpretation one gleans the satisfaction of this obsequious human adding machine has in hobnobbing with people of the world and in living in the corner suite of the Grand Hotel. Mr. Barrymore is superb when he as Kringelein finds himself tipsy, tipsy but elated. If ever an actor got under the skin of a character Mr. Barrymore does here.And, although Miss Garbo and Lionel Barrymore deliver talented portrayals, it does not mean that any aspersion is to be cast at the work of others in the cast. Miss Crawford, for instance, is splendid as Flaemmchen. She, too, does all that is possible to vie with the others in the cast. Then there is John Barrymore as the Baron. Nobody could hope to see such a type better acted. This Baron is handsome, a little sly, eager for money, but always thoughtful and friendly when it comes to his association with Kringelein. He steals Kringelein's wallet, but, when he hears Kringelein bewailing his loss, he \\"finds\\" the wallet, and how glad is Kringelein!As for Mr. Beery, it may seem that while his performance does not quite compare with that of Siegfried Rumann, the stage Preysing, it is nevertheless a very worthy characterization. Mr. Beery is sufficiently ponderous and forbidding as Preysing, but in having to assume a German accent he is not quite in his element. But those who did not see Mr. Rumann will undoubtedly decide that Mr. Beery's performance is good enough.No review of this picture would be complete without a mention of the genuinely pleasing work of Ferdinand Gottschalk, who acts the loyal underling of Grusinskaya. Lewis Ston also does well as Dr. Otternschlag and Jean Hersholt is up to his usual high standard as the porter, Senf, whose chief interest during the running of the story is the condition of his wife, who finally gives birth to a child as the story comes to a close. And it is Dr. Otternschlag who is given to saying that \\"people come and people go, and nothing ever happens in the Grand Hotel.\\"And the audience has seen manslaughter, gambling, a baron bent on stealing pearls, love affairs, a business deal and various other doings. And \\"nothing ever happens!\\" Greta Garbo and Lionol and John Barrymore in a Pictorial Version of Vicki Baum's Stage Work."},{"year":"2003","title":"Falluja, in heart of Sunni Triangle, is epicenter of anti-American hatred in Iraq","excerpt":"loathing for American occupation is so intense that Iraqi children refuse to take candy tossed to them by American soldiers; Saddam Hussein won strong support in Falluja in exchange for privileges and patronage, and city now bristles with desire to confront American soldiers, to kill them and to celebrate when they fall; downing of American helicopter outside Falluja prompts celebrations from many local residents; it is difficult to find anyone in Falluja willing to express appreciation for American presence; even American-trained Iraqi police officers in city speak of wanting Americans to leave; photo (M) IN DIE-HARD CITY, G.I.'S ARE ENEMY"},{"year":"1959","title":"Stein, L: Loathsome Women Bewitched, Bewildered -- and Analyzed","excerpt":"LOATHSOME WOMEN.
