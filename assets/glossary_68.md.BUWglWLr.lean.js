Even if one were to occur which required emergency response, it most likely would be one that would allow 12 or more hours for responsive actions. Far less likely is a fast-moving accident; for such an accident, sheltering, even in homes without basements, would likely be preferred over immediate evacuation.

By RICHARD HALLORAN   WASHINGTON, July 6 - Nine weeks ago, when an Argentine fighter pilot fired a French-built Exocet missile that struck the British destroyer Sheffield and left her a blazing cripple, eventually to sink, he also touched off what has become a vigorous argument here over the future of surface warships.   The devastating effect of that single shot surprised few naval officers, who knew that missiles had become increasingly lethal. But it brought into the open these questions:   Have warships become so vulnerable to ''smart'' weapons that fleets of the established type are doomed? If not, would the United States Navy be less vulnerable with a few big, technically advanced and expensive ships? Or would it be better for the Navy to build many smaller, simpler and less expensive ships?   The debate has centered on the Reagan Administration's proposal to build two 90,000-ton nuclear-powered aircraft carriers at a cost of $3.4 billion each. This issue has divided members of Congress and naval officers without regard to political party or naval experience. Among the proponents of big ships have been Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, chairman of the Armed Services subcommittee on seapower","excerpt":"John F. Lehman Jr., the Secretary of the Navy, and Adm. Thomas B.

The two trophies were a tacit acknowledgment of the underlying tension between art and industry, a tension that now plays out each time another studio dependent steals critical thunder from its big studio brother and that will play out with increasing feverishness over the next five months.    Directed by the German import F. W. Murnau, ''Sunrise'' stars George O'Brien and Janet Gaynor as a young country couple nearly undone by the temptations of the big city, and it remains a triumph of the classical studio system as well as one of its saddest cautionary tales. Brought to America by Fox to class up its act, Murnau quickly became a bridge between the cinema of the old world and the new. The writer was Austrian, the set designer German and one of the two cameramen, an Englishman in Hollywood, had worked with Murnau in Germany. During production, studio luminaries like Frank Borzage visited the vast set constructed on the Fox lot","excerpt":"John Ford declared ''Sunrise'' the greatest picture ever made and even went off to Germany later to shoot exteriors for one of his own films.    But critical praise did not translate into box office success for what turned out to be the most expensive silent film made at Fox, which abandoned Murnau to cinema immortality. The academy, meanwhile, learned its lesson: never again did it give an award to a ''unique and artistic picture.'' Sunday at 6 p.m., Wednesday at 7:45 p.m., Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9480.

'Miracles do happen,' wrote Michael Coveney in The Financial Times when the piece moved to Wyndhams Theater. ''This stunning new play has materialized in the West End out of thin, thin air.''

During a snack break the children will have a chance to consider which of the stories they want to interpret in the ensuing bookmaking workshop. Mr. Kruk will guide them through the development of the idea, the characters and the layout of a handmade storybook to take home.    Intended for children from 5 to 10 years old and their parents, the program begins at 11 A.M. and ends around 1 P.M. Admission to the performance is $10, admission to the performance and workshop is $20. The center is at 155 Fifth Avenue. Call 738-2525 for more information or reservations. ERIC BOWEN'S ART     \\"The Right to Life in Peace,\\" a series of 12 paintings incorporating quotations from John Donne, Pliny, Rabindranath Tagore, Sankichi Toge and other poets and philosophers, opens at the Hopper House Art Center in Nyack today. Attending the reception from 1 to 6 P.M. will be Martin Huslid, Norway's Representative to the United Nations.    The artist, Eric Bowen, was born in India but lived in Oslo for many years, where his peace series was completed and shown in 1985. Its content is based on concerns about a world conflagration emerging from the cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union, and its relevance is more powerful now than it was six years ago.    Mr. Bowen's work has been largely in the non-figurative field, but this series combines architectural elements on which the quotations are inscribed with swathed skeletal figures from the Holocaust and Hiroshima. Somber in color and apocalyptic in concept, it also contains elements of hope and tranquillity.    The exhibition will continue through Feb. 10, and it will move to Manhattan for an April showing to coincide with the meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission. The gallery, at 82 North Broadway, will be open from 1 to 6 P.M. Friday through Sunday. Admission is by donation of $1. Call 358-0774 for more information. MEADOW GARDENS     Meadow gardening has been gaining converts among homeowners, landscape architects and overseers of public places.

A symposium addressing many aspects of this trend will be held in the auditorium of the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx from 9 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Saturday.    Subjects to be discussed are \\"Ecological Restoration: A New American Garden Ethic,\\" \\"Meadow Gardening, Step by Step,\\" \\"Plants for Ponds and Wetlands,\\" \\"Landscaping to Attract Wildlife\\" and \\"The Glory of Grasses.\\"    Among the speakers are Mark Gallagher, senior scientist at Coastal Environment Services in Princeton, N.J.","excerpt":"John Greenlee, owner of two nurseries in California; William R.

His method was to wire freshly killed specimens into lifelike positions on a gridded board. He describes the first time he tried this. \\"One morning I leapt out of bed ... went to the river, took a bath and returning to town inquired for wire of different sizes, bought some and was soon again at Mill Grove. I shot the first kingfisher I met, pierced the body with wire, fixed it to the board, another wire held the head, smaller ones fixed the feet ... there stood before me the real kingfisher. I outlined the bird, colored it. This was my first drawing actually from nature.\\" ... \\n\\n     Before the turn of the century there were even 'Audubon gun clubs\\" that, in a sense, reflected Audubon's predatory nature more accurately than the noble fiction that gave rise to the Audubon movement and the Naitonal Association of Audubon Societies, now simply called \\"Audubon.\\" Far more birds fell to his trigger reflexes, his obsessions with shooting, than he needed for his drawing and research, and most of the early ornithologists who followed him were equally fond of the gun. They had to have the specimen \\"in hand\\" to establish base lines of morphology, classification and anatomy. At the turn of the century even that  venerable bearded nature writer, John Burroughs, counseled the serious young bird student: \\"Don't ogle it through a glass, shoot it.\\" The Great Outdoors: March 10, 1985","excerpt":"John J.

A viewer does not have to be threatened with an elephant gun to realize that this is an understatement. Victor Mature, Janet Leigh and a covey of African and British natives are exposed to everything from a man-killing lion to marauding Mau Mau in this adventure, which illustrates that Africa is photogenic in color and CinemaScope and that the plot is no tribute to anyone's imagination. Although this colorful \\"Safari\\" travels quickly, it rarely moves an observer.One can't blame Mr. Mature, who is appreciably grim throughout the rough proceedings, for acting like a man with a king-sized problem. First of all, his young son and his sister-in-law are ruthlessly dispatched by Earl Cameron, who, under the guise of a trusted servant, has been operating as a Mau Mau leader. The script, incidentally, never explains why Mr. Mature's household has been singled out for the attack.Then, our bereaved and vengeful white hunter is hired by a singularly neurotic, rich British sportsman, Roland Culver, to bag that lion, \\"Hatari,\\" which, as every Swahili student knows, means \\"danger.\\" What with that predatory cat inflaming Mr. Culver's senses, and the svelte Miss Leigh—she's nominally betrothed to Mr. Culver—upsetting Mr. Mature's peace of mind, the Kenya bush country becomes somewhat less idyllic than that pictured in the travel folders.Miss Leigh, as has been noted, seems out of her natural habitat, but she is a burnished blonde, who is cool and seductive enough in a variety of fancy costumes to turn a dour hunter's head.

As he languorously stretches his legs, the performer, wearing full makeup, a woman's marcelled wig and a glittering circus suit, is a dead ringer for the Parisian legend as pictured in well-known photographs taken by Man Ray. But he is also more than that. In the show's exquisite lighting, Mr. Kelly glows like a human jewel radiating a mysterious brilliance in a luminescent purple haze.    That visual payoff, as haunting as it may be, is a little late in arriving in the leisurely paced 90-minute collage, which had the first of four performances at the Majestic on Wednesday evening. What Mr. Kelly, who wrote, choreographed, and directed the piece, has created is an often lovely but overly drawn-out meditation on muses, ghosts, Paris in the 20's, transvestism, and the art of Jean Cocteau.

They were too preoccupied handling the overflow crowds to notice what was going on up on the screen. In fact, we had a bit of trouble, too, keeping track of the dialogue which fills in the gaps between sight gags in \\"My Friend Irma Goes West\\" because the audience was having a laughing spell. During the first ten minutes of this helter-skelter comedy we missed most of Jerry Lewis' witty remarks, for every time he opened his mouth the audience went into hysterics. There were a lot of young, high squeaking voices bouncing off the rafters, but while the small fry may have been most responsive they did not account for all the merry sounds.Jerry Lewis, the slight, abject, elastic young man, and his straight-man-accomplice with the velvety baritone singing voice, Dean Martin, are responsible for about ninety-nine and nine-tenths of the fun in \\"My Friend Irma Goes West.\\" Marie Wilson, who plays the title role","excerpt":"John Lund, as her bungling boy friend, Al, and Diana Lynn, as Irma's normal roommate, work hard in carrying the other one-tenth of the picture. There is a marked reduction in the quality of the show when Martin and Lewis are off the screen and sometimes even they are victimized by the silly script. However, M. & L. are in there pitching most of the time and most of the time they are in top form.Unlike most night club comedians, the boys have an uncommon faculty for sensing just the right emphasis to place on their antics even without the benefit of audience stimulation. A lot of their material looks and sounds familiar, but one never can be too sure about such things, so let's not get involved on that score. At the moment Martin and Lewis are the brightest people in \\"My Friend Irma Goes West\\" and for that Producer Hal Wallis can count his lucky stars. Without them, the film would not add up to anything. The story is a nondescript affair that has Irma and friends tagging along as excess baggage when the boys leave New York to seek fame and fortune in Hollywood and, for economic reasons, have to ply their talents in a Las Vegas hot spot.Perhaps those remarks are a bit unkind at that. Even though Cy Howard and Parke Levy have not actually written a recognizable story, they did, after all, put some words in Jerry Lewis' mouth and, moreover, they did provide the basic plot material. But having recognized that the writers served a purpose, we still would like to leave a reminder that it's the interpretation that stirs up the fun in \\"My Friend Irma Goes West.\\"The Modernaires share the stage show at the Paramount with Louis Prima's orchestra, Gary Morton, and Tommy and Margot Conine.

LUNDBERG'S TEAM TRIUMPHS WITH 72"},{"year":"1955","title":"ALTHOUGH Samuel Goldwyn Jr. is dealing with Western staples that are nearly as old as the movie medium itself, his first production, \\"Man With the Gun,\\" is several cuts above the norm for this genre. For the action drama, which arrived at Loew's State yesterday, manages to infuse a modicum of suspense, adult dialogue and characterizations and fine photography and background music into what might have been merely a standard marshal-vs.-bad men yarn. Mr. Goldwyn and his willing troupe have not created a work of art, but the customers are not being short changed either.While the principals occasionally are a mite too garrulous, they are believably unglamorous folk frightened by the ruthless rancher and his gunmen who rule them. Director Richard Wilson, however, wastes little footage in explanation. Robert Mitchum, a gunfighter who has tamed a lot of outlaw towns in his time, rides down the dusty main street in search of his estranged wife and is immediately hired as Sheridan City's \\"peacemaker.\\"Our tough and stoical hero has a more rugged time with his spouse, the duenna of a group of comely saloon dancers, who has left him because of his way of life, than with the gun slingers sent to dispatch him. But the marshal, a gent who packs two six-shooters and has the added task of keeping a young, hotheaded would-be homesteader from being killed by the villains, lays down his own laws. As might be expected, he finally frees Sheridan City of its desperadoes.The script does not make flamboyantly heroic figures of the leads. They do have quirks and faults. As the man with the gun, Mr. Mitchum convincingly enacts the role of a dedicated citizen who has seen his unarmed father mowed down and therefore loves his bloody profession. Jan Sterling is effective as the unpainted mistress of the dancing dolls, who loves her determined husband despite her loathing of his dangerous calling. Henry Hull contributes a standard portrayal as the weak sheriff. Emile Meyer, as the blacksmith and town councilman","excerpt":"John Lupton, as the young homesteader; Karen Sharpe, as his comely fiancee; Ted de Corsia, Leo Gordon and James Westerfield as the villainous hired hands of the boss, Joe Barry, competently support the principals.As has been noted previously, Alex North's score and Lee Garmes' photography accentuate but do not intrude on the story.

They also drew lots to decide who will stand where (Gov. Bill Clinton will be in the middle, with Mr. Bush stage left and Mr. Perot stage right).

But the impression was marred by an insufficently varied program and by a remarkably unprofessional presentation.   Cheerleading program notes, with repeated promises of fun, were spoken off the cuff by Mr. Granados","excerpt":"John McDonald, a composer; Jory Vinikour, the pianist, and other performers. Page-turning, of all things, became an adventure. The culmination came before an encore, when Mr. Vinikour, who had evidently left his score for the Faure \\"Sicilienne\\" somewhere, abandoned Mr. Granados onstage for long, uncomfortable moments.   As advertised, it was a \\"fun\\" program, consisting almost entirely of the studiedly witty, flashy kind of works in which the flute repertory abounds. Mr. Granados spun out music by Walter Gieseking, Robert Muczynski, Paul Taffanel and Mr. McDonald with fair facility. He also played some modestly diverting Venezuelan popular numbers with his compatriots Daniel Marchan on guitar and Pedro Pereira on bass and the Colombian Maria-Olga Pineros on cuatro, a small four-string guitar.   What the program lacked was music of depth, in either thought or expression. The closest it came was in the gently melancholic opening of Schubert's Introduction and Variations, but even this eventually degenerates into mindless display.   In doing so, it calls for a sustained virtuosity that strained Mr. Granados's resources, which generally stood up well elsewhere. But in the end it was hard to tell how much Mr. Granados may have to say in music that goes beyond the merely facile and pleasant.

Were they the progenitors of the innumerable Smiths who pervade American history? Was Smith a monumental liar who invented the Pocahontas story and other dramatic episodes to gain wealth and glory?

Eileen Joyce, between international concerts, already has made some notable \\"ghost\\" contributions to such British films as \\"The Seventh Veil,\\" \\"Brief Encounter\\" and \\"Quartet.\\" Apparently, Michael S. Gordon, who wrote, directed and produced this Mayer-Kingsley release, decided the time was nigh for an official feature-length bow in her direction.Mr. Gordon erred. For, while Miss Joyce supplies her own magnificent sound track in selections by Liszt and Mozart, and is seen performing thematic excerpts from the Grieg piano concerto, this biographical chapter cries out for compression as a short subject. The story is a laboriously detailed account of how the offspring of a poor Tasmanian miner rises to pianistic acclaim, ending with her departure for the city.The action, focusing mainly on the family's efforts to make ends meet and the daughter's musical aggressivenes, moves at a snail's pace. Mr. Gordon's direction is scarcely less wooden than the acting of the entire cast, including Nigel Lovell and Muriel Steinbeck as the parents","excerpt":"John Wiltshire as a roving harmonica player, Tim Drysdale and Rex Dawe. And we sincerely trust that the portrayal of the budding genius by a whimpering, pig-tailed teen-ager named Suzanne Parrett was not Miss Joyce's idea.Furthermore, the formidability of the authentic mining backgrounds suspiciously elbows the careful gentility of the incidents described, however true they may be. Actually, the only genuinely affecting moments in the entire film are several high-up camera shots dwarfing the forlorn little heroine in a mine-shaft panorama. But for those happy to settle back and simply lend an ear to the sound track, there is ample proof that a stereotyped cherub grew up to preside at the keyboard like a full-winged angel.

He was a graduate of Roger Ludlowe High School, with Honors. Dr. Murren was renowned as a medical oncologist and cancer researcher specializing in the treatment and prevention of lung cancer. Since 1992, he had been awarded grant funding to study cancer drug therapies yielding invaluable contributions to the understanding of the effectiveness of cancer drug therapies, particularly chemotherapy. He was the chief of the Yale Medical Oncology Outpatient Clinic and director of the Lung Cancer Unit at the Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, CT. He earned his B.A. in Chemistry and History from Duke University cum laude followed by his M.D. in 1984 from the Loyola - Stritch School of Medicine in Chicago. He completed his internship and residency in Internal Medicine at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York where he was chief resident. In 1988, Dr. Murren accepted a postdoctoral fellowship in Medical Oncology at the Yale-New Haven Hospital where he was an attending physician as well as an associate professor of Medicine. For the Nevada Cancer Institute, Dr. Murren was one of its early visionaries and founders. The articulation of his vision to bring research-based medicine to Nevada resulted in the founding of the institute in 2002, and the creation of a 142,000 square foot facility in Las Vegas that is dedicated to researching, preventing, detecting, caring and curing cancer. He served on the institute's Board of Directors as well as an adjunct faculty member. At Yale, Dr. Murren had the largest clinical practice at the Cancer Center and treated thousands of patients and their families over a distinguished career. As a researcher, he was exceptionally gifted and his clinical research widely published. He sat on several peer review Boards and was sought out worldwide for his expertise.

In addition to his clinical, educational and research endeavors, Dr. Murren served on the Clinical Research Subcommittee of the American Association of Cancer Research and the American College of Surgeons Cancer Committee.
