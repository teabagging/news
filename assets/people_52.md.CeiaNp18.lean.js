There is a moment in her recent \\"Earth Mysteries,\\" performed on Sunday night at the 14th Street Dance Center, that epitomizes her style. In the solo, set to mysterious yet earthy music composed and performed by Mieczyslaw Litwinski, Miss Tseng dances within a circle formed by three abstract but suggestive sculptures by Tobi Kahn. She approaches one of the sculptures, in that telling moment, and kicks at it through a pile of leaves that surrounds its base. That little kick is strong and deftly aimed, yet as dry and fragile-seeming as the leaves themselves.      In her new \\"Faience,\\" which completed the program, Miss Tseng has admirably chosen to work in a vein different from the ritualistic dances for which she has become known, in a career that includes seven years with Jean Erdman's Theater of the Open Eye.

NEW YORK","excerpt":"Murder and Unions Labor Racketeering Child Labor WPA Retrenchment Traffic's New Gait"},{"year":"1928","title":"The art of murder, as it was in the days of the Borgias, is depicted in a film known as \\"Lucrecia Borgia,\\" which is now at the Little Carnegie Theatre. The incidents tend to give additional interest to the snuffing out of lives. It is rather a change from the underworld tale with the shooting of men in the back and their speedy demise.The modern school lacks suspense in severing the mortal coil. The Borgias look here upon murder as one of the beaux arts and they gave to the proceedings as much color as possible. If a man is to be poisoned then it must be done intelligently, not in a slapdash fashion. And if it is decided to use the sword, then the executioner swings the well-tempered blade a few times in the air, approaching gradually the subject until the torso is left minus a head.The suspense engendered by the Borgias aroused real agony on the faces of the victims. But the highest degree of skill in sending life from this world is accomplished, in this film, by mental suggestion. Cesare Borgia wants to know where one of his enemies is holding forth and, to obtain the information, he terrifies a captive, first by wielding a sword, with which he eventually merely slashes the man's rope binding, and then by telling the cringing fellow that he has swallowed poison. Still the poor chap refuses to disclose the enemy's whereabouts, but when Cesare produces a vial, which, he says contains an antidote for the poison, the supposedly dying man begs for it and tells the hiding place of Cesare's enemy. Having obtained the information, Cesare shows what an artistic killer he is, by letting the man die just the same, smiling over the success of the mental suggestion.This picture is poorly acted by some of the principals, but it possesses no little interest through the magnificent backgrounds and the hordes of armor-clad extras. There is a wonderfully effective death combat following the storming of an old castle.The director of this film, Richard Oswald, is said to be a German. He made his picture in Italy. The leading players are Conrad Veidt, Lina Haid, Paul Wegener and John Win-ship. Through a title, the relationship between the Borgias is dodged.One episode deals with the lions in a place that looks like the Coliseum and not only is the seating space thronged in the section shown but the lions look so real that one feels glad that one does not have to be a motion picture actor to be thrown to the lions in this modern day.Mr. Veidt gives a studious performance as Cesare Borgia. The others are only fair. Sometimes their movements are so fast that it seems absurd. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Murder As An Art.
