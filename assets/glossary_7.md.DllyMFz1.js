WellPoint, which already has more than 283,000 medical customers in Illinois, said the state was a growth market. Rush Prudential had 302,775 medical plan members as of Sept. 30, the company said. The transaction needs regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first quarter. Shares of WellPoint, which is based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., fell 81.25 cents, to $59.3125. The acquisition was announced after the close of regular United States trading.  (Bloomberg News)    FUSION MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES PRODUCT GIVEN APPROVAL  Fusion Medical Technologies, a money-losing company whose shares have doubled this year, won Food and Drug Administration approval for its most important product, a gel used to stop bleeding during surgery.

It will be used in surgery on the heart, blood vessels and spine, especially where sutures, staples and fibrin glues do not close wounds well. The company, which had no revenue last year, will market the product for use in spinal surgery with Sulzer Medica, Europe's biggest maker of orthopedic products. Shares in Fusion, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., fell 93.75 cents, to $13.0625.

After the first session of the New England Regional Swiss Team Championship in Cambridge, Mass., last Sunday, a group from the New York metropolitan region had collected just 23 victory points out of a possible 60. But Michael Radin and Margie Gwozdzinsky, both of Manhattan, and Keith Garber of New Rochelle, N.Y., Mel Colchamiro of Long Beach, L.I., and Eileen Brenner and Michael Pickert, both of Livingston, N.J., chose to battle on.    With one match left to play, they were in third position, close behind the leaders, and the diagramed deal proved crucial.   Radin as North overbid slightly with a forcing one no-trump response followed by a jump to three hearts. He regretted his optimism when East doubled and ruffed dummy's diamond ace when that card was played on the king at the first trick.   But East shifted to a low spade. Colchamiro as South was able to win with the king and maneuver two ruffs in the dummy, one in each black suit. East could have vindicated his double by returning a trump at the second trick with another trump to follow later.

President Clinton has approved a plan that will place three foreign affairs agencies under the jurisdiction of the State Department, a reorganization that had long been sought by Senator Jesse Helms. The Senate agreed to schedule a vote next Thursday on an international treaty banning chemical weapons, which Mr. Helms had long resisted.   A1    Major Reverses Europe Stance  Prime Minister John Major, trailing in the polls for the coming British elections, reversed his previous stance and publicly declared his opposition to current proposals for Britain's integration into Europe. Mr. Major said he would permit a parliamentary free vote, in which members need not abide by party policy, on the issue of Britain's joining a single European currency.   A1    Netanyahu Defiant on Charges  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel went on the counteroffensive against police recommendations that he be indicted for breach of the public trust. The gravity of the charges was widely questioned","excerpt":"senior police officers said their verdict was based largely on the testimony of one witness.   A1    Yeltsin Says NATO Pact Is Near  President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia met with Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Germany and indicated that a security agreement between Russia and an expanded NATO would be negotiated by May 27. Mr. Kohl pledged to insure that Western leaders consider Russia's concerns about military deployments in Eastern Europe.   A3    Korean Ex-Leaders Lose Appeal  Korea's Supreme Court upheld lower court rulings sentencing the country's former President, Chun Doo Hwan, to life in prison and his successor, Roh Tae Woo, to 17 years. No further judicial appeals are possible for the two former generals, although President Kim Young Sam could pardon them.   A4    Canada to Ease Fishing Ban  The Canadian Government declared that it would partially lift a ban on cod fishing off the coast of Newfoundland. The ban was imposed five years ago because of the scarcity of the fish. Environmentalists, scientists and some fishermen said it was too early to lift the ban.   A7    Alleged Arms Dealer Arrested  An Israeli magistrate ordered a businessman held in jail, reportedly on charges of exporting chemical weapons to Iran. One Israeli newspaper said the C.I.A. was helping the Israeli authorities with the investigation.   A8    Land Mine Parts Made in U.S.A.  A prominent human rights group identified dozens of American companies that have produced components used in land mines and said that 17 of the companies had promised that they would not allow their products to be used in future production. Production of land mines in the United States ended last year.   A10    NATIONAL   A14-25    Dole Lends Gingrich $300,000 to Pay Fine  Newt Gingrich said Bob Dole would lend him the $300,000 he needs to pay an ethics fine imposed on him by the House. Mr. Dole will charge 10 percent annual interest but will not demand any payments until 2005, two years after Mr. Gingrich plans to leave Congress. Democrats, caught by surprise, grumbled.   A1    More Top Earners Pay No Tax  Nearly 2,400 of the richest Americans -- those who earn at least $200,000 a year -- paid no Federal income taxes in 1993, up from just 85 in 1977, I.R.S. data showed. How they arranged that was not clear; economists said they believed falling audit rates played a role.   A21    F.B.I. Faulted in Ames Case  An internal Justice Department inquiry found the F.B.I. derelict in its initial failure to aggressively pursue what became the Aldrich Ames case, officials said. The inquiry found the F.B.I. did not react quickly when two Soviet officials it had recruited as spies were recalled to Moscow and executed, the officials said. Mr. Ames, a C.I.A. official, was not arrested until eight years later. F.B.I. officials said the C.I.A. had not been very cooperative at the time.   A16    No Arms Warning, Powell Says  Gen. Colin L. Powell entered the debate over whether the C.I.A. adequately warned the military about chemical weapons in areas where American troops blew up Iraqi ammunition depots shortly after the 1991 war. No such warnings reached him or other senior commanders, he said.   A19    Cosmic Uniformity Questioned  New measurements suggest the universe may have an ''up'' and a ''down,'' scientists said. If so, current theory, which pictures the universe as uniform in all directions, would have to be rethought. Which way is up would be an arbitrary choice.   A1    Reno Brushes Off Attacks  Attorney General Janet Reno said she was committed to doing ''justice'' in the campaign finance investigation. She said she was unfazed by Republican attacks on her decision not to appoint an independent prosecutor in the case.   A23    Hawaii to Vote on Gay Marriage  A referendum that would let Hawaii voters ban same-sex marriages in their state passed a major test in the Legislature. The measure would ask voters to amend the State Constitution to overturn a State Supreme Court ruling that such a ban was unconstitutional.   A15    Remembering the Bush Era  Former President George Bush will be reunited with many of his top aides today for a conference at Hofstra University on Long Island that is billed as the first collective look at his Administration's legacy. While most scholars say it is too early to make historical assessments, the organizers say they want to capture the fresh recollections of former White House officials.   A18     NEW YORK/REGION   B1-5     Pataki Dumps Lieutenant From His '98 Ticket . . .  Governor Pataki said he would drop his Lieutenant Governor, Elizabeth McCaughey Ross, from the Republican ticket when he runs for re-election next year. He said he could not work with a lieutenant governor whom he considered disruptive and who did not share his philosophical beliefs. Ms. McCaughey Ross, who has been allying herself more and more openly with Democrats, said she would run for something else.   A1    . . . and Won't Face Schumer  Representative Charles E. Schumer abandoned his plans to run against Governor Pataki next year in favor of a challenge to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Most New York politicians agree that Mr. D'Amato will be the easier target.   B2    A Test for Pupils, and Schools  Hundreds of thousands of students sat down for New York City's annual reading test. Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said he would use the results to hold district superintendents accountable and to decide which schools need more resources.   B1    Police Sergeant Avoids Prison  The highest-ranking police officer implicated in the 30th Precinct corruption scandal in Harlem was spared a prison sentence. The officer, former Sgt. Kevin Nannery, received five years' probation from a judge who cited his cooperation with prosecutors.   B3    Rent Rule Foe Softens a Bit  Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader, softened his stance against New York's rent regulation laws slightly: he said he would consider phasing out the laws over four years instead of two.   B1    SPORTS   B6-16    Jets Trade Top Draft Pick  The Jets traded the No. 1 pick in Saturday's draft to St. Louis for the No. 6 pick in the first round and the Rams' third-, fourth- and seventh-round selections. Coach Bill Parcells said that for his struggling team, many new players would be better than one.   B7    WEEKEND   C1-34    BUSINESS DAY   D1-17    Big Quarter for Microsoft  Microsoft reported an 85 percent increase in earnings and a 45 percent rise in revenues, far above analysts' estimates. It credited strong sales of Office 97, its software suite for businesses, and warned that such strong results might not be repeatable.   D1    Business Digest   D1    OBITUARIES   A26-27    Chaim Herzog  Israel's outspoken President from 1983 to 1993, he strove to enlarge the office's role, which in Israel is largely ceremonial, by making public declarations on issues that leaders in Government would not, or could not, address. Mr. Herzog, a former general, also served as the first military governor of the occupied West Bank. He was 78.

It was merciless, reminding him he was now half a century old, that two-thirds of his lifetime had passed. At the time, I was in my late 40's and yet 50 seemed a distant number, so the fun was entirely at his expense. Ho, ho. Although he seemed to be impressed by my enterprise, he did not share the hilarity.   Now I understand. I am there. Five oh. In fact, I have been for many months, and every day I expect to awake with a sense of adjustment: \\"Hey, 50 isn't so bad once you get used to it.\\" Trouble is, I haven't. It's not that I am angry or melancholy. It's more an irritation. Sort of a chronic low-level virus. For those of you cruising quietly toward this two-score-and-ten marker be forewarned, as I was not, that 50 is more than 49 plus 1. It brings with it some unexpected and unrelenting conditions.   First, the obvious: at 50 you're no longer young. Oh, an occasional octogenarian will say, \\"Listen here, young man, when I was your age. . . .\\" That's comforting if you spend all of your waking hours with octogenarians, but the more realistic standard is set by other experiences. When was the last time you were the youngest person in an office meeting? Or at a dinner party? How many of your college classmates or old girlfriends are grandparents? Have you noticed how many captains of industry, governors, ambassadors are not yet 50?

There are several breath-taking glimpses of the matador, Pepe Ortiz, working his cape and his body in perilous proximity to the bull, and some wicked flashes of action when the bull gets his horns on a man. The atmosphere of the bullring, with the spectators roaring \\"Olé!\\" and the general excited agitation, is all very interestingly caught.But otherwise—and for the most part—\\"Silk, Blood and Sun\\" is an old-fashioned tale of a bullfighter's all-consuming jealousy of a rival who he thinks covets his wife. The story is strangely reminiscent of an \\"unhand-that-gal\\" dramatic gem, and the action is highly stilted under direction which is primitive, at best. Jorge Negrete plays the jealous husband—but changes mood at times to sing a couple of songs","excerpt":"Señor Ortiz is more convincing in the bullring than he is as the maligned and sad rival, and Gloria Marin is lovely but generally morose as the wife. A volatile comic performance by Florencio Castellot is the best in the film. Ample English subtitles convey the substance of the Spanish dialogue.The Cantinflas short, called \\"The Boxer,\\" is not translated, and as a consequence its colloquial gags and Mexican-Spanish double-talk will go over the American patron's head. But this droll and simple-looking fellow is a master of pantomime; he has a delightful way of timing his impish smirks and japes and he fetches explosive guffaws with some of the most obvious old tricks. With better handling and material he might become a universally popular clown. Right now, it is easy to perceive why the Mexicans idolize him.
