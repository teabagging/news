Several of Zadkine's 300 sculptures stand beneath the trees and, inside, the artist's paintings and drawings are displayed. The hours are 10 A.M. to 5:30 P.M., Wednesday through Saturday.   Farther afield, on the French Riviera, Nice, too, has added a museum - the Musee International d'Art Naif Anatole Jakovsky. The museum is named for a leading art critic who donated his entire collection of more than 600 canvases and drawings to the institution, housed in the restored Chateau Sainte Helene. The collection, in which artists from 27 countries are represented, traces the history of naive painting from the 18th century to the present. The museum is open every day except Monday and holidays. Until Sept. 30, the hours are 10 A.M. until noon and 2 P.M. to 6 P.M. Admission is free.   Details are available from the French Government Tourist Office, 610 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10020 (212-757-1125).

''The point was,'' Mr. Luening recalls, ''that it was no good always talking about American music if nobody could get their hands on it.''

It means, quite simply, the emergence of a new animal act in a circus. Principally because of these disarming creatures—bears, mainly, plus mountain goats and, finally, two panthers—Saturday's arrival at the Cameo is a mildly diverting time-killer. It could have been an ideal import for children. Even so, the kids probably will have the best time.This Artkino release, produced by the Moscow Popular Science Film Studio, is an extremely tame and uneventful little item, even with its colorful backdrops of the big top (one-ring) and some rugged mountain terrain. Supposedly based on the career of a famed animal trainer, Vasily Gulyayev, the picture leisurely trails an actor named Vladimir Balashov, as he rehearses his four-footed charges, timidly romances a young lady named Inna Kmit and triumphantly brings down a mountain-goat act (plus those panthers) from the hills.Mr. Balashov and Miss Kmit are pleasant people, but no match for the real stars, a group of wonderful trained bears, amusingly costumed, majestically poised and cutting all kinds of capers. One cute little skirt-clad bear does a nifty dance, as the big boys strum balalaikas. But a huge bruin named Potap steals the show, whether performing as a peasant woman or in a hilarious costume as a drunken sailor.A picturesque half-hour travelogue, \\"Peak of Sayan,\\" also in pretty color, rounds out the Cameo program.

It's a form of advertising that originated in Copenhagen about five years ago, spread through Europe and was brought to New York in the spring of 1994 by two companies, M@x Racks and Fivefinger Post Ads. Power-hitters (Tanqueray, Calvin Klein), culture purveyors (Lincoln Center, Pilobolus) and a sprinkling of artists and charities are trying to tempt that sought-after species, the yac (young affluent consumer) to pick a card, their card. Giveaway newspapers and T-shirts bearing messages are familiar, but free cards are so new that takers often experience the faux-frisson of almost-stealing.\\n\\nHOW IT WORKS The rack companies each charge advertisers around $2,200 to print and distribute 40,000 cards a month to about 150 locations around Manhattan. What they are selling, said Alan Wolan, Fivefinger's co-president, is \\"a very high-quality contact, because people only choose the cards they're interested in.\\" He added, \\"They hold the cards and identify with them.\\" Many commercial cards blur the genres of art, advertising and kitsch, but the rack companies usually extend a discount to real artists' cards, to keep the public guessing. The restaurants receive free cards to promote their business, and managers say they see the racks as a bonus for customers.\\n\\nWHAT'S THE USE? M@x Racks contends that 46 percent of takers mail the cards, but who's to say what really happens? A 26-year-old diner at the Time Cafe in the East Village, who identified himself only as Squid, said, \\"I grab them because I think I'll send them, but I have a pile at home.\\" His girlfriend, Amy, said, \\"I try to make collages, but I'm too lazy.\\" Nevertheless, creative uses abound. Ravers have used a psychedelic card designed by Dolphina Jones as an invitation to their gatherings. When the performance artist Anita Liberty put out cards marked, \\"I hate him,\\" many women mailed them anonymously to their exes. \\"For weeks, I got calls from baffled boyfriends,\\" she said. \\"I guess there are a lot of angry women in New York.\\" Most rudimentary use: Gloria Estefan and a table of music-biz types were seen one hot evening using free cards to fan themselves.\\n\\nMOST POPULAR Sexy and bizarre cards that don't look like advertisements move fastest and are often \\"sold out\\" in their slots. The most popular card, restaurateurs report, is a reproduction of the centerfold of Marilyn Monroe from the first issue of Playboy. It had to be reprinted four times. The current champ (though surely not heavyweight) features Kate Moss with a milk mustache and is such a hit that the samples are often peeled from the racks.\\n\\nRACK WARS M@x (pronounced MAX) battles Fivefinger and its affiliates for the best advertisers and venues in eight American cities. M@x (which recently changed to that name from Gitter's Gallery because \\"it sounds more cutting edge\\") says its racks are sleeker and its cards are on better stock. Last year, a spy from M@x phoned Fivefinger (the name refers to the proverbial \\"five-finger discount,\\" i.e., pilfering) asking for its list of restaurants. \\"We made up a bogus list of weird places in Chinatown and gyro spots in the Village,\\" Mr. Wolan of Fivefinger recalled. \\"It set them back three weeks!\\"\\nDAVID KARP THING","excerpt":"New on the Menu: Picture Postcards"},{"year":"2002","title":"The Times today introduces expanded weekly coverage of business travel, its rewards and its frustrations.

The chef and owner, Peter Loria, offers creative yet homey dishes at reasonable prices. Recommended are an appetizer called eggplant napoleon with pesto and shrimp ($6) and pastas like garlicky rigatoni with grilled chicken, escarole and pine nuts ($8) and fettuccine with salmon and asparagus ($10).

Hats are a novelty for many young women who have now taken to wearing them with barrel-shaped short coats and stretch stirrup pants or tights. This freshens the \\"hat look,\\" and gives it quite a different proportion. Not that the traditional look has been discarded. Dressy hats still look fine with leg-baring skirts and coats.   As for the hats themselves, almost anything goes. There are echoes of the 1920's in hats with deep crowns, of the 1930's profile, of the doll-size concoctions of the 1940's, and the wide-brimmed black felt that Audrey Hepburn made famous in \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\\" Many women prefer clean, precise shapes, sometimes in fur, punctuated with a jeweled pin. For others, there's always the hood, warm and a little mysterious.    Whatever the choice, the hat remains a special and very personal fashion expression.

The official, Bunnatine H. Greenhouse, has worked in military procurement for 20 years.

A1    As ripples of vapor-filled turbulence began to organize into a storm over the steamy waters of the southeastern Bahamas, Tropical Depression 12 was born, giving few hints that it was an embryonic monster that would grow into Hurricane Katrina.   A13    For one of the few times since legal gambling arrived in Mississippi, the casinos that helped revive the Gulf Coast economy went dark, shutting down along with scores of other businesses.   A13    Energy companies rushed to shut down oil rigs and refineries and evacuate employees in the Gulf of Mexico, shrinking oil output in the area at a time when markets are already on edge over surging energy prices.   A12    Roberts's Grammar Precision  An obsession with rhetorical precision is a central John Roberts trait, according to friends and former colleagues of the man nominated by President Bush to become a Supreme Court justice.

But not to do so with this year's JVC Jazz Festival-New York, which starts today and runs until June 25, would ignore a strange turn of events. Not only is this year's JVC-New York full of sleepy or many-times-repeated bookings, weird inequities and antique fixations, but its Rhode Island cousin, JVC Jazz Festival-Newport, now clearly has the edge.     The impresario George Wein, along with Elaine and Louis Lorillard, began the Newport Jazz Festival in 1954, before corporate sponsorship supported musical events. It was, as everyone now knows, the first major outdoor jazz festival in the United States, and became the model for what is now a summer jazz-festival circuit around the world, including Montreal","excerpt":"New Orleans; North Sea (in The Hague), Marciac (France), Perugia (Italy), Montreux (Switzerland) and on and on.

With Flo's aid he regains his former position as a lawyer, and after he has saved her sweetheart from prison he is reunited with his wife, who, it appears, has loved him all the time.
