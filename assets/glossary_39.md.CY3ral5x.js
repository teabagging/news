By Jerry Glanville and J. David Miller. (Macmillan, $18.95.) Jerry Glanville, formerly the head coach of the Houston Oilers and now with the Atlanta Falcons, has been over the course of his career a controversial figure who fancies himself something of a rebel. His book, \\"Elvis Don't Like Football,\\" is dedicated to \\"Jerry Jeff Walker, Kris Kristofferson and John Cougar Mellencamp, the last true rebels of our time.\\" Like many self-proclaimed rebels, Mr. Glanville, perhaps best known for his cloyingly precious habit of leaving tickets at the box office for deceased notables like Elvis Presley and James Dean, complains that he is misunderstood. For example, his football teams don't play dirty, they just play tough. With the help of J. David Miller, a contributing editor of Sport magazine, Mr. Glanville has produced what amounts to little more than an apologia for his professional life, as well as a comfortable perch from which he can snipe at his detractors","excerpt":"most notably, he settles scores against other coaches, including Chuck Noll of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Sam Wyche of the Cleveland Browns, who once proclaimed that Glanville's teams \\"are the dumbest, most stupid, undisciplined teams we've ever played.\\" Others who come in for the Glanville chop block include sportswriters and broadcasters and assorted aides and players who were either disloyal to Mr. Granville or did not measure up to his code of ethics. On those rare occasions when he does stoop to discuss football philosophy, he often shoots himself in the foot. \\"Defenses get beat by mental errors. I don't believe you win a game with cerebral ideas. Your players have to know what they're doing. They have to react, not think.\\" Say what? For the most part this is a rambling, sophomoric, self-indulgent book marked by feeble and tasteless attempts at humor, such as his description of one of his nonunion players during the strike of 1987 as \\"so fat he would've turned queer for a chocolate sundae.\\" Curiously missing from this book is any mention of the Oiler quarterback Warren Moon, who most certainly had something to do with the success of the team while Mr. Glanville was at the helm. Or did he? In any case, it is hard to imagine who the audience for this book would be, other than Atlanta Falcon fans who might want a peek into the future of their team.

Officials involved in creating the plan acknowledge that American forces face an extraordinarily difficult task and that success is far from guaranteed.   A1    Insurgents fired two rockets into a Sheraton hotel in central Baghdad, setting rooms ablaze and forcing the temporary evacuation of scores of journalists and foreign contractors. No deaths were reported.   A12    Saddam Hussein spent heavily on arms imports starting in 1999, found a report by the top American arms inspector for Iraq. But, he said, the purchases were not enough to create a viable chemical, biological or nuclear weapons program.   A1    France reacted cautiously to the inspector's suggestions that French officials and businessmen accepted bribes from Saddam Hussein as he sought to ease sanctions.   A14    On the eve of the American invasion, Mr. Hussein instructed top Iraqi ministers to ''resist one week, and after that I will take over.'' Some believed that was a signal that he had a secret weapon, but now it appears that he meant an insurgency.

H. Mackzum, a Knights of Columbus secretary, and shown at the Rialto seven weeks ago, is said to have been made on a German submarine during the war and to have been obtained by allied representatives since the armistice. It shows cargo steamers and a picturesque schooner stopped by the submarine, wounded by its shells and bombs, and then sinking, each one slowly at first, with a different turn or roll of dumb helplessness before finally disappearing with a hurried plunge into its grave. For those to whom ships are something human, or magnificently triumphant human creations, these pictures of their assassination by forces controlled by men are overwhelmingly tragic—or, to the mood of despair, hellishly comic.The photoplay at the Capitol is \\"Should a Woman Tell?\\" (it honestly hurts to write some movie titles,) with Alice Lake, a Brooklyn girl, taken from Roscoe Arbuckle comedies by Maxwell Karger, of Metro, and now starred for the first time. The picture was directed by John E. Ince, under Mr. Karger's supervision, from a scenario by Finis Fox.The heroine of the story is a native of a New England seacoast village who, on a visit to Boston, is a victim of her own ignorance and a man's knowledge. She returns to her home appalled by the consciousness of her misstep, but revives hope when her first, and still constant, lover returns after several years in Paris. He knows nothing of the Boston incident, and the question so feverishly shouted by the title of the photoplay arises in the girl's mind. Shall she tell him? She does, but not successfully until after they are married, and then he leaves her. From this point on until nearly the end, it looks as if the story would be a tragedy and answer its question in the negative, but after several frenzied reels old reliable Happy Ending is brought in with his benevolent smile and the two true lovers are reunited.The story starts well and, despite the rush of melodrama in which it becomes confused, has genuine human quality in places, though, of course, it gives no answer to its problem. It approaches humanness chiefly through the acting and directing. Mr. Ince has made some remarkable scenes. The wreck of a yacht off the New England village is a masterly piece of work","excerpt":"most of the action that counts in the plot is presented in moving pictures that do not depend upon text, beautiful views abound, and that part of the story which, too realistically treated, would be offensive, is effectively told metaphorically.Miss Lake's performance confirms Mr. Karger's judgment. She is not only a person of pleasing appearance, but, much more importantly, has pantomimic ability. Others in the cast conspicuous by their good work are Frank Currier as an old seaman, Relyea Anderson as his unlovely wife, and Richard Headrick as a delightful child. Jack Mulhall, as the hero, is just satisfactory.Another pictorial number on the Capitol bill which must be mentioned even in crowded space, because of its fascination for those who like to smile and laugh is \\"Such Is Life in New York Uptown,\\" a Travelaugh executed by the skillful Hy Mayer.Ned Wayburn's contribution to the program is what most people will expect. Frank Johnson, Donald Kerr, Lucille Chalfant, Pearl Regay, Evan Burrows Fontaine, and others furnish singing and dancing acts of the revue type, with such a sprinkling of novelty as may be counted on from Mr. Wayburn.One of the most grim and gruesome, and decidedly one of the best made, pictures produced since the beginning of the war is at the Broadway this week—\\"Behind the Door,\\" adapted from a story by Gouverneur Morris, directed by Irvin Willat, under the supervision of Thomas H. Ince, with that big human being, Hobart Bosworth, in the leading rôle. The picturized story reaches a terrific climax in an act of maniacal hate, the hate of an American naval officer of German extraction for the German commander of a submarine who has robbed him of his wife and treated her hideously. To describe the act would, perhaps, be unfair to those who want to receive the full shock of it from the photoplay. It need be said only that the experience of the woman among the brutes on the submarine and the revenge of her husband are pictured relentlessly, though, according to report, even more frightful scenes were but from the original film by the management of the theatre.Whatever one may think of the advisability (or entertaining capability?) of \\"Behind the Door,\\" he cannot deny that it is the work of able individuals. The acting of Mr. Bosworth, as the German-American, of Jane Novak as his wife, and of Wallace Beery as the German, is compelling by its force and precision, and Mr. Willat has made moving pictures which for atmosphere and dramatic intensity have seldom been surpassed.The ending, making a hopeless effort to be \\"happy,\\" shows a reunion of the spirits of the husband and his wife, and this, because of the idea and its photographic representation, would be beautiful in another story, but nothing can be convincingly beautiful arising out of such a substance of horror and hate as \\"Behind the Door\\" is made of.Norma Talmadge has the distinction of starring in two photoplays on Broadway at the same time this week. \\"A Daughter of Two Worlds\\" at the Strand and \\"She Loves and Lies\\" at the Rivoli, the first directed by James L. Young and the latter by Chester Withey.\\"When the Clouds Roll By,\\" with Douglas Fairbanks, has moved from the Rivoli to the Rialto for the week.Burton Holmes delivered the first illustrated lecture of his season at Carnegie Hall last night, his subject being \\"Belgium.\\" It will be repeated at the same place this afternoon.

Their bodies are shaped like the sole of a shoe and both their eyes lie on the same side of the head. The halibut is the largest member of this family and can weigh as much as 600 pounds and measure six feet long. Such hefty specimens are unusual, however","excerpt":"most of the big ones weigh around 100 pounds. The smaller fish -- often known as chicken halibut -- can weigh as little as three pounds.    Halibut is often overlooked in favor of its more glamorous cousins, sole and turbot, but it is a close-textured, delicate fish that takes well both to strong and subtle seasonings. It is also extremely nourishing, being high in fish oils that help to lower cholesterol. It is at its best between August and April.   In England, halibut has always been popular and often shows up grilled with a tomato, and topped with a pat of parsley butter. I think tomatoes taste even better when they have been baked in olive oil in a slow oven. I discovered this method from a recipe by the Italian cooking expert Marcella Hazan and it is one of the best ways of cooking them I have come across -- drawing off their excessive wateriness and making even rather poor tomatoes taste good. What remains is a highly concentrated flavor. Do not be alarmed by the quantity of oil used; nearly all of it is left in the pan.    Anton Mosimann, the brilliant chef de cuisine at the Dorchester Hotel in London, garnishes skinned and boned halibut fillets with red onions stewed in red wine with orange peel. This unusual, delectable dish can be served with steamed potatoes and green beans.   Halibut is also a very good fish for soups. The following recipe, which consists of fish and shellfish briefly cooked in a saffron-flavored broth, is extremely simple. It can also be made in advance, with the fish cooked in the broth at the last minute. It is served with a rather unconventional rouille (a thick garlicky sauce stirred in after the soup is served), but uses a couple of tablespoons of commercial mayonnaise instead of egg yolks as a liaison, lowering the cholesterol content somewhat. More garlic can be added by those who consider rouille made with just one clove wimpy. Fish Soup   Total time: 1 hour    1/2 pound shrimp, with shells on  1/2 pound squid, cleaned  1/2 pound halibut  1 piece monkfish (about 1/2 pound)   Lemon juice  2 tablespoons parsley  Fish heads and bones as available  2 tablespoons olive oil  1 large leek, sliced  2 carrots, sliced  1 clove garlic, minced  4 ripe tomatoes skinned and chopped, or canned tomatoes, chopped  Pinch saffron  1 glass dry white wine  For the rouille:  4 thick slices white or light whole wheat bread, crusts removed  2 tablespoons mayonnaise  1 teaspoon paprika  1 teaspoon cayenne pepper  1/3 to 1/2 cup olive oil  Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.     1. Shell the shrimp and put the shells in a stockpot. Put the shrimp in a mound on a large plate. Slice the squid and place in a mound next to the shrimp. Cut the remaining fish into one-and-a-half-inch chunks and put any bones into the stockpot. Squeeze lemon juice onto the fish and set aside.   2. Add the parsley to the stockpot with any fish heads and other bones. Add five cups water and simmer gently uncovered for 30 minutes.   3. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet and soften the leek with the carrots and the garlic. Add the tomatoes with the saffron and white wine. Cook gently for five minutes, turn heat down to very low, cover and simmer while the broth is cooking.    4. Meanwhile, make the rouille. Put the bread and mayonnaise into the bowl of a food processor. Add the mayonnaise, paprika and cayenne. Slowly add the oil and process until you have a thick puree. Season to taste and place in a small bowl.    5. Drain the fish broth and reserve. Put the broth into a pot that you can carry to the table and add the leek tomato mixture. Simmer for five minutes.    6. Just before serving add the fish to the broth. First add the squid, cook for five minutes, then add the white fish, cook for two minutes, then add the shrimp and cook for two minutes. Bring to the table and serve the rouille separately.    Yield: 4 servings     Note: This is good served with boiled potatoes and hot French bread.   Grilled Halibut With Baked Tomatoes   Total time: 1 to 1 1/2 hours   1 large halibut steak or two small ones (about 2 to 2 1/2 pounds total)  Juice 1 lemon  About 1/2 cup olive oil  4 medium tomatoes  1 clove garlic  3 tablespoons parsley  Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.     1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Wipe the halibut steaks dry and brush with lemon juice and one-fourth cup olive oil. Set aside.   2. Cut the tomatoes in half. If they have a great deal of seeds, remove some. Place tomatoes cut-side up in a flameproof baking dish, tightly packed because they will shrink in cooking. Sprinkle them with garlic, parsley, salt and pepper and add enough olive oil to come about one-fourth inch up the sides. Cook on top of the stove for 15 minutes, or until tomatoes are tender, then transfer them to the oven and bake for about one hour or until they have shrunk to about half their original size.    3. Meanwhile, preheat broiler or charcoal grill. Season the halibut steaks with salt and pepper and broil for six to seven minutes on each side, turning once. Place on a serving dish. Remove tomatoes from baking dish with a slotted spoon, leaving most of the oil behind, and arrange them on the serving dish around the halibut.   Yield: 4 servings.     Note: This is very good garnished with grilled leeks in addition to the tomatoes.    Anton Mosimann's Halibut Fillets   Total time: 30 minutes   4 fillets of halibut weighing about 6 ounces each, skinned and carefully boned  Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  11 ounces red onions, finely sliced  4 fluid ounces red wine, preferably Beaujolais  1 teaspoon orange peel  1 teaspoon honey  3 tablespoons olive oil  1 tablespoon unsalted butter  1 tablespoon unsalted melted butter  4 sprigs fresh tarragon to garnish.     1. Season the fish fillets with salt and pepper and set aside.   2. Place the onions and red wine in a fireproof dish and season lightly with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer until soft, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Add the orange peel and honey. Keep warm.   3. Heat the oil and one tablespoon butter in a frying pan and saute the fillets on each side for about two minutes or until golden.   4. Arrange the onions on four warmed plates, place the fish fillets on top and brush them with the melted butter. Garnish with tarragon sprigs and serve immediately.   Yield: 4 servings.

After working through the night, negotiators were said to have agreed on almost all aspects of an ambitious package of measures to promote environmentally sustainable development in the poorer south, but officials said the United States contribution was likely to be small.   Negotiators still struggled to resolve their differences over the aid that the wealthier industrial nations of the North would offer the poor nations of the South to offset the extra cost that the latter face for safeguarding the environment and preserving disappearing forests. Talks Through the Weekend    As a result of the standoff, the Earth Summit's chief organizer, Maurice Strong of Canada, announced today that negotiations would continue into the weekend so President Bush and other leaders can help shape the final compromise.   \\"Involving the heads of state and government personally will give us a better result,\\" Mr. Strong told a news conference today. \\"By Sunday we hope they will have produced a full agreement for approval by the summit's final plenary session.\\"    But diplomats said the decision to involve heads of state and government in the final talks reflected the intractable difficulties that had arisen and that could now be resolved only by compromises at the highest political level.   As their price for agreeing to Agenda 21, the plan for making economic development environmentally sustainable, developing countries want the industrialized world to meet a 20-year-old commitment to raise its aid to seven-tenths of 1 percent of economic output by 2000, from four-tenths of 1 percent at present. How Much Is Wanted    They also want donors to enlarge the size of the $1.3 billion Global Environmental Facility that they set up three years ago in the World Bank and to add a special \\"earth increment\\" to the World Bank agency that supplies loans on easier terms so it can provide virtually free environmental aid to the very poorest nations.   The United States, which has contributed $50 million to the Global Environmental Facility so far, is prepared to consider an increase and is ready to study an \\"earth increment,\\" officials say. Washington is also offering $150 million in new aid to help developing countries safeguard their forests.   But today the Deputy Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Michael Young, reiterated Washington's long-standing refusal to accept any target for its overall aid, arguing that such targets do not reflect the developing world's ability to absorb the money. He also said such loan commitments absolve poor countries from the need to attract foreign investment.   Instead, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, William K. Reilly, presented a plan to carry out quickly a new convention curbing emission of the so-called greenhouse gases","excerpt":"most of the plan had already been announced.   Mr. Reilly also said President Bush would propose a global inventory of biological resources when he addresses the Earth Summit on Friday.   European and other Western countries, which have all accepted in principle the aid target of seven-tenths of 1 percent, are now trying to convince leaders in the developing world that donors will increase environmental aid to secure an agreement here -- even if many will not commit themselves to reach that figure by a particular date.   Several delegations have already indicated that their leaders may present new aid offers when they address the Earth Summit. As a result, developing countries say they are waiting to see just what is offered.   \\"We want to see what they come up with, so the negotiations will go on for another day or two,\\" said Jamsheed A. Marker, Pakistan's Ambassador to the United Nations, who is also spokesman for the Group of 77, as the developing countries call themselves. An Offer From Japan    Japanese officials have said Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa plans to announce an increase in the amount of environmental aid that Japan offers to developing countries to $1.4 billion a year over the next five years, from about $800 million a year between 1989 and 1991 .   But in order not to embarrass President Bush, these officials say, Mr. Miyazawa will probably delay announcing plans to raise Japan's total development aid to $70 billion during the coming five years, from $50 billion over the last five years. The announcement could come in early July at the Munich summit meeting of the seven major industrial democracies.   The 12 members of the European Community are also putting together a $4.3 billion package of environmental aid projects, which they plan to present at the final sessions.   While the package will include both existing projects and some new money, European diplomats hope it will encourage developing countries to compromise on their demands. Forest Talks Also Blocked    The continuing standoff over money has contributed to the stalemate between North and South over steps to preserve the world's forests.   Tonight a senior United States official said Washington had virtually abandoned its hopes of securing a firm commitment to negotiate a binding international convention to safeguard forests.   \\"We are not going to get a convention,\\" the official said. \\"It's too much of an article of faith for the Group of 77.   But Malaysia, which has opposed even a nonbinding set of forestry principles, was reported by delegates to be adopting a more flexible stand, and Brazil, which has the world's largest forests, was said to be anxious to promote a compromise to assure success at the meetings to which it has played host.    Thus, diplomats said, India has emerged as the developing country most opposed to any move by the Earth Summit that might imply international control of the world's remaining forests.

Instead of ruling, the King prefers to compose poems and songs and to while away his time with his wives.The British East India Company is preparing to gobble up Oudh, but to do this legally, it must persuade the King to sign a new treaty of what's euphe-mistically called friendship.While all this is going on, two friends, wealthy Lucknow noblemen named Mirza and Mir, carry on a non-stop chess tournament. There are no stakes other than their egos. The two men are obsessed with the game to such an extent that one of them has no time for his lovely young wife (Shabana Azmi), while the other is the last person in Lucknow to know that his wife has made him a cuckold.\\"The Chess Players,\\" Satyajt Ray's new film that opens today at the Little Carnegie, is social satire of a sort that is so graceful, so polite, so balanced and in such good taste, that it virtually amounts to a shrug: This is the way it was, Mr. Ray seems to be saying. So be it.Though it is often witty, \\"The Chess Players\\" lacks the passion that guides the intelligence and can make urgent the most remote of problems. More than anything else, I suppose, it is stately. Watching it is like being witness to a formal ceremony. One admires the costumes, the perfectly picked-up cues, the elegance of the principals, the complicated footwork, the manner in which an entire civilization has been encapsulated in a few particular gestures. Yet one is always a little ahead of the film. It's unable to surprise us.Some of this must be the intention of Mr. Ray. He's not trying to keep us on the edge of our seats but to make us contemplate a bit of history, not because of any special parallels to our own times but because it has to do with the birth-life-death rhythm of all civilizations. He's not outraged. Sometimes he's amused","excerpt":"most often he's meditative, and unless you respond to this mood, the movie is so overly polite you may want to shout a rude word.\\"The Chess Players\\" becomes epigrammatic in form as it cuts among its three arenas of action, which are the equivalent to plot lines. There is the nonstop chess game and the minor irritations that must be faced by the two friends played by Sanjeev Kumar and Saeed Jaffrey—who was so good as the sly Indian guide in \\"The Man Who Would Be King.\\"Then there are the scenes in the British resident's office in which Richard Attenborough, as the resident, talks, very intelligently, about British policy in India, and the scenes in the palace where we watch the King at play and, finally, as he comes to the realization that he's been checkmated and that the best he can do is to retire with honor.The film is not without feelings, but they are muted, reined-in. There's resignation everywhere, even in the line, \\"The Indians invented the game but the British changed the rules,\\" and especially at the end when the two chess players, having escaped from Lucknow for a day of uninterrupted chess-playing in the country, wonder whether they should return to the city, now occupied by British troops, \\"If we can't cope with our wives,\\" one of the chess players says to the other, \\"how can we cope with the British Army?\\"Actually it's a funny line, and it's meant to be, but it also reflects the civilian impotency that is the film's subtext.

Magnetic Poetry has its origins in writer's block. Whenever Dave Kapell, 33, a Minneapolis songwriter, felt creatively choked he would scribble words on strips of paper and rearrange them in various orders, a common exercise for poets. Then one day a friend who worked in a pizza parlor gave him a stack of refrigerator magnets. Having sneezed, wiped and spilled much of his work into oblivion, it dawned on Mr. Kappell that gluing his words to the magnets would give his verse staying power. True enough. Though hit singles are still elusive, Mr. Kapell is no longer struggling. Magnetic Poetry sales, which at $19.95 a kit recently topped 200,000 after 18 months, have bought him a house and a car. \\"I'm quickly becoming bourgeois,\\" Mr. Kappell said.\\nALREADY A MUSEUM PIECE: Magnetic Poetry is sold at many museum gift shops and other specialty boutiques. More important is where you can use it, which is basically on anything with magnetic force","excerpt":"most popular are refrigerator doors, filing cabinets, cookie sheets and car hoods.\\nSTARS ARE ATTACHED: Kits are known to have been purchased by Tim Robbins, Daryl Hannah and Gloria Steinem. Mr. Kappell personally gave one to Uma Thurman. Last Christmas, he sold them in bulk to executives at Paramount and Columbia Studios in Hollywood. \\"Perhaps they were trying to give screenwriters a hint,\\" Mr. Kappell conjectured. Mr. Kapell says he hopes Magnetic Poetry will help \\"subvert the mentality that only people with berets can write and read poetry.\\" Truth is, he didn't much enjoy the genre at the University of Minnesota. \\"I got turned off trying to understand Ezra Pound and all of T. S. Eliot's Catholic references,\\" he said. \\"I want to rebel against this fad of poetry slams where all these pretentious, tortured artists read such garbage.\\"\\nWHAT REAL POETS THINK: \\"It's a fabulous way of seeing how words rub up against each other,\\" said Jonathan Galassi, president of the Academy of American Poets. Georgia Shreve, a poet, uses the game as a learning tool for third graders. \\"It's particularly useful when teaching the style of E. E. Cummings, who liked short and simple words,\\" Ms. Shrieve said.\\nTHE POWER OF WORDS: \\"I'm not saying I'm John Lennon but I am beginning to realize that if my product is someone's first exposure to poetry, then I do have a certain responsibility, because it can change people's lives,\\" Mr. Kapell said. He's not being immodest. There's the child psychologist whose 10-year-old patient expressed the pain of incest through a poem written with Magnetic Poetry. And the 85-year-old woman who wrote in to say: \\"I found a part of myself I didn't know existed.\\"\\nFUTURE VERSE: Already out is Magnetic Poetry for children, with larger letters and child-oriented words like \\"mom,\\" \\"dad,\\" and \\"dinosaur.\\" \\"No diminutives like doggy or kitty,\\" Mr. Kapell exhorted, ever aware of his influence. Soon to come is a romance version that will contain lots of \\"loves,\\" \\"candlelights\\" and \\"touches,\\" as well as some semi-erotica like \\"skin,\\" \\"breast,\\" \\"stomach\\" and \\"thigh.\\" Mr. Kapell says he chooses words based on their multiplicity. For instance, \\"behind\\" can serve as an adverb or a preposition, but also as a noun.

Few traders predict that gold will fall to the $100 mark last seen in 1976, but the precipitous drop from 1980's $825 level has raised concerns about whether gold will retain its reputation as a safe harbor during times of uncertainty. Indeed, more traders seem to be wanting dollars as the hedge, especially since the American inflation rate is staying so unexpectedly low. The relationship between the dollar and gold shifts occasionally as the world economy changes, and some investors apparently have greater faith in the continuing strength of the dollar than they do in gold. And traders note that gold is still high, both historically and when adjusted for inflation.
