Only the most obviously disreputable of American imports and revivals fail to earn critical raves here, and on occasion local versions of New York shows are proclaimed superior to the originals. During the 1980's, this was most famously the case with Richard Eyre's staging of \\"Guys and Dolls\\" and Cameron Mackintosh's upbeat revision of Stephen Sondheim's \\"Follies,\\" though American visitors could see that both productions were far from fluent in Broadwayese. In \\"Guys and Dolls,\\" Damon Runyon's mugs sometimes spoke with Southern accents and tapped like Bojangles.   So it was with skepticism that I approached the new production of the 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein \\"Carousel,\\" which opened last weekend to ecstatic reviews and turn-away crowds at the Royal National Theater, the site of the Eyre \\"Guys and Dolls.\\" But for once the wild enthusiasm may be an understatement. This is without question the most revelatory, not to mention the most moving, revival I've seen of any Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. The National has recently found startling new ways of looking at the dramas of Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller under both Peter Hall's and Mr. Eyre's leadership, and now it proves just as imaginative in sweeping away decades of cliches from an American musical classic of the same period.

Several of the most striking scenes deal with a great strike at the railhead, ended by the blowing of a whistle signaling the finding of a new pass through the mountains when the route had encountered impassable bogs.Of course there is a love story, in which Richard Arlen as a young engineer, Lilli Palmer, Antoinette Cellier and Barry Mackay play the principal rôles.The utmost fidelity has been paid to detail and scenes in the mountain wilderness and amid the muskegs where a train sinks before the eyes testified to the enormous pains taken in the film.Figures of the great pioneers, Van Home, Shaughnessy and the rest, live again and there is an excellent reproduction of the dramatic scene in the directors' room in Montreal when James J. Hill, failing to divert the new railroad to connection with his own, resigned from the board.The film will appeal to all Canadians and thousands in the United States to whom in Summer Canada has become a second homeland. Its première tonight was given for the benefit of the Safer Motherhood Appeal, of which Mrs. Stanley Baldwin is president. Queen Mary attended.The occasion was the opening of a new theatre, the Gaumont in Haymarket, with a seating capacity of 1,300.

The house, built between 1756 and 1766 as the London home for the first Lord Spencer, became too expensive to maintain as a residence and was converted to offices in 1927. Still owned by the Spencer family, of which the Princess of Wales is a member, the work has been carried out by Lord Rothschild. Five years ago he took a 125-year lease on the Palladian house and had it restored to its original splendor. On view to the public will be nine state rooms containing a distinguished collection of paintings and furniture, some on loan from private and public collections, including those of the Queen. The state rooms were among the first neo-classical interiors to be designed in Europe, and the Painted Room is considered to be one of the glories of English architecture.   In Lady Spencer's bedroom are two Adam-style gilt wood girandoles, one from the 18th century, the other a flawless modern copy by Clifford Wright. In the dining room are the two original 18th-century gilt wood tables with their majestic panthers, designed by John Vardy. A master craftsman, Dick Reid, has replaced all the missing architectural moldings in the house and has been commissioned to carve the Carrara chimney pieces for six of the state rooms and the console tables and pier glasses designed by James Stuart for the Great Room.   The house, which in the late 18th and 19th centuries was a rallying point of fashion and political activity, will be open every Sunday except in August and January from 11:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Visitors will be given a guided tour, and an accompanying guidebook costs $8. Admission, including guide, is $7. Nearest Underground station: Green Park. More information: (071) 499 8620.
