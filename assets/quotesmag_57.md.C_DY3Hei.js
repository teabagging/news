The Munich Oktoberfest (Sept. 17 to Oct. 2), with food and drink in great tents and halls, is world-famous. Less renowned is the Wieze Beer Festival (Sept. 24 to Oct. 9) in Belgium. In the tiny Flemish village of Wieze, 18 miles from Brussels, local beer is piped directly from cellars to counters in the halls, and Wieze sausages are served instead of the weisswurst, knockwurst and chicken that constitute much of the solid fare in Munich. During this event, some 300 brass bands and folkloric groups from Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and France are scheduled to gather in Wieze, where plans call for costumed processions, to the tunes of perhaps 15,000 musicians, to wind through the streets on Sept. 24 and 25 and Oct. 2 and 9.

His black-and-white prints of tract houses, warehouses and construction debris, which date from the early 1970's into the 80's, have an austere beauty that is heightened by their profound but seemingly incidental kinship with Minimalism. They are bare and spare documents of the worst aspects of urban sprawl, but they are also stripped down to an essential, rectilinear geometry.    This is to say that the 45-year-old photographer, who comes from California and now lives in Europe part of the year, is not merely a photographer in the topographic tradition of such 19th-century surveyors as Carleton Watkins and Timothy O'Sullivan. As a retrospective exhibition of his work now at P.S. 1 Museum -- the Queens venue of the Institute of Contemporary Art -- makes clear, he is also a close follower of the art world. His photographs reflect both modern life and contemporary art movements.

The entire group numbered almost 40 people, most of whom were on stage during most of the performances, making for what seems to have been extremely cheerful and friendly chaos.That, at least, is the spirit of this most satisfying, record-album of a movie, for which the group's off-stage experiences—traveling by bus and plane, radio interviews, picnics, getting up in the morning—act as liner notes.Liner notes are seldom absolutely necessary, but they can be entertaining when one has nothing else to read. Those for \\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\" (the movie, not the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer soundtrack album) don't say very much about the driving genius of Mr. Cocker, which remains his own, quite private concern until his stage appearances, but they serve as necessary and often entertaining intermissions between the fine, galvanizing Cocker performances.\\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen,\\" the name Mr. Cocker gave to the group put together for this tour, is exactly what a cinema vérité concert film should be: music as recorded during lively performances, in this case in Dallas, San Francisco, Piattsburgh, N. Y.","excerpt":"Minneapolis and, finally, New York, at the Fillmore East.Mr. Cocker is not the spectacularly sinuous, sexually aggressive performer that Mick Jagger is. In his old undershirt, which is occasionally dressed up with a few sequins, he is hardly a sight that is immediately riveting. His equally talented No. 2 man, Leon Russell, arranger-guitarist-pianist-composer-what have you, with his long hair, 19th-century topper and white jeans with the flowers on the seat, is much more photogenic. It is, however, Mr. Cocker who provides the show, who sings most of the film's 15 numbers, with, from time to time, a little bit of help from such friends as Claudia Linnear and Mr. Russell.Mr. Cocker's style is post-Ray Charles, post-almost anybody I can think of, a gravelly voice that seems to have been pushed beyond its endurance, but that always retains reserve with which to maneuver through Mr. Russell's complex arrangements. Their rock-blues utilizing the large choir into which the children and Canina sometimes wander, are immensely elaborate without ever being fancy, principally, I suspect, because Mr. Cocker is not a fancy artist.He is simple, direct and great, as is the repertory that includes a lot of rock standards like \\"Honky Tonk Woman,\\" \\"Space Captain,\\" \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"Give Peace a Chance.\\" Thus, people coming upon Mr. Cocker for the first time will not be lost.As in most films of this nature, it's difficult to tell who is responsible for what, but let me say that it was directed by Pierre Adidge, co-directed and edited by Sid Levin, with David Myers as director of photography, which includes the work of at least three cameras.The quality of the blow-up print from 16 millimeter to 35 millimeter that I saw at the Trans-Lux West (where it opened yesterday, as well as at the Trans-Lux East) was not perfect, but certainly adequate. The split-screen effects are sometimes lovely, and the sound recording seemed excellent.\\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\" patronizes neither its audience nor its stars. Occasionally it lets peripheral characters make rather sober fools of themselves, such as the professorial disk jockey who tells Mr. Cocker how he could spend \\"two hours in the British Museum, just looking at all that stuff they ripped off the Egyptians.\\" The film, however, is too good-natured, and too involved with the actual performance of a single star, to waste much time with this sort of thing, which is why it is so satisfactory, so pleasing. It is uncluttered, one of the best concert films so far.
