From his credentials, one might expect La Caravelle to begin grilling over vine clippings and serving only vinaigrette sauces. Far from it. Mr. Ono's summer menu cleverly blends his own contemporary dishes -- poached sea scallops in citrus sauce, duck ravioli with cilantro consomme, steamed monkfish rolled in Chinese cabbage -- with traditional La Caravelle fare like grilled Dover sole with mustard sauce and pike quenelles in lobster sauce. The dinner menu is prix fixe at $54","excerpt":"lunch is a la carte.   Among the best starters at a recent dinner were the peppery lobster bisque and the light duck-filled ravioli in a richly flavored sauce of duck stock enlivened with fresh cilantro. Snails served with fennel and couscous were a nice new twist, too.   Steamed monkfish, wrapped in leaves of Chinese cabbage and served with a light ginger butter, is a winning entree, as is crisp-skinned roast duck with cranberries and grilled Dover sole with mustard sauce. Sauteed sweetbreads came atop a mound of mashed potatoes, all enhanced with chive oil. If the sweetbreads had been crisp, the combination would have been smashing.   Desserts are colorful and iconographic. Some even taste good, like the chocolate mousse with a lid of bittersweet chocolate, and the apple terrine with fresh berries. La Caravelle is clearly heading down a new, adventure-filled road. Considering the quality of the new menu, it might be worth hitching a ride.   La Caravelle serves lunch noon to 3 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner 5:30 to 10:30 P.M. Monday to Friday. Closed Saturdays until after Labor Day. All major credit cards accepted. Telephone: (212) 586-4252.

On Buying Big Fish     If you want big fish, like a seven-pound bluefish, 89 cents a pound, or a four-pound catfish, 99 cents a pound, the place to go is Miracle Two Fish Plaza, 2169 Third Avenue, at 118th Street. This busy, bright and impeccable market -- opened a few months ago by James Yoo and his wife, Jong Sun Yoo -- carries a good variety of whole fresh fish. Smaller fish like silvery butterfish, for $1.29 a pound, and sleek Spanish mackerel, $1.99 a pound, also shared the ice. Only the sea bass looked over the hill.   The market also stocks fish steaks and fillets like cod, for $3.99 a pound, and salmon, $6.99 a pound, as well as shellfish. Shrimp are $4.99 to $10.99 a pound. Fried fish and seafood are sold at a counter in the front of the store.    Raw shrimp and crabs purchased in the store can also be steamed there with hot-pepper seasoning. The steaming is free and makes it appealing for Manhattanites to stop at Miracle Two for spicy shrimp before heading over the Triborough Bridge to the beach.   Miracle Two is open every day except Sunday, from 7:30 A.M. to 8 P.M. Telephone: (212) 348-8490.  Women Organize     The International Association of Women Chefs and Restaurateurs, whose goal is to promote education and advancement of women in the restaurant industry, made its debut in New York this month.   The founding members are mostly chef-owners: Lidia Bastianich and Anne Rosenzweig in New York; Barbara Tropp, Elka Gilmore and Joyce Goldstein of San Francisco; Mary Sue Milliken of Santa Monica, Calif., and Johanne Killeen of Providence. Barbara Lazaroff, a restaurateur and restaurant designer from Los Angeles, is another founder. Other women's groups in the food business aren't dedicated solely to chefs and restaurant owners.   These women, from a generation now well established on the American restaurant scene, hope to help those entering the field by offering, among other things, guidance on legal and technical matters, an apprenticeship program and scholarships.   The next meeting will be held on Aug. 28 and 29 in San Francisco. More information is available by calling Susy Davidson, the administrator for the group, at (212) 879-2709.

The new store is just 15 minutes by car from the Upper West Side when traffic isn't heavy. It's in the Linwood Plaza Shopping Center, 112-130 Fletcher Avenue, Route 9W at Route 4.

The compilation includes some of the best recent DFA remixes: Cajmere's ebullient take on Juan Maclean","excerpt":"Luomo's suave makeover of Black Dice. And best of all is the double-digit price: 99 cents.    Akon, Vybz Kartel, Shabba Ranks & Sizzla       The Senegalese-American crooner Akon has a big hit with ''Soul Survivor,'' a collaboration with the Atlanta rapper Young Jeezy. And how does the reggae world reward him? With a bootleg, naturally. An unauthorized reggae remix of ''Soul Survivor'' preserves the music, along with eight bars of Akon singing, then adds new verses from three of dancehall reggae's greatest declaimers. (The New York hip-hop station Hot 97 has been playing it, and an MP3 is available online.) Ferocious isn't even the word. Sizzla makes some bloodthirsty promises while Vybz Kartel chuckles, ''Dem boy don't have na gun, dem boy don't have na rifle/Dem collapse like twin tower but I am the Eiffel.'' And Shabba Ranks's verse is half-censored, which heightens the effect: the censor's tool isn't a beep but a blast of gunfire.    Okkervil River       What on earth happened to Okkervil River? For the past few years, this group, led by the riveting indie-rock singer-songwriter Will Sheff, has been on a tear, releasing a series of increasingly ambitious albums and EP's. Now, barely six months after the ''Black Sheep Boy'' album, comes ''Black Sheep Boy Appendix'' (Jagjaguwar), a mini-album that is also a brain-teasing epilogue. The lyrics tell the intertwined stories of a songwriter and his protagonist, although you can never be sure that those two characters aren't one. The band's folk-punk rants are more rousing than ever, the strings-and-horns arrangements more elegant; minute for minute, it might just be the best Okkervil River CD so far.    Pussycat Dolls       First came ''Don't Cha.'' Now comes a second hit by this unaccountably ubiquitous striptease group, a cotton-candy ballad called ''Stickwitu,'' which might be even better. It revolves around a breathy promise ideal for the text-messaging age: ''I'm-a stickwitu.'' The melody is perfectly simple, but the beat keeps dropping out and returning and growing and shrinking, confounding expectations the same way this gleefully prefab group does. Both songs come from the sextet's debut album, ''PCD'' (A&M), and non-fans hoping that the CD contains no more potential hits may well be disappointed.    Growing       This duo is, in some sense, a heavy-metal band, although it may never become clear exactly what sense that is. No matter: the new mini-album by Growing is called ''His Return'' (Troubleman Unlimited), and it's a heavy but peaceful CD. Two long, wordless drone compositions frame one not-so-long track called ''Freedom Toward Death,'' where the lyrics are chanted, monklike, over a slowly mutating bed of electric guitars.    Project Pat       Fresh out of prison, where he served a sentence for gun possession, this Memphis rapper is celebrating his freedom by serving as host for the 15th installment of DJ Drama's prestigious ''Gangsta Grillz'' mix tape series (online at gangstagrillz.com). Project Pat hasn't lost his unpredictable, off-kilter style, and at one point he uses a donkey-inspired rhyme scheme: ''They was thinking Dirty South was like, 'Hee haw, hee haw'/Are you worth over a hundred mil? We are, we are.'' And perhaps the most memorable part comes at the beginning, where he rattles off a list of states: this isn't a generic hip-hop shout-out, it's a thank you to everyone who sent him fan mail while he was away.    Imogen Heap       ''Where are we? What the hell is going on?'' Those are the first two lines of one of the year's most sublime songs, ''Hide and Seek'' by Imogen Heap. (She also sings with the British electro-pop duo Frou Frou.) The only sound is her voice, multitracked and digitally processed to create a rich humanoid chorus. ''Hide and Seek'' first arrived in America on the soundtrack to the season finale of ''The O.C.,'' and this month it is released on a pair of new CD's: it's the best thing on her second solo album, ''Speak for Yourself'' (RCA Victor/Sony BMG), and it also appears on '' 'The O.C.' Mix 5'' (Warner Brothers), the program's latest spinoff compilation. Best -- and cheapest -- of all is the music video, available free on imogenheap.co.uk. The director, Joel Peissig, gives her bright lights, a solid background and a wind as artificial as the vocal effect. It resembles a glamorous dance-pop video, except that you'll wait in vain for the beat to arrive.

Griffith's latest screen contribution, \\"Lady of the Paveements,\\" an adaptation of a story by Dr. Karl Vollmoeller, author of \\"The Miracle,\\" is a handsome production, with spacious and lavishly furnished settings, brilliant photography, faultlessly-fitting uniforms and voluminous? crinoline skirts. This German Spanish romance of the days of Napoleon the Little, in the French capital, is however, unfurled in the popular fashion, with an abundance of close-ups and some half-minute kisses. Its outcome creates little anxiety, for while there is the penultimate chapter of sorrows, it is dollars to doughnuts that in the end a smile will lighten Lupe Velez's countenance.Miss Velez is appearing in person before the picture four times a day. She is a fascinating, vivacious and resourceful little person who was not in the least dismayed yesterday afternoon by a few thousand persons in the audience. In fact her songs and chatter were far more entertaining than all but a few of the Hollywood luminaries who have taken the stage before their films were offered. Miss Velez has a ready wit and her limited knowledge of English was never embarrassing to her, for if she was at a loss for a phrase she filled in the gap with apt colloquialisms. She mimicked her rival in \\"Lady of the Pavements,\\" Jetta Goudal, also Gloria Swanson and Dolores Del Rio, much to the delight of those who packed the theatre.In the film, Miss Velez is most suitably cast. She gives a clever performance as a Spanish dancer and singer in a Parisian cabaret, known as \\"Le Chien Qui Fume.\\" She is far more apt to bite the hands of her masculine admirers than caress or kiss them. She subsequently reminds one vaguely of a Pygmalion or a Madame Sans Gêne, when she is being taught how to act in high society.The idea of the narrative has merit, even though Mr. Griffith has not inoculated it with much suspense. A rather unfortunate choice for the principal male rôle was William Boyd, who is quite pathetic when it comes to expressing his silent love for Nanon Del Rayon. His part is that of Karl von Arnim, attaché of the German embassy in Paris, who is at first jubilant that the German emperor has given his consent to the young man's marriage to Countess Diane des Granges. It happens, however, that Diane, played by Jetta Goudal, is fickle in her fancies and when Arnim goes to tell her of the Joyful news he finds her in the arms of another man.It is to be supposed here that the footman is in sympathy with von Arnim, for the young attaché is permitted to ascend alone to the Countess's apartment. It is through the inevitable large mirror that von Arnim sees the Countess fervently embracing his rival. The scene ends by von Arnim informing the Countess that he would sooner marry a woman of the streets than have her as his wife. Hence the Countess, with the aid of Baron Finot, impersonated competently by Albert Conti, plots to tempt von Arnim with a lowly girl.Finot discovers the short-skirted dancer in the cabaret and following a gift of bank-notes he arranges for the instruction of Nanon del Rayon so that she can appear at a function given by the Countess. Nanon is by no means a pliant pupil, for her uncouth nature is constantly asserting itself, especially when it comes to arousing fun with a hooped skirt. Her conduct at the social affair is not always exemplary, but her presence proves so alluring that she easily wins von Arnim's favor and finally his love.Von Arnim is perceived scrawling several times on a piece of paper the name \\"Nanon.\\" It is obvious that when the attaché learns of the lady's past he is at first going to be disappointed and then once, more turn to the minx from the cabaret.Mr. Griffith's scenes in Le Chien Qui Fume are adroitly executed, and this producer makes the most of the sign of a dog with a pipe in his jaws. There is the nice Papa Pierre, acted by Henry Armetta, who looks upon Nanon as the salt of the earth.There are episodes in which Nanon bursts forth into a song, which is fairly well registered. The melody in question was furnished by Irving Berlin. But while there is an excuse in this instance for this tuneful' expression, as it comes from one of the characters and not, as is so often the case, from an invisible person, there are some inopportune moments when Miss Velez chooses to express herself in song. Toward the end, however, Mr. Griffith does some very clever camera work. It is when the heavy-hearted Nanon has returned to her old friends at the cabaret and is once again singing the same melody. Mr. Griffith here causes the men in the place to change gradually into the person of von Arnim. There are half a dozen von Armins around the Place, and, as you might surmise, one of them is the real lover, or husband, as it happens here.The uniforms of the officers, including that of von Arnim, are more reminiscent of an imaginary kingdom yarn than one of the days of seventy-odd years ago. And as for William Boyd, with his well-shaved face and American haircut, he hardly, impresses one as being either an attaché or a person of bygone days. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Lupe Velez Again. The Roar of a City. Who Strangled the Dancer?"},{"year":"1935","title":"THE first grueling rehearsal of \\"The Broken Wing\\" was drawing to a close. As the final words of the play re-echoed through the empty studio at Radio City, the director, who had been charting the course from his elevated glass enclosure in the control room, discarded his earphones with the terse comment: \\"That's all for today.\\"   MERRY-GO-ROUND OF THE AIR","excerpt":"Lupe Velez Finds Script Handicaps Style -- Plans of Artists"},{"year":"1930","title":"\\"East Is West.\\" the current attraction at the Globe, is the saga of little Ming Tong and her brave American hero, Billy Benson, who endure many trials at the hands of white slavers and uncomprehending society folk before they are finally united. This screen version of the melodramatic stage play is an intricately plotted and quite implausible affair which runs its tedious length for an hour and twenty minutes.E. G. Robinson appears in his first talker as Charlie Yong, the chop suey \\"king\\" of San Francisco's Chinatown, and provides most of the entertainment with his amusing characterization of an egocentric half-caste. Lupe Velez makes the most of her rôle as Ming Toy, Lewis Ayres does what he can with the part of Billy Benson, which isn't very much, and the minor players are in the main excellent. It is necessary to emphasize these points thus early in a consideration of \\"East Is West\\" because the virtues of the film are limited to the work of the players.The story is trashy fiction of the sort that the paper pulp magazines publish only with reluctance at this late day. A large audience sat through the picture at the Globe yesterday without registering much emotional feeling one way or the other, but there was a visible brightening when little Ming Toy was informed by her rascally father that she was not really Chinese and was therefore eligible to enter fashionable West Coast society as the bride of Billy Benson.The film opens in China and for the first ten minutes holds the interest with a kaleidoscopic impression of native life and manners in the Orient. Then the Love Boat comes into port, Ming Toy is placed on the auction block by her father, and is saved by the sight-seeing young American. A kindly Chinese patriarch, Lo Sang Kee, takes her to San Francisco, where her vivacious conduct gets her in trouble with a water-front missionary society.To save Ming Toy from deportation, Lo Sang Kee sells her to Charlie Yong, but Mr. Benson appears on the scene and kidnaps her. High society is horrified when Mr. Benson, heir to the famous Benson fortunes, announces his intention of taking the young woman to wife. The revelation that she is really white, having been taken from a murdered missionary as a baby, solves the problem but cannot be said to provide a climax.Both Mr. Robinson and Miss Velez liven the rambling narrative with many amusing moments, but their task is a heavy and thankless one. The short subjects are well above the average. Knute Rockne's football film is easily the best item on the program.

But when the girl, little Manette, the daughter of the native smuggler who was shot by the police, comes to disrupt their placid existence in the log cabin, everything in the past is forgotten.While the climax is rather obvious, coming when Burr, the stancher of the two men, discovers that Dave has crossed the deadline set before Manette's room, and then tries to kill him, the lesser moments intending to reveal how both are working toward a final settlement are well presented. The scene in which Dave deprecates Burr's Christmas gift of a music box to the girl by telling her that Burr isn't really playing it is capitally done.The film has particular merit in the natural performances of all three players, William Boyd, as Burr","excerpt":"Lupe Velez, as Manette, and Paul Cavanagh in the rôle of Dave, who finally discovers that the girl doesn't love him and then leaves the other two.Miss Velez here possesses a vivacity typical of the rôles in which she has previously appeared, but it is somehow curbed by the restraint shown by the other players. The Messrs, Boyd and Cavanagh do well by their parts, as do the avalanches of snow, the rushing rapids, the blinding storms and the machine responsible for the wind that sounded so much like a band saw at work.

Nothing about him offers golden opportunities to the good Samaritan. Already in the terminal stages of alcoholism as the film begins, Ben seems to sense his fate and want to face it in his own way, with crazy bravado and a whiff of desperate romance. This small, searing film watches transfixingly as Ben plays out his final hand.         As directed by Mike Figgis, who makes a long overdue return to the sultry intensity of his \\"Internal Affairs\\" and \\"Stormy Monday,\\" \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" has the daring to suspend judgment about Ben's downward spiral. This film simply works as a character study, pitilessly well observed and intimately familiar with its terrain. Mr. Figgis based his screenplay on a novel by John O'Brien, who committed suicide two weeks after learning that his book would be made into  a movie.  Mr. O'Brien's father describes the novel as his son's suicide note, which does not seem a farfetched claim.

Shirer says that it was told to him by a woman in Europe some time after the second World War. But the credit-sheet on the picture goes no further than to state that it was written by Robert Smith and Mort Briskin, two independents, who also produced the film.This sounds a little more like it, for the cock-and-bull story that unfolds smacks of nothing more firmly reliable than the vaporing of a script-writer's brain. And, as a piece of free-flight romancing, it ranks somewhere between \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" and \\"Hitler—the Beast of Berlin.\\"Simply, it is the story of a European vaudeville star who uses his talent for impersonations to overthrow Hitler and the Third Reich. Cast in prison by the all-powerful Fuehrer for objecting to the theft of his wife, this fellow first finagles his freedom by Impersonating the warden of the jail. Then, in another imitation, he gets a job as Hitler's valet and grabs the first chance to kill the master and quick-change himself into the role. And thus, unbeknownst to everybody, he fills the dead Hitler's shoes, countermands all the the plans of the generals and causes Germany to lose the war.More than the story is fantastic. The way that it is played, under Frank Tuttle's unrestrained direction, is beyond fairly rational belief. Luther Adler, who portrays both the actor and the unlamented boss of the Third Reich, throws himself into this nonsense with the affected seriousness of a small-time vaudeville \\"ham,\\" and Peter Preses, who plays the prison warden—which is the next most important role—gives out with such snorting and sneering that you'd think he had jumped out of a melodrama of the first World War. Production of this film in Vienna is apparent only to the extent that the scenery looks fairly authentic and the actors work desperately hard.Says Mr. Shirer, in conclusion, \\"an amazing story, almost beyond belief—and yet it is difficult not to believe it.\\" That's what you think, Mr. S.!

And, while this case history of a psychopath-killer, which arrived at the Globe on Saturday, is morbid and only in a special sense an entertainment, it is taut and often exciting melodrama abetted by professional performances, direction and, strangely enough, an engrossing albeit twice-told tale.Credit Norman Reilly Raine, Leo Katcher and Waldo Salt, the scenarists, with adhering, in the main, to the script fashioned originally by Fritz Lang and Thea von Harbou. For the original sound and, later, dubbed versions of \\"M,\\" while exemplary in the field, did not have the widest circulation here. Thus, the present edition is not spinning an overly familiar yarn in recounting the search by the police for a murderer of little girls who, the script points out, does not violate his victims but merely kills and then makes off with their shoes.Since the police, who are harried both by the municipal powers and an aroused and frightened public, round up all known criminals, the underworld, anxious to protect its interests, also begins seeking the man who unwittingly stymied their activities. And this dual chase is brought to a fitting climax, as the deranged culprit, trapped and pleading his case before his criminal \\"jurors,\\" is apprehended by the police.Although the scenario is succinct in divulging psychopathic details of the principal's horrible mania, David Wayne gives stature to a sordid assignment. Unlike Peter Lorre, who, in creating the role, made the killer a wide-eyed, obsessed man, Wayne is a quieter but equally tortured sick man, whose climactic scene explains his crimes hysterically but soundly. In portraying what one of the film's phychiatrists terms a \\"schizophrenia with paranoic tendencies,\\" Wayne exposes a new page in an acting record which thus far has included musicals and light comedy roles.Howard da Silva, as the badgered homicide bureau chief: Martin Gabel, as the ruthless and efficient gang czar who organizes his motley minions with all the aplomb of a field marshal","excerpt":"Luther Adler, as his lawyer, a man fallen on drink and evil days; John Miljan, as the blind man who \\"fingers\\" the suspect and various subordinates such as gangsters Raymond Burr and Glenn Anders; detective Steve Brodie; Karen Morley, as the mother of one of the victims, and Janine Perreau, who narrowly escapes being another, contribute competently to a harrowing adventure.Harrowing, it should be stressed, is the word for \\"M,\\" For, despite the comforting knowledge that the identity of the slayer is known throughout the proceedings and that he will be captured eventually, \\"M\\" is strictly adult fare which may even terrorize impressionable parents.

Cool and attractive aspic-coated meat and fish dishes are ideal for elegant summer entertaining, but many home cooks tend to shy away from them, suspecting that they are overly complicated and require a lot of fussing. The truth is that they are not so difficult to make as they look. And, like many cold dishes, they can be assembled a day in advance and pulled out of the refrigerator when guests arrive. Though fresh and light, they are not so insubstantial that the guests will head for the first hamburger hut when they leave.   The cold dishes described here, which were devised with Pierre Franey, all use a simplified aspic made with stock thickened with gelatin, since the preparation of regular aspic, using pigs' or veal knuckle, is the trickiest and most time-consuming part of an aspic- coated dish. Fortunately, a poultry or fish stock thickened with unflavored gelatin does just fine.

Licensing is already such an enormously pervasive practice that you might wonder what new constituency it could possibly reach. An answer to that question appeared not long ago on the cover of the trade magazine Brandweek, in the form of a photograph of a dog wearing a SpongeBob SquarePants sweater.

Not any longer","excerpt":"luxury high-rises are popping up all around us.     Our prewar, low-ceiling, ground-level apartment faces a schoolyard to the north. A bay window in the living room catches some feeble morning rays from the northeast, enough to sustain a few shade plants. For eight years, we tried to find a plant that could survive in the northwest-facing window.    Even with a green thumb, the best I could do was a small ivy that sulked for two years. And then, magically, the scraggly plant began to sprout new leaves and branches. I couldn't figure out why, until one day I was sitting on the couch reading at about 3:30 in the afternoon, and the sun was in my eyes. For a while I continued to read, bobbing and weaving my head to find a comfortable angle. When it finally sank in that the glare wasn't going away, I went to the window.     Lo and behold, the high-rise tower that had sprung up a block north was reflecting the sun's glorious afternoon rays into our humble one-bedroom, an unexpected benefit of gentrification.   Jock Grundy and Donna Ng    Dear Diary,    I was born in New York and my family moved to Florida when I was about 5. Over the years (I'm in my late 40's now), there have been many trips to visit family in Queens.     My Aunt Pat drove a Checker -- not a cab, but a black version of the old venerable yellow Checker cab. During one visit, we (Aunt Pat, Mom, Grandmother, my sister, two cousins and I) piled into the Checker for a visit to the Museum of Natural History. As Aunt Pat made a left onto a one-way side street in Manhattan, we were promptly sandwiched between a moving van in front and a garbage truck behind us.     My very ladylike aunt opened the window and shouted to the truck driver (very politely), asking him to move it so we could get by. The burly guy sauntered over and gestured at her that there was plenty of room for her to get by and she should move it!     The arguing went on for a few minutes, as more traffic piled in behind us with horns blaring, when Aunt Pat announced that she wasn't going to take a chance of scratching her beloved Checker, but that if it could be done, then he should show her. With that, she got out of the car, the truck driver got in and mumbled hellos. He then moved the Checker back and forth, left to right, up on the curb, clearing the large truck by about a half-inch. After a few minutes, we were free of the jam.     The truck driver got out, tipped his hat to my aunt (who conceded defeat very graciously) and we proceeded on to the museum for a great afternoon.   Diane McBride    Dear Diary:    Traveling from California to the East Coast with my two young children was a challenge. I was particularly nervous about how I would negotiate my trip to the Upper West Side to visit my elderly Aunt Gert. Getting to and from the train station would be difficult with my charges, our stroller and all of our luggage.    We made it to our hotel thanks to avoiding most stairwells and with the help of some kind strangers. My sister, Sarah, was also visiting New York and volunteered to help us get back to Grand Central Terminal to leave.    Arriving there, we began our trek to the tracks, stopping every so often to see how to avoid the staircases. After descending several ramps, we found our train, only to discover a long flight of stairs down to the platform. Sarah and I looked at each other, sighed and immediately began a heated discussion about how to get everyone and everything to the bottom.    As our discussion intensified, a businessman behind us asked to get by, picked up one of our suitcases, took it down the stairs and quickly boarded the train. Another man did the same with our next two bags. Two fellows picked up either end of the stroller with my 9-month-old in it, gently descended and placed it at the foot of the stairs.    My sister and I stared at each other dumbfounded as our heap of burdensome baggage at the top of the stairs was quickly transformed into a wonderful New York story at the bottom.

Endowed with a cast in the best of spirits, a merry script and a director with a nice sense of pace, the picture deserves inclusion on the list of \\"required courses\\" in any entertainment seeker's curriculum.Based on the story, \\"Bagdad on the Hudson,\\" by Ward Morehouse and Jean Dalrymple (Mrs. Morehouse), \\"It Happened in New York\\" presents the case of Vania Nardi, idol of approximately 10,000,000 movie-goers, who comes to New York to get \\"away from it all\\" and especially from men with brilliantined hair. Here she encounters a taxi driver who calls her \\"Toots\\" and forthwith finds herself in the state which, in an operetta, would require that she burst into some equivalent of \\"Ah, sweet mystery of life, at last I've found you.\\"Before exploring further into the high-road low-road romance between the $5,000-a-week glamour lady and the taxi-driving Romeo who needs $200 to buy into a garage and thereby cinch his marriage with a certain young phone girl. it might be well to back-track a little over the story.Miss Nardi, one discovers at the ??? has been so thoughtless as to permit her press agent to accompany her on her quest for seclusion. Which is very much like trying to tiptoe across a tin roof in wooden shoes. Her public relations counsel arranges receptions, plants stones about a romance between the star and an oily Prince Devorak, heralds their attendance at the première of Miss Nardi's newest colossal picture and, for good measure, drops the word that she will be wearing the famous $100,000 Nardi diamond.All this goes agley when the brash cab driver says \\"Okay, Toots!\\" Miss Nardi hires him to accompany her to the première, much to the chagrin of a band of jewel thieves, who were out for the Nardi jewels, and to that of the cab driver's phone girl. Complications are as plentiful as tax collectors in the Spring, but every one—including the press agent—is triumphant at the end.Gertrude Michael gives an excellent performance as Nardi","excerpt":"Lyle Talbot long chained by Warners to unimportant rôles, demonstrates that he has unsuspected talent for comedy as the cab driver; Hugh O'Connell, as the press agent, is vastly amusing and not so much a caricature of the tribe as an outsider might suspect, and Heather Angel fits neatly into the farce as the wrong number specialist.

American voters made that clear on Nov. 2, by substantially strengthening the Democrats' control of the House of Representatives and of state governments, and narrowing Republican control of the Senate.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. compiled and edited from several kinds of documentary footage by Ely Landau, is scheduled to play tonight only at many theaters throughout the country, including more than 50 in the boroughs of New York City. A longer version of the film will eventually be available for purposes of study, but for most moviegoers the theatrical version, which runs for almost three hours, may well seem long enough.In fact it is too long, exactly to the extent that it includes a number of cameo guest appearances by such stars as Paul Newman, Burt Lancaster, James Earl Jones and others who mostly look at the camera and very sincerely recite verse. But the rest of \\"King,\\" except for a few relevant national-affairs stock shots (Vietnam","excerpt":"Lyndon Johnson's Civil Rights bill), sticks close to its subject, and for its pains achieves a density and shapeliness that is rare in any movie—let alone a documentary committed to the sequence of actual events.Those events begin with the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, when Dr. King was 27 years old, and they end shortly after his murder in Memphis, in April, 1968. Between, come the confrontations in Birmingham, the 1963 March on Washington, the three Selma voter-registration marches, the housing protests in Chicago, and finally the Memphis sanitation men's strike, which led to Dr. King's death. Even from this short distance, it is good to be reminded of recent history, and what that history, as it generates pride or even mere dramatic urgency, owes to black men in America.Although it makes some attempt to distinguish Dr. King and his nonviolence from the black militants who came after him, and although the distinction is accurate, the film strongly suggests the continuity of Dr. King and his successors in a drive toward a viable group identity. Dr. King's strategies, seen here in rich and spacious detail, seem to have been designed less for winning civil rights as such than for the use of civil rights as a means to human dignity. In Dr. King's platform and pulpit manner (of which there is a good deal) that bid follows a traditional Christian rhetoric for which religious belief and self-dramatization go hand in hand. The manner seems flamboyant, and a little old-fashioned. But it was a real form of communication, and for a while it worked.When it begins not to work, after the fire hoses of Birmingham have been replaced by the lawn sprinklers of Chicago, it strains toward a sense of fulfillment (with many quotations from \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\") that really does seem hollow. The film catches this shift with great precision and insight, just as it faithfully records only only bitter victories (for example, the Birmingham jail) but also victorious-seeming defeats (for example, the descent of the celebrities for the end of the third Selma march: a Nichols and May comedy routine, Harry Belafonte singing about the girl in Kingston Town.)But the truth of \\"King\\" is ultimately a ceremonial truth, of symbolic gestures, crowds, surging response. I know nothing to compare it with except Leni Riefenstahl's magnificent \\"Triumph of the Will\\"—not, of course, in tone or content, but rather in its comprehension of history as drama.

That rather elaborately contrived epigram does not have the brevity or the wit of Oscar Wilde, but you might be fooled into thinking it did by the droll delivery of Lynn Redgrave. In the new Broadway revival of W. Somerset Maugham's comedy ''The Constant Wife,'' Ms. Redgrave, above, plays Mrs. Culver, a plumply upholstered British matron who is called upon, by herself primarily, to interfere in the messy marital affairs of her daughter, who has a straying husband and some bold ideas about how best to deal with him. With her high regard for propriety and her tendency to speak in aphorisms, Mrs. Culver is a distant relation of the imperious Lady Bracknell, from Wilde's ''Importance of Being Earnest.'' As it happens, Ms. Redgrave will undertake that role next season in Los Angeles. Her delightful Mrs. Culver can be considered a most promising sneak preview.

This one-woman show is a revealing and often rueful account of life without father in a stagestruck family.   During Ms. Redgrave's childhood, her parents were often absent, away on tour or, in the case of her father, at home working obsessively on his next role. The paternal slights were many, beginning with the fact that Redgrave failed to mention Lynn's birth in his journal. More attention was paid to her outgoing older siblings Vanessa and Corin.

But the film is also a vivid demonstration that a period piece powerfully peppered with quaintness, archness and a seeming lack of dialectics or propaganda does not necessarily make a truly funny farce.Mosfilm's producers are not implying that villagers in Old Russia were simply a doltish, myth-ridden lot who could have used the enlightenment of the new order. Except for an occasional beggar, the citizenry here appear to be as carefree as the peasantry in Graustark. But it is a feeble fable too obviously coy and labored that they are projecting. \\"The Marriage of Balzaminov\\" is harmless fiction, and it has little impact on the heart or the mind.A theatergoer may be vaguely reminded of \\"Fiddler on the Roof\\" during the course of this film since we are here involved with Balzaminov, a lowly clerk who is constantly being directed by a termagant of a match-maker. Seems that our hero finds mental surcease in dreaming great dreams of being a general or being married to a rich woman. He doesn't like his mean estate but, an introspective, timorous chump, he is a slave to his mother and the aforementioned matchmaker.Suffice it to say that our cloddish climber doesn't make it with a prospective heiress, or a kittenish, well-heeled rural type or any other candidate. They can't be blamed since he's hardly a bargain. But fantasies can come true, and they do for our boy when he manages to team up climactically with a monumental rich widow.The plotting, even with adequate English subtitles, is often confusing, but Konstantin Voinov, who adapted and directed the story, has kept his cast moving at a crisp tempo. His sets bring alive, with a Chagall-like flair, the droshky-filled streets of a Czarist town of a century ago. And the tinkly, melodic piano score in a fitting musical background to his tongue-in-cheek tall tale.While his principals are as energetic as kazatzka dancers, they give their roles the broadest of interpretations, readings that are more fitting to the stage than the screen. Georgi Vitsin, as the oafish Balzaminov, may be properly foolish and scared, but his portrayal is too blatantly exaggerated. Lydia Smirnova, as the vodka-bibbing, talkative matchmaker","excerpt":"Lyudmila Shagalova, as his anxious mother; Zhanna Prokhorenko, as their outspoken maid; Roland Bykov, as a designing officer who uses our hapless hero; Nonna Mordyukova, as the bored but desirous widow, and Nadezhda Rumantseva, as a flirt who kids him, are among those chipping in with equally uninhibited characterizations.Balzaminov may be charming and far removed from the lower depths when he sighs, \\"I'm the most unhappy creature on earth.\\" Unfortunately, neither he nor his free-wheeling caperers are ever charming enough.
