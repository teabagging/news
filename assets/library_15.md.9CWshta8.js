To his first objection I reply that novelists who are priests and sociologists in fact do such things.

One can, for example, use correlational analysis to probe responses to questions the respondent does not realize are being asked. Thus, half of the new readers of my books say that they ''can hardly wait for the next book.'' We did not ask why this holy (and thoroughly admirable, from my viewpoint) impatience. But multiple regression analysis shows that the difference between the enthusiasts and the nonenthusiasts is that the former perceive the stories as forcing them to face important religious questions, and as explaining to them the relationship between religion and sex, while the latter do not.

Hill & Wang, $25. \\n\\nIn 14 years of environmental reporting at The New York Times, Philip Shabecoff saw American environmentalism rise and fall and rise again. He met colorful characters from James Watt, Ronald Reagan's fundamentalist Interior Secretary, to David Brower, the grand curmudgeon who brought the Sierra Club to political life. On his beat the world reached an agreement to save the ozone layer and the Audubon Society fought about keeping the egret as its symbol.\\n\\nRecognizing how crucial the experience of the American land has been in shaping American environmental thought, Mr. Shabecoff begins his book with an east-to-west eagle flight over the continent as it would have appeared at the time of Columbus 500 years ago: occupied by natives, but virgin to a European eye, and blessed with passenger pigeons, buffalo, pristine waters and unbelievable riches in timber, minerals and soil.\\n\\nThe story continues through the Lewis and Clark expedition, through Daniel Boone, John James Aububon, Emerson, Thoreau and George Perkins Marsh in Woodstock, Vt., setting down in the 1860's the first principles of sustainable resource management. There is the strange association of President Theodore Roosevelt with Gifford Pinchot, the forester, and John Muir, the mountain man, whose interacting passions produced the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the preservation of Yosemite Valley as a national park and the flooding of Hetch Hetchy Valley, Yosemite's twin, to provide water and power for San Francisco. Already the battle between development and preservation was joined.\\n\\nThere is a parade of personalities: Rachel Carson, William O. Douglas, Lois Gibbs, the embattled housewife of Love Canal, and Aldo Leopold, the ecologist and game manager who appears to be one of the few people able to embrace both sides of the use-it-conserve-it dilemma. Mr. Leopold gave Mr. Shabecoff his title, in a passage that describes his own ecological conversion. \\n\\nSome years ago Mr. Leopold and some friends had found a mother wolf with her cubs and had shot them. \\"We reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce, green fire dying in her eyes,\\" Mr. Leopold recalled in his book \\"Sand County Almanac.\\" \\"I realized then, and have known ever since, that there was something new to me in those eyes -- something known only to her and to the mountain. I was young then, and full of trigger-itch. I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, no wolves would mean a hunters' paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view.\\"\\n\\nMr. Shabecoff throws in this quote without connecting it to his title, but his position is not that the fierce, green fire of American environmentalism is dying. Rather, he sees it surging up and down in waves, three so far: first, the Roosevelt-Pinchot conservation movement of the early 1900's","excerpt":"second, the burst of landmark environmental legislation around the time of the first Earth Day in 1970, and third, the professionalism and pragmatism of the present.\\n\\nHis last chapter offers advice for the fourth wave. Get political, Mr. Shabecoff says. We have green publications, green technology, green products. Now we need green politics.\\n\\n\\"To make the political breakthroughs necessary to achieve their goals,\\" Mr. Shabecoff writes, \\"the environmentalists \\n\\nmust \\n\\nmake common cause with other sectors of our society that have a stake in changing the political and economic status quo.\\" That alliance is natural, he points out, when you look to see who gains from polluting, and who gets polluted. He makes the interesting observation that \\"the Black Caucus . . . has the best voting record, year in and year out, on environmental issues of any interest group in Congress.\\"\\n\\nIt's too bad that Mr. Shabecoff's courageous advice comes at the end of his book, not at the beginning, and that the early parts of the book are written in a plodding style that may not carry readers through to the end. Mr. Shabecoff admits that he is a journalist, not a historian. Until he gets to history that he himself witnessed, he does not make his story come alive. It's as if he were working through a list of names and ideas that need to be mentioned, describing each one dutifully, but rushing to get to the good stuff: the Reagan Administration and Anne Gorsuch Burford, the Bush promise and disappointment. He doesn't even tick off the history list in chronological order, so one can get confused about whether Barry Commoner might have been influenced by Rachel Carson or vice versa.\\n\\nThere is one more problem with this book, one that might have arisen from 14 years of environmental reporting under constant pressure to be objective. Mr. Shabecoff lets his bias loose in this book. Too loose. There are too many preachy sentences about \\"the urbanized, overcivilized materialism that is engulfing late 20th-century America\\" and about human beings having \\"for the first time . . . the ability to make the world uninhabitable for their own species.\\"\\n\\nIt would have been better to tell the story of the settlement and degradation of a glorious continent, of political corruption and senseless waste of resources and of the eloquent voices raised against that folly, and to let readers come to their own conclusions.

The Cabinet in Tokyo had approved a proposal to encourage every family to have five children so that Japan's population, then 67 million, would reach 100 million by 1960.    Four objectives were announced: \\"First, to maintain a perpetual increase","excerpt":"second, to outrival other nations in the rate of increase and quality; third, to supply the military and industrial manpower required by the state; fourth, to distribute the population properly to maintain Japan's leadership in Asia.\\"   One official said that a large number of tanks and planes would serve no useful purpose unless there were enough men to operate them. Consequently, the Japanese people were called upon to abandon their \\"individualistic tendency to avoid pregnancy and enjoy their own lives only.\\"   This brought editorial comment from you in \\"Empire in Wonderland\\" on Jan. 24, 1941. The gist was that Japan had been taking territory away from its weaker neighbors since the turn of the century, while explaining to critics that it needed room for its growing population. In 1941, however, the Government began pushing the idea of five children to a family because it insisted that more Japanese were needed to occupy and administer the conquered territories. \\"Perhaps one of these explanations is valid,\\" you wrote. \\"And perhaps the author of 'Alice in Wonderland,' if he were still alive, would be able to get the Mad Hatter to fit them together.\\"   Extraordinary changes have occurred in Japan since 1945, but the old way of thinking bubbles up occasionally. In 1941, women who did not like the Cabinet's cannon-fodder plan would have put themselves, their families and perhaps even their friends in danger if they had publicly voiced opposition. Today, Japanese women can express their anger openly, even if they are still fighting to achieve equality in their male-dominated society.   The Japanese Government appears to be harking back to the \\"breed and multiply\\" ideas of half a century ago to counter the declining birthrate. You note that one rural prefecture has begun an Operation Stork campaign to urge young couples to add \\"a brother (or sister)\\" to the \\"only child\\" they already have. This represents progress of sorts; in 1941, a sister would not have been mentioned, even parenthetically. Japanese fathers, to say nothing of the Army and Navy, wanted sons.   A more hopeful sign is that some Japanese -- especially women -- are incensed by the idea of being offered monetary rewards to enlarge their families. They are painfully aware of the very poor life they lead in a country that is perceived abroad as rich. We should applaud the women of Japan who are rejecting the Government's approach. The problems posed by a plummeting birthrate are serious indeed, but surely the authorities in Tokyo can think of better ways to respond than the attempt to lure Japanese women into becoming coin-operated, baby-vending machines.

After all, it is a problem which, it is said, is driving the members of many households mad. As the comic misadventures of a cantankerous British literary giant with an inordinate passion for good dishes, on a good-will cementing visit, \\"My Kingdom for a Cook\\" is much shorter on laughs than a respectable comedy should be. The new visitor to Loew's State shows signs of having been hurried through the Columbia workshop with more thought to capitalizing on Charles Coburn's newly won laurels as an amusing old codger than was accorded to the preparation of the script.That is regrettable on two counts: firstly, a lot of people will be disappointed in Mr. Coburn's initial solo starring effort","excerpt":"secondly, \\"My Kingdom for a Cook\\" could have been a first-rate comic excursion if a sharper edge had been given to its lines and situations. But within the limitations imposed by the authors, Mr. Coburn is fairly amusing as a gruff, befuddled and misunderstood cultural ambassador from the Court of St. James, who would go to any lengths to snare a culinary artist.The ladies of the small New England town to which he flees after some amusing experiences in New York willingly put up with his eccentricities until he brazenly shows his gratitude to the town's first lady by coaxing her cook of eighteen years to come into his employ. That causes international complications and gets him into several local scrapes of more or less funny nature‚Äîall of which is punctuated by a vapid romance between the author's daughter and a handsome young American eagle. As the girl, Marguerite Chapman is cause enough for better Anglo-American relations.

The landscape photography, by Farzad Jodat, is fully up to the high standards of the Iranian cinema, and there is always something pleasant to look at in the film.

Last summer, I planted six sprouted avocado pits in a giant pot. In mid-September, I moved them to a west-facing window with filtered light. The plants are quite tall and making new leaves, but lots of old leaves are withering and falling off. I've tried letting the soil dry out, then watering well. I am not fertilizing and see no evidence of infestation. What's going on?    A.  Avocados are not sardines, though they will be similarly slender if you pack them in tight quarters. Each seedling was born with dreams of growing 30 to 50 feet, and each will harbor those hopes after it lives alone, which is why avocados need plenty of root room. If you want six plants, give each a pot (medium size is fine for now). If one will do, cut the others off at the soil line.    Avocados need bright light and consistently moist soil, even in winter. They need moist air, too, and plenty of fertilizer. Feed them every other week, spring through fall, then once a month in the winter. Every six months or so, flood the plant with water to wash out damaging salts left behind by the fertilizer.    For a bushy plant, cut the seedling back by almost half when it is a foot tall. Taller plants should be cut right above a closely placed pair of leaves with growth buds in the axils.    Avocados are obliging houseplants, able (some would say determined) to survive almost anything. But to flower and fruit they need far more light than windows provide.    Ivy Variations    Q.  I would like to plant variegated ivy in my garden, but can't find any in nurseries around southeastern Michigan. Where can I buy some?    A.  There are dozens of variegated ivies, but most are tender examples of the English kind (Hedera helix), and are more likely to be sold as houseplants than garden material.     You could try the slightly tougher Persian version, Hedera colchica Dentata Variegata, which some optimistic sources rate hardy to zone 5. And there is an unusually hardy Helix called Harrison, which has white veins, if that's variegated enough for you. Alternatively, you could plant some tender dazzlers outdoors, take cuttings in the fall and start next year's ivy inside.    Some sources for ivy include Hedera Etc., P. O. Box 461, Lionville, Pa., 19353, (610) 970-9175","excerpt":"Secret Garden Rare Plants, (850) 482-6034, www.secretgardenrareplants.com; or Squaw Mountain Gardens, www.squawmountaingardens.com, (503) 630-5458    Managing Spare Bulbs    Q.  I still have some unplanted ''little'' bulbs: iris reticulata, grape hyacinth and scilla. We often have a thaw in February. Can they go in the ground then? Or is it better to put them in the freezer and plant them next spring?    A.  Spring bulbs make roots in fall, when there is no top growth to support and the soil is moist and cool. This takes about three months and is essential to survival. Freezing rootless bulbs usually kills them.    You could pot the bulbs right now, keep them where it is cool but not freezing (the refrigerator or basement) and plant them out in May. Or you could gamble on having a thaw soon.     If you plant by Valentine's Day, and winter starts waning soon after, they should be able to make enough roots to pull through, though they may not bloom well this year.

Co-workers in a strip club, the women become friends and roommates, as Natalie initiates the conservative, uncertain Sandrine into the pleasures of unbridled female sexuality.  But pleasure also becomes business, as the two young women resolve to use their sexual powers to conquer the male-dominated business world, embodied by a private bank where Sandrine gets a job as a secretary and begins seducing her way to the top. Mr. Brisseau may pay lip service to post-feminist ideas of female empowerment through seduction, though his actual concerns seem to be less intellectual than frankly carnal.  As the two friends compete to see who will be the first to conquer and tame the elusive Christophe (a Sadean libertine in his own right), Mr. Brisseau stages some rousingly voyeuristic sex scenes that, while they stop short of hardcore pornography, feature combinations seldom seen outside the oeuvre of Jenna Jameson.

The visitor is John Shooter (John Turturro), who drawls menacingly, &quot;You stole my book.&quot; Sleepy and astounded, Mort gets the evidence shoved into his life.  Shooter's short story reads exactly like Mort's best-selling murder mystery, &quot;Secret Window.&quot; What's worse, Shooter gives Mort three days to set things right, or else. What little intrigue the movie has comes from Mort's shattered self-esteem; he asks himself if he really was capable of stealing Shooter's story vowel for vowel.

He was the big kid on the block last year when he spreadeagled the 2&#8208;year&#8208;old division and he has continued to grow and fill out. At 3 he is a strapping dude, magnificently muscled, giving a sense of controlled power even in repose. He is very well behaved, said Lucien Laurin, &#8220;and a lot of that is the man who takes care of him. Patience, kindness, understanding&#8212;it all goes into making a good horse. The trainers words were easily laudible to the groom, but Edward Sweat worked on methodically, giving no sign that he heard. Secretariat remained in this stall yesterday while Hialeah distributed $140,800 to lesser colts in the Flamingo Stakes.
