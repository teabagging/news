No road connects the rocky, wooded Kineo Peninsula to the mainland, making the resort area accessible only by boat. \\n\\nLeigh Turner, one of three owners of the Wolfeboro Inn who are buying the resort from the TM Corporation of Skowhegan, said they would invest more than $1 million to revive its existing buildings. \\n\\nLocal historians say that Henry David Thoreau and John Greenleaf Whittier stayed at Kineo when it was still just a hunting and fishing camp.\\n\\nBy the late 1880's it had evolved into a six-story hotel that accommodated 400 guests and their servants and provided them with ticker tapes, golf courses, hunting guides, orchestras and elegant cuisine. It had its own beaches and marinas on Maine's largest lake, its own herb and vegetable garden and its own sawmill for building material.\\n\\n\\"People would take the train to Rockwood and then board one of three steamers to make the one-mile sail from Rockwood to Kineo,\\" recalled 77-year-old Hubert Templeton of Greenville, who worked with his father as a hunting guide there. Business declined as people began going farther afield for their vacations, Mr. Templeton said, and the stock market crash finished the resort off by the 30's. \\n\\nIn 1938, the main building burned down","excerpt":"several attempts to reopen the resort failed.\\n\\nThe TM Corporation developed about 20 house lots around the former golf course but built no roads to the site, which is hemmed in by Mount Kineo and timberland owned by Scott Paper. \\n\\nMr. Turner said he and his partners would buy the property and the two surviving buildings -- both once residences for staff members -- and convert the resort into an upscale, year-round operation with motel rooms and suites that would rent for up to $200 a night, including meals. Among the planned amenities are skeet shooting, indoor swimming pools and cross-country ski trails.\\n\\n\\"The area needs extensive rehabilitation in excess of $1 million,\\" Mr. Turner said. \\"If we can attain the necessary state permits in time we hope to open the facility next July 4.\\" Mr. Turner also rehabilitated the Wolfeboro Inn, built about 1812 at Lake Winnipesaukee, after he bought it in 1987.\\n\\nRecently, the state bought Mount Kineo to protect it from development.

Today history seems to be repeating itself with a second period of vivid and elaborate decorative wall painting. While the white wall that typified modern interiors was challenged several years ago by soft post-modern colors and painted details, even post-modern interiors pale in comparison to these newer rooms, some of them like painted Cineramas - total, wraparound visual environments.   The scale and scope of such decorative painting go well beyond the trompe l'oeil moldings, faux wood-grain cupboards and marbleized baseboards that have long occupied a place in the repertory of interior decorators. Many examples of the new decorative painting are reinterpretations of old styles such as Victorian flower patterns and Pompeian murals, and they are often done in old techniques such as stenciling and fresco. Some, however, are new stylistic inventions and are abstract rather than figurative. The ranks of designers doing these kinds of rooms have been joined by artists such as David Novros and Cynthia Carlson of New York, who have done large murals and rooms of murals for houses. Decorative painting is also being used in public places","excerpt":"several large wall paintings by three New York artists, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kenny Scharf and Francesco Clemente, are an important part of the striking decor at the newly opened Palladium in Manhattan.

With five New York solo shows to his credit and exposure in territories as remote from one another as Europe and Japan, California and the Bronx, Basquiat's success is as close to overnight as can be in the visual arts. His ascent is not without a touch of radical chic either, since technically he started out as a graffitist called Samo. But he is different from the defacers who, over the last decade, have moved from exhibitionism in the subways to exhibitions in galleries. Not only is his work unquestionably art, but also his outdoor production, said to have been mainly on the walls of SoHo, was meant to attract professional attention. He is reported also to have haunted places frequented by such art notables as Andy Warhol to show them examples of his art.

When Kahlo was 18 years old, her abdomen was pierced by a piece of metal in a trolley accident, causing her to suffer endless pain and many operations until her death in 1954 at the age of 47. She married the painter Diego Rivera twice, and endured endless betrayals by him, including an affair with her sister. She retaliated with love affairs of her own, with both men and women.
