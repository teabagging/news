My mother used to read the Yiddish letters emigrants sent to their parents, and they always wrote about the statue. They said that when they finally saw the statue, their hearts became easy: ''I know nothing bad could happen to me.'' They believed in her like in a kind of goddess. When I finally saw her, I knew she could not physically help me in case of trouble. It was 1935. I was a grown-up man of 30. I know a statue is a statue and nothing helps.

Next to nothing, probably, apart from the fact that he composed ''The Carnival of Animals,'' ''Danse macabre,'' ''Samson et Dalila,'' the ''Organ'' Symphony No. 3 and a bunch of flashy piano concertos.   But there is more - much, much more. Because he wrote his first piece shortly after his third birthday in 1838 and was still composing a year before his death at the age of 86 in 1921, the number of works he racked up during his lifetime is staggering. There were, for example, 12 other operas in addition to ''Samson et Dalila.'' Then, too, he enjoyed a reputation as a piano virtuoso, known especially for his playing of Mozart.

This young Japanese violinist, the recipient of the 1993 Naumburg Award, played Bartok's First Sonata with a cool, rapt, meditative detachment that put the music in an intriguing new light.   It should be noted first that Mr. Okumura is a player of considerable technical fluency and tonal polish. Bach's Sonata in A, first on the program, promised an evening of refined, restrained musicianship","excerpt":"Saint-Saens's First Sonata, with its dazzling 16th-note cascades, added virtuoso glitter at the end.
