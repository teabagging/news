Miers to the Supreme Court.    Behind the News -- Until then, Ms. Miers has her work cut out for her. Committee leaders want her to redo a questionnaire about her legal career. ''Inadequate,'' ''insufficient,'' ''insulting,'' committee members called her answers. Critics say Ms. Miers is not up to the job, and in particular lacks experience on constitutional issues. President Bush, meanwhile, is steadfast. ''Out of this,'' he said Thursday, ''will come a clear picture of a competent, strong, capable woman who shares the same judicial philosophy that I share.''    SPAIN    The News -- A Spanish judge wants to arrest three American soldiers in connection with the killing of a Spanish journalist in Baghdad during the 2003 invasion.    Behind the News -- The judge said the three might have committed a ''crime against the international community'' by firing a tank shell at the Palestine Hotel. In 2003, the Pentagon found that the soldiers' actions were justified and that the soldiers did not know the Palestine was a journalists' hotel. The judge wrote that the Bush administration had ignored Spanish requests for information. Spain's public prosecutor does not agree with the judge that countries can pursue the suspects beyond their borders and has appealed the decision.    BAGHDAD    The News -- The trial of Saddam Hussein began on Wednesday and after three hours was adjourned until the end of next month.    Behind the News -- Mr. Hussein and seven others are charged with the torture and killing of 148 men and teenage boys in 1982, but this trial is just the first of what may be as many as a dozen in the cases of tens of thousands of deaths during Mr. Hussein's decades as dictator.     After refusing to recognize the court and berating the chief judge on the five-judge panel, Mr. Hussein eventually and defiantly pleaded not guilty. The court is run not by the United Nations, as war-crimes trials are, but by the Iraqis with American support. Some representatives of human rights groups observing the trial are critical of that arrangement","excerpt":"more so after a lawyer for one of Mr. Hussein's co-defendants was slain the next day, heightening concerns about security.      The trial began against the backdrop of a vote on the new Iraqi constitution last weekend. The vote count continues, but there appeared to have been high turnout, with an overwhelming majority voting yes to the document. Passage of the constitution is essential for the American-backed political process that the Bush administration is relying on to thwart the Sunni-led insurgency. If the voters approve it, elections for a full-term government are to be held in mid-December.     Mr. Hussein will not be a part of it.    TEXAS    The News -- In answer to an arrest warrant on conspiracy and money-laundering charges, Representative Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, turned himself in to be photographed and fingerprinted on Thursday, and then appeared in Criminal District Court in Austin on Friday, above, for his booking hearing.    Behind the News -- Mr. DeLay has asked for a new judge. The one he appeared before on Friday, Bob Perkins, is a Democrat who has contributed to the liberal organization MoveOn.org, Mr. DeLay's lawyer noted.

Before Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart even took the stage, a wide-screen projection showed a vaguely Cubist animated cartoon of the three musicians vaulting through the air with their instruments. Throughout the set, the backdrop intermittently displayed diverse and surreal images of drum kits suspended over water, geometric computer graphics, children gazing at space ships and flying bird's-eye views of landscapes.    The music itself was not so much a collection of songs as a nonstop technological force. Mr. Peart, the drummer, seldom played anything as simple as a back beat, instead laying down complex, assaultive patterns with frequent time changes. Mr. Lifeson's speedy, baroque guitar solos added the next textural layer, with their counterpoint in Mr. Lee's florid, melodic bass lines. But during numbers like \\"Roll the Bones,\\" the title track from Rush's latest album on Atlantic, most of the music seemed to come from prerecorded backing tapes, anyway.

Back in 1939, a Depression year, I too was a poor kid with only a high school education and no way to learn a trade. I lived in New Jersey, which in those days did not have a state college. Student loans had not been invented. So I enlisted in the Army to learn a trade, and was paid the princely sum of $21 per month plus \\"three squares and a flop.\\"   I certainly didn't join expecting a shooting war, but I was on the first troopship to leave San Francisco for the Pacific after Pearl Harbor, and was in the third wave to land on Makin Atoll in the first beach landing in the central Pacific. I got back three years later from Guam.   I had indeed learned a trade, but now I had a chance to go to college and I took advantage of it. I had spent six years in the Army, and when I got to college I was sitting next to rich young men who had never heard a shot fired in anger. If I had been smart and never enlisted, I would probably still be a high school graduate with limited prospects. Instead, while I never got rich, I got an education enabling me to live respectably and support a family. Does Ms. Siegel's heart bleed for me?

He notes that the idealized images of    ukiyo-e    -- meant to extol the amusements of the quarter and the charms of its highest-ranking prostitutes -- did not show \\"the seamier side of the prostitution industry that is known all too well to have existed from diaries, popular literature and other written sources.\\" Indeed, plate after plate depicts elegant women lounging about waiting for their patrons, reading love letters or strolling to houses of assignation.

Troubled by what she perceived as a tendency toward elitist estheticism in the work of the German Expressionists, Kollwitz used simplified and affecting means to represent the extreme suffering that she witnessed as a resident of Berlin during two world wars. These representations, charged with protest, are particularly directed against the oppression of women. The critical reception of Kollwitz's work has always emphasized its political implications, and in recent years feminist art historians, including Alessandra Comini, the author of one of the essays in KATHE KOLLWITZ (Yale University, $45), have discussed Kollwitz's role as an early voice of feminism. Elizabeth Prelinger suggests in the main essay that the politicizing of Kollwitz has detracted from formal and technical analyses of her work. Arguing that by exaggerating Kollwitz's political commitments and her feminist stance, previous criticism has rendered her something of a symbolic figure, Ms. Prelinger, who teaches fine arts at Georgetown University, attempts to restore the artist's reputation as a practitioner. She also provides a careful and detailed reconstruction of Kollwitz's complex experiments with a range of printmaking methods, and a welcome close reading of the pictorial means she used to frame \\"the rhetoric of her powerful images.\\" IN SHORT: NONFICTION","excerpt":"More Than Her Message"},{"year":"1949","title":"That wonderful Anna Magnani, who has justly established her fame as the most dynamic individual performer in post-war Italian films, proves that comedy, rich and rambunctious, is also within her range in the surprisingly bright Italian picture, \\"Woman Toruble,\\" which opened at the Little Cine Met yesterday.As a highly explosive Roman housewife who insists upon tagging along when her poor unemployed and desperate husband tries secretly to dispose of a stolen car, she shapes a delicious characterization of a loud and capricious Latin dame, given to endless outpouring of harsh chin-music upon her luckless spouse. But she also combines with her coarseness a remarkable warmth and tenderness that softens and greatly enhances the human qualities in this little film.Actually, \\"Woman Trouble\\" is a catchpenny title for it, woefully unworthy of the elements it contains. \\"Molti Sogni Per Le Strade\\" is its Italian tag, which might be freely translated as \\"The Streets Are Full of Dreams.\\" And that is an adequate title, for a gentle and fragile poignancy runs through the salty sidewalk vigor of its comical episodes.Indeed, there is in this little picture about a little man, his wife and little boy a quality of genuine compassion that today is all too rare. It is the sort of irony and pity that conspicuously characterized the old films of Rene Clair and Chaplin—or, more precisely, King Vidor's \\"The Crowd.\\"For here we have more than a series of slapstick blunders by a poor hen-pecked guy who is trying one Sunday morning to turn a few dishonest lira in order to live. Here we have more than his screamingly funny heckling by a Roman street crowd when he tries to sneak off without taking his innocent wife in his stolen car","excerpt":"more than his farcical dilemma when the usually dependable \\"fence\\" with whom he hopes to dispose of the property gets religion at a grandchild's christening.Here we have deep understanding of the plight of the little man, caught between economic pressure and devotion to those whom he loves. And here we have subtly injected into the picture from time to time, a beautiful comprehension of the spirit of innocence in a world of stress. For Piero Tellini, the scriptwriter, has done a masterful job in using within his story—within this wild, comical, potentially corrupt and larcenous \\"chase\\"—the breathless and wide-eyed pleasure of the near-culprit's little boy, dragged along on the ride by his mama and enjoying the sights tremendously.In fact, next to Miss Magnani's brash but warm-hearted playing of the wife, the most affecting thing in the picture is the portrait and performance of the child. In little Anthony Terlo Director Mario Camerini has a tot of irresistible appearance from whom he has magically got some of the most appealing attitudes and gestures that we have seen a child give on the screen. And one shot of the youngster playing along on an open beach is supremely eloquent of the spirit of innocence that elevates this film.Massimo Girotti is also excellent, comically taut yet sad, as the badgered spouse and Checco Durante is ponderously amusing as the repentant \\"fence.\\" Checco Rissone contributes to the comedy as a highly unctuous thief and several other actors play pungent and picturesque bits.

It will be a main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club, it has been sold to publishers in France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands, and last week Avon Books bought the paperback rights in an auction with three other publishers.    \\"You normally wouldn't expect that kind of money in this economy,\\" said Cork Smith, the editor in chief of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.    The novel, Mr. Helprin's first since \\"Winter's Tale\\" in 1983, is the last on his two-book contract with Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. But last year, acting as his own agent, Mr. Helprin signed another contract giving the house world rights to an additional five books: three novels and two collections of stories. The amount of the contract was not disclosed, but Mr. Helprin told Publishers Weekly, \\"I got from H.B.J. an enormous amount of money, but not as enormous an amount as I would have gotten had I waited and jockeyed for each book. But I think it's important to know exactly what you want and when to stop.\\"   Mr. Helprin, an American citizen who served in the Israeli Army, has also fared well as the author of children's books. Two years ago, for example, he and Chris Van Allsburg, the illustrator, shared an advance of $801,000 for a retelling of Swan Lake (published by Houghton Mifflin ). And several months ago they signed a two-book, $1.5 million contract with Penguin U.S.A. for two more children's books.   \\"A Soldier of the Great War,\\" set in Italy, is about an old man, one Alessandro Giuliani, who tells the story of his life to a young, illiterate factory worker. \\"Everybody who has read it said it is one of the most remarkable renderings of World War I,\\" said Carol Lazare, the subsidiary rights director, who conducted the auction.  \\"You're right there in the trenches.\\"   While corporate Harcourt Brace Jovanovich has been having financial problems, its adult trade book division has repeatedly had success publishing writers like Mr. Helprin, Umberto Eco and Alice Walker, literary authors who also have commercial appeal. A 'Zen, etc.' Successor     It has been 16 years since the publication of Robert M. Pirsig's last book, \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,\\" but now Mr. Pirsig has another book ready for the publishers. The book, entitled \\"Lila,\\" is also a philosophical excursion featuring Phaedrus, a \\"ghost\\" from the narrator's past who one night in a bar meets a woman named Lila, who ends up joining him on a sailing voyage.   \\"He's trying to set forth a metaphysics of quality,\\" said Lynn Nesbit, Mr. Pirsig's agent. As to whether the new book is fiction or nonfiction, Ms. Nesbit said, \\"I think he creates his own genre.\\"   \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,\\" the story of a 17-day motorcycle trip from Minnesota to San Francisco by the narrator and his 11-year-old son, has sold 2 million copies. It is still so popular that William Morrow & Company, its hard-cover publisher, has just published \\"Guidebook to 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' \\" by Ronald L. DiSanto and Thomas J. Steele, a collection of essays and other material related to the book.  A Crash Milken Book     After the recent sentencing of Michael Milken, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond king, to 10 years in prison, it's not surprising that the fastest-selling business book at the Waldenbooks store near Wall Street is \\"April Fools: An Insider's Account of the Rise and Collapse of Drexel Burnham\\" ( Donald I. Fine .) The author is Dan G. Stone, a vice president and eight-year employee of Drexel Burnham.   To get the book out before interest in the subject waned, the publisher ordered a crash production schedule.  The contract was signed last March, on the basis of a proposal, and the 85,000-word manuscript was delivered five months later. Last month, less than seven weeks after delivery of the manuscript, the book was on its way to stores.  Garcia Lorca Day     Federico Garcia Lorca lived at Columbia University for eight months in 1929 and 1930. During his stay, he wrote the poems that make up the collection \\"Poet in New York.\\" The poems, filled with helpless children threatened by violence and with death-haunted images, were not published in their entirety until 1940, four years after Garcia Lorca was shot by Franco's soldiers at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Despite their piecemeal appearance, however, the poems helped to insure Garcia Lorca's reputation as a major poet. His plays, especially \\"Blood Wedding,\\" \\"Yerma\\" and \\"The House of Bernarda Alba,\\" all written shortly before his death, have also received critical acclaim.   Mayor David Dinkens of New York declared yesterday Federico Garcia Lorca Day, and the next two weeks will see many public events, from symposiums to exhibits of his manuscripts, at Columbia University, Barnard College and New York University. Garcia Lorca remains one of the most frequently translated poets and playwrights in the world","excerpt":"more than two dozen books by and about him are currently in print.

But Garrett, an inspiring motivator with a preacher's delivery, is pursuing that goal by pushing his players to new limits, demanding more of them, he says, than they have ever been asked to give","excerpt":"more, he fears, than they themselves may be willing or able to give.

There's a quirky little mechanism used in many countries that looks like a bargain and sounds like a bargain and may even be a bargain, if it doesn't prove to be more trouble for you than it's worth.    It's called the Value Added Tax, or V.A.T. This is a kind of national sales tax levied against the increase in price - the ''value added'' - of goods and services at each stage of their production or performance. What's important to American tourists is that (1.) V.A.T. is a concealed component of an item's retail price, and (2.) most countries that have a V.A.T. do not believe shoppers from abroad should pay it. As a result, Americans can often get a refund on the V.A.T. paid on goods purchased abroad.   Unfortunately, getting the refund is not automatic - a sales clerk won't simply slash an item's price - and it is not easy.

Other critics might find women's liberation itself to be a major culprit. Women are positively reeling under the weight of all the new freedoms conferred upon them: the freedom to have a demanding career as well as to raise children, to have sex after two dates with a man, to undergo multiple abortions, to be single mothers.

But even a soft landing, devaluation and indiscriminate budget-deficit reduction may cause more harm than good.   First, as The Economist (July 19) reported, more than half the United States trade deficit comes from trading with non-oil-exporting Latin American and Asian countries whose currency is tied to the dollar ($22 billion), plus oil imports ($55 billion), whose price is also fixed in dollars.
