Ikram Goldman isn't afraid to take chances. She lines the racks of her impossibly chic eponymous store in Chicago with fashion, as opposed to inventory. After four years in business for herself, she cherry-picks from the collections with conviction and has no qualms ordering a $62,000 alligator trench coat by Proenza Schouler or a faux-fur skirt from Undercover, the Tokyo label designed by Jun Takahashi. ''If it's good, someone will buy it,'' she says. Here, she's wearing a top by Junya Watanabe and necklaces from Prova.    2. Like most women of the cloth, Goldman worships at the altar of Azzedine Alaïa. ''He's a king of kings,'' she proclaims. ''Even his shoes are incredible and give you an unbelievably confident walk.'' These $3,910 alligator heels (Goldman's pick for the shoe of the season) ''will be perfect with just about everything, including one of fall's most important looks: the little skirt suit.''    3. She also reveres the New York-based designer Isabel Toledo.  ''I bought my first gown by her -- a black taffeta shirtdress -- in the early 90's, and I still wear it,'' she says. ''Isabel is an extremely elegant woman. Her husband, Ruben, designed all of my mannequins.'' Toledo's hand-painted dress and bolero are $4,255.    4. Goldman wants her shoppers to get a Clu. ''Clu tops are an easy fit,'' she says of her favorite sculptured cotton T-shirts, ''so anyone can wear them, but they also have a lot of style.'' This one is $90.    5. One of her latest obsessions is the London designer Duro Olowu. ''He's one of the few designers who can get me into color,'' she says. ''This empire-waist dress''  -- $1,300 -- ''made from pieced-together vintage fabric is a must-have for fall.''    6. Goldman's customers covet one-of-a-kind bijoux, like this $2,100 rhinestone-and-sea-glass necklace by Tom Binns. ''Tom is truly the most unique and unusual of all jewelry designers.''    7. Her admiration for the New York designer Thakoon is transparent. ''He's a very talented young man,'' she says. ''Very chic, and very 'street,' in a good way.'' This clear plastic-and-lace peacoat is $1,600.    8. Cloud-soft, colorful wraps from Toosh in Italy are the closest things Goldman has found to shahtoosh, the banned microfine fiber. They come in a variety of colors and sizes. This one is $805.    9. Elsa Schiaparelli inspired Yohji Yamamoto's showstopping balloon-sleeved coat embellished with rhinestones, $6,255.  ''It's just unbelievable,'' Goldman says with a sigh.    10. The store owner even lugs things around in high style. Her tote is a $2,100 ''gym bag'' from Chrome Hearts. ''I buy lots of evening bags, but for day, this one is absolutely perfect.''    11. A rock chick at heart, Goldman prefers bands like Led Zeppelin and the Pretenders. Bob Dylan's ''Biograph'' ($48 at www.amazon.com) provided inspiration via iPod during the fall shows.    12. Where to show off all this glamorous gear? Goldman likes to sip an Absolut Mandarin cosmopolitan at the bar at Blackbird, her favorite restaurant.  ''It has the most delicious food and the chicest ambience in all of Chicago.''

If the color is above reproach, so, with one exception, is the picture, as molded by director Aleksander Ford, whose previous \\"Border Street\\" told a worthy, harrowing tale of Nazi occupation. Co-adapted with Kazimierz Kozniewski, whose 1952 novel became a homeland best-seller, the Artkino release opened on Saturday at the Stanley.This depiction of the gradual rehabilitation of five teen-age Warsaw boys shows the same fierce earnestness, the same technical skill and even more structural and dramatic unity than \\"Border Street.\\" Using another excellent cast, and setting and resolving his case histories in a graphic, frankly melodramatic frame, Mr. Ford has provided another solidly respectable, less than distinguished, but perceptive and dynamic import.The story, however, poses one puzzling question, since the protagonists are guided simultaneously by an understanding, court-appointed custodian and what would appear to be a handful of underground Nazi saboteurs. Who are these menaces, anyway? And if they do represent the routed enemy, what is their hold on the youngsters?Nevertheless, on an emotional level, the picture remains credible, moving and suspenseful, as the youths strain toward new-found self-respect and industriousness and desperately try to break with the past and their hounding tormentors. Mr. Ford's staging is restrained, blunt and stinging in turn—as in the stark family vignettes amid the rubble, and one brilliantly conceived dance sequence, in which the leader and a lovely young student profess love.And for pictorial impact, two superbly agile camera men, supplying a vast, panoramic backdrop of reconstructed Warsaw, have joined hands with Mr. Ford for the explosive, churning sewer chase that closes the film on an optimistic note.Tadeusz Janczar, as the rather neurotic leader","excerpt":"Mieczy slaw Stoor, as his husky side-kick; Aleksandra Slaska, as the loyal student; Tadeusz Lomnicki, as the humble \\"guardian,\\" and, indeed, all the others, are excellent.Mr. Ford, keep them coming!

The human appetite for looking at images of the world, the unending horrors, beauties and banalities of that world, and the ever-more sophisticated technology for manipulating images pretty much guarantee that some attention will be paid. Some: the attention span alternately expands and contracts in ''reGeneration: 50 Photographers of Tomorrow'' at the Aperture Gallery in Chelsea. Selected by William A. Ewing, director of the Musée de L'Elysée in Lausanne, Switzerland, and Nathalie Herschdorfer and Jean-Christophe Blaser, who are associate curators there, it surveys the state of photography through the work of 50 students or recent graduates of 63 art schools or university photography departments in the United States, Canada, Europe and, less frequently, elsewhere. Confirming the fail-safe eye candy of large size, color and expert printing, the show suggests that all photography is essentially surreal: beautiful, disturbing, invasive and more or less contrived. The forms of modern architecture continue to fascinate. Digitalization is here to stay whether in portraiture or nearly abstract images.

(Carroll & Graf, $13.) Filled with eccentric characters and fond echoes of Anthony Powell's fiction, this British novel tells of the life and times of a rather passive civil servant, and how the aftershocks of a summer spent as a male nanny in Normandy are felt throughout his adult life. Last year our reviewer, Michael Gorra, admired the tale's ''incidental pleasures'' more than its plot. '' 'Fairness' doesn't succeed at everything it tries,'' he wrote, ''but at moments . . . reading Ferdinand Mount is as much fun as pink gin.''    Moral Freedom: The Search for Virtue in a World of Choice, by Alan Wolfe. (Norton, $14.95.) Using polling results and interviews with people in eight diverse communities, a sociologist examines the nation's moral compass, finding evidence that Americans set high standards of virtue but balk at mandates. ''Approaching people with empathy and respect, Wolfe presents an engaging array of voices,'' Wendy Kaminer wrote here in 2001.    Lightning Field, by Dana Spiotta. (Scribner, $12.) In a first novel that explores the scripted quality of life in Los Angeles, the author employs a symphony of different characters, chief among them a defiant walker in a city of cars who prefers to be ''in-between places'' as she juggles her relationships with her husband and two lovers. ''Spiotta proves herself to be a fierce and nimble satirist,'' Maud Casey said in these pages last year.    Islam: A Short History, by Karen Armstrong. (Modern Library, $10.95.) Part of the Modern Library Chronicles, a new series of short histories aimed at the general reader, this survey of of the ups and downs of Islam, written in an ecumenical spirit, explores the persistent Muslim effort to make their society both just and holy. In 2000, our reviewer, William H. McNeill, found Armstrong's heavy focus on religion a bit narrow, but called her account ''engaging, provocative and often persuasive.'' Another offering from the Modern Library Chronicles is The Renaissance: A Short History, by Paul Johnson ($9.95), an unabashedly old-fashioned overview of Renaissance art and literature. McNeill said Johnson's emphasis on the era's cultural achievements is similarly one-sided in its dismissal of political and religious affairs, but praised the book's ''interesting details and idiosyncratic judgments.''    Inventing Paradise: The Greek Journey, 1937-47, by Edmund Keeley. (Northwestern University, $22.95.) A scholar and translator recounts Henry Miller's adventures in Greece before and during World War II, and his friendships with writers like Lawrence Durrell and the poet George Seferis. Keeley ''fleshes out Miller's impressionistic portrait of place . . . with generous swaths of poetry not only by Seferis but also by others of the renowned Greek 'Generation of the Thirties,' '' David Yezzi said here in 1999.    Funeral Games, by Mary Renault. (Vintage, $14.) Renault (1905-83) won a worldwide audience with her intensely realized fictional chronicles of Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Age. This novel (her final one) completed her trilogy on Alexander, which began with ''Fire From Heaven'' in 1970 and ''The Persian Boy'' in 1972. It is a ''vivid, harrowing and disciplined account of the power struggle after Alexander's death in 323 B.C.,'' Christopher Ricks wrote in the Book Review in 1982. ''Renault deals scrupulously with a world which was monstrously unscrupulous.''    The Return of Felix Nogara, by Pablo Medina. (Karen and Michael Braziller/Persea, $15.) Though it takes place on an imaginary island, this novel by a Cuban &#233","excerpt":"migr&#233; is actually a thinly disguised imagining of life after Castro, as it recounts the orgy of privatization and free-market free-for-alls following the death of the island's aging dictator. The result is a ''delicious, astute, darkly funny'' act ''of literary clairvoyance,'' Bob Shacochis said here in 2000.    The Geometry of Love: Space, Time, Mystery, and Meaning in an Ordinary Church, by Margaret Visser. (North Point/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $14.) A historical anthropologist of daily life charts the structure and nervous system of Sant'Agnese Fuori le Mura (St. Agnes Outside the Walls), a church in Rome, reflecting on the interaction of architecture and prayer through time. Last year our reviewer, Marina Warner, called this ''an ascetic, private, devotional meditation on Christian history, embodied in a church and its bones and stones, which she lovingly numbers.''   Scott Veale   New & Noteworthy Paperbacks"},{"year":"2002","title":"(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)    IGNORANCE, by Milan Kundera. (HarperCollins, $23.95.)

THE PIANO TUNER, by Daniel Mason. (Knopf, $24.) A first novel whose alert, responsive, generous hero is a London piano tuner, selected by the authorities in 1886 to trek into Burma's backest beyond to treat the piano of a (possibly mad) British surgeon and proconsul.    THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW: A Collection of Stories, by A. M. Homes. (HarperCollins, $23.95.) Short stories by an author sometimes accused of the gratuitous grotesque; but the strangeness she deploys is often in perfect balance with the heart of the character who displays it in little tragedies, wild aspirations and surprisingly warm satires of family life.    CHARLES DARWIN. The Power of Place: Volume II of a Biography, by Janet Browne. (Knopf, $37.50.) The second half of a consuming portrait of Darwin and the Victorian habitat that enabled his work but paradoxically rejected its content, though honoring him as Britain's greatest scientist.    PARADISE ALLEY, by Kevin Baker. (HarperCollins, $26.95.) A scary, convincing novel steeped in historical fact and set in the New York City of July 1863, when 119 died in three days of rioting against the draft, chiefly by Irish immigrants who feared losing their jobs to the slaves they were being called on to free.    AGAPE AGAPE, by William Gaddis. (Viking, $23.95.) The first word in the title of this brilliant posthumous not-really-a-novel has three syllables and refers to love in and of the creation; the book is a kind of farewell summa or parting meditation on life, death and the player piano, seen as forerunner of digital computing.    TEACHER: The One Who Made the Difference, by Mark Edmundson. (Random House, $23.95.) A fascinating tribute to a teacher who opened the doors of careful thought to Edmundson in 1969, his last year in high school in Medford, Mass., a working-class city that supplied factory workers and civil servants; instead, it eventually delivered Edmundson into the English professoriate of the University of Virginia.    I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT: The Life of Kate Reddy, Working Mother, by Allison Pearson. (Knopf, $23.) The beleaguered heroine of this novel, a 35-year-old hedge fund manager in London, struggles madly with the world she has made, containing children, husband, work and worry, under high pressure.    HIGH AND MIGHTY: SUVs -- The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way, by Keith Bradsher. (PublicAffairs, $28.) The author, a former Detroit correspondent of The Times, devotes statistics, indignation and a how-things-work comprehension of the internal combustion monster to an argument that the S.U.V. is bad for your health.   And Bear In Mind"},{"year":"2001","title":"ROADS: Driving America's Great Highways, by Larry McMurtry. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $13.) This prolific author (23 novels and counting) cracks open a door on his own life as he crisscrosses the country, ruminating on anything that comes to his eye or mind. The mix includes odd facts, tributes to literary and historical figures and a quizzical look at the books in Hemingway's house in Key West. ''He has a reporter's eye, an affectionate ear for everyday speech and . . . a Dickensian storyteller's facility,'' Timothy Foote wrote here last year. Touchstone has also reissued Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen: Reflections at Sixty and Beyond ($12), a collection of personal essays in which McMurtry recalls his Texas childhood and laments what he sees as his failure to ''subvert'' some grand fallacies about the West. In 1999 our reviewer, Thomas Mallon, called this ''part memoir, part commonplace book, part tour de force.''    A PLACE ON EARTH: (Revision), by Wendell Berry. (Counterpoint, $14.) First published in 1967 and reissued in 1983 in this compressed version, this novel by a renowned poet tells the interwoven stories of a dozen or so people in a rural Kentucky town at the close of World War II. The final result, which displays ''the tenderness one would like to imagine God has as he watches a human community act and interact,'' is ''a masterpiece,'' Noel Perrin wrote here.    MILLIONAIRE: The Philanderer, Gambler, and Duelist Who Invented Modern Finance, by Janet Gleeson. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $13.) John Law was a Scotsman who introduced 18th-century France both to paper currency and to irrational exuberance on a grand scale, through a speculative venture to colonize the Mississippi River basin. Guess what? The bubble burst. The author's ''eye for sensual detail allows her to recreate vividly the opulent world of French Regency society,'' Diana B. Henriques wrote here in 2000.    THE QUESTION OF BRUNO, by Aleksandar Hemon. (Vintage International, $12.) In seven stories and a novella, the author evokes his homeland, Bosnia, and the Yugoslavia that dominated his youth back when the region was a hopeful place, as well as his &#233","excerpt":"migr&#233; life in the United States. Hemon's appetite is ''insatiable and wild,'' Richard Eder said here last year, whether he writes about the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand or a semifictional history of his own family. ''Several of the shorter pieces are so good as to make the reader feel certain of having discovered'' a writer ''who seems not simply gifted but necessary.''    I, FELLINI, by Charlotte Chandler. (Cooper Square, $19.95.) The Federico Fellini who dominates this biography is a conversational performance artist: talkative, beguiling and canny in recounting his life and passions. ''Fellini's storytelling races with the kind of high spirits familiar from his films,'' W. S. Di Piero wrote here in 1995.    ARSLAN, by M. J. Engh. (Orb/Tom Doherty, $14.95.) In this 1976 science fiction tale, a young Asian general conquers the world without firing a shot and sets up headquarters in a small Illinois town, where he begins his reign by publicly raping a girl and boy. Against all odds, the author makes the monstrous Arslan sympathetic and his conquest plausible, Gerald Jonas wrote in the Book Review: ''Engh's performance is as perversely flawless as Arslan's.''    QUITTING THE NAIROBI TRIO, by Jim Knipfel. (Berkley, $13.) The author recounts his six-month confinement in a Minneapolis psychiatric ward after repeated suicide attempts, and his long climb back to relative mental health, depicting the uselessness of psychiatrists and the virtues of self-help. The result ''is a zany lark of a read'' by ''a gifted stylist with a truly original take on things,'' Daphne Merkin wrote here in 2000. Of Two Minds: An Anthropologist Looks at American Psychiatry, by T. M. Luhrmann (Vintage, $14), is a study of how aspiring doctors learn psychiatry and of how mental illness has come to be seen as more a matter of biological dysfunction (best treated by drugs) than the product of psychosocial factors (best treated by psychotherapy). Last year our reviewer, Stephen S. Hall, admired the author's ''cleareyed intellectual analysis'' and ''shrewd, witty observations.''    REAP, by Eric Rickstad. (Penguin, $13.) Set in Vermont's rugged Northeast Kingdom, this first novel tells of a lonely boy who takes up with a crew of dope farmers and scammers, with dangerous repercussions. Though the violence is persuasive, Jennifer Schuessler said here last year, ''most remarkable is the evocation of the territory, the gothic tangle of native forest and exotic cash crop that mirrors the claustrophobic inner landscapes.''

This metaphysical ghost story tells of a newly widowed woman -- a ''body artist'' who is part actress, part mime, part human artwork -- living alone in a large beach house, where she discovers in an unused room a mysterious man with the ability to speak in her voice. In barely more than 100 pages, DeLillo tackles some large themes, like how we structure time and how an artist copes with calamity. Last year our reviewer, Adam Begley, admired the book's ''exquisite beauty,'' calling it an ''intimate affair, quiet, spare and strange -- but not so strange as to distract from the glories of the chiseled prose.''    HOW I CAME INTO MY INHERITANCE: And Other True Stories, by Dorothy Gallagher. (Vintage, $12.) The author's mordant account of her Ukrainian Jewish heritage is also a memoir about her parents' final days and her search for her roots. ''Gallagher's uncompromising presentation of both the beautiful and the abhorrent aspects'' of her relatives' lives ''has a cumulative effect,'' Laura Shaine Cunningham wrote here in 2001. ''Readers who relish the truth -- served straight up, 120 proof -- will be intoxicated.''    BORDER CROSSING, by Pat Barker. (Picador USA, $13.) In this angry novel set in Britain's grim northeast, a charming psychopath returns from prison to haunt the child psychologist who helped send him away 10 years earlier. Last year in these pages, Richard Eder praised the tale's ''exhilarating moral exploration'' and found the writing ''as naked and jolting as an unwrapped live wire.''    ECLIPSE, by John Banville. (Vintage International, $12.) A celebrated actor who is heartlessly detached as a husband and father endures a Dantean punishment when he loses all sense of his off-stage self and holes up in his childhood home to come to grips with his memories and his narcissism. It's a bravura performance with an audience of two, himself and the reader. ''Like Nabokov, Banville captures the vivid aesthetic pleasures of quotidian reality in the most satisfying ways,'' Jim Shepard wrote here in 2001. ''The novel's triumph is to have contrived for us . . . the piercing sadness of having connected to a man who can't connect to anyone.''    BOOK BUSINESS: Publishing Past Present and Future, by Jason Epstein. (Norton, $13.95.) In a collection of essays that began life as a lecture series at the New York Public Library, the founder of Anchor Books (and a cofounder of The New York Review of Books) argues that publishing reached its peak in the 1920's and has been going downhill ever since. ''The reader is swept up by Epstein's fingertip brilliance as he ranges swiftly across the history of publishing, his adventures with authors . . . and his first encounters with the digital future,'' Laurence J. Kirshbaum said here last year.    THE FUNERAL PARTY, by Ludmila Ulitskaya. (Schocken, $11.) Five women, all Russian &#233","excerpt":"migr&#233;s, gather in a Manhattan loft to squabble, grieve and reminisce at the deathbed of a failed painter and accomplished philanderer. In 2001 our reviewer, M. G. Lord, called this a ''riotously funny'' novel ''whose themes of love, loss and identity soar over the boundaries of language and geography.''    FOUNDING BROTHERS: The Revolutionary Generation, by Joseph J. Ellis. (Vintage, $14.) A scholar examines six crucial episodes in the nation's volatile youth, all of them involving a remarkable fraternity of men -- Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Adams, Hamilton, Madison and Burr -- who held together a fragile republic until national habits and customs took root. His Pulitzer Prize-winning account is ''humane, learned, written with flair and radiant with a calm intelligence and wit,'' Benson Bobrick said here in 2000.    AMERICAN TRAGEDY: Kennedy, Johnson, and the Origins of the Vietnam War, by David Kaiser. (Belknap/Harvard University, $18.95.) A professor at the Naval War College traces American military involvement in Southeast Asia from the late 1950's to the dispatch of ground troops in 1965. Kennedy comes out looking good, Eisenhower and Johnson worse. ''Kaiser has worked his way through the archives and emerged with an impressive account of what he terms 'the greatest policy miscalculation in the history of American foreign relations,' '' Gideon Rose wrote here in 2000.    A GRAND DELUSION: America's Descent Into Vietnam, by Robert Mann (Basic Books, $22), tries to transform the story of American intervention and policy making into a grand, sweeping narrative.

Marquand, Twentieth Century-Fox, Peter Lorre & Co., is a person of infinite guile. Not only does this small Japanese detective run down criminals both before and after the commission of vast, international crimes, but sometimes, with unparalleled foresight, not to mention capacity for self-punishment, he will even help them to escape from Devil's Island (to which he has first heroically allowed himself to be committed so as to win their confidence) in order that he may later have the pleasure of thwarting their foul designs in London under the racially and criminologically superior noses of Scotland Yard. The risk is nothing, for well Mr. Moto knows that not even a stray bullet can deprive the world of so valuable a screen commodity.In the long run Mr. Moto's adventures (including \\"Myterious Mr. Moto of Devil's Island,\\" at the Globe) are of the kind that breeds soft tolerance in a reviewer: what is to be gained, after all, from swimming against a trend apparently as well established as the Gulf Stream? Therefore we herewith formally and for all time accept the phenomenon of Mr. Moto, together with his invariably able supporting cast, and the fact that Providence, or its equivalent in Shinto or the Shogunate, has enabled him to be (1) everywhere at once (2) aided by almost supernaturally mysterious allies in all parts of the world (3) unsusceptible to ambush, espionage, riot, hail, tornado or falling aircraft and (4) invincible, when the issue descends to anything so vulgar as physical assault.In the current chapter the Moto formula is not varied except possibly for the fact that it telegraphs Erik Rhodes as the brains of the villainy at somewhat unusual length—about what Western Union would classify as a \\"Day-Letter.\\" Or maybe it is because we feel that anybody who wears such collars would naturally be distrusted at sight.At the Teatro HispanoPerhaps, for the purpose of enabling its patrons to see what progress has been made in film production in Mexico during the last few years, the Teatro Hispano has dug out of the archives \\"Mano a Mano\\" (hand in hand), turned out under the direction of Arcady Boytler shortly after the movies learned to talk Spanish.

Then Mr. Diaz, a personal fitness trainer, went off to make house calls. It was four hours before he returned to retrieve the bike. It wasn't so much the discovery that the bike was gone that startled Mr. Diaz; the really big shock was that the parking meter was gone too.   It occurred to him that he might have the wrong block. The proof that he was on the right spot was a circle of wet cement that covered the hole where the meter had been anchored four hours earlier. But where was the bike? Where was the meter? The police weren't much help. At the station house, Mr. Diaz learned that the police have nothing to do with parking meters, that the city hires contractors for that purpose, that the contractors hire subcontractors and that Mr. Diaz would no doubt have to travel a rocky road before getting his bicycle back.

September    REUNION Friends graduate from high school in 1986: 20 years later, one has been murdered, presumably by someone in the clique. Through flashbacks, each episode illustrates a year in their lives, gradually uncovering the mystery. It's an interesting -- and risky -- structure. Fox, Thursdays at 9 p.m., began last week. (All times are Eastern.)    UNFABULOUS and ZOEY 101 The pair of hit tween shows starring actresses with famous pedigrees -- Jamie Lynn Spears, sister of Britney, leads ''Zoey,'' and Emma Roberts, niece of Julia, is the star of ''Unfabulous'' -- are back for their second seasons. Nickelodeon, Sundays at 7:30 and 8 p.m. (Tonight)    THE WAR AT HOME Frustrated parents, incorrigible kids, suburban living. This comedy joins Fox's Sunday lineup, and fits in much better with family sitcoms like ''The Simpsons'' and ''Family Guy'' than ''Arrested Development'' did in the same slot. Fox, Sundays at 8:30 p.m. (Tonight)    GILMORE GIRLS Lorelai (Lauren Graham) asked Luke (Scott Patterson) to marry her at the very end of the season closer. But though her romantic life might be in good shape, she and her daughter, Rory (Alexis Bledel), aren't getting along, breaking the hearts of fans. Amy Sherman-Palladino, the show's executive producer, has said the mother-daughter rift will get worse before it gets better. WB, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. (Sept. 13)    BONES In watching the F.B.I. and a team of forensic anthropologists put together a computerized hologram based on the remains of a murder victim, one might wonder whether law enforcement ever has the time or budget for this technological exactitude. But oddly, this series is based on the life of Kathy Reichs, an anthropologist and novelist, who writes autobiographical mysteries. Ms. Reichs's fictional alter ego, played by Emily Deschanel (''Boogeyman''), banters with her F.B.I. contact (David Boreanaz from ''Angel''). Fox, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. (Sept. 13)    HOUSE The cranky genius/Vicodin addict (Hugh Laurie) begins a second season of curing obscure medical problems. Dr. House's ex-girlfriend, played by Sela Ward, will be back for at least seven more episodes. Will ''House'' continue its ratings successes without ''American Idol'' preceding it on the schedule? Fox, Tuesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 13)    SUPERNATURAL Two brothers -- one reluctant (Jared Padalecki of ''Gilmore Girls''), one gung-ho (Jensen Ackles of ''Smallville'') -- go in search of their missing father. Along the way, they have to keep the family business running, and that business is hunting evil. This genuinely scary series -- with executive producers McG (''The O.C.'' and ''Charlie's Angels'') and Eric Kripke (''Boogeyman'') -- is looking to capitalize on the horror-movie trend. WB, Tuesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 13)    THE DIARY OF ANGELINA JOLIE & DR. JEFFREY SACHS IN AFRICA Ms. Jolie accompanied Dr. Sachs, an adviser to the United Nations, to western Kenya. No, not to escape the paparazzi -- to illuminate the overwhelming problems many Africans are facing. MTV, Sept. 14 at 7 p.m.    HEAD CASES Chris O'Donnell plays a corporate attorney who has a nervous breakdown from stress. After losing his job and his wife (Krista Allen, ''Unscripted''), he goes into business with another crazy lawyer: one who has ''explosive disorder'' (Adam Goldberg). Fox, Wednesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 14)    THE INVESTIGATORS: DEATH OF A RISING STAR Mia Zapata, the lead singer of the Seattle band the Gits, was murdered in the summer of 1993, but the case wasn't solved until recently. This documentary follows the long inquiry. Court TV, Sept. 15 at 10 p.m.    THRESHOLD When an alien spacecraft appears in the middle of the ocean, the government's team leader (Carla Gugino of the lauded but canceled ''Karen Sisco'') acts as you would want her to: unsurprised and ready to investigate. She and her team find that the unseen aliens seem to exert a murderously unpleasant influence over anyone they contact. CBS, Fridays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 16 is the two-hour series debut at 8 p.m.)    TWINS A family -- half nerds (Sara Gilbert of ''Roseanne'' and Mark Linn-Baker of ''Perfect Strangers''), half empty-headed beauties (Melanie Griffith, along with Molly Stanton from ''Passions'') -- runs a lingerie business. The creators of ''Will & Grace,'' Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, have had little success with other shows, like ''Good Morning, Miami'' and ''The Stones.'' Perhaps they will fare better on WB, where the ratings bar is lower. WB, Fridays at 8:30 p.m. (Sept. 16)    SURFACE Why does a science-fiction show about giant sea creatures seem so much more implausible and laughable than one about aliens? For whatever reason, it just does. With that as a given, the pilot of ''Surface'' successfully employs the ''Jaws'' method of hide-the-fish well, lessening its ridiculousness. A marine biologist (Lake Bell) leads an ensemble of characters who have found their lives changed by their close creature encounters. NBC, Mondays at 8 p.m. (Sept. 19)    HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER A man tells his kids how he met their mother 25 years earlier, and the story unfolds in flashbacks. Josh Radnor, Jason Segel (''Freaks and Geeks''), Alyson Hannigan (''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'') and Neil Patrick Harris (''Doogie Howser, M.D.'') co-star in this comedy. CBS, Mondays at 8:30 p.m. (Sept. 19) A related article is on Page 90.    KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL Another urban upscale show from the executive producer, Darren Star (''Sex and the City''). Bradley Cooper (''Alias'') plays the fictionalized version of Anthony Bourdain, the celebrity chef who wrote ''Kitchen Confidential.'' Here, Mr. Bourdain is renamed Jack and has fallen from grace in the New York restaurant world because of his drunken philandering. Then he gets a second chance at chic chefdom. Fox, Mondays at 8:30 p.m. (Sept. 19)    JUST LEGAL An 18-year-old genius lawyer (Jay Baruchel of ''Million Dollar Baby'') can get a job only with a once-great defense attorney (Don Johnson) who has become a corrupt loser. From the Jerry Bruckheimer factory (the ''CSI'' shows, ''Cold Case,'' ''Without a Trace''), this procedural series has the light dramatic tone of ''The Practice'' and ''Boston Legal,'' probably because Jonathan Shapiro, one of its executive producers, worked on both of those shows. WB, Mondays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 19)    OUT OF PRACTICE The adult children of recently divorced parents (Henry Winkler and Stockard Channing) try to deal with their strained family dynamic. The laughs on ''Frasier,'' also from the executive producers Joe Keenan and Christopher Lloyd, were never this forced. CBS, Mondays at 9:30 p.m. (Sept. 19)    MY NAME IS EARL A luckless petty criminal (Jason Lee) loses a winning lottery ticket for $100,000 when he is hit by a car and the ticket blows away. NBC, Tuesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 20) A related article is on Page 90.    NIP/TUCK When viewers last saw Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) at the end of Season 2, he was lying underneath ''the Carver,'' a serial mutilator whose crimes were being undone by Christian and Sean (Dylan Walsh), partners in plastic surgery. FX, Tuesdays at 10 p.m. (Sept. 20)    THE APPRENTICE: MARTHA STEWART Will Ms. Stewart revive the ''Apprentice'' franchise or contribute to its demise? The arguments against this show's success range from Mark Burnett's recent losing streak as an executive producer (''Survivor,'' but also ''The Casino,'' ''Rock Star: INXS'' and ''The Contender'') to the reputation of Ms. Stewart herself as being difficult. On the other hand, perhaps Ms. Stewart will bring back viewers who had abandoned ''The Apprentice'' because they were suffering from Donald Trump-inspired ennui. NBC, Wednesdays at 8 p.m. (Sept. 21)    E-RING A throbbing, militaristic Pentagon drama from Mr. Bruckheimer, the hit-maker. Benjamin Bratt (''Law & Order'') plays J.T., a guy new to the building who tends to act rashly and bravely, ignoring the careful planning of the higher-ups. Even more improbably, his boss (Dennis Hopper) supports this maverick behavior. NBC, Wednesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 21)    LOST After a run of keeping its fans happy during the first season of this plane-crash mystery, many rabid ''Lost'' viewers were infuriated by the inconclusive two-hour finale. It's time for some answers about what's down that hatch. ABC, Wednesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 21)    INVASION Hurricanes plus Florida plus aliens equals creepy. This show seems like the potential standout among the big three networks' science-fiction offerings. Shaun Cassidy, the teenage idol turned writer-producer, created this body-snatcher series. ABC, Wednesdays at 10 p.m. (Sept. 21)    EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS This comedy is the season's most-anticipated new show. Based on Chris Rock's childhood in 1980's Brooklyn, he narrates this sweet, funny, nostalgic sitcom about a family in which he was the normal one. UPN, Thursdays at 8 p.m. (Sept. 22)    CSI The Quentin Tarantino-directed finale episode of ''CSI's'' fifth season, in which Nick (George Eads) was buried alive, will be tough to top. But many millions of viewers will want to see them try. CBS, Thursdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 22)    LOVE, INC. A woman makes her living as a matchmaker but is unlucky in love herself.

But now he has a new partner (Marguerite Moreau of ''Life as We Know It''), whose motives might not be in his best interests. Fox, Fridays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 23)    THREE WISHES Get out your handkerchiefs: Amy Grant, the Christian music icon, goes from town to town granting three wishes, meaning thrice the do-gooding of ABC's ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.'' NBC, Fridays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 23)    INCONCEIVABLE If television reflects cultural trends, it was only a matter of time before a show was set in a fertility clinic. This series -- led by Jonathan Cake (''Empire'') and Ming-Na (''ER'') -- illustrates the dramatic scenarios of medically aided conception and its accompanying ethical dilemmas, before a soapy backdrop. Angie Harmon (''Law & Order'') was a late addition to the cast. NBC, Fridays at 10 p.m. (Sept. 23)    GHOST WHISPERER Jennifer Love Hewitt sees dead people. Or at least her character, a newlywed, does: she helps ghosts resolve problems that have prevented them from moving to the great beyond.

We will see. CBS, Fridays at 8 p.m. (Sept. 23)    THE WEST WING Who will inherit the Jed Bartlet-Martin Sheen throne, Jimmy Smits's Democrat or Alan Alda's Republican?

ABC, Sundays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 25)    GREY'S ANATOMY When the show left off, the audience and Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) had just found out that Patrick Dempsey's character, her dreamy boss and boyfriend, is married. Ruh roh. ABC, Sundays at 10 p.m. (Sept. 25)    ALIAS Jennifer Garner's pregnancy has thrown a wrench into the ''Alias'' plot as it heads into its fifth season, but viewers can look back at how things were in the spy thriller's beginnings in daily reruns.

VH1, Sept. 26 at 9 p.m.    SEX, LOVE & SECRETS The best chance for this trash -- a nighttime soap opera about a group of friends in Los Angeles, led by Denise Richards -- is that it reaches a transcendent so-bad-it's-good level. You've got to see it to believe it. Or not. UPN, Tuesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 27)    COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF After the president of the United States dies, his vice president (Geena Davis) succeeds him, making her the first woman in the Oval Office. ABC, Tuesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 27) A related article is on Page 90.    VERONICA MARS Having solved the mystery of who killed her best friend -- Harry Hamlin's character did it -- Veronica (Kristen Bell) has a new mission: to find more viewers for this superior but low-rated series. She'll also have new crimes to solve. With high hopes, UPN has placed the show in its prized time slot, in the hour after ''America's Next Top Model.'' UPN, Wednesdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 28)    NIGHT STALKER The makers of ''The X-Files'' always said that ABC's 1974 series ''Kolchak: The Night Stalker'' influenced their supernatural show; now Frank Spotnitz, an executive producer of ''The X-Files,'' has remade ''Night Stalker.'' Stuart Townsend (''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'') plays Carl Kolchak, a journalist whose wife was killed by a mysterious evil creature.

ABC, Thursdays at 9 p.m. (Sept. 29)    BODIES When a young doctor (Max Beesley) begins a new job in an OB-GYN ward, he might as well have descended into hell.

Mondays at 9 p.m. (Oct. 3)    CLOSE TO HOME A young mother (Jennifer Finnigan, formerly of the NBC comedy ''Committed''), who also happens to be a crack prosecutor, returns to her demanding job after maternity leave. The twist to this new crime show by Mr. Bruckheimer is that the evildoing takes place in the seemingly safe suburbs of Chicago. But again, that no one is safe anywhere -- thus the title -- is one of the lessons television teaches us. CBS, Tuesdays at 10 p.m. (Oct. 4)    FREDDIE Freddie Prinze Jr. plays a Chicago restaurant chef whose female relatives move into his apartment after his brother dies. This amusing, innocuous series, created by Bruce Helford (''The Drew Carey Show''), is paired on the schedule with ''George Lopez'' for an hour of Hispanic-led sitcoms.

N, Fridays at 8:30 (Nov. 4)    PROJECT RUNWAY The first installment of this fashion design contest was one of the surprise pleasures of the last television season, offering a great villain in the diabolical contestant Wendy Pepper.

Kentucky Quintet Is Upset By Tennessee in Overtime"},{"year":"1992","title":"Rickey Henderson politicking for a trade or a better contract, that's not surprising. Dennis Eckersley being a perfect 24-for-24 in save situations, that's not surprising. The Cleveland Indians' holding up the rest of the major leagues, that's not surprising. But that does not mean that the 1992 baseball season hasn't already had its share of amazing stories, some of significant proportions, some merely pleasant, others about as welcome to teams and players as an abscessed tooth on a holiday weekend. Here's an attempt at choosing the top 10 surprises in baseball as the 1992 season nears its midway point:   1. Comeback Players of the Decade? Let's face it, the prognosticators who predicted greatness for Brady Anderson and Gary Sheffield moved on to other causes long ago. But clearly, they gave too soon, because both are enjoying career years so far, putting up numbers worthy of early consideration for post-season awards. Anderson, once considered a future savior of the Red Sox only to wind up on Baltimore's bench, has been completely resurrected by the Orioles as a standout left fielder. As a full-timer, he is batting .278, has scored 43 runs, stolen 24 bases and driven in 46 runs.   Sheffield, just as successful a reclamation project, has risen from the dredges in Milwaukee to new heights in San Diego, batting .320 for the Padres. Sheffield has hit 15 home runs and 14 doubles and driven in 53 runs.   2. The Little Infielder Who Could Unlike Anderson and Sheffield, Andy Stankiewicz, the Yankees shortstop, wasn't looking for a second chance, just a chance. And he wasn't going to get that until Mike Gallego went down with an injury just as the season was to open. Yankee Manager Buck Showalter, a Stankiewicz believer since he managed the infielder in the minors, brought the long shot to the major leagues and immediate success, not to mention an Cinderella story, followed (.321, 13 doubles, 27 runs scored).   3. A Little Change Is a Good Thing What the Atlanta Falcons' secondary may lose is turning out to be baseball's most pleasant gain. Deion Sanders, a second-team All-Pro in football, is proving to be an all-star for the Braves, shedding the label of Punch-and-Judy hitter/designated runner by blossoming into a leadoff threat with pop (.348 with 11 triples, six home runs, 18 stolen bases). Meanwhile, another Falcon defensive back, Brian Jordan, has enjoyed enough success with the Cardinals (5 home runs, 22 r.b.i., 6 stolen bases) to shelve the football cleats and take on baseball as a full-time career.   4. Seattle's Shooting Stars It should be no surprise that the Seattle Mariners have launched the career of yet another young pitching phenom in one Dave Fleming (10-3, 3.35 earned run average). The 22-year-old's victory total, compiled in less than a half a season is just 9 shy of his two-year minor-league total. The real surprise is that the Mariners have still not figured a way to avoid jettisoning promising arms. Last winter's sweep is contributing today to pleasant surprises blossoming in Minnesota (Bill Krueger, 7-2, 2.83 earned run average), and San Francisco (Billy Swift, 6-0, 2.17 e.r.a.","excerpt":"Mike Jackson, 3- 2, 2.50 e.r.a.).   5. La-La Lost in Los Angeles It is not a surprise that most every Dodger on the field has trouble catching the ball. But who would have thought that the Dodgers would be equally adept at being inept offensively? Even the team's usually optimistic manager, Tommy Lasorda, must look in alarm at the fact that there's no clutch in the Little Blue Bicycle (6-20 in one-run games). Another obvious worry: the league's leaders in runs batted in have individual totals greater than the combined total of his oft-injured big-contract players, Darryl Strawberry (21 r.b.i.) and Eric Davis (19).   6. The Boston Massacre Talk about the truly offensive. The Red Sox rank 14th and last in the American League in batting average, runs scored, hits, total bases, home runs, runs batted in and slugging percentage. And they play in Fenway Park, one of the more notorious band boxes in the American League. Well, at least the names Wade Boggs, Mike Greenwell, Jack Clark, Ellis Burks and Tom Brunansky still look good on paper. But come on, guys, the rabbits who play in St. Louis's spacious Busch Memorial have more home runs.   7. The Express Derails Nolan Ryan, who has pitched in the major leagues since 1968, never went through an April without a victory -- until this season. Now he has gone through May and most of June without a victory. July now looms for the Ranger right-hander, bringing questions as to whether the bad luck can all be chalked up to bad weather and bad timing on the part of the Rangers' batters.   8. Flying Dutchman I Bert Blyleven, who did not pitch professionally in 1991 because of shoulder surgery, has defied the odds by returning to the majors and winning with apparent ease for the Angels. The Dutch-born Blyleven, who turned 41 on April 6, is 3-1 with a 2.63 e.r.a. and has obviously refueled the notion that he may yet have a shot at joining the illustrious 300 victory-3,000 strikeout club (the right-hander has 282 victories and 3,656 strikeouts).   9. Flying Dutchman II Darren (Dutch) Daulton, the dean of the Phillies, has never driven in more than 57 runs in a season or hit more than a dozen home runs. Now he stands on the threshold of July with 53 r.b.i. and 12 home runs, at last rewarding the Phillies for hanging in for the eighth year while waiting for Daulton to come of age at the plate.   10. Biggest Bust-Up Since Martin and Lewis Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams, ex-teammates and kindred spirits, seem to be lost now that they're not linked in the Giants' lineup. Mitchell, flailing and failing in Seattle, has only 4 home runs and 29 r.b.i., killing the theory that the Mariners finally found a bat to protect young Ken Griffey.   Williams, left behind in San Francisco, has openly mourned the loss of Mitchell, whose swing and style he mimicked. Williams's average is hovering around .200, and he has hit only 11 home runs and driven in just 35 runs. The strikeouts -- 50 in 239 at-bats -- remain a mystery.

Descriptions invariably end up in a string of ''nots'' -- it's not classical, it's not jazz, it's not rock, it's not klezmer -- or in a vague blur of inclusiveness: it's all of those things, sometimes, sort of. What's certain about the work of this composer, performer (he plays the saxophone) and winner of a 2006 MacArthur Foundation ''genius'' award is that there's a lot of it, and it's as mercurial as its creator. Since Mr. Zorn, above, also has his own performance space (the Stone, in the East Village) and his own record label (Tzadik), which both present a staggering range of music from around the globe that few have heard before, you might say he's a musical genre unto himself. So in trying to give a comprehensive portrait of Mr. Zorn, 53, any single concert is going to come up short. But the Miller Theater's Composer Portraits usually manage to find a way to present a satisfying snapshot. Thursday's concert dedicated to Mr. Zorn offers new music with a vengeance: brand-new music, as in three world premieres, along with an American premiere and a relatively elderly piece from 1997. The group of performers, selected by the composer, are an indication of his stylistic eclecticism: they include the Vox Vocal Ensemble","excerpt":"Mike Patton, the former lead singer of the rock group Faith No More; and the composer-conductor Brad Lubman.

This series of scenes was made by William Beebe, and the hideous but interesting victim is now having his board and room rent paid by Father Knickerbocker in the Bronx Zoo.After having looked upon Wallace Beery, George Bancroft and even Dick Sutherland in their ugliest moments in a pictorial drama, one discovers that they are relatively handsome when considering the great anteater. The great ant-eater has a certain courage. He struggles and fights back, his forelegs serving him in good stead, as well as the length and sharpness of his jaws. He has a tail that rather reminds one of an old chimney-sweep's broom before being trimmed. It was through this tall that Mr. Beebe was able to catch this mammal, and then only after a long battle in which ropes, oars and sticks played a conspicuous part. Eventually the ant-eater was cajoled into taking a rest in a nice comfortable box, and it was in this receptacle that he was taken to the Bronx.And now to the photoplay, which was inspired by a novel from Countess Cathcart's pen. It is said to have been freely adapted from this literary work. It must have been, for precious little remains that one could construe as drama.It was directed by Maurice Elvey, who has succeeded in eliciting an emphatically good performance from a young woman, named Juliette Compton. Miss Compton fills the part of the siren who falls more or less desperately in love with the placid hero. The young man is impersonated by Warwick Ward, who figured as the great Artinelli in \\"Variety.\\" Mr. Ward's acting is not at all bad, but he has little chance to develop any excitement or true interest, for although Mr. Elvey is to be congratulated on the sensitive and intelligent work of Miss Compton, he must be criticized adversely for his utterly unimaginative direction and the prolonging of scenes until they lose most of their possible effect.Mr. Elvey invariably poses his players, and Miss Compton alone avoids this failing. Mr. Elvey strives for something great and does not even get a small result when a trigger of a revolver is pulled by fingers circled with precious stones. It is all so artifically done that there is no dread, no thrill, no chagrin, but perhaps just a feeling of relief that the film story is nearing its end.Simplicity and restraint, with much less theatrics, are needed in British pictures, if this \\"Woman Tempted\\" is any criterion of Britain's present productions.

Gianni Versace's fashions for spring were so saturated with her spirit that had she turned up in the flesh at his recent show in Milan, she would have been redundant. Madonna's failure to appear at the Dolce & Gabbana show caused no ripples either, since reminders of the projectile-bosomed blonde were everywhere on the runway -- from the designers' signature corsets to the models' sullen come-and-get-it looks.   Fashion week in Milan this fall was marked by salutes to the entertainment world's most celebrated bad girls -- high-voltage personalities who just naturally seem to emanate an air of sexual candor. Versace, Milan's most talked about designer of the moment, claims to find their lusty spirit bracing, even downright inspiring. And the feeling must be mutual. Cher and Tina Turner, two of Versace's favorite muses and most visible clients, exhibit a brassy, media-driven look that colors the designer's work, just as he has influenced their sense of style. Cher has worn Versace's thigh-hugging sequined trousers. Turner has been seen in his cantilevered-bosom dresses. What Versace is to Cher, Dolce and Gabbana are to Madonna. She shares their fascination with fashion's underpinnings, stocking her lingerie cupboard with their black bustiers and cobwebby crocheted cover-ups.

The princess, an otherwise lovely lady, has been impelled to this decree by her subjects' complete indifference to farming, industry, tax payment, to everything, in fact, but the organization of double quartets, string trios and concert orchestras. Austria, in consequence, is threatening to annex Lucco for non-payment of its debt.So Lucco, which had been singing, whistling, piping, fiddling and blowing for generations, suddenly goes silent, and probably would have been tuneless still but for the fortuitous arrival of an early American newspaper man (one Jimmy Durante) and a native Luccan tenor (one Richard Tauber). Between them they manage to foment revolution, convert the princess (Diana Napier) and, by some vague expedient, turn Lucco's national weakness into a natural asset.Now this, as noted before, is an amusing idea, but the film scarcely demonstrates it. Mr. Tauber strikes his attitudes with such vigor that they never rise again. Mr. Durante's nose is in everything but a good script. Although it had an excellent opportunity to be merry, sly and imaginative, the picture's humors are forced, its dictatorial spoofing has no subtlety at all and its pattern is that of the old, old operettas: \\"Scene One, the stage is filled with happy villagers singing and dancing.\\"Mr. Straus has written a few pleasant songs for the occasion, and his director now and then remembers that a camera and a microphone may be used to blend sound and image into a symphonic pattern. But generally \\"Forbidden Music\\" has not been properly tuned for the screen. At best it has a mildly sedative effect.At the Chopin TheatreWisely limiting its scope to the dramatic early days of the abortive Polish revolution of 1794, the Libkow Film Company of Warsaw, with the blessing and very material aid of the Polish Army, has produced an interesting historical picture in \\"Kosciuszko,\\" the Chopin Theatre's Christmas present to its patrons. Smoothly directed by Jozef Lejtes and well equipped with English titles, this bright celluloid page from the history of the patriot whose memory is treasured as highly in this country as in his homeland is well worth seeing.Beginning with striking incidents showing the revolt of both the army and the people against Russian impositfons, the action graphically depicts the rise of the popular movement and reaches its climax in the battle at Raclawice on April 4, 1794, in which Kosciuszko, with 4,000 men, mostly crudely armed peasants and city workers, defeated 6,000 Russians marching on Cracow. Tadeusz Bialosczynski, in the title role, gives an excellent performance.Pretty Elzbieta Barszczewska is the object of the affection of two handsome officers (Witold Zacharewicz and Jur Pichelski), but there is no intimation that the revolt was started on her account. Considerable comic relief is furnished by Jan Kurnakowicz, as a sergeant who had fought with Kosciuszko in the uprising of 1792 against the Czarina.At the 48th Street TheatrePortly Edvard Persson, one of Sweden's most popular comedians of stage and screen, divides the fun-making honors with the equally substantial Dagmar Ebbesen in \\"Baldvins Bröllop\\" (\\"Baldwin's Wedding\\"), just arrived at the Forty-eighth Street Theatre. Despite the natural charm of Elsa Holmquist and the manliness of young Björn Berglund, their love affair is merely incidental to the merry mix-up culminating in the marriage of the likable middle-aged pair.Smoothly directed by Emil A. Pehrson and Gideon Wahlberg, this Europa production shows scenes in and around the port of Göteborg well calculated to mingle a little homesickness with the gales of laughter with which Swedish-Amer-importation from the old country Rarely have the beauties of life in Summer on the Swedish coast been brought out as impressively as in this sketch of the work and play of honest fisherfolk.The principals are excellently supported by a cast including John Ekman, Elsa's rich, but essentially Kind-hearted father, and Arthur Fischer and Bullan Weijden, as the secondary comic couple. English titles explain the simple story, but hardly cover all the wisecracks.

For many musicians, a boxed set is still mainly a summation of past releases with a few rarities thrown in. Some releases take the large storage capacity of CD's as reason to forget selectivity, boxing whole catalogues of recordings in giant sets. Recording companies have also taken heart from the big sales of ''The Beatles Anthology'' series of unearthed recordings. An increasing number of boxed sets present material that used to be the province of bootleggers: live shows, alternative takes and unreleased songs, as if recording companies are rushing to release everything they own before the millennium.    Here, the pop music and jazz critics of The New York Times assess a selection of this year's boxed sets. (Collections previously reviewed in these pages, including those of Hank Williams, John Lennon, Judy Garland and Taj Mahal, are not listed.) The sets average $12 to $16 per disk.

Mr. Niblo has elicited from his principals competent work, and he has had the temerity to let the story run without flashing uselessly to the journeying heroine while the more interesting action of the narrative is holding forth. There are toward the end some scenes of great crowds, but whether they were made especially for this production is not known. Their inclusion, is, however, quite effective.Prince Mauritz, impersonated by Nils Asther, is a most immaculately uniformed young man. The Dictator, played by Warner Oland, is wont to refer to the handsome fellow as the \\"long-legged Prince.\\" This kingdom is evidently in a wretched state, for Prince Mauritz has nothing whatever to say about finance or other matters. The Dictator has a pretty wife, acted by Aileen Pringle, who, either to bring about the downfall of Prince Mauritz or to teach her husband a lesson, frequently visits the Prince. The Prince is in love with Adrienne, a singer with a traveling show. He is, however, eminently successful in casting her from his mind when the Duchess, as the Dictator's wife is known, reports at his apartment.The Dictator finds his attention riveted on a Countess (Carmel Myers), but while she apparently appreciates the elderly person's declaration, of affection in public, she is not opposed to receiving in her abode a Baron. When the Dictator calls her on the telephone she insists that she is all alone, waiting for him to come to see her, and then one perceives the Baron enjoying the Countess's little joke.The Prince, in his eagerness to break up the more or less happy home of the Dictator so as to put that individual out of power, very nearly loses Adrienne, his real love, who latterly appears as a successful actress with a glistening dress.The settings for this production are lavish and so are the costumes. There are dozens of men in smart officers' uniforms and Miss Pringle does well with the Duchess's gowns and sparkling skull caps.Mr. Niblo makes excellent use of the mobile cameras. He follows his characters all over the place and in some scenes he singles out the heroine in a crowd and brings her, as if from a distance, to a close-up.Mr. Asther is capital as the romantic Prince. Mr. Oland leaves no stone unturned to show the pomp and power of the Dictator. Harry Myers, who will be remembered in the now long ago for his clever portrayal in \\"A Connecticut Yankee at the Court of King Arthur,\\" once again proves himself to be an intelligent and pleasing player.Joan Crawford is charming as the humble singer, who wins stage laurels and subsequently admits her love for the Prince.No sound issued from the screen at the first performance yesterday. Even the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lion refused to roar. It was rather nice, this silence, and one did not object to the organist supplying the accompaniment for the picture.The stage program includes a glimpse of the Capitolian orchestra players all dressed up like Father Christmas. Harland Dixon, the dancer, also interested the audience.Van and Schenck are to be seen in a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer short talking film. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Military Academy Students.
