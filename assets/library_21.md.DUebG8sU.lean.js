Books about the lionization of sports figures are nothing new, but Mr. Lipsyte and Mr. Levine have constructed an interesting premise: they contend that their subjects are literally symbols of different periods in 20th-century America. Arnold Palmer, Vince Lombardi and Mickey Mantle represent not only excellence on the playing field but also \\"the promise of post-World War II America.\\" Billie Jean King and  Muhammad Ali are not only great competitors but also are emblematic of \\"the turbulent 60's, a time in which sports as well as the larger culture confronted  the inequities of race, sex and class.\\" Placing coaches and athletes on cultural time lines is a risky proposition at best -- as is arguing that the contribution of a certain select group reflects the myriad forces at work in society at a particular time. There is something about sports that defies rigid classification. But one does not have to agree totally with the authors to enjoy their book. The description of John L.

A1    American and Iraqi forces raiding an Iraqi government detention center in Baghdad discovered more than 600 prisoners packed into a cramped space, 13 of them mistreated so badly they had to be taken to a hospital, a senior American official said.   A1    Chinese Officer Held in Deaths  The commander of paramilitary forces who opened fire on villagers protesting land seizures was detained by the authorities in connection with the shootings, an extraordinary response that suggested high-level concern over whether the crackdown was justified.   A1    Paris Suburb Symbolizes Riots  La Courneuve, a Paris suburb of 35,000 people of 80 nationalities and ethnic backgrounds, has become a symbol of France's failure to integrate millions of Arab and African immigrants -- many of them Muslims -- and their French-born children and grandchildren.   A1    Top Croat Suspect at the Hague  For the United Nations war crimes tribunal in the Hague, taking custody of Ante Gotovina means the end of a four-year wait and the capture of one of its most-wanted suspects from the Balkan wars of the 1990's.   A3    Rights Unit Faults Sudan Leader  The United Nations should impose sanctions on top political and military leaders in Sudan and conduct an investigation of crimes against humanity committed in Darfur, Human Rights Watch said in a report that accuses senior officials, including President Omar al-Bashir, of playing major roles in making civilians the target of attacks.   A5    Quebec Party Courts Minorities  The Bloc Québécois party has put up a record nine candidates of Haitian, African, Middle Eastern and Chinese origin this year to appeal to minorities and win toss-up districts in the Jan. 23 election, with the larger goal of winning a third separatist referendum expected in the next few years.   A6    Runoff in Chile Election  With ballots counted in the first round of voting in Chile's presidential election, a candidate who describes her rise as unlikely because she is ''a woman, a Socialist, separated and agnostic'' and a conservative billionaire businessman have advanced to a decisive runoff.   A6    Finns Build Largest Reactor  With continued spikes in gas and fuel prices, fears about overdependence on foreign oil and the growing threat of global warming, Finland has decided to move ahead this year with the construction of the world's largest nuclear reactor, and a number of countries, including the United States, are freshening up proposals to build nuclear plants.   A10    NATIONAL   A16-23    A Clash Over Rebuilding Gulf Coast After Hurricane  There is a broad clash along the Gulf Coast over whether to rebuild hurricane-damaged areas much as they were, to rebuild at a higher price, with more robust foundations and buildings raised above ground, or to cede large swaths of land to nature. The debate features a cast that includes disaster victims, coastal engineers, mortgage lenders, the insurance industry, as well as local, state and federal officials.   A1    Tackling Medicaid Costs  Members of Congress will soon plunge into battle over the future of Medicaid, as House and Senate negotiators try to resolve huge differences over legislation that would allow states to cut benefits and increase charges for millions of low-income people, including many children.

A23    Virginia Governor Ponders Bid  Propelled by his popularity at home, Gov.

The latest stop came in Florida this weekend at a state Democratic Party convention.   A16    Still No Decision on Inmate  As fervor over the scheduled execution of Stanley Tookie Williams early Tuesday began to boil across California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declined for a third day to announce a decision on a petition to spare the life of Mr. Williams, a former gangster and now-famous death row inmate, and commute his sentence to life in prison.   A16    Administration Word of Choice  Vice President Dick Cheney warned that Al Qaeda's ultimate goal is the re-establishment of the caliphate, with calamitous consequences for the United States.

This genre is already far too crowded and you would be better off working with dialogue instead. But if you must, here's some more advice: call Larry Moss. Over the last few years, Mr. Moss, above, the director and distinguished acting coach, has shaped and staged some of the best solo work in the city. His latest effort is directing ''RFK,'' a biographical play about the Kennedy who might have been president, starring Jack Holmes as the title character. It is running at the Culture Project. When watching an actor directed by Mr. Moss, one gets the sense that each choice has been mulled over and decided with considerable intelligence, and each moment fits snugly into the whole. ''The Syringa Tree,'' Pamela Gien's piece about the final years of apartheid South Africa, may be one of the most successful solo shows in recent years, and it grew out of an acting class conducted by Mr. Moss.

He represents Lawrence Schiller, the show's producer-director, who out-bargained David Susskind and others for the exclusive book and film rights to the story of the murderer whose demand to be executed turned him into a media superstar in the mid-70's. The four-hour adaptation begins tonight at 9 on NBC and concludes tomorrow night.   In Mailer's account, there is no coyness about naming names","excerpt":"Larry Schiller figures prominently in the book. Indeed, Mailer is indebted to him for many of the key interviews. Since Schiller could hardly be left out of the television adaptation, perhaps the name was changed in deference to the queasy feelings stirred up by the idea of purchasing ''rights'' to a doomed man's life; or perhaps the change simply made it easier for producer-director Schiller-Samuels to present character Samuels-Schiller as a serious-minded and reflective person. Whatever the name, by drawing attention to one who gained a reputation as a hearse-chaser in previous entrepreneurial encounters with such ''properties'' as the Sharon Tate murder, Lenny Bruce, Jack Ruby and Marilyn Monroe, this film raises the question of whether Gary Gilmore's case has been turned into a case of show-business exploitation.

Although the new approach, called the ''atomic vapor laser isotope separation'' process, has many problems that must be overcome and would not be used until 1995, department officials are confident they have chosen the best technology.

KNOCK,\\" the Gallic comedy-satire that arrived Saturday, is not a revival of the 1937 Louis Jouvet import, but an almost exact remake. The great actor completed it shortly before he died in 1951. Decked out with an entirely different supporting cast, this Martin J. Lewis release is playing at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse.Again, M. Jouvet is the whole show in a reprised adaptation of Jules Romains' play about the urbane charlatan who profitably transforms an indifferent medical practice after convincing an entire village that the Grim Reaper can't wait. Funny, impudent and brilliantly thrusting in turn, the picture is also slow to start, repetitious, extremely talky, overlong and, as before, not entirely credible.Furthermore, it remains a photographed play, in contrast to many other fluent and elastic Jouvet vehicles. M. Jouvet is supposed to have turned over the directorial reins (he held before) to Guy LeFranc. The gentleman must soon have handed them back.Front and center, always, in a role that practically amounts to a monologue, the distinguished performer makes a perfect charlatan, all but licking his dignified chops over his acclaim as regional benefactor, and all but convincing himself. His strictly supporting colleagues, headed by Jean Brochard, Pierre Renoir, Yves Deniaud and Marguerite Pierry, provide a wonderfully picturesque gallery of villagers.Never, though, has one locale held so many gullible geese, poor and rich alike. Excluding only the former village doctor (who returns for the delicious dénouement), these earthbound natives promptly capitulate, mind you, to a somber, lofty and smooth talker from afar. Indeed, the whole picture, for all its knowing sharpness, retains the same condescending air.As for the unfunny scene where Dr. Knock blandly reduces a naïve peasant to a state of a frozen terror, one viewer wishes the portly lady, Genevieve Morel, had picked up a scalpel and run him clean through. We wish the unforgettable M. Jouvet's screen swan song were warmer and less wise. On this one count, at least—calling Dr. Kildare.

But Wisconsin is called the Dairy State for a reason, and anyone visiting Madison must go to Michael's Frozen Custard, where dozens of flavors, from butter pecan to mint chip, are dished out at four locations, old-timey shacks in converted gas stations. Madisonians are partial to the sundaes with hot fudge, caramel and toasted, salted pecans, but purists order the vanilla. Fresh tasting, with the heady, eggy perfume of homemade tapioca pudding, it gets its signature pale yellow hue from egg yolks. Michael Dix, 45, who started the business in 1986 with frozen-custard machines from the 1940's, loves the color so much that he had a bedroom painted to match. Now, on a hot summer day, he serves up to 750 gallons (mail order is available from www.ilovemichaels.com). During a short trip two summers ago, I limited myself to a baby cup the first day. By the second I'd upgraded to a medium, which looked as though it might easily be a full pint.
