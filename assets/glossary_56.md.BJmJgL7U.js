As you plow through the crowds and rustle through the greens, you might want a little help focusing. Here it is. These purveyors at local farmers' markets are among the best. Most bring crops to market month after month. But each has a specialty worth trying at the peak of its season. For each, the tale of what brought them to market is slightly different.

In addition to the usual strawberries and raspberries, there are blackberries and gooseberries and both black and red currants.     The orchards, in Highland, N.Y., have been in the Wilklow family since 1855. They once raised mostly apples.

Although buying by large institutions was modest, market participants said speculative demand was good and noted that some of the price gains in the Treasury market were related to higher prices for bond futures contracts traded in Chicago.   While the Treasury's 12 1/2 percent bonds due in 2014 closed at about their highest price of 107 2/32, up more than 5/8 point, to yield 11.64 percent, the December bond futures contract traded on the Chicago Board of Trade rose 11/32, to 70 20/32.    Treasury Bill Rates Drop    In the Treasury bill market, the recent decline in overnight interest rates to less than 10 percent has spurred a sharp drop in rates for new bills due in three and six months. At yesterday's auction, the average rate for three-month bills plunged to 9.54 percent, from 9.98 percent the previous week, while the six-month average rate was 9.57 percent, down from 10.08 percent.

In the case of the Treasury's two-year notes, investor demand strengthened enough so that the 10 3/4 percent note issue sold with an average yield of 10.86 percent, little changed from a day earlier, but down from 10.99 percent last Thursday.    Reflecting the general rise of short- and long-term rates since late January, the 10.86 percent yield on two- year notes was up from an average of 10.12 percent at last month's auction, and from 9.83 percent at the late January sale.

Among long-term issues, prices fell about 1/4 point for 30-year bonds, and smaller amounts for shorter maturities. The 11 1/4 percent bonds due in 2015, for example, were offered at 96 10/32, down 6/32, to yield 11.69 percent.

It was a heresy for which the artist paid dearly. Unnerved by the New York art critics who derided the new works as crude and cartoonlike, Guston retreated to upstate Woodstock, where he turned to a group of poets and writers for artistic solace.

He survived as co-anchor of the \\"CBS Evening News\\" with Connie Chung, a woman he appeared to be allergic to. He also survived the budgetary slashings of CBS's chairman, Laurence Tisch, and the ratings dive that the news program later suffered. Rather even survived a cloud of rumors in the spring that his anchoring days might be numbered: in May, it was Chung, not Rather, who was pulled from the anchor's chair.   \\"I guess some of this comes from being born during the Depression,\\" Rather was saying on a recent August morning as we drove through southeast Texas in a pickup truck. \\"Also, I realized pretty early on that while I had skills, there were an awful lot of other people with better skills. All that may have given me strong survival skills.\\"   These words were being spoken at a time when Rather's survival skills were likely to be tested once again: a couple of days after Tisch announced plans to merge CBS with the cash-poor Westinghouse Electric Corporation. This move convinced many CBS staff members that there might be still more cuts in their future. (Not to mention bigger uncertainties. As this article went to press, Ted Turner, who had been trying to find the money to buy the network out from under Westinghouse, was himself negotiating a potential buyout of Turner Broadcasting System by Time Warner.)   We were talking on a blazingly gorgeous morning a full month before Rather would begin his 15th season as the \\"CBS Evening News\\" anchor and managing editor. Our goal was to visit the places of his childhood, to do an interview free of the formalities of his New York life.   We dashed to Huntsville, the site of Rather's alma mater, Sam Houston State College. Then it was on to the oil town of Wharton, his birthplace. Finally, we drove to Austin for dinner with Mrs. Dan Rather, the artist Jean Rather, 59.   Between stops, there were gawkings at cattle, an encounter with a highway patrolman, who pulled us over for driving without seat belts, and constant trips to pay phones as Rather sought updates on the pending CBS-Westinghouse merger. Q: David Letterman did a Top 10 list the other night about the CBS-Westinghouse merger. Among his predictions: The current CBS brass would be replaced by a \\"whole new batch of weasels,\\" and your next co-anchor would be a coffeepot. Can you work with a coffeepot? A: The real question is, How will a coffeepot feel about working with me?  [ Laughs ]  Actually, I'd prefer a refrigerator. But I'm not sure I'll have a coffeepot or a refrigerator because I'm not yet convinced we'll have Westinghouse. And if we do, we may not have Westinghouse for long. . . . As we speak, the deal is a long way from finished. The thing to look for in whoever winds up with CBS is whether they have taken on so much debt that they have to squeeze CBS News down further to help service it. Q: That's what happened when Tisch took over the company eight years ago, isn't it? A: Uh-huh. And now we are in 1995. And this is a much bigger deal. Q:Andy Rooney recently said: \\"Larry Tisch did all the wrong things with CBS. . . . He turned the best broadcasting company in the business into one of the weakest and got even richer in the process.\\" Agree? A:  [ Slowly ]  Mmmmm . . . I'm going to have to say, I'm not going to answer that question.   What I will say is that there's real concern about what effect one merger after another, each one bigger than the last, will have on the news. Everywhere. Not just at CBS. When we were purchased last time, much of what Wall Street said needed to be done with CBS was wrong. Now, I understand that CBS needs to make a profit, but we also are, in some ways, a public trust. . . . When the new buyers talk about \\"increasing margins,\\" it makes me nervous. A recent Wall Street Journal article quoted someone from the new potential ownership saying that more layoffs are inevitable. . . . At CBS News, we're down to the bone, past the bone, and we've been there a long time. Q: A lot of CBS News people are praying that Ted Turner will buy the network. Are you a member of the \\"Waiting for Ted\\" camp? A: Well, I like Ted Turner and respect many of the things he's done with CNN.   Now, I do have concerns. Turner already has the infrastructure of a worldwide news-gathering operation. If he were to take CBS, the danger is, that might gut CBS News, perhaps leave around it some of the trappings of what it once was, but wipe out the depth of our talent. Q: This could happen anyway? A: Well, with any potential new management, you don't know. It's true, somebody else might get hold of CBS and gut us anyway. The last time the company changed ownership, what we first believed turned out to be several area codes away from what was true. The picture that was painted of the new ownership  [ then ]  was that it would bring in a new era of aggressive expansion and leadership in news.   You can make a case that we had a critical moment in 1988 -- when the \\"CBS Evening News\\" on the flagship CBS station in New York was moved from 7 P.M., where it was strong, to 6:30, where it would be weak. What was put in at our place at 7 was a game show, \\"Win, Lose or Draw.\\" When that happened, I knew the tide had turned against news. I, among others, fought as much as I could. \\"We can make more money by buying this syndicated program, and we decided we want the money,\\" we were told by management. And we said: \\"If this is only about money, it's a short-term gain and long-term loss. If you move the 'CBS Evening News' from where it is doing well, the signal goes out to our affiliates that they can move the news to any time they damn well please. They'll move it to terrible time periods.\\"   Which they did. Affiliated stations began playing the \\"Evening News\\" at 6:30, 4:30, 5 -- it was Death Valley. The signal from the top was, \\"Go for the buck.\\" Now, this move was not Larry Tisch's idea,  [ but ]  he approved it. I'm now thinking, whoever winds up owning us, if they want to make a bold move for all of CBS News, they should put the news back at 7 at every owned and operated station. Q: You made headlines earlier this summer when Connie Chung was removed as co-anchor. At the time, she said she refused a smaller role because it was \\"inappropriate for the only woman on the three major network news programs to have anything less than coequal status.\\" A: This is not and was not a gender issue. Connie has often said, and rightly so, that she didn't come into the job because she's a woman. And she didn't lose it because she was a woman. It was a business decision to try it, and it was a business decision to stop it. . . . There was a time when some people thought having two anchors would make us more flexible, give me a chance to get out in the field more -- and it was thought that it might improve our ratings. After two years, basically, the same people who decided to do it realized that our ratings were poorer than when we started out. Q: When did you first hear that Connie Chung might be leaving the \\"Evening News\\"? A: By Friday  [ May 19 ] , word was beginning to get around that Connie's agent was negotiating. . . .  [ I figured ]  she'd probably sign a new contract, would stay on with CBS and be a central star and probably would continue to be a dual anchor. I'd been told  [ by the CBS brass ]  fairly recently that the intention was to continue.    I left New York for Austin  [ after the Friday broadcast ]  to give the commencement address at the University of Texas. . . . I thought, \\"They may very well say to me, 'We want you to work at CBS News, but we want you to go off in a different direction.' \\" Q: So you thought you, not Chung, might be pulled from the anchor's chair? A: The thought occurred to me. Television, after all, is a young person's game. You can count on one hand the people in television, in news and entertainment, who are front and center who are over 59. There's Angela Lansbury and Dan Rather.    Also, there had been this business with the Oklahoma City bombing coverage.  [ Immediately after the explosion, Chung was sent to the blast site","excerpt":"Rather was told not to go there. Eventually, he did join the coverage team. ]  Afterward, I said  [ to management ] : \\"We have to work out something so that we don't have this situation develop again. . . . If something like that breaks, I want to be on it. Not to the exclusion of anybody else. My feeling was, I love this job, but I can't, I won't, go through this again.  [ Being kept from the story ]  chewed me up inside. It was like trying to swallow barbed-wire-wrapped ball bearings.   I got off the plane, my beeper was going off. I was told, \\"Somebody is calling around the newspapers saying that Connie is trying to get out of her contract.\\"   Of the things that I've read, the one that strikes me as having the strongest possibility of being true is that Connie and her agent made a decision that they wanted to put heat on CBS to get what they wanted by way of contract resolution. And in order to get what they wanted, this writer quotes someone as saying that they made a conscious decision to pursue a \\"scorched earth\\" strategy. With time, and seeing the whole context, that seems to be the most reasonable explanation.  Q: On screen, the two of you always looked miserable together -- as if you'd been pushed into the video version of a shotgun marriage. A: People have said that to me. But I never felt that. I never had any personal problems with Connie, which surprised me in a high-pressured situation every day for nearly two years. Now, it has been suggested -- and I think there may be some merit -- that the  [ on-air ]  dynamic between us changed in about late February or March of this year. Q: Was that about the time of her \\"just between you and me\\" Kathleen Gingrich interview? A: Yes. That's a wee small answer, yes. I spoke up for Connie at the time. What I felt privately was something not to express publicly. So, looking back on it, I did begin to notice a change in our on-screen dynamic in late February or March. . . . Also in March, I learned of some meetings that had taken place before the November 1994 elections -- discussions about what the election coverage would look like. I didn't know the exact details of who said what to whom. But in March I was told -- and did confirm -- that there had been meetings at which  [ Chung's agent ]  Mr. Geller and the person for whom he was working sought, at the very minimum, to have a much larger role in election-night coverage. At my expense.   When I say that there was a change, I would have been foolish not to take that seriously. Now, there are differing versions of what happened. What stuck in my mind was Mr. Geller saying to somebody, \\"You know, it's time for Dan to step aside.\\" It's a rough trade and I understand that, but I didn't take kindly to that. Q: What would you have done if that argument had been successful? A: I would have said to my employers, \\"Well, do you have anything else besides anchoring for me to do?\\" If I am able to do something in journalism, I'd be O.K. . . .    You know, I was supportive  [ of Chung ] . I worked hard to make it work. I gave much more than I got. And happily so. I was protective and defensive. I gave it everything. I believed it would continue indefinitely, until I found out about election night and what had happened in secret. Until it was made very clear to me that there was a push-on not for me to share, but to give up.   [ Asked to respond to Rather's comments, Alfred Geller said: \\"His statements are baldfaced lies, following many that have been made by Dan Rather over an extended period of time concerning Connie Chung and me. He has abdicated the crown jewel that every journalist holds dearest -- disseminating the truth. One would think that within the bounds of good taste, human decency and gentlemanly behavior that he would stop attacking Connie Chung. It's time for him to enjoy his 'victory,' however tainted, and leave Ms. Chung alone.\\" ] Q: Most of the reportage on l'affaire Connie Chung painted you as the heavy. Of the three network anchors, you seem to be a lightning rod for personal attacks. Do you have any insight on why that is? A: I have no idea where that comes from. The best I can come up with is that I've been around a long time. Sometimes, there's been envy, jealousy, wonderment: \\"How did a guy as dumb as Rather get where he is?\\" My answer is, I got in early, stayed late, worked hard, cared a lot and God smiled on me. And by the way, I might not be quite as dumb as you think I am.   Another thing, I think it sometimes peeves some people when someone from the bottom breaks through. My background is Texas and poor. There was a review of a book about education in The Wall Street Journal, and the headline was, \\"Dan Rather and Other Enemies of Civilization.\\" The review said, more or less, that television news was incredibly literate before I was on the air and concluded that we should shut down all teachers' colleges. I had attended Sam Houston State teachers' college. It hurt. The truth is, I got a wonderful education at Sam Houston State teachers' college and afterward at CBS, where I was trained by masters -- Charles Collingwood, Eric Sevareid and, by extension, Edward R. Murrow himself. I met Murrow. But he left CBS just about the time I got there.   Now, I know I'm not Ed Murrow.  [ Smiles ]  Every morning, when I shave, I say: \\"Boy, what a wreck you are. And I'll tell you one damned thing, you're not Ed Murrow, and Ed Murrow you're never going to be.\\" But that doesn't mean I can't practice the lessons that these guys taught me.  Q: Tell us what the late Charles Collingwood taught you about men's haberdashery? A: When I first came to CBS, Charles said, \\"If you want to make it here young man, 'dress British and think Yiddish.' \\" And he certainly taught me the British part. \\"You should buy at least one tailored suit,\\" he said, and then he took me to his tailor on Savile Row. He showed me what traveled well.    I should have remembered his advice many years later when I was at \\"60 Minutes\\" doing a story on drug dealers. We had an informant in Wyoming who said he'd only talk if I came into town in complete disguise. So I dressed up in biker clothes -- jeans, a T-shirt, with sleeves rolled up to my shoulder, a pack of cigarettes stuck in the sleeve and a phony tattoo. I thought I was completely unrecognizable. But on the plane, I sat down next to an African-American businessman, who looked me up and down and declared: \\"Dan Rather, is that you? You look bizarre!\\" Moral of the story? 'Tis better to dress British than Biker. Q: Or sing off-key. TV Guide recently accused you of \\"conduct unbecoming a network news anchor\\" because you sang \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth\\" on the David Letterman show with the rock group R.E.M. A: Oh, that was so ridiculous. Everyone knows I can't sing in a bucket with a lid on it. I laughed when I read that. What does \\"conduct unbecoming an anchor\\" mean, anyway? Q: It means you're not being grave enough for a guy telling the country about Bosnia. A: Verrrrry interesting. Conduct unbecoming an anchor is \\"selling out.\\" You know, most of the time I'm accused of being too grave. All this comes under the heading of \\"Either way you go, you're going to catch it.\\" If you read the news in a deep baritone, they are going to say, \\"God, he's stuffy.\\" If you let any part of your other self show, it's \\"conduct unbecoming an anchor.\\" Q: Can you envision Ed Murrow singing with R.E.M.? A: Yes, I could. Ed Murrow, you know, was roundly criticized for sitting down and just talking to Marilyn Monroe! That was his equivalent of singing with R.E.M. Q: The R.E.M. song is actually about your 1986 assault, when one of the people who attacked you said, most oddly, \\"Kenneth, what's the frequency?\\" What I recall about the coverage at the time was that there wasn't a lot of sympathy for you. It was played as, \\"Well, weird things always happen to Dan Rather.\\" A: And as with so many other things, I shrugged my shoulders and thought, \\"This is what comes with the territory.\\" Who knows what it was about? A lot of people get very badly hurt in assaults. I came away lucky.   When Michael Stipe  [ lead singer of R.E.M. ]  was in New York last, I did talk with him about why he wrote this song, which I like a lot. He said that one of the themes he thinks about is the surreal and unexplainable things that happen. He remembered this as a kind of crazy surreal experience of the kind a lot of people go through. Q: Speaking of the surreal, do you have any insight on why a journalist with Diane Sawyer's reputation would participate in something like her \\"interview\\" with Michael Jackson? According to newspaper reports, the singer was able to alter his appearance on the videotape and choose the format. A: With this kind of program, the problem is a servility to ratings. Listen, Michael Jackson can produce a 42 share. Dyn-o-mite! There isn't an executive in television who doesn't lust for a 42 share! And once we get ourselves into that obsession, we are all very close to making that mistake. Even the best among us. Q: How do you rate your competitors -- do you ever envy them? A: They are all very decent, classy people -- Peter, Tom and Bernie Shaw. Peter has a sense of elegance about him, which I greatly admire. Tom has a steadiness and unflappability that I especially admire. Bernie has a terrific tenaciousness, but with it, an ability to make it no big deal most of the time. It doesn't even show.

''Avenues A, B, C, and D form a dirty appendage to Manhattan . . . these Alphabet Blocks have become Indian country, the land of murder and cocaine.'' Well, sort of. This novel is too amiable for murder, except of the comic-book variety - lots of Eeech! and Yuch! but not a great deal of pain. In fact, the novel is remarkably like a comic book - I mean the kind with pictures - in tone, in lively vernacular and juxtaposition of disparate elements. It is sort of about Sarah, a pockmarked woman from Bayonne, N.J., who becomes a nurse in Saigon, South Vietnam, and then den mother to a band of misfits in an abandoned synagogue on the lower east side of a city vaguely like New York. But the book isn't really about Sarah","excerpt":"rather, it contains her every so often. And it contains her boyfriend, Howie, who learns magic from Vietnam's Montagnards (called ''yards'' here) and is left by the war pulling shrapnel from his hair, addicted to poison. And it contains the various machinations of an omnipotent C.I.A.-like agent called The Preacher. Or is he K.G.B.? Or are they different? And do they perhaps both work for a super-agency run by a publisher in New York? We are not asked to believe any of this. It's just so many alphabet blocks thrown together - a few mild jokes about Henry James and his critics (who here are thugs for the super-agents), some surprising transpositions (the black market currency in Ho Chi Minh City is Mont Blanc pens), a few James Bond-like exploits and a lot of friendly, slangy writing.

I did so reluctantly, as I am generally both set in my ways and loyal to a fault. Yet I feel I am not abandoning the Book Review","excerpt":"rather, it has abandoned me, along with most of its own traditions.    There is not a single thing I like about the Book Review's recent face-lift, but those cosmetic changes only make more obvious a gradual transformation that has taken place over the past several years. The Book Review has become, perhaps deliberately, more like the world in general and the rest of the media in particular -- flashier, more superficial and less respectful of its audience. The cover now shouts the editors' selection of the most important review of the week (a choice I would just as soon make for myself), which is further expounded upon in the loud and self-indulgent Up Front column. Other front-page teasers feature more People You've Heard Of, be they authors, reviewers or book subjects. I could equally well do without the gossipy Inside the List column, which covers literature in much the same way the networks cover politics. It typically highlights yet another celebrity author who, having made a name for himself in some other arena, has now written a book about it. Likewise, the tendency of the Letters column nowadays is to emphasize the comments of authors, editors, reviewers and subjects of books, to the near exclusion of mere readers, unless of course they happen to be famous as well.    Your publication has gradually become less like the Book Review and more like People magazine, attempting at every turn to leverage itself on the celebrity of those it covers. What finally pushed me over the edge was the new policy of including head shots of many authors. It is an unwelcome intrusion of the world of admen, image consultants and television into the quieter realm of the written word, where one could, at least until very recently, seek refuge.

You can be a traveler in Paris -- that most touristy of cities -- if somehow you break through the surface of the cafe and get invited for Sunday dinner with your waiter's family.

But most writers give the impression that they are above the mundane concerns of cheap hotels and are traveling in an altogether higher, and more trailblazing, sphere.

Quick transition of scenes tends to disturb the continuity, but in other respects the direction of Vittorio DeSica reveals keen and sympathetic understanding of the nature of embittered, frustrated youth.Fascism's bequest to the children of Italy was a bitter cup of gall, and \\"Shoe-Shine\\" is an unrelenting study of the despair and corruption that seared the hearts and minds of so large a part of Italy's future manhood. Mr. DeSica got the inspiration for this film from the hordes of sickly, undernourished and ill-clothed street urchins who followed American troops into Naples, Rome and other cities with their shoe-shine boxes, badgering the GI's with their cries of \\"Shoosha. Joe.\\" Some of these pathetic youngsters became pawns in the hands of unscrupulous black marketeers and, like Giuseppe and Pasquale, were tossed into jail to languish and lose whatever vestige of goodness remained in them while inefficient police authorities half-heartedly sought the real criminals.It is against unjust incarceration and the inhuman handling of such unfortunate victims of war that \\"Shoe-Shine\\" cries out so eloquently. For where compassion should have been exercised, the big stick of authority was applied instead. The reform school in which Giuseppe and Pasquale are confined is a fine breeding place for criminals, for, in addition to suffering snocking physical discomforts, the boys are supervised by corrupt guards who steal from their meager food packages and are always open to bribes.The complete hopelessness with which the film regards the future of these youths is cruelly dramatized by the brutal, though accidental, death Giuseppe meets at the hands of his friend, Pasquale, after a prison break. The only heartening thing about \\"Shoe-Shine\\" is the knowledge that this film was instrumental in bringing about reforms in the treatment of juvenile delinquents in Italian institutions, for the picture offers no solution to the problem it presents.Director DeSica, working with boys who never before had faced a movie camera, much less acted, has done a masterful job in coaching his cast. Rinaldo Smordoni as Giuseppe and Franco Interlenghi as Pasquale are so genuine one never for a moment thinks of them as actors, and, indeed, they arc not, for theirs are naturalistic performances devoid of any histrionic techniques. Moreover. Mr. DeSica has peppered the picture with the vulgar mannerisms typical of the street urchins, and the English title translations by Herman G. Weinberg preserve the earthy tone of their talk. \\"Shoe-Shine\\" is not an entertainment","excerpt":"rather, it is a brilliantly executed social document.

Ill, distracted, and weary of performing, night after night, year after year, the old actor, who is referred to only as ''Sir,'' is reluctant to go on stage again. It is England in January of 1942, and outside the theater, the distant rumblings of German air-raids are heard.   ''What play is it tonight?'' the actor absent-mindedly asks, wondering which of his repertory of roles he is to perform.  '' 'King Lear,' Sir,'' says his valet.  Sir, who regards that play as ''the severest test known to an actor,'' reacts to the information with something approaching horror. His response is a single word - ''Impossible.''   Sir, of course, eventually does go on, and as ''The Dresser'' - which opens Thursday at the Brooks Atkinson Theater - proceeds to its end, the fictional actor's production also progresses to its sad and terrible conclusion.

The commander of the British naval expedition forced Pinedo to haul down the Argentine flag and depart. The British then estab lished themselves on the islands and have been there ever since -- except for the unfortunate 74 days of Argentine occupation in 1982.   There could have been no question about Argentine ownership at the time the British seized the islands. There was some question until 1790, but at that point Spain and Britain signed the Nootka Sound Convention, under which Britain recognized Spain's right to its existing territories and agreed not to plant colonies of its own to their south. As Prof. John Gobbel of Yale said in 1927, in what is still regarded as the definitive legal study of the dispute: \\"The Spanish right to the Falklands became absolute at this moment, if indeed it had not been before.\\"   Spain's sovereignty over the islands passed to Argentina when it became an independent state. To assert that sovereignty, Argentina took possession of the islands in 1820 and maintained colonists and official representatives there until 1833, the year when the British arrived and took them by force.

THE VISIT\\""},{"year":"1998","title":"TWO decades ago, when most other states were caught up in the mechanics of manufacturing ever more fish for anglers, Montana decided to go the other way. The state stopped planting trout in streams and tried to seal its borders from fish that did not belong in the cold, Rocky Mountain waters under the Big Sky.    The idea was simple: let nature flourish, and man would be rewarded. Endowed with legendary rivers like the Madison, the Gallatin, the Missouri, the Blackfoot, the Yellowstone and the Bitterroot, Montana had to protect only those streams and, state fish managers hoped, thereby would nourish some of the most bounteous trout habitat the world has ever known.    It worked beyond the most farfetched projections. Without competition from factory fish, the wild trout thrived. Big, red-striped rainbows. Brawling browns. Enormous bull trout. Tough little cutthroats. Anglers from all over the world came to Montana for a chance to hook something that connected them to the wild, to fish that had been fighting off predators since the last ice age receded more than 10,000 years ago.    But then, three years ago, it was discovered that a lethal disease had infected these clean, nutrient-rich arteries of aquatic life and was killing fish by the thousands. Whirling disease, found in 21 states, went on a tear once it entered Montana waters, killing up to 90 percent of rainbow trout.    For all its protection of wild nature, Montana found that it could not be a biological island in the modern age. The disease, caused by a parasite that devours cartilage and ultimately destroys the spines of fish, which end up swimming in maddening circles, is believed to have come to Montana from fish planted here illegally from out of state.    But as this state tries to hold onto its beloved wild trout, it may turn out that the best hope for Montana -- and the rest of the nation, for that matter -- is in looking to its storehouse of at what is going to save wild trout is having wild trout to begin with, this great diversity of backgrounds, genetics and immunities,'' said Richard Vincent, the whirling disease coordinator for the state of Montana.    In the world of fly fishing -- a religion, as the Montana writer Norman Maclean noted in the opening passage of his novella ''A River Runs Through It'' -- people sometimes speak a language known only to other disciples. But the debate over how to protect  wild fish here has led to a broad discussion in places where nymphs, caddis flies and other fishing lures are seldom mentioned.    Instead they talk about clean water, native species and human hubris. Often people are simply trying to make better plant hybrids or boost fish populations. But in introducing exotic species, or in trying to breed a single strain of fish, animal or plant that serves human needs, people can end up with unintended, even disastrous results. So what they are really discussing is how much humans can stir the pot of wild nature without poisoning the soup.     ''Nobody is going to come out and say they are against biodiversity -- that's like saying you're against baseball,'' said John Epifanio, a science researcher with Trout Unlimited, the nation's largest cold-water fish conservation group, which is based in Arlington, Va. ''But the way that most states manage fish, they end up by default being against biodiversity.''    America used to be a trout cornucopia. Just as bison and grizzly bears roamed much of the country -- grizzlies living in what is now Los Angeles, bison grazing as far east as Chicago -- trout flourished wherever a cold-water stream bubbled up from the ground. During their epic journey of 1804 to 1806, Lewis and Clark named 122 different animal species or subspecies previously unknown to science. One of the best known today is cutthroat trout.    Nearly a hundred years ago, different states tried to boost their trout populations artificially. Wild fish were captured, their eggs and sperm mixed, and then small fish were released into the waters. These fish, at least, learned early to compete in the wild.    The next step was growing fish in cement ponds, saving them for release until they were big enough to catch. This started biologists down the road of trying to breed a type of fish, narrowing the gene pool. The practice was, and still is, widespread throughout most state fish and wildlife departments.    ''In their infinite wisdom, the states decided to make their own brood stock -- the Frankenstein fish, the one that fit the image of every fisherman's dream,'' said Jim Edmondson, the executive director of Caltrout, a fish conservation group in California. ''They had to breed a fish that's docile and tolerant of living in a concrete pond and eating pellets, one that grows quickly.''    Hatcheries multiplied, most state fish managers say, in direct response to the number of licensed fishermen. People wanted to take home their dozen trout on opening day, and the only way to insure that was to dump millions of hatchery-raised fish into lakes, ponds and rivers.    But what has happened is that the hatchery-bred fish have killed off many of the wild trout, an outcome nobody wanted. These fish compete with the wild ones for food, and even though they are more vulnerable to disease, they usually outnumber the wild fish by such a high ratio that they threaten the native species. The so-called Frankenstein fish also interbreed, narrowing the genetic diversity because as they propagate, they do so with a less varied genetic map. And the more homogenous the gene pool, the greater the likelihood that disease can wipe out whole strains of fish.    ''You dump 300 fish into a stretch of stream, and what you're left with is a biological desert,'' Mr. Edmondson said. ''We just keep manufacturing fish by the millions because that's where the money is. But if hatcheries are so good, how come so many fish are going extinct?''    Whirling disease has brought this problem into focus, pointing to the risk of assuming that people can build a better fish.    Up to a third of all native fish species in America are now threatened, endangered or could be considered candidates for extinction, according to the Nature Conservancy.     The plea of wild-fish managers is not that all hatcheries should close","excerpt":"rather, that there should be a place for planted fish -- urban lakes, reservoirs and ponds, for example -- and that free-flowing, clean streams should be left to the wild.    This debate is particularly resonant in Colorado, which has long embraced the hatchery system. Infected hatchery fish have been poisonous to Colorado's wild system. All but two of the state's major river drainages are infected with the parasite that causes whirling disease, state researchers recently found, and they blame the manufactured fish for spreading it.    Colorado fish managers concede that mistakes were made. They say they are now trying to protect their wild-fish populations by being more cautious about where they plant hatchery fish and by no longer planting fish that they know have been infected with the parasite that causes the disease. (So far, officials say, the contaminated fish do not pose a health risk to humans.)     ''No question, the state learned a great deal from all of this,'' said Todd Malmsbury, a Colorado Division of Wildlife spokesman.    There is pressure in other states to slow, or at least re-examine, the hatchery programs. The state of Washington has more than 90 hatcheries, but new trout and salmon species are listed as endangered every day. To protect the remaining wild salmon in Washington, some hatcheries are shutting down.     California, with its population of 33 million people, is not a place normally associated with wild trout. Still, it has the greatest diversity of trout of any state in the United States -- 10 species, including such legendary fish as the Lahontan cutthroat, which grows to 30 pounds, and golden trout, which lives in the High Sierra. But state officials say the hatchery system may be putting these wild native fish at risk.     Some fish managers are looking for a so-called magic bullet, a superfish resistant to disease that could be mass-produced, as a solution to the whirling disease crisis. The problem with this approach, others say, is that these fish would then be vulnerable to other diseases and therefore wipe out even more fish. Here in Montana, they look to the wild.    AS it turns out, a strain of fairly obscure wild rainbows, call redband trout, lives above waterfalls in the high elevations of northwest Montana. Early tests indicate that these fish are not adversely affected by the parasite that causes whirling disease. Whether this is because they have evolved a resistance over the years or because they are isolated is still an open question.     Genetic diversity has also helped California cope so far with the disease. Whirling disease came to the Truckee River system in the Sierras decades ago. But now most trout, virtually all wild, have flourished in the Truckee, and the disease is not a real problem there. It may be that because the river is managed as a wild system, nature has produced fish that can live with the parasite, biologists say.    ''I have a great deal of confidence in the power of nature,'' Mr. Edmondson, of Caltrout, said. ''But the power of nature requires patience. We live in an era of instant gratification.''

Chayym Zeldis's latest novel is a Middle Eastern version of Romeo and Juliet in which an Arab girl and Jewish boy fall in love in Jerusalem amid circumstances assuring that tragedy and destruction are to be their fate. Mr. Zeldis is a gifted writer and, here, as in his earlier books, he demonstrates a thorough knowledge of the culture and history of the region. The flaws of ''A Forbidden Love'' have little to do with history or locale","excerpt":"rather, they are of a literary sort. The characters are too starkly painted, the plot is overladen with coincidence and entirely too predictable. It is hard to take the characters seriously since all of them are pure incarnations of good and evil - the bad guys smack their lips and the good guys, even in the midst of crises, are never less than well-mannered. As in ''West Side Story'' and other modern versions of the Shakespearean tale, the lovers are doomed from the start. Given the frequency of the warnings, posted as large as billboards and written on every other page, the characters appear more foolish than tragic when they finally do succumb to their fate. And then there is the matter of the author's point of view. There are good and decent Arabs and good and decent Jews among Mr. Zeldis's characters, but the Arabs seem to have the monopoly on evil. Depending on the point of view, one may or may not be disturbed by this fact. IN SHORT"},{"year":"1982","title":"AFEW call it ''parity.'' Others cry of ''mediocrity.''

During the 1960's and 70's, the filmmaker formerly known as George Landow (he changed his name in the 70's) created a number of short films that the theorist P. Adams Sitney classified as ''structural'' in his book ''Visionary Film.'' This designation has nothing to do with structural linguistics, but instead describes ''epistemologically oriented'' films that are determined by form rather than content. In simple terms, these films don't tell stories, per se (Mr. Land's films, however, do tell plenty of jokes)","excerpt":"rather, they explore the materiality of the medium and the processes by which viewers make meaning. As the sometimes long and baffling titles of Mr. Land's films suggest (''New Improved Institutional Quality: In the Environment of Liquids and Nasals a Parasitic Vowel Sometimes Develops,'' from 1976), this is not work that readily opens itself up to easy interpretation. That said, it is certainly possible to derive a great deal of pleasure from a film like ''Wide Angle Open Saxon'' even if you do not know that this 1975 short is ''about'' a man who undergoes an epiphany while watching an avant-garde film -- an avant-garde film that, as it happens, is itself a meanly funny parody of the kind of structural films championed by Mr. Sitney. Mr. Land, apparently, did not embrace Mr. Sitney's classification of his work and made several films in response. These films, along with earlier landmark works like ''Film in Which There Appear Edge Lettering, Sprocket Holes, Dirt Particles, Etc.'' (above, with Mr. Land inset), are essential viewing for those who cling to the beleaguered, perhaps even sentimental idea that film is an art.

Conventional wisdom has gone out the window, however, as the political imperatives of an election year have yielded to the economic imperative of curbing a prolonged recession.   ''Overriding concern for the economy is shoving traditional politics onto the back burner,'' said Representative Gillis W. Long of Louisiana, chairman of the 243-member House Democratic caucus, in an attempt to explain the unusual series of events on Capitol Hill in the past 10 days.   Traditions were scuttled in a manner that puzzled many Capitol Hill observers and created the impression of a topsy-turvy Congress.  Only a few months ago many Hill experts expressed skepticism that Congress would break with tradition and enact a major tax bill four months before Election Day. They pointed out that six of the 11 Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee were running for reelection, along with four of the nine Democrats. A vote for a major tax bill this close to an election was widely regarded as an invitation to political oblivion.

SCHUMPETER of Harvard, the great historian of economic analysis, hailed capitalism for its contributions to rationality and honesty in dealing with the facts of society and nature.   ''Capitalist practice,'' he said, ''turns the unit of money into a tool of rational cost-profit calculations, of which the towering monument is double-entry bookkeeping.'' By crystallizing rationality and defining it numerically, the cost-profit calculus propelled the logic of enterprise and began its ''conqueror's career subjugating - rationalizing - man's tools and philosophies, his medical practice, his picture of the cosmos, his outlook on life, everything in fact, including his concepts of beauty and justice and his spiritual ambitions.''   But, despite this Schumpeterian tone poem in celebration of capitalist rationality, one realm of life may escape for a time the logic and discipline of the market and cost-profit calculations: politics.

This was, after all, the conclusion of a three-concert series in Carnegie Hall called \\"The Revolution of Expression,\\" a welcome attempt at thematic programming. Mr. Rattle has also established a strong reputation for musical insight and for idiomatic interpretations of 20th-century music. And the orchestra, far from being a provincial group, has developed a large following through its EMI recordings and is acclaimed in its native England.   But instead I found myself less than fully engaged. There was, of course, much to respect. The orchestra has an enviable relationship with Mr. Rattle, who became its principal conductor in 1980 and was just made its music director. The players seem comfortable both with him and with one another, a phenomenon not to be taken for granted. It may not be an ensemble of virtuoso soloists, but it has a distinctive sound, if a bit wiry and emphatic and tending to accent the openings of phrases.

Symphonists before and after him wrote works that might be the centerpieces of concert programs but that nevertheless must share the spotlight. With a couple of exceptions -- the First and Fourth Symphonies -- Mahler's symphonies are so expansive as to require evenings to themselves. It's a good thing, because these works are as emotionally draining as they are long, and they require an involvement that would render the side dishes on the traditional concert menu irrelevant, even irritating.   What Mahler painted on these vast sonic canvases are visions of mortality and the vain struggle to defeat it. These are not visions of heaven (although in the finale of the Fourth, Mahler suggests one view of it), but of life and death in the here and now, with extremes of elation and despair transformed into musical topography. It is music that lends itself to peculiar exegeses: read enough Mahler essays and you encounter theories, advanced seriously, suggesting that Mahler's symphonies embody predictions of both world wars, racial strife and other calamities that have befallen the world since Mahler's death in 1911. It is as if the music's tragic scope is too great to be merely autobiographical.

On Tuesday night at the Bottom Line, songs from Ms. Faithfull's new album, \\"A Secret Life\\" (Island) and her earlier ones coalesced into a chronicle of connections made and broken, every one leaving a scar.    Her voice sounded as natural as a tree shattered by lightning, though there was craft in the way it cracked at the bitterest moments, and in the calm she brought to warnings like one in \\"The Wedding\\": \\"When you leave me I will haunt you.\\" Yet the drama in her songs has nothing to do with virtuosity; it is an almost voyeuristic glance into someone else's remembered pain. True to diva tradition, Ms. Faithfull uses her audience's knowledge of her own life, from her 1960's reign as Mick Jagger's consort to her slide into drug use. She sang the Rolling Stones's \\"Ruby Tuesday,\\" delivering the line \\"Yesterday don't matter if it's gone\\" in a voice full of bleak memories.

Though the sound system did its best to subvert his set, Mr. Charles used a whole raft of devices to draw the audience into a world of his own making. Backed by the Philip Morris Superband, Mr. Charles used stop time breaks, setting his voice against silence, or sang a call-and-response duet with the guitarist Kenny Burell. He played an achingly beautiful and slow duet with the bassist Ray Brown, and sang a host of familiar songs, from \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" to \\"What'd I Say?\\" When Mr. King came out to join him for a short, promising final blues, he wrung meaning out of tunes that should have lost their resonance years ago.

For many musicians, a boxed set is still mainly a summation of past releases with a few rarities thrown in. Some releases take the large storage capacity of CD's as reason to forget selectivity, boxing whole catalogues of recordings in giant sets. Recording companies have also taken heart from the big sales of ''The Beatles Anthology'' series of unearthed recordings. An increasing number of boxed sets present material that used to be the province of bootleggers: live shows, alternative takes and unreleased songs, as if recording companies are rushing to release everything they own before the millennium.    Here, the pop music and jazz critics of The New York Times assess a selection of this year's boxed sets.

It can take away energy, creativity,  even talent. Until the very end, however, it can't rob musicians of their soul and depth of feeling. On Wednesday night at Avery Fisher Hall, the 63-year-old Ray Charles was onstage for no more than 45 minutes. He didn't play his electric piano much, and his vocals were often drowned out by the 17-piece, brass-heavy Ray Charles Orchestra. But, in the short amount of time he performed at this JVC Jazz Festival event, Mr. Charles moved many audience members to tears.         Mr. Charles's emotional impact came from his musical frugality. His slightest keyboard glissando or squeal of delight added more intensity to each song than any horn section could ever have conjured. He played the piano as if it were the third rail of a subway track. Every key his fingers touched sent his body into convulsions. His vocals were just as spare and expressive. In \\"Knock on Wood,\\" he shifted from a long, low melisma to a punchy falsetto, isolating soul music,  the genre that his early work gave birth to, into its separate components of gospel and rhythm-and-blues.

It is relatively easy when just one suit has been bid by the defending side -- the doubler wants that suit led. But what if each defender has bid a suit?   The normal tendency is for the leader to choose his partner's suit, since that is not a play that is likely to cost a trick. Theory therefore indicates that the double should be a diversion -- the doubler wants his partner to lead his own suit.   Consider the diagramed deal from a Westchester pairs event played last month. North was Roy Hill of White Plains, and he followed his negative double of one heart with a highly optimistic raise of one no-trump to three no-trump. He was no doubt nervous when East doubled, intending to call for a spade lead.   The lead of the spade ten would have given the defense the first five tricks, with a chance of one or two more depending on the eventual play of the club suit. But West led the heart king, theoretically correct, and South won with the ace.   The declarer was Ritsuko Kai of Scarsdale, N.Y., and she cashed four diamond winners ending in the dummy. She then took her life in her hands by leading the club ten for a finesse. This was an inspired guess, for it brought home the doubled game and she and her artner won the event by a single match point.   If she had misguessed in clubs, as she might well have done since West was known to have the majority of the missing clubs, the result would have been down four, for a penalty of 800 and a bottom score instead of a top.

On the traditional side is a performance of Bach's \\"Christmas Oratorio,\\" to be presented in its entirety by the Taghkanic Chorale and Amor Artis Orchestra playing period instruments under the direction of Johannes Somary. The concert will be held at the Paramount Center for the Arts, at 1008 Brown Street in Peekskill.   The first cantata of the three-hour Baroque masterpiece was first performed with Bach himself conducting on Christmas Day, 1734, in Leipzig's St. Thomas Church. The other cantatas were heard on the second and third days after Christmas, New Year's Day and the Feast of Epiphany. Composed as a collection of six cantatas, rather than following a single biblical text as most oratorios do, the work is woven together by recitations.   Soloists in Saturday's performance are Susanne Peck, soprano","excerpt":"Ray Pellerin, countertenor; Patrick Romano and Thom Baker, tenors, and John Eppler, bass.   \\"Hallelujah Holidays,\\" a family Christmas-Hanukkah-Kwanzaa spectacular by the New Orchestra of Westchester will be performed in the Performing Arts Center Concert Hall at the State University of New York at Purchase.

Next on the bill is a mini-version of Dickens's \\"Christmas Carol,\\" presented by the Phoenix Theater. Miller Lide will serve as narrator; Vernon Morris will portray Scrooge, and Bram Lewis, the theater's artistic director, will be Bob Cratchit. Projections of George Cruikshank's original drawings for the novel will provide backdrops for the costumed actors.   Robert Sherman of WQXR will then narrate \\"G.A.G.E. -- The Story of Silent Night,\\" accompanied by the orchestra. The letters are the first four notes of the beloved carol.   In addition, a rousing chorus of more than 200 voices from the Westchester Choral Society, the Master Singers of Westchester and the Dobbs Ferry Harmonaires Children's Chorus, with Diana Solomon-Glover, soprano, and Andre Solomon-Glover, baritone, will join in songs from the Caribbean, familiar carols and excerpts from Handel's \\"Judas Maccabaeus\\" and \\"Messiah.\\"   The third concert is Westchester Community College's \\"Too Hot to Handel,\\" a version of the composer's \\"Messiah\\" featuring rock, rhythm and blues, jazz, gospel and pop.
