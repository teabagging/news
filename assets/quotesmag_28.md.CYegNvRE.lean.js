Their aim is to clear the city of insurgents one house at a time and eventually take several large public buildings in the heart of the city.   A1    The American offensive in Falluja will provide a crucial gauge of the Iraqi insurgency, testing the view that the resistance can be subdued in time for Iraqi elections in January. The operation will also be a key test of the Iraqi forces, since it is crucial that Falluja not be seen solely as an American operation.   A11    Tentative Agreement With Iran  Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi of Iran praised the outcome of weekend talks with European negotiators, saying that a preliminary agreement had been reached to suspend Iran's production of enriched uranium immediately. But he emphasized that any suspension would only be temporary.   A6    Attack on Dutch Muslim School  A bomb damaged a Muslim elementary school in the Netherlands. The authorities believe the attack was intended as an act of revenge for the killing of a Dutch filmmaker, which has unleashed widespread anger toward the country's growing conservative Muslim population. No one was hurt in the attack.   A3    Anti-French Violence in Abidjan  French and Ivory Coast military commanders appealed for calm in Abidjan, as thousands of government supporters formed a human shield around President Laurent Gbagbo's neighborhood after hearing reports that French tanks were assembling there. France took pains to say it had no intention to oust Mr. Gbagbo.   A3    NATIONAL   A15-20    Bush's Detainee Policy Deemed Unconstitutional  A federal judge ruled that President Bush had both overstepped his constitutional bounds and improperly brushed aside the Geneva Conventions in establishing military commissions to try detainees at the Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, naval base as war criminals.   A1    Voting Rights Cases Unheard  The Supreme Court declined to hear cases from New York and Washington on whether states violate the federal Voting Rights Act when they strip felons of the right to vote.   A19    F.A.A. Facing Tough Decisions  The Federal Aviation Administration is facing some of the same problems that are driving the airlines to bankruptcy, rising costs and declining income, as its essential computers wear out and half of its air traffic controllers near retirement age.   A15    Progress on 9/11 Suggestions  Congressional negotiators reported progress in talks over a bill to enact recommendations of the Sept. 11 commission, agreeing that the Senate had made an important concession to keep secret the size of the nation's intelligence budget.   A14    Kerry Advisers Assess Loss  Senior advisers to Senator John Kerry said he lost because he failed to turn the election into a referendum on the economy, which they attributed to a barrage of foreign policy news and President Bush's success in wielding cultural issues.   A20    Bush Coralled Hispanic Votes  Senator John Kerry won a clear majority of Hispanic votes, but President Bush won about 44 percent of the Hispanic vote, more than any Republican presidential candidate in at least three decades.   A1    The White House said that Mr. Bush asked his chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., to stay for his second term and that Mr. Card agreed.   A20    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-8    Study Looks at Extent Of 9/11 Compensation  The Rand Corporation has released a two-year study that aimed to be the most comprehensive accounting of how much victims and businesses affected by Sept. 11 have been compensated by private and public means.   A1    Admission by Sheik's Lawyer  A federal prosecutor forced Lynne F. Stewart to acknowledge that she was fully aware of the history of terrorist violence by the Egyptian followers of the fundamentalist Muslim client she is accused of aiding illegally.   B1    Domestic Benefits Ruling  A State Supreme Court justice ruled that the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg must carry out a law that requires companies that do business with the city to extend the same benefits to employees' domestic partners that they provide to spouses.

Now a new design is conceived as a stoical nine-story tower standing alongside the existing landmark.   E1    BUSINESS DAY   C1-18    S.E.C.

New Yorkers are increasingly hostile toward the mentally ill homeless. Many would like to see them simply vanish. I am repeatedly asked why we don't reinstitutionalize this population. This question is often voiced by well-meaning individuals.   With the advent of psychotropic drugs and new rehabilitation techniques, involuntary long-term institutionalization is unnecessary. Maintaining a stabilized patient in a hospital turns a hospital into a prison and a patient into a prisoner.   The overwhelming majority of the mentally ill can live in the community. A number of small community-based initiatives funded by my department have reclaimed many from the chaos of street life. These programs must be expanded.   Frustration about the homeless mentally ill should be directed toward a system that maintains unneeded and expensive institutions, not toward those who are sick. Your editorial is a major step in refocusing the debate. BILLY E.

In her new play, which opened last night at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater in Lincoln Center, there are glimmers of her special talent, but not enough to justify the fuzziness of the effort.   The subject is friendship and its opposite, loneliness, as represented by two New Yorkers of decidedly different background and temperament. Mr. Gogol (Mike Nussbaum), an intellectual European refugee of no apparent profession, is living reclusively in a derelict New York apartment. He is surrounded by books, dirty dishes and other detritus of a household that exists without the benefit of housekeeping. Through his spectacularly cluttered set design, John Lee Beatty makes his own commentary about a city dweller's ability to exist in chaos. Amusing sight gags subsequently derive from the set.

Clive Giboire, who edited both this book of correspondence between Georgia O'Keeffe and Anita Pollitzer and the Pollitzer memoir, \\"A Woman on Paper: Georgia O'Keeffe,\\" chose to omit certain important aspects of the relationship between O'Keeffe and Pollitzer, and includes one for which he provides no evidence. Ms. Barnet describes the published result as a record of \\"a friendship broken after years of affinity and trust,\\" which is at odds with my findings in researching my biography of the artist.   Pollitzer and O'Keeffe were close friends between 1914 and 1917. Thereafter their paths diverged, and though the relationship continued, it diminished in intensity. In 1950 Pollitzer wrote a chatty reminiscence about O'Keeffe at art school, and by the mid-50's the possibility arose of her writing O'Keeffe's biography. O'Keeffe gave her approval, and in 1959 Pollitzer produced a first draft. O'Keeffe asked Doris Bry, her assistant, to give Pollitzer editorial help.   Pollitzer was a generous, intelligent woman and a very good friend, but she was not a good writer. The work was full of sentimental cliches, its tone effusive and adulatory. It was one-sided, giving little sense of the pain and challenge of O'Keeffe's life and work -- not at all the serious and objective document O'Keeffe had expected. Bry, who had editorial experience, wrote Pollitzer a long and detailed response, criticizing both style and structure. She urged Pollitzer to sensitize herself to sentimentality and cliches. Style and structure cannot necessarily be learned, however, and after a decade of assistance Bry resigned from the project in 1968. O'Keeffe also offered Pollitzer help with revisions from another friend, to no avail.   Between 1957 and 1965 the manuscript was rejected by Doubleday, Harper's, Scribners, Crowell and Atheneum. The list belies Mr. Giboire's assertion that \\"there is little that could not have been easily corrected by her or by an editor.\\" Pollitzer was undaunted, however, and in late 1967 sent a last draft to O'Keeffe for approval. After reading it, O'Keeffe wrote back in real distress. Her letter was gentle and sensitive: \\"I do not like to say to you what I would say to someone else. . . . You have written your dream picture of me. . . . It is a very sentimental way you like to imagine me -- and I am not that way at all. . . . I appreciate  [ your ]  time, thought, work and effort  [ but ]  I wish you would give up the idea of publishing it. . . . I also know that I cannot prevent you from publishing some sort of book about me.\\"   She offered to pay Pollitzer","excerpt":"recognizing that money was no true compensation, she still felt it would be a clean ending to the unhappy episode. After Pollitzer's death in 1975, O'Keeffe wrote William Pollitzer, Anita's nephew: \\"It has been very hard to say no to Anita. I was very upset over it, but there was nothing else I could do.\\"   Pollitzer's manuscript was very substantially edited and rewritten by Mr. Giboire before being published in 1988. The work was presented as a personal memoir instead of an objective biography. (This was wise, since the book is not a scholarly tool; its many errors include the misidentification of people, Alfred Stieglitz' photography and O'Keeffe's own house.) As O'Keeffe had wanted, the writing was purged of much of its sentimentalism. The edited manuscript was then presented as Pollitzer's own work, free from O'Keeffe's supposed restrictions.   The friendship between O'Keeffe and Pollitzer was at its height a strong and important one. It foundered, five decades later, because professional roles interfered with private ones. The rejection of a manuscript is always excruciating, and doubly so at the hands of a friend. Pollitzer did not recognize her shortcomings as a writer and took personally O'Keeffe's criticism. O'Keeffe was unhappily placed in the role of editor -- a situation most friends avoid assiduously. Both women tried to salvage the situation without pain, but this proved impossible. Mr. Giboire's reference to O'Keeffe's \\"threatening to sue Anita\\" is entirely unsupported and undocumented in \\"Lovingly, Georgia,\\" and William Pollitzer has no knowledge of any such threat.   It is unfortunate that this edited version of the friendship is now being used as a tool to depict O'Keeffe, as Ms. Barnet describes her, as \\"cruel,\\" and her treatment of Pollitzer's manuscript as \\"a denial of the rapport these two women so obviously shared.\\" Scholarship and biography should expand our knowledge of a subject's character and motivation. A limited and judgmental approach expands our true knowledge not at all.   It is ironic that the information surrounding this issue should have been so presented as to suggest that O'Keeffe was trying to manipulate her public persona and to create her own myth. In this case the reverse is true.
