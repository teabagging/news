It is 1953,  and these students are among the thousands of young people orphaned by the Holocaust whom the Youth Aliyah movement relocated in Israel in kibbutz-like communal villages. While they are helping to build the foundation of the emerging Israeli state, beneath their communal hope and idealism lurk horrifying memories and haunting questions that may never be answered.         At the end of the day, when the singing and dancing stop and the lights go out, the ghosts of the past loom large. In the movie's eerie opening scene, the  students methodically comb the muddy fields around the school in search of a runaway classmate who turns out to have drowned himself. The scene echoes their  own desperate flight from the Nazis. One young man, Yurek (Ohad Knoller), who survived in the woods for two years with a younger boy, periodically reverts into a wild-child state in which he dashes around piggybacking the boy (Jeniya Catzan), who emits frightening animal cries.

The action by the grievance committee became public this week when the State Court of Appeals issued a brief procedural ruling on an appeal filed by Ms. Holtzman.    Short of a public censure, disciplinary actions against lawyers are not generally made public. And the one-line Court of Appeals decision denying Ms. Holtzman access to certain disciplinary records for her appeal appeared to have been made public by accident.    The incident in 1987 involved Ms. Holtzman's public assertions that a State Supreme Court Justice in Brooklyn, Irving W.

It now seems to be reaching epidemic proportions.\\nHISTORY: Holographic theory arose in the late 1940's as a way to enhance clarity in the electron microscope. In the 1960's, the hologram reached the general public as a portrait medium, then spent decades gathering dust in trinket shops in the form of eyeball key chains and unicorn stickers.\\nSEEING TRIPLE: The hologram's optical sleight of hand is appearing on album covers, greeting cards, cereal boxes and even California drivers' licenses. Just about everyone carries one around on a credit card. It made the cover of Sports Illustrated with an image of a poker-faced Michael Jordan that broke into a smile when seen from a certain angle. It's appearing on designer belts, Olivier Lapidus suits, and dresses and skirts from Marc Jacobs's spring collection. And when the National Football League wanted to prevent forgeries of Super Bowl tickets and souvenirs this year, it tagged them with holograms of the Super Bowl logo. \\n\\n Bloomingdale's has featured holograms in its windows, and they're embedded in Australia $5 and $10 bills. Archeologists make holograms of perishable discoveries so that the real thing can be stored in a preservative. Furniture designers and the automotive industry plan to use them soon in place of their usual mechanical models, because the images can be transported easily and cheaply. And doctors are making holograms of human organs for study and diagnosis. New technology makes the images bigger and clearer than before, chipping away at the virtual, leaving more of what's real.\\nTHE TECHNOLOGY: Everyday light is a jumble of colors and intensities, like the clamor of Grand Central Terminal at rush hour. But laser light is pure, like a soprano singing a single note on a mountaintop, making it extremely sensitive to the way light patterns reflect an object's shape. When projected onto an object and bounced back onto film, laser light is recorded as a mold. It is then refilled with light to create the three-dimensional effect.\\nTHE ART OF SCIENCE: \\"They're optical concoctions that act like cracks in the wall of reality,\\" said Rudy Berkhout, a Manhattan holographic artist known for his abstract landscapes and figurative impressionism. Russian artists have used holograms to replicate ancient sculpture, bringing artistic media full circle. Or is it full sphere?\\nPICTURE THIS: \\"People are embracing the mysteries of the future in every way,\\" said Stephen Benton, the Allen Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \\"And holograms are beginning to be symbolic of that. Holo-anything has become a metaphor for the visual future.\\" Professor Benton sees three-dimensional television as inevitable. He envisions the movie theater of tomorrow as a highly interactive arena of intense realism, where a small group will choose one member to be its guide through the narrative. His biggest goal is to watch a virtually real football game take place in his living room. \\n\\n And soon traffic lights and billboards may be seen from a whole new perspective.\\nKRISTINA ZIMBALIST THING","excerpt":"Holy Holograms!

The mystical pull of changing millenniums, denied to all past mortals with the exception of those roaming the earth 1,000 years ago, is sparking a wanderlust to the far ends of the planet to mark the moment at midnight on Dec. 31, 1999, when -- take your pick -- either the 21st century dawns or the last year of the 20th century begins a 366-day slide into 2001, which purists argue is the real start of the third millennium.    Who could have guessed that with slightly more than a year to go, the 700 hotel rooms in the tiny island kingdom of Tonga in the remote South Pacific would be booked? Or that suburban couples would be shopping for climbing boots that will help them clamber up rough slopes to observe the first hours of 2000 in Nepal?    Similarly, there has been a mad dash to book cabins on cruise ships, almost any cruise ship as long as it parks under a starry sky on a warm sea at the appointed time and date. So many liners will be straddling the international date line in the Pacific Ocean to let passengers celebrate two New Year's Eves a day apart that crews may need to watch radar screens for oncoming traffic instead of popping corks.    For those with $44,950, that amount will buy a seat on a private long-range jet carrying 88 travelers to witness several hours of Jan. 1, 2000, on the ground on the western side of the international date line in Tonga, one of the first countries to see in the new year. The group will then fly east across the date line to Samoa, where the final minutes of 1999 will be counted down at midnight. (The jet, chartered by TCS Expeditions of Seattle, then continues on a 24-day globe-circling excursion.)    For those craving a more worldly setting, TCS also offers a 20-day private jet tour (for $29,950 a person, double occupancy) that provides a New Year's Eve party in Istanbul at the Ciragan Palace Hotel Kempinski, with swirling belly dancers and whirling dervishes.    TCS says the round-the-world flight has been fully booked and is wait-listed, but space is available on the Great Builders tour, which will visit Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, India, Egypt and Jordan before reaching Istanbul.    For those unfazed by red-eye flights and perhaps terminal jet lag, a group in Johannesburg is trying to get enough passengers to fill a jumbo jet at $7,950 a seat and fly around the southern hemisphere between Dec. 30, 1999, and Jan. 4, 2000, in the company of an orchestra. Heinz F. Rosner, one of the organizers, said the plan is to fly from South Africa to South America to join New Year's Eve celebrations at stopovers in Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile, before experiencing multiple millennium moments on a midnight flight to Tahiti, due to four time zone changes. Then it's on to Auckland, Sydney and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, arriving back in Cape Town and Johannesburg.    For less frenetic souls, the Bitter End Yacht Club in Virgin Gorda, British Virgin Islands, will be host to a 10-day celebration where the outings will be to other islands in the group and where one can hike, sail and sweat out the effects of elaborate dinners and nightly parties. The package costs $10,800 for two in a room.    Most charter sailing vessels and motor yachts in the Virgin Islands and elsewhere in the Caribbean seem already booked for the millennium week, often at two to three times the hefty holiday rates.    ''We've had bookings for more than a year now, and people are going nuts in terms of the prices they're willing to pay,'' said Tom Rowe, a co-owner of Newport Yacht Services of Newport, R.I., a broker for a fleet of privately owned luxury boats for hire.    Mr. Rowe offered as an example a 76-foot sport boat with four double staterooms that normally costs $18,750 a week, including food and drink. ''She's booked for millennium week at $54,500,'' he said, adding mischievously, ''the more modest gougers are asking only twice their usual rates.''    Many of the larger charter boats will be in New Zealand for the America's Cup trials scheduled there for late 1999, and that nation is bracing for an additional influx of travelers who want to be among the first in the world to celebrate the millennium.    The international date line, a manmade contrivance that snakes along the 180th meridian in mid-Pacific Ocean with a zig here and a zag there to avoid splitting nations into different calendar days, falls just to the east of New Zealand. At Gisborne, N.Z., clinging to the northeasternmost point of land, millennium events over several days will range from a tall ships visit to a Maori music festival and the first triathlon of 2000.    Two time zones behind, Sydney, Australia, will host a 24-hour New Year's party which, for Australians, may be just like another Friday night at the pub.    TONGA, a group of 171 islands with a population of 97,000 situated about 1,000 miles north-northeast of New Zealand, will be more intensely affected. Some 10,000 or more visitors aboard cruise ships and chartered flights are expected to join another 3,000 overseas Tongans coming home for the New Year's party, according to Amelia Tupou, spokeswoman with the Tonga Visitors Bureau. Nearly all 700 hotel and resort rooms have already been booked, she said","excerpt":"home stays are being arranged, and those arriving without reservations may have to camp out.    In central India, there will be a millennium observance of a different sort at the 1,000-year-old stone temples at Khajuraho, scene of an annual dance festival. Twenty-two of the original 85 soaring shrines commissioned by Chandal Rajput kings still stand among splendid ruins, and visitors maintain an abiding interest in scores of erotic figures frozen in time on the walls.    Special New Year's Eve tours will ponder the key mystery of the floodlighted temples: Do the groupings of men and women captured in carnal play portray the emptiness of human passion or -- as some scholars believe -- teach that gratification of earthly desires is a step closer to enlightenment? A question, no doubt, that will be posed endlessly that night in countless other milieus and circumstances.    Those seeking more formal surroundings are headed for fancy dress balls in Europe.    One of the hottest tickets is for the Bath Ball in England, a black-tie event normally held every New Year's Eve and limited to 1,300 revelers inside the Bath Pavilion. But the millennium ball has been relocated to a giant multipeaked concert tent on the central recreation grounds near the city's famous Roman baths, and the number has swelled to 8,000. In a country where privilege still counts, 1,000 guests will get to look down on the others from a raised platform where the extra cost of a ticket will include champagne and canapes.    In Vienna, partygoers at the Imperial Ball will be able to waltz into the new millennium inside the elegant state rooms of the Hofburg Palace with music provided by members of the Vienna State Opera and the Volksoper. Tickets start at around $170 for the event, which is almost sold out; hopefuls can try contacting the Hofburg Congress Center directly or tour companies in the United States that have packages.     Luxury hotels and restaurants around the world are offering millennium packages that are being snatched up by well-heeled couples wishing to recapture the romance or sentiment of a previous visit. One offbeat celebration is being planned at the Four Seasons Hotel in London.    The entire hotel near Hyde Park will be themed as an ocean liner and 350 tickets sold to a millennium cruise party, a two-night package going for $3,380 a couple, at a rate of $1.69 to the pound.     For the couple that really wants to get away from all the millennium madness, a ninth-floor suite will have its windows blacked out and soundproofed, clocks and calendars removed, and the guests can order from a menu dating to the first half of the century while watching a selection of black and white movies. (The suite will be auctioned at the highest bid received by June 1, 1999, with a minimum of $1,606 for lodging only, plus 17.5 percent V.A.T.)    If this is too tame, Abercrombie & Kent International is offering a wide selection of high-end millennium tours and cruises to every continent for nearly every taste, whether voyages to Antarctica, safaris in Africa or serendipitous tours of Indochina.    For less money and more exercise, Vermont-based Country Walkers has millennium walking tours in seven countries.    Laurie Brown, a 47-year-old retired wildlife biologist from Little Rock, Ark., has signed up for the hike to the ruins at Machu Picchu in Peru. She said she was inspired by an interest in the medicinal uses of plants and by reports that alien space ships may land there at the dawn of the new millennium.    ''Who knows?'' Ms. Brown mused on the possibility this might actually occur. In any case, it will be less crowded than Times Square.    SHORT of space ships, perhaps the most millennium travel to be squeezed into one New Year's Eve trip will take place in Las Vegas, the chameleon of the desert, never at a loss to masquerade as someplace else.    The Strip now offers monuments to New York, Rio, Egypt, Rome and Camelot. Three new hotel-casinos scheduled to open by 2000 will expand the tour with a 50-story copy of the Eiffel Tower, Venetian canals and gondolas and a setting inspired by Kipling's ''Mandalay,'' with sand beach and artificial waves.     If only the real Paris will do, a walk down the Champs-Elysees on New Year's Eve 1999 is envisioned as a dreamlike passage through a series of giant gates created by a dozen artists. From the Porte Maillot to the Place de la Concorde, including the Arc de Triomphe, the proposed gates would represent a symbolic crossing into the new millennium. Other cities in France are being encouraged to create their own distinctive gates so the French can stroll en masse into the future.    Ringing it in roundly    The British hope to ring in the new millennium with a blast from the past.    At noon on Jan. 1, 2000, the music of thousands of bells will peal across the nation in five minutes of uninterrupted tintinnabulation that will be part of a 15-minute church service.    Organizers want to use the event to revitalize an ancient tradition: the art of English bell ringing.     ''The English are a bit odd in their choice of bells as well as in most everything else,'' said Jane Wilkinson, president of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers.    Most church bells in Europe and elsewhere are, in Ms. Wilkinson's words, ''hung dead,'' tolled by the striking of a hammer or clapper while stationary or swinging in a low arc. English bells, weighing from about 50 pounds to a few tons and mounted on wheels in a church tower, swing in a 360-degree arc when pulled by a rope from below.    An estimated 6,000 churches in Britain have sets of five or more bronze bells. When rung, they produce a rippling chorus, a sound identified with happy affairs of state such as coronations and victory celebrations.    The problem is there are not enough accomplished bell ringers -- one to a bell -- with the skills to manage snaking bell ropes that can launch an unwitting greenhorn toward the ceiling.    ''We hope to train 5,000 new bell ringers by the end of 1999,'' said Ms. Wilkinson. ''I've known people who've been at it for 18 months and still are not good.''    The Millennium Commission, financed by the lottery, is helping restore bells for the New Year's ringing, an event that will have faint echoes in North America, where there are some 35 sets of English-style bells still in use across the continent.    Who's on first?    A few years ago the Republic of Kiribati, some three dozen coral islands scattered across the central Pacific, decided to move eastward the international date line that cut through it, uniting the country within one calendar day and also giving it bragging rights as the first nation to greet the year 2000.     The competition for millennium claims does not end there. New Zealand, for example, boasts a report by the Royal Geographical Society in London that says its Chatham Islands will be the first inhabited places to see the sunrise on Jan. 1, 2000. Samoa, meanwhile, bills itself as the last country to say farewell to the current millennium and the last country to celebrate the arrival of the new one.

Named after James Brady, the former White House press secretary who was wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan, the bill establishes a mandatory waiting period of five working days for the purchases of handguns. Republican and rural Democratic members tacked on an amendment that would end the waiting period regulation in five years, but supporters promised to extend it once it proves effective.

The book is &#8220;The Total Woman,&#8221; by Marabel Morgan, a Miami, Fla., housewife (and proud of it), mother of two girls and a former beauty queen at Ohio State University. The book is a spin&#8208;off of a &#8220;Total Woman&#8221; course that Mrs. Morgan taught, which is now being given in 36 states by alumnae. The book's publisher; Fleming H. Revell, a small, venerable religious publisher out in Old Tappan, N. J., heard about tho course and asked Mrs. Morgan to write a book about it. Now sales are perking along quite nicely and the company admits it was surprised at the response &#8212;thus far, 64,000 copies sold, 100,000 in print and sales at the rate of 3&#8211;5,000 a week. Mrs. Morgan's message for her &#8220;gals,&#8221; as she calls them, includes obedience to one's husband, as well as lots of praise and admiration (try oohing and ahhing over his muscles, for example, as one gal did) quoting from the Bible (frequently), Dr. David Reuben, Ann Landers and Calvin Cooligde and tossing off apothegms such as &#8220;Sex is as clean and pure as cottage cheese,&#8221; Mrs. Morgan ladles out advice and class assignments aimed at putting the &#8220;sizzle&#8221; back in one's marriage. Among the assignments: dress up in something exotically sexy and meet your husband at the door (Mrs. Morgan once employed a baby doll nightgown and white boots: Mr. Morgan chased her around the dining&#8208;room table). There is also advice on bringing up children&#8212;Mrs. Morgan is a disciplinarian&#8212;and the final chapter urges a decision for Christ. Just to show that Christians don't have to be dull, one gal who took the Total Woman course at her local Southern Baptist Church was inspired to welcome her better half at the door dressed solely in black mesh stockings, high heels and an apron. He took one look and shouted &#8220;Praise the Lord!&#8221; If all this sounds tailored for the Bible Belt, it should be pointed out that the book is selling well in the New York City area. Mrs. Morgan's courses probably help publicize It, but it also spreads by word of mouth. Total Woman grads include singer Anita Bryant, Mrs. Jack Nicklaus and several Miami Dolphin wives. Generally, &#8220;The Total Woman&#8221; seems to appeal to young affluent matrons of a conservative bent.

Until last year the strategy seemed successful as HomeFed posted steady profits.
