One of the most pleasant of these villages, and one of the closest to Manhattan, is Nyack, with its red 19th-century brick buildings on Main Street and Victorian mansions overlooking the river. Nyack is the centerpiece of three adjacent communities in Rockland County that at various times were part of one village. Now South Nyack, Nyack and Upper Nyack are separate villages, though the three are known as the Nyacks, with a combined population of 11,800.   In the 1870's the Erie Railroad built a track that ran from Nyack to Hoboken, N.J., ushering in an era of industrial growth. Most of the 19th-century buildings along Main Street are converted factories and warehouses from that era. And in 1955, the Tappan Zee Bridge was built, helping to make Nyack one of many suburban communities in the New York area.   Labeled the \\"Gateway to the West\\" at the time, the bridge in reality linked the New York State Thruway from Tarrytown on the Hudson River's eastern shore to the Nyacks on the west.   As if to underscore the community's commitment to the past, Nyack is home to more than 30 antiques stores. The antiques dealers have formed an association that sponsors an outdoor fair three times a year. The next one is to be held Sunday, May 20, from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. in the center of town, South Broadway and Main Street. Most of the antiques shops are on Broadway and Main Street.

A New York commodities trader who played a major role in emergency medical services in his community and the state, died Wednesday at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center, New York City. Mr. Moore was a commodities futures trader with the New York Commodities Exchange, or COMEX and New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, for 50 years. Later in life he developed a second career, born of his love for boating, as owner of Brown's Point Marina in Keyport. But it was in a volunteer capacity that he may have affected the most lives during his years of service as an emergency medical technician and EMT trainer in Aberdeen. As an EMT trainer, Mr. Moore helped establish the EMT standard among first aid squads throughout the state, said Brian Gelburd, a former captain of the South Aberdeen EMS and longtime friend of Mr. Moore. ''He was instrumental in establishing the program in the state,'' Gelburd said. ''He was a natural leader, he would get on these crusades.'' Mr. Moore joined Matawan Township First Aid (later Aberdeen Township) in 1971. In 1972, he became an EMT and joined the South Matawan Township First Aid Squad (later South Aberdeen). He was a life member of South Aberdeen EMS, served several terms as captain, president and various other offices. He answered thousands of EMS calls, and also served as state testing coordinator for the National Registry of EMTs. After he moved away from Aberdeen, he remained active with the squad as a trainer and even went on calls when he was in the area, Gelburd said. In 1973, Mr. Moore started one of the earliest, if not the earliest EMT training programs for the state Department of Health. He remained coordinator of the Bayshore Area EMT course, one of the longest running programs in the state. He helped establish the pilot program for crash injury management/first responder for the State Police Academy, Sea Girt, which remains part of basic training in the academy. He was extrication training instructor and team captain for the state, and instrumental in bringing the first ''jaws of life'' rescue tool into service in Monmouth County. One of the earliest CPR instructor trainers, he coordinated one of the earliest testing sites at Bayshore Community Hospital, Holmdel. Mr. Moore began his trading career in 1960 as clerk for Anderson, Clayton & Fleming, and later became customers' manager for Bache & Co./Prudential Securities. He then joined Harmon Lichtenstein & Co., the oldest firm on the COMEX. He became a member of COMEX in 1965","excerpt":"NYMEX in 1966; and New York Cotton Exchange (New York Board of Trade) in 1977. He was a licensed broker for National Futures Association; and a member of Copper Club and various trade associations. He was one of the longest-serving members of COMEX. In addition to his commodities work, Mr. Moore was owner and operator of Brown's Point Marina, Keyport, for the past 20 years. He was drawn to the marina business because of his avid interest in boating. Largely through the efforts of his friend Paul Gasior, he acquired the marina in the late 1970s. Brown's Point Marina is one of the most active dealers for Suzuki Marine in the country. Mr. Moore enjoyed nothing more than his twicea-year boat trips to his home in Florida with Gasior, family and other friends. He enjoyed boating so much that he obtained his 200ton boating license through the Coast Guard, upgraded from 100ton. At the time of the World Trade Center disaster, Mr. Moore was staying at his New York apartment near the Trade Center, confined to bed because of his illness. His marina friends, especially Gasior, and Old Bridge Police Chief Jerry Polumbo and George Jensen, rescued him from the building after the Twin Towers' collapse. The building was not damaged, but was unlivable because of the debris from the collapse. In addition to his other pursuits, Mr. Moore served in the National Guard. He graduated from Xavier High School in New York City in 1950, but before that, in 1946, he lied about his age and enlisted in the New York National Guard. He first served in the 102nd Medical Battalion and later was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Medical Corps, 107th Combat Team. He then was battery commander of Battery D955, 2nd Corps; artillery commander of Company D, 106th Infantry; and retired as a captain in the Army Reserve. He was a communicant of St. Clement's Roman Catholic Church, Matawan, and a member of the Knights of Columbus. He moved from Brooklyn to Aberdeen in December 1967. He became active in Little League, Pop Warner and other community organizations. He was a third-degree member of the Knights of Columbus, Cardinal Newman Council, Aberdeen. He received many community service awards including the Elks Club Man of the Year. ''Anyone who ever met Jim will never forget him,'' his family said. ''He left a lasting impression with his charm and sense of humor. Above all, he will be remembered as one of the most generous and giving men in the world. Even those closest to him will never know the extent of his giving and kindness, which is the way he wanted it.'' He was predeceased by two sons, James E. Moore, Jr., in 1975; and Daniel J. Moore, in 1990; a brother, John Moore, in 1997; and a sister, Florence Hunter, in 1961. Surviving are his wife, Anne Kristin Moore of Bainbridge Island, Wash; two daughters, Theresa Olsen of Bainbridge Island, Wash; and Martha MooreStoll of Charlottesville, Va.; a sister, Joan Riordan of Atlanta; a grandson, Joshua Andrew Olsen; and three grand-daughters, Madeline Anne Olsen, Veronica Jae Moore-Stoll, and Isabelle Marie Moore-Stoll. Visiting hours will be from 7 to 9 P.M., Saturday, and 2 to 4 P.M. and 7 to 9 P.M. Sunday at Day Funeral Home, 361 Maple Place, Keyport. A Funeral Mass will be offered 11 A.M. Monday at St. Clement's Church, Matawan. Cremation will be private. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Box E, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021.

The faculty, staff and students of NYU Medical Center deeply mourn the passing of our cherished friend and Trustee, Laurence A. Tisch. A revered alumnus of New York University, Mr. Tisch earned the lasting respect and admiration of all who were fortunate to know him and benefit from his generosity. Because of his passionate belief in the importance of caring for the sick, Mr. Tisch was one of the most generous philanthropists in the history of NYU Medical Center. Today, due in large measure to his support, Tisch Hospital stands as one of the nation's finest hospitals and a place of hope, care and compassion. Mr. Tisch was also one of New York City's most distinguished citizens, a man who embodied the most enduring traditions of service to our community. He was one of our country's most successful business leaders, whose influence will be felt for many years to come. His contributions to the arts, culture and education have left an indelible mark on our city and have improved the lives of many of our fellow citizens. The entire NYU Medical Center family will be forever grateful to Mr. Tisch for his years of leadership and support. On this sad occasion, we extend our deepest sympathies to this beloved wife, Billie, his children, Andrew, Daniel, James and Thomas, his brother, Bob, and the entire Tisch family. Kenneth G.

The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art note with deep sadness the passing of Laurence Tisch, a dedicated benefactor and friend. He made enormous contributions to the Metropolitan Museum, both through his keen vision as Trustee (1983 to 1999) and then Trustee Emeritus, and through his personal generosity. His many gifts to the Metropolitan since the 1980s included support of the 1986 exhibition ''Treasures from the Holy Land: Ancient Art from the Israel Museum.'' And in 1987, with his brother Bob, he enhanced visitors' experiences of special exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum immeasurably by making a donation through the Tisch Foundation for the construction of The Tisch Galleries. Thousands of museum goers each day have visited these spacious galleries in the years since--experiencing a thrilling variety of major exhibitions, from 30 centuries of Mexican art to masterworks of painting and drawing from Europe, treasures from imperial China, and Renaissance tapestries. He explained his commitment to the Metropolitan by saying that it held a special place in the life of his family, as the country's greatest art museum and at the same time as their own beloved local museum. We will greatly miss the far-reaching wisdom, passion and dedication of this great New Yorker, and offer condolences to his wife Billie and to the entire Tisch family. James R. Houghton Chairman Philippe de Montebello Director David E. McKinney President     TISCH--Laurence A. The Board of Directors of Loews Corporation deeply mourns the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Larry Tisch, the co-founder and co-chairman of Loews. His wisdom, intellectual honesty and integrity have been an inspiration to us all. Larry Tisch was a business visionary, and his philanthropic leadership and sense of civic duty were unparalleled. With his brother, Bob, Larry built Loews Corporation into one of the largest diversified financial corporations in the United States. In 1959, he and his brother acquired a substantial interest in Loew's Theatres, Inc., which was the predecessor of Loews Corporation. Together, they built Loews into the major corporation it is today, including subsidiaries: CNA Financial Corporation, Lorillard, Inc., Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc., Bulova Corporation, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation, and the original business which grew from one small hotel they purchased in 1946, Loews Hotels. Larry's most important legacy is his significant contributions to the human services, educational, civic and charitable communities. He was a lifelong contributor to the City and the country where his family has achieved great success. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Billie, his sons, Andrew, Dan, Jim and Tom, his brother and lifelong partner, and our cochairman, Bob and wife Joan, and to the entire Tisch family.     TISCH--Laurence A. The entire F.E.G.S. Health and Human Services family mourn the passing of Laurence A. Tisch, an exemplary leader in business and philanthropy.

His brilliance and commitment flow throughout this extraordinary family to benefit our Jewish and larger communities. We are fortunate to have his son, James Tisch, as a cherished member of the F.E.G.S. Board and as its past President and Chair. Jim's wife Merryl has been instrumental at UJA-Federation of New York in helping F.E.G.S. and other Federation agencies make their needs known to government. Larry and his beloved wife Billie had no limits on their caring and their sense of giving back to society and to the Jewish community here, in Israel, and around the world.

Mr. Heyman's extraordinary leadership, as Chair of the Development Committee of NYU's Board of Trustees, 1978-1999, was in large measure responsible for the rise of the university from a regional school to a residential research and teaching institution of international distinction. Highly esteemed by men and women in the business and philanthropic communities, he chaired, with huge success, NYU's three campaigns which raised more than $2.2 billion, enabling NYU to be the first American university to undertake a drive to raise $1 billion, completing the goal five years early. George's leadership in development was matched by magnificent personal generosity, for which he was named a charter member of the Sir Harold Acton Society. For extraordinary service to NYU, he was awarded the Albert Gallatin Medal; the Distinguished Service Award from the Leonard N.
