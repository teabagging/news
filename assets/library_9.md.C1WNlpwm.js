The middle-class extended family that spends its yearly vacations at this idyllic retreat is meant to seem much too complacent for its own good and for anyone else's.As the director Gunnel Lindblom sees it, the ills of the world don't intrude enough to spoil these merry Swedes' good time, and whenever anyone has a bad dream, Grandma, who is a physician, merely prescribes sleeping pills. The family takes its greatest satisfactions in the lake, the flowerbeds and the freshly baked bread.Naturally enough, there are a few termites in the woodwork: The women are lonely, the men are weaklings, and the children are growing up without proper supervision. These things are pointed out by great-grandpa and by grandma's social-worker friend, older people who are wise enough to realize that subsequent generations have gotten further and further out of line. \\"It's a disgrace to be a human being today, woman,\\" says the social worker at last, in a rather blunt and unconvinicing moment of pique.Miss Lindblom, an actress who worked with Ingmar Bergman in films such as \\"The Seventh Seal\\" and \\"Wild Strawberries.\\" fills \\"Summer Paradise\\" with hints of trouble and indications that a great deal is being swept under the rug. However, she never manages to suggest that the family genuinely gives a hoot about any of this, and the film's glimpses of bourgeois guilt are singularly unaffecting. When unrest finally does burst forth at the end of the story, it comes as a bolt out of the much-too-blue sky.Miss Lindblom's point may very well be that people who live life too comfortably aren't even capable of intelligent or moving regret, but that's a poor premise on which to construct a drama","excerpt":"she winds up with two hours' worth of ripples in the water and not a single wave.She also has a tendency to undercut her own points through overemphasis: A lower class mother and son, very conspicuous brunettes in a sea of blondes, are treated with wildly exaggerated rudeness by the others. When, at the end of the film, the little boy sits dejectedly on the lawn, Miss Lindblom photographs him in the foreground of a larger shot, then makes the point in the closeup, and then in even closer closeup than that.Miss Lindblom gets some vivid characterizations out of a distinguished Swedish cast, and she is particularly successful in presenting scenes between lovers with an equal appreciation of male and female sensuality.But there is no sense of real darkness beneath the film's patently artificial light, and the viewer is finally swamped by those very same middle-class amenities that Miss Lindblom means to deplore. One does wind up feeling sick to death of nice-looking people with nicely manageable problems, but that's apparently only half of what Miss Lindblom had in mind.

Starring in the production will be another elusive creature, Amanda Plummer, whose infrequent stage appearances are always worth noting.

Although Ms. Plummer will be making her Stratford Festival debut, her arrival is a homecoming of sorts. Now the whole family will have played Stratford. Her parents -- Christopher Plummer and Tammy Grimes -- are both alums. Her father's triumphant performance in ''King Lear'' was a highlight of recent Stratford seasons, and theater buffs may also recall that Mr. Plummer appeared in the original Broadway production of ''The Lark'' in 1955, playing the Earl of Warwick opposite Julie Harris's Joan of Arc. The Stratford production, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, will use the same Lillian Hellman adaptation, but this time, Joan's trial will unfold against the backdrop of Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943.

Two months after obtaining his license, the new ''Doctor'' O'Brien sued for divorce.

One of the two, of course, is David Letterman. She has just become the other, with \\"Lauren Hutton and . . . ,\\" a syndicated 30-minute nightly program that has the makings of a hipper version of the old NBC program \\"Later With Bob Costas.\\" (In New York, \\"Lauren Hutton and . . . \\" follows Mr. Letterman's \\"Late Show\\" and Tom Snyder's \\"Late Late Show\\" on WCBS-TV, at 1:37 A.M.)    There also seems to be room for at least one gap in prime time: Ms. Hutton is a regular on \\"C.P.W.,\\" the new hourlong drama on CBS. Which raises the inevitable impossible-schedule question.    \\"You're saying, how mean can I get for lack of sleep?\\" she said. \\"I'm learning to do with much less. I realize I led a very coddled existence. When I was a model, I would model for two months and I'd be running out of smiles and I'd go off to Africa for two months and come back and next time, Malaysia. Well, them days are over.\\"    But she did not trade in her six-months-on, six-months-off schedule for a traditional desk-and-couch format. For one thing, she is a woman in a field long dominated by hosts who are men. For another, \\"Lauren Hutton and . . . \\" is not videotaped, as Mr. Costas's show was, but filmed, on 16-millimeter film, by the fashion photographer Luca Babini. Ms. Hutton says there has never been a talk show produced on film","excerpt":"she works in 12-minute segments, which lets the camera operators reload during commercial breaks.    No wonder Ms. Hutton's set is more like a movie set than a television studio, with softer lighting, tighter shots and stylish editing. \\"We've created an atmosphere to relax guests and create a chemistry so we can go beyond small talk,\\" Ms. Hutton said. She has completed 108 episodes, interviewing everyone from Kathleen Turner, who talked about her first kiss (but Ms. Hutton managed to say more about hers), to the rap star LL Cool J to the marine biologist Sylvia Earle to the anthropologist James Shreeve.     Mr. Babini, a former choreographer and director of visual art at the Gomma Gutta Fine Art Academy in Genoa, Italy, first encountered Ms. Hutton while making a documentary that quickly became a kind of pilot for \\"Lauren Hutton and . . . \\" Eventually they sent it to Pat Mitchell, the president of Turner Original Productions, a unit of Ted Turner's empire. Ms. Mitchell gave it to Jane Fonda, who gave it to Mr. Turner and said, \\"This is going to revolutionize talking heads,\\" said Ms. Hutton.    \\"And Miss Jane knows her films,\\" she added. \\"We figured they'd come back and ask for, you know, maybe four documentaries over a year. They came back and asked for 180, and before we knew it, it's like stepping in this noose that you drew yourself and suddenly we're hanging upside down from a tree.\\"    But Ms. Hutton is not hanging alone. On her staff are veterans of the talk-show wars like her supervising producer, Lora Wiley, a former producer and investigative reporter with \\"Geraldo\\" who coordinated interviews with the likes of Mary Jo Buttafuoco. But in contrast to many other late-night hosts, Ms. Hutton does not do pre-interviews.    \\"For me, that was the least pleasant of anything,\\" she said. \\"Who knows what you're going to feel like talking about weeks from now when you go on?

It's more than an ordinary collision of clothed bodies. Two souls have come together and, rather as if they were jellyfish, it's impossible for us to separate them, though each immediately senses the pain hidden deep within the other.Michel apologizes. Lydia smiles. It was nothing, she says. He smiles. She smiles again. They enter a cafe. They talk about this and that. Small talk. They reveal nothing and yet they reveal all. Lydia even reveals her address.Later Michel knocks at the door of her flat, which she opens. She smiles. She has been expecting him. He smiles. He enters. The flat is somber.

She's not ready. She rushes into the bathroom and emerges a minute later looking absolutely smashing in a long white terrycloth robe. Lydia owes Michel an explanation.\\"Clair de Femme,\\" Costa-Gavras's romantic new French film, is pretty bad when it's dealing in small talk, but it manages to get hilariously worse when the explanations begin to flow.Lydia (Romy Schneider) still grieves for her small daughter killed six months earlier in an automobile accident that has left her husband brain-damaged, suffering from dysphasia. Talking as if she'd overdosed on Rudolph Friml, Lydia says, \\"I love a man I no longer love, so I love him more,\\" which is the sort of thing that Michel (Yves Montand) understands perfectly.Eventually Michel reveals his pain. His beloved wife, suffering from terminal cancer, has just died, a suicide made possible with the aid of the grieving Michel.When he and Lydia met, Michel had been planning to fly off to Caracas or Calcutta or Africa, someplace, anyplace, as long as there's a first-class flight to it. He has to think.\\"Clair de Femme,\\" which opens today at the Little Carnegie, is about loneliness and loss, about being able to afford a trip to a far-off place to think, and about talking in some of the fruitiest images to be spoken in any language on any movie screen in years.\\"You are drunk with despair,\\" says Lydia to Michel, who's been drinking a lot of brandy. \\"Words keep us afloat,\\" says Michel to Lydia. \\"I was offered a job helping people in Bangladesh,\\" says Lydia to Michel.Lydia and Michel talk about their grief, always in abstract terms, with the singlemindedness of tourists who've lost their luggage. Talk, apparently, helps, though Michel does say to Lydia at one point, \\"It's like throwing a bottle into the sea, only now there is no sea, only bottles.\\"\\"Clair de Femme\\" is a movie of such grave, all-pervasive fatuousness that it makes one suspect one's judgment for having respected such earlier Costa-Gavras films as \\"Z,\\" \\"The Confession\\" and \\"State of Siege.\\" Only the elegant presences of Yves Montand and Romy Schneider keep the picture from being an outright disaster. Even exhausted and totally confused they command our attention.In the program notes, Mr. Costa-Gavras is quoted as saying of this, his first romantic film, that \\"love relationships between couples\\" are \\"the initial point of the human being.\\" (By which I think he means the love relationships between the two members of one couple, rather than those among the four people that would comprise two couples, but I really can't be sure.)\\"I believe,\\" he says further, \\"that the couple is the most basic — and the most political — unit of society.\\"\\"Clair de Femme\\" is leaded with couples, some more odd than others, but none of them especially compelling. In addition to the emotionally wrecked Lydia and Michel, the movie is about Lydia's mother-in-law (Lila Kedrova), a rich White Russian émigré who forms a couple with her vegetable-son, and about a colorfully tacky nightclub performer (Romolo Valli), who is a couple with his 14-year-old poodle. Just to make sure we get the point of couplehood, there's another couple, a chimpanzee and a toy poodle who, in moments of stress, dance together.There may well be a political point to be made about couplehood, but it's not made in \\"Clair de Femme.\\" These couples are all so self-absorbed, you wouldn't trust them with the time.Perhaps Mr. Costa-Gavras is not entirely to blame for the high-camp dialogue, but, from the French I could hear on the soundtrack, the English subtitles are accurate. The screenplay, which Mr. Costa-Gavras wrote himself, is based on a novel by Romain Gary, who is reported to have told the film maker he believed all movie adaptations to be violations but that he hoped this one \\"would be the best possible kind.\\" Mr. Gary should keep his dire predictions to himself.

MUSIC","excerpt":"SHE'S PLAYING BEETHOVEN AGAIN"},{"year":"1995","title":"It Makes Perfect Sense to Be a Good Neighbor Looking at it from a coldly practical angle, this nation can't afford to have the Mexican economy fall apart. Just as a ramshackle house stains a whole neighborhood, a tattered Mexico would be a big headache for its mighty cousin to the north. So it made total sense last week when Washington decided to pump billions into Mexico to prop up the battered peso. And President Ernesto Zedillo soon saw the necessity of some falling on swords, accepting the resignation of his Finance Minister, Jaime Serra Puche, whose prints were all over the currency mess. Mr. Zedillo also announced a drastic emergency plan, including deep concessions from labor, big spending cuts and a slowdown of economic growth. As it happens, Mr. Serra's replacement, Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, tried in the fall to show the need for an orderly devaluation, but no one listened. They are now. Give and It Shall Be Taken From Britain, today's lesson: Never, ever underestimate the public's willingness to take full advantage of anything that's free. A mobile-phone company called Mercury One-2-One wanted a catchy promotion for its \\"personal communications services\\" -- it's among the first in the world to offer this radio-wave-based phone technology -- so it offered free calls on Christmas for new subscribers. What it no doubt figured on: customers merrily making a few calls to relatives, then getting back to the day's festivities. What it got: jammed lines, 10 times normal volume, 12-hour international calls, some people making 100 calls, others not able to get through at all. In short, chaos. Japan's Humbled Self-Image Japan strikes a bit less terror in American hearts these days, and even the Japanese admit that their mighty economic machine has been badly humbled. Just three years ago, 53 percent of Japanese said they expected Japan to lead the world economic pack for quite a while. A recent poll shows, though, that that's plummeted to 25 percent. And what's the next powerhouse? A big difference of opinion on that one -- fully a quarter of the Japanese, but a scant 4 percent of Americans, picked China. One feeling persists in Japan, though: 83 percent of Japanese believe their blue-collar workers work harder than Americans -- and that number's held pretty steady. Mr. Pataki Seems to Mean It George Pataki sent some powerful signals last week that he is dead serious about his economic vision for New York. First he named a new budget director, Patricia Woodworth, who as Michigan's budget director has zeroed in on cutting taxes and state spending. A key item on her resume: Michigan's move this year to end local schools' dependence on property taxes. She said that approach would be tough in New York, though. Mr. Pataki also found a Commissioner of Social Services in Mary Glass, who holds the same job in Westchester (she'll have to work fast","excerpt":"she's returning to that job in three months). On her watch, 60 percent of those on home relief were dropped for failing to work. The ship of state is clearly shaping up as a tight one. The West, Yes; the Coast, No It's really true. Though New Yorkers persist in thinking they are at the center of the universe, New York, alas, has suffered the indignity of falling behind Texas to be No. 3 on the state population list. But Census figures out last week also highlighted an interesting aspect of this nation's great tilt westward: it stops before it gets to the ocean. The big growth spurts are coming one or two states in from the West Coast, like Nevada, up 5.4 percent, and Arizona, up 3.3 percent. And how about California? Yes, it's still easily No. 1, but it now ranks just 35th in growth. The state's sour economy is clearly no draw these days. Mutual Funds: Doing Fine (So Far) The public made a startling discovery last year: mutual funds are not invincible. Investors scurried away from bond funds, but a sickly stock market couldn't stop stock funds from slogging ahead. True, the net $3 billion that flowed in in November was the lowest since 1991, but that marked the 49th straight month that more has come in than gone out -- easily the longest streak ever. Maybe people, even when gloomy, can't think of a better place to put their cash. Shoppers Always Show Up It makes no sense. Stores panic in early December, then run sales even before Christmas, and -- wonder of wonders! -- the hordes arrive. Don't retailers know that this nation's citizens are genetically programmed for holiday excess? They have to show up, always at the last minute. So it was that retailers, tallying it all up last week, found that sales weren't bad but profits were poor -- because of markdowns. One footnote: plastic was big. Visa and Mastercard both reported hefty increases in credit-card purchases. Maybe people are using cards more for their daily bread, but it could also spell empty stores now as people wrestle those Visa bills back to earth. Something Completely Different On New Year's Day, this page would be incomplete without a roundup of Top Stories of '94. On second thought, that's a dumb idea. Instead, here's an exclusive look at what will surely be the Top Story of '95: All the people who made money on derivatives (if billions were lost, billions had to be made, right?) will be overwhelmed by remorse and holiday spirit and send checks to Orange County. BRITS ZIP UP TMS. SQ.! It's called the zipper, that ribbon of lit-up news on the 43d Street end of Times Square. And even in an age when people get up-to-the-second news practically piped into their brains, the passing throng can easily be seduced into watching the headlines emerge, word * by * rolling * word. In 1928, soon after it was born, the zipper carried news of Hoover's victory, and with a few interruptions, it's been blinking ever since. But Newsday, which has run the billboard since 1986, pulled out recently, raising the possibility that zipper junkies would go headline-less come New Year's Eve. Relax. Last week Pearson, the British conglomerate that puts out The Financial Times and The Economist, picked up the lease. Senate to House: Drop Deal Newt Gingrich's sojourn in the land of big-bucks publishing was a brief one. Last week Bob Dole raised his powerful eyebrows at Mr. Gingrich's $4.5 million deal to write two books for a publisher owned by Rupert Murdoch, who happens to have regulatory business with Congress. Mr. Gingrich soon scrapped the deal, saying he'd take just a $1 advance and patiently await his royalties. He had to \\"do what's good for the country,\\" Mr. Gingrich said; even though it was a \\"legal and ethical deal,\\" he didn't want the new Congress \\"to be slowed down or distracted,\\" even for a second. David Bonior, the Michigan Democrat who is showing signs of being a feisty anti-Gingrich, said Mr. Gingrich \\"finally got the message.\\" Insurance With a Difference Life insurance. It conjures images of endless mailings and sales pitches -- and it's the last thing people want to think about anyway. So selling it is tough, and many agents don't last. But a New York sales agent named Steven Genovese, prosecutors say, had a better idea. An indictment last week asserted that for years he presented phony applications, wrote bad checks for a few payments, and pocketed his commission -- perhaps half the first year's premium. If a policy's canceled, part of the commission should be returned, but that didn't happen this time -- and no procedure was in place to track such fraud. Agents can job-hop leaving barely a footprint. Even Mr. Genovese's lawyer admitted that the system \\"could almost seduce people into fraudulent conduct.\\" A Bullet Too Far Well, David Keen decided last week that the world did not need, just yet, a bullet that not only pierces armor but splits into razorlike shards and does all sorts of nasty, nasty stuff. Mr. Keen, who heads an Alabama company called Signature Products, backed down after stiff police opposition to the company's bullet, which he says is needed because criminals often wear bulletproof vests. Of course, some people say that his bullet isn't even possible, that it's all a hoax, that he was helping the gun-control lobby more than anyone. The one thing that's certain: he got a lot of attention.

Its producer, Jon Brion, has said that Ms. Apple's label, Sony Music's Epic Records, shelved the album because it didn't hear potential hit singles. An Epic spokeswoman said, ''Fiona has not yet delivered her next album.'' Lately, what purports to be the full album, 11 songs, has been leaked onto the Internet, where -- despite the efforts of Sony's legal department -- a simple search will find multiple sources of downloads.

Epic may have been discomfited that Ms. Apple's collaboration with him doesn't sound anything like what's on the radio now.

The beats are often waltzes and oom-pahs, not hip-hop or punk; the arrangements are full of cellos, horns, bells and vintage keyboards. Ms. Apple's piano and voice are still at the center of the music, but now orchestras and show bands sprout around her, adding layers of whimsy and artifice. Ms. Apple has always placed herself somewhere between confession and entertainment, but in songs like ''Window'' or ''Better Version of Me,'' the carnival bounces and mock-Hollywood glitz put a cartoonish frame around her traumas, giving them a brand-new perspective.    Had it been released, ''Extraordinary Machine'' would have been a fine counterbalance to a pop moment full of monolithic, self-righteous sincerity.

Before last night's game against the visiting Florida Marlins, the club was 1-6 in one-run games, without a victory in extra innings and 3-10 in its last 13 games at Shea Stadium. The Mets average stood at .230 and the bullpen was 0-7. So the Mets aren't in last place because of unrealized potential, but because of fully realized shortcomings. Any notion that the Mets can be rehabilitated in 1993 requires a great leap of faith, and the Mets Aren't too good at any kind of leaping these days. MANAGER WATCH    The mananger won't be fired any time soon, or so ownership has said. Jeff Torborg, above, whose relaxed approach has come perilously close to becoming a detached approach, has done nothing to shake up his club. There has been talk of togetherness, of effort. It is only talk, and when it comes from Torborg, the players seem to ignore it. DUGOUT DECOMPRESSION    Bobby Bonilla, right, the Met's first baseman of the future, might benefit from some time on the bench. His strikeout total is escalating disturbingly. The umpires don't have a good word to say about him","excerpt":"Shea fans say mostly boo, and maybe Bonilla and Mike Cubbage need to spend some quality time in the dugout talking over the game's finer points. HEY, BOBBY, SAY HI TO VINCE    Speed. Speed. Speed. Manufactured runs. Menace on the basepaths. New York has heard enough about Vince Coleman's potential threat and seen not nearly enough. The leadoff man had a .285 on-base percentage before last night. Why not sit Coleman, get Joe Orsulak in a more comfortable spot in left, get center fielder Dave Gallagher's bat (.391) in the lineup for a couple of weeks and make the Mets a decent defensive team. TRADE EMBARGO    The Mets say trading any significant player right now is impractical. Howard Johnson, right, has too much to prove at the moment to command from other clubs the value the Mets would want in return. Trading Sid Fernandez, even after his surgery, might net a useful player, but would leave a gaping hole in the No. 3 spot in the rotation. \\"The best we could probably do would be one of those change-of-scenery types of deals where both clubs would be taking huge gambles,\\" said one official. 30 DAYS OF GOOD BEHAVIOR    The Mets are one month of bad baseball away from 1993 irrelevance. They play the Cardinals and Expos this week and the Pirates and Phillies before the end of May. If they are 12 or more games out by then, the Mets are over and out. ONE MORE STOP BEFORE COOPERSTOWN    The Mets, if they fail to mount an assault on repectability this month, could make the trading of Eddie Murray their first order of bargain-basement business. The first baseman's numbers are still high enough to give him marketplace value. Would the Braves, who need offense and who have a ton of prospects, be interested? AN UNEVEN ODD YEAR    Bret Saberhagen, who began the year with a 74-30 career record in odd-numbered years, has only three victories this season, all against expansion teams. The right-hander has struggled to find his blowaway fastball and has had an occasionally cranky right shoulder. \\"I've been pitching stupid and I'm sick and tired of it,\\" Saberhagen said last week. \\"My 7-year-old son has a better idea of how to pitch than I've had the last month.\\" FOR PETE'S SAKE    Perhaps Pete Schourek, the left-hander with the 1-3 record, would profit from a stint in the bullpen, or the minors. Let Eric Hillman start a couple of games, fool some teams, maybe and meanwhile reignite Schourek's focus and talent. And why not promote Kevin Baez and reassign backup infielder Tim Bogar? CHAPTER 11, FILING AT DEADLINE    The Mets, if they are in the middle of nowhere in mid-summer, might declare their season bankrupt and stage a liquidation sale at the trading deadline. Johnson and Fernandez might garner a fair ransom of young talent.

They're next-door neighbors in lookalike towers in the World Financial Center. And Shearson, in the taller tower, is the only firm on Wall Street that comes close to powerhouse Merrill, both in selling securities through a network of branch offices and in corporate finance, the business of creating new securities to be sold. Still, the neighbors are different indeed. Merrill has molded itself into a model of a diversified, profitable securities firm","excerpt":"Shearson aspires to do the same, but has much to overcome. Merrill Lynch's growth has been largely internal, with no major acquisitions in the past 10 years; Shearson was a second-tier firm until it acquired Lehman Brothers, a leading trading and corporate finance firm, in 1984 and the troubled E. F. Hutton in 1988. Merrill Lynch has chalked up record profits; Shearson foundered, and its parent, American Express, rescued it in 1990 with a $750 million cash infusion. Now Shearson is rebuilding with an eye to becoming strong enough to stand alone. Shearson is expected to return to profitability this year, but whether the profits will be great enough to repair its damaged reputation is uncertain. At Shearson's Helm    The new faces in the executive suite at Shearson Lehman belong to two Lehman executives - J. Tomilson Hill, a 44-year-old investment banker, and Richard Fuld, a 46-year-old former trader. Although they lack experience in Shearson's brokerage business, they have the support of American Express's chairman, Harvey Golub. His mandate: Reduce costs and make Shearson profitable. At Merrill's Helm    Merrill's two top executives - William Schreyer, the 65-year-old chairman, and Daniel Tully, the 61-year-old president and C.E.O. - both rose through the branch office system. Mr. Schreyer, who will retire this year, was a key executive when Merrill expanded into government securities and corporate finance in the 1970's Mr. Tully, a sales specialist, has managed other parts of the business deftly in recent years. At Shearson, Round Two of Cost-Cutting; Profitable Merrill Stays The Course    Shearson Lehman, having lost $116 million in 1992, a year of record profits for other Wall Street firms, is on the verge of its second cost-cutting drive in three years, seeking to eliminate duplicate overhead costs at the Shearson and Lehman Brothers parts of the firm. No major line of business is to be abandoned. In contrast to 1990, when the broker network was slashed, Shearson will continue expanding its broker staff, in the hope it will produce higher revenues without significantly higher costs.    If Shearson Lehman matches other financial companies' 5 percent to 10 percent cut in fixed costs, the savings would come to $120 million to $240 million, moving it closer to its profit goal of $500 million. Profits will be greatly helped, analysts note, by the end of special charges for past mistakes, like the $245 million written off last year from an investment in Computervision.    Shearson Lehman executives are also looking for ways to reduce the cost of salaries and bonuses, perhaps by offering equity in the firm. At Merrill, where employees own about 25 percent of the company, stock acquired on favorable terms is an important part of total compensation.    Merrill Lynch, flush with two consecutive years of record profits, aims to stay the course. The cost control learned in the past few years put Merrill in good shape to weather the industry downturn that is sure to come eventually. Its brokerage force has been stable at just under 12,000, but it has been able to reduce the number of support workers in the last six years.    Merrill has mostly avoided major miscues in its trading and corporate finance departments. Its interest-rate and currency swaps business has emerged as a major profit center, making the compnay less dependent on commissions and corporate finance fees, both of which are high now, but could decline.    \\"We want to be a sales-driven company that is a dominant force in every product line\\" said Daniel Tully, president. \\"Then we can be indifferent as to what the customer is buying, so long as they buy it from us.\\" Right Next Door, But Worlds Apart"},{"year":"1982","title":"''I F you want to out-image Merrill Lynch, you have to beat the bull,'' said Bill Giles, a vice president and the creative director at Grey Advertising for Shearson/ American Express.

From Moscow and St. Petersburg in the East to New York and Chicago in the West, enclaves of buoyant and embattled avantgarde artists and visionaries trans forme d virtually every aspectof the visual culture of the modern age.   It was in the inventions and attitudes spawned in the intellectual ferment of this pivotal era that modernist art was given its quintessential forms. It is therefore to the art and the ideas of this pre-World War I period that we can trace the roots of the culture that continues in so many respects, even in our own so-called post-modern epoch, to shape our artistic assumptions and govern our critical standards.

It's about Mr. Hockney's inability to finish a painting when his lover for the last five years, another artist named Peter Schlesinger, walks out on him. His friends worry about him. They worry about a forthcoming show, and they worry about the décor of his house. \\"It looks like a waiting room now,\\" says Celia Birtwell, a beautiful young woman who looks a lot like Andy Warhol's Viva. Another friend says, \\"When love goes wrong, it's more than two people suffer.\\"In these moments, there's a suggestion of the satire that is almost always evident in Mr. Hockney's paintings, but the film's Hockney-like gags are mostly blunt, as when Henry Geldzahler of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is \\"discovered\\" striking the pose in which Mr. Hockney once painted him.The manner of making the film—in London, Geneva, California and New York, whenever the artist's schedule permitted—has as much to do with the non-content of the film as with its style. There are only the slightest traces of the outrageous self-promotion and put-on that once were so much a part of the pop scene. \\"A Bigger Splash\\" is unforgivably solemn, something that Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey would never have allowed.5 Shorts at Whitney\\"Transformations\\" is the blanket title covering a well-organized exhibition of five short films exploring motion pictures as the vehicle of expression of pure art. The exhibition opened yesterday for a week's run in the New American Filmmakers Series at the Whitney Museum of American Art.Of the five, which range in length from 6 to 35 minutes, the least imaginative was \\"Birds of Paradise,\\" by Mike Lovell, in which the soaking of film in bleach produced whitened patterns washing across repetitive shots of caged vultures.More active and successful in working out thematic variations were Steve Osborn with \\"Polyphemus,\\" a piece of cinematic choreography that makes the camera and a mirror partners in a contredanse","excerpt":"Sheldon Brown's \\"Clean Gate!!,\\" fugal in the increasing complexity of its patterns; Mr. Brown's \\"Frame/Rate Declension\\" in which juxtaposed vertical film strips moving at changing speeds provide a tapestry of images, and David Hykes's \\"Moving Parts,\\" a combination of eerie sound and colored particles that form a kaleidoscopic universe, at once pastoral and nightmarish.

But the situation is a bit more complicated, at least for takeover speculators, because a man named Donald Mitchell, who is little known on Wall Street, has quietly informed the company that he represents clients willing to pay more for Sheller. That disclosure, contained in a company proxy statement filed last month, and a subsequent letter Mr. Mitchell sent to the Toledo, Ohio, concern on Monday, have caused a distortion in the price of Sheller-Globe's stock. Yesterday it was at $47.125.   That price says, in essence, that the folks on Wall Street who gamble on takeovers expect to see a richer deal than the one scheduled for a vote, and that the deal will probably come from Mr. Mitchell.

Many tax shelters, especially those in real estate, are structured as limited partnerships, and sales of partnerships have already declined in expectation of the tax changes, which begin to take effect Jan. 1 and will be totally phased in over five years.   Companies that sponsor limited partnerships are now emphasizing the income and appreciation potential of their investments rather than the tax advantages.   Kenneth E. Nitzberg is president of the Equitec Financial Group, an Oakland, Calif., financial services company that sponsors real estate limited partnerships. He has long favored putting the emphasis on the basic economics of a deal, rather than its tax aspects. Q. What is the future of tax shelters? A. The future for tax shelters is nonexistent. They've dropped the marginal rate low enough that it's probably not worth the risk to capital to avoid tax liability. And most of the tax shelters are in a format that creates passive losses which cannot be used to offset active income.

Critics of the proposals say such deceptive missions could shatter the Pentagon's credibility.   A1    The Stalled Hunt for Bin Laden  The hunt for Osama bin Laden has been strictly supervised by Pakistani officials. The search remains stalled, frustrated by the remote topography, stymied by the Qaeda network, sidetracked by the war in Iraq, and limited by deep hostility.   A1    Bomb Kills Soldier in Iraq  Militants killed an American soldier and ambushed an Iraqi National Guard patrol in Baghdad. The soldier was struck when a roadside bomb exploded near his patrol.   A9    Karzai Vows Poppy Destruction  President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan said that he planned to destroy the country's poppy fields. Mr. Karzai's comments come in the wake of news reports about an American military review of Afghanistan that says poppy cultivation and opium production will increase and expand the influence of drug magnates at all levels of the government.   A9    Race for Arafat's Successor  Marwan Barghouti, the imprisoned leader of the Palestinian uprising, withdrew from the Palestinian presidential race. His decision removes any serious challenge for Mahmoud Abbas to succeed Yasir Arafat.   A16    China to Impose Textile Tariffs  China's Commerce Ministry announced that it would impose tariffs on some textile exports, a step that could avert a trade war with the United States and the European Union over low-cost Chinese garments.   A1    Deadly Bombing in Philippines  A bomb exploded in a market packed with Christmas shoppers in Manila, killing at least 15 people and shattering a long lull in terror attacks in the volatile southern Philippines, where Muslim and communist rebels are active.   A16  NATIONAL   A18-25    Conservative Christians Try for Post-Election Gains  Energized by electoral victories that they say reflect wide support for more traditional social values, conservative Christian advocates across the country are pushing ahead state and local initiatives on thorny issues, including same-sex marriage, public education and abortion.   A1    Withdrawal Strains Relationship  Bernard B. Kerik's withdrawal from the nomination of Homeland Security director has placed a strain on the relationship between President Bush and Rudolph W. Giuliani, who recommended Mr. Kerik for the post.   A1    A Difficult Mess to Clean Up  Weather and the swells and powerful winds of the Bering Sea are preventing cleanup crews and biologists from getting to the site of last week's wreck of a freighter, where a still-unknown amount of fuel may be leaking into one of the world's ecologically richest wildlife refuges.   A18    Towns Fight Deportation  Two communities in Colorado are rallying behind a well-respected Armenian family threatened with deportation. The fight has led some of the townspeople to say they fear a loss of innocence, as a small town used to participatory democracy bumps up against a vast bureaucracy.   A18    Security for Inauguration  The security plan for the inauguration of President Bush, the first since the Sept. 11 attacks, is considered by the Secret Service as the most comprehensive ever devised for the inauguration of an American president.   A22    SCIENCE/HEALTH    NASA Administrator to Resign  Sean O'Keefe, the NASA administrator who guided the agency through sweeping changes after the Columbia shuttle accident, will resign and pursue a job as chancellor of Louisiana State University, agency and university officials said.

The ad listed a number of accusations criticizing the way the judge dispenses justice.   B1    Bush Portrait Taken Down  Artwork in a Chelsea Market exhibition was abruptly taken down when the market's managers complained about a portrait of President Bush fashioned from images of tiny chimpanzees.

Try selling a new series to television these days, especially if it's not a half-hour sitcom. The hourlong dramas, we are told, aren't nearly as profitable later, in syndication. Producers have to try harder, sometimes reverting to tactics that not too long ago would have been unthinkable. Consider the case of \\"Ned Blessing,\\" an 1880's Texas-Mexican border tale being presented on CBS this evening at 9 as a two-hour movie.    Actually, as becomes obvious at the end of the film, this is the first chapter in a potential series, its continuation apparently depending on the ratings fate of the pilot. Scripts are at the ready, but that's where they'll stay unless the network decides to go ahead with the series. But where, reviewers might well ask, would the program be heading?

These latest episodes bring to a total of 34 hours since 1984 the Granada Television productions that star Mr. Brett as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective. One curious development: the more the actor painstakingly refines and enriches his portrayal, the more he tends to suggest in his increasingly chilly cerebrations the interpretation of another actor closely associated with the role, Basil Rathbone. Even if unintentional, the effect is perfectly on target.    In these new additions to \\"The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes,\\" England has turned the century, shifting from a Victorian to an Edwardian mode. Holmes, however, remains remarkably resistant to change. He still lives at 221-B Baker Street, tended to by Mrs. Hudson (Rosalie Williams), the unflappable housekeeper, and assisted in his amateur sleuthing by the steady Dr. Watson (Edward Hardwicke). For important errands, he employs the local young men known as the Baker Street Irregulars because, he explains, \\"they are more discreet than any telegraph.\\" Review/Television","excerpt":"Sherlock Holmes Solves A Two-Ended Mystery"},{"year":"1953","title":"Doty, Roy, Show: rev TELEVISION IN REVIEW","excerpt":"Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson and the Messrs.
