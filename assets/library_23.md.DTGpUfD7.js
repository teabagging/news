If art is imitating life, then Mr. Mardirosian is unabashed and candid in his confessional.

The incident involves a perfectly conventional suburban English housewife, Diana, who is sitting on her living room couch presiding over a Saturday afternoon tea party. Diana -- played by the sublime English actress Brenda Blethyn, in her New York debut -- is a cheery sort, with button eyes, rosy cheeks and a jolly word for nearly anyone who will look benignly in her direction. But things have not gone well at her tea party, and suddenly Diana cracks at the realization that she long ago took a wrong turn in life and has ever since been stuck \\"doing all the wrong things.\\" Her arms folded and her posture still erect, Ms. Blethyn starts crying and shrieking uncontrollably, inconsolably, plunging from chattery contentment to rage and nervous collapse.

He wins the girl, foils the villain and is cheered by the hotel guests, who shout their rahs-rahs in unison and drape themselves on the staircase in tableau order.There is some other business about a sheriff following two young men over the musical comedy course because they forgot to return their employer's stock certificate. But this serves only to lend the element of the chase to the picture.Mr. Brown, as the becheckered and beleaguered liar, is a delight in his facile comedy scenes and kept those in the Strand yesterday afternoon in continuous laughter. His antics are easy and his screen foil, a supposedly rich young woman, played by Laura Lee, is equally apt and frolicsome. She dances, sings and mimics well. Hardly as much can be said for Bernice Claire. Jack Whiting is seen as Gerald Brooks, Mr. Brown's allegedly junior partner.The manners exhibited in the picture are not quite up to the usual First National standards, for when a group of supposedly cultured society folk are standing idly watching the races, a young man, one of the Long Island Colgates, rushes up to Miss Claire and, grabbing her by the shoulders, exclaims: \\"Hello, gorgeous, give us a kiss.\\" Miss Claire only lowers her lashes.

With great sorrow, we announce the passing of Arch Nadler, on June 4, 2005. Born Aaron Nadler in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on April 11, 1924, to Samuel Nadler (from Bucharest, Romania ) and Clara Rubin (from Iasi, Romania), he came to the United States in 1955. An accomplished graphic artist, his first enterprise was a marketing and publicity firm, Arch Nadler Associates. He then established with Rober Larimer the New York advertising agency, Nadler and Larimer, Inc. It soon established itself as one of the major and innovative firms in the world, with additional offices in London, Paris and Bremen. Its clients included Faberge, Austin Nichols, Lionel Toys, New York State Lottery, and Conde Nast. He was the Chairman of the Board until his retirement in 1983. He married Sarah Shirley Friedmanin 1949, and their daughter Linden (now living in Jerusalem, Israel), was born in 1950. After a divorce, he married Nancy Sharon Hertz in 1957. They had three children: Steven (of Madison, WI)","excerpt":"Lauren (of Wilton, CT); and David (of LLoyd Harbor, NY). He also had nine grandchildren: Rose and Ben Nadler (Madison); Cameron Nadler (Wilton); Caroline, Sydney and Savannah Nadler (Lloyd Harbor) and Eliezar Zev, Ariel and Rachel Stromberg (Jerusalem). He is also survived by his brother, Sidney Nadler. He was a loving and deeply beloved husband and father, and a devoted, generous, and doting grandfather. He was blessed with wisdom, a brilliantly dry sense of humor, quiet digity, and (something he tried to impart to his children) an unfailing sense of ''menschlicheit''. He never forgot his impoverished roots--he lost his father when he was 14, and worked to support his family--and his personal and professional success never clouded his sense of who he was and where he came from. May his memory be for a blessing. With love, from his children     NADLER--Arch. He was my partner for twenty years at Nadler & Larimer, a New York advertising agency, which we sold in 1979. A tall man who exuded authority, Arch was an astute businessman, the account-management half of our partnership. But that didn't mean he would hesitate to offer his own ideas to me and others in the Creative Department. In fact it was his idea to employ athletes such as Joe Namath and Muhammad Ali as TV spokesmen for Faberge's Brut Cologne-a successful campaign that was among the first of its kind to feature sports celebrities. Arch came from a humble background and never outgrew his simple tastes. Once, returning from a lavish client luncheon, we passed a sidewalk hotdog stand. He said, ''I would rather have had lunch there.'' What started as friendship at the Benton & Bowles agency turned into a long and fruitful partnership with many precious memories. I offer condolences to Arch's wife, Nancy, and family.
