A member of the nobility, young, handsome and adventurous, travels in Nuremberg incognito and he too falls in love with the girl. He obtains employment as an apprentice with Sachs and wins Eva, who plans to elope with him.This causes some confusion on the part of her father, who has already promised her to several others. To decide the issue a contest is held in which the man who writes the best poem will win the hand of the girl. Sachs is the best lyricist of the town and, becoming aware of the girl's love for Stolzing, the romantic noble, gives him his poem.There is a fantastic rhythm in the direction of \\"Meistersinger.\\" The characters frequently speed up their actions to suit the pace of the story. There are several amusing sequences, in one of which Beckmesser loses his toupée and is forced to appear bare-headed before the Grand Council. It is a fanciful, droll and a rather attractively mounted film.

Ms. Hay has described the full-evening solo, danced to a score by Ellen Fullman, as the story of a previous longer group dance. Dressed in white pants and a shirt sewn with gold braid and wearing an odd molded white headdress, Ms. Hay looked implike and sometimes was, disappearing behind side panels then darting out after blackouts to what sounded like the crash of pots and pans.

The film opened last night at the Sixty-eighth Street Playhouse.Once again, in this flavorsome collection that Robert Youngson has made as a successor and equally rich addenda to this popular \\"The Golden Age of Comedy,\\" Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, Harry Langdon, Ben Turpin, Charlie Chase and the inestimable Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, not to mention many more, tumble and reel through giddy routines of old-fashioned knockabout farce. Fellows are bonged on their noggins and felons are chased by maniac cops.Langdon, the baby-faced gudgeon of all the sharpers and meanies in the world, wobbles in deadpanned innocence right into the mischief makers' traps. Keaton is stalked by a mad bomber, Wallace Beery ties Gloria Swanson to the railroad tracks. And Laurel and Hardy vie with Jimmy Finlayson in a wild contest of vandalistic spite.It is a charmingly simple memory album that Mr. Youngson has compiled and equipped with an excellent musical sound track and a mildly nostalgic narration. His somewhat historical annotations, spoken by Dwight Weist, are helpful, if one cares to listen, but are not essential to full enjoyment.No academic preparation is required to appreciate the fun in the kind of pantomimic madness that the old silent comedians indulged. Theirs was a world of wild extensions of all the embarrassments and agonies of life, even to death and taxes, heaped on the comic victims' heads. The comics themselves were the fall guys, only occasionally coming out on top. The villains were all the representations of authority and brutality. Even today, despite television and the preponderance of the wisecrack and gag, their dilemmas are as apt and fresh as ever.Here's a toast to this sort of comedy!
