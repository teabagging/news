Builders admit that the practice has grown as construction and land acquisition costs have risen and the cost of financing it all through a conventional lender has begun to add significantly to overhead. Critics argue that the recent strong market has allowed builders to get away with the practice and that it is done primarily to increase profit margins.   Under such conditions, the buyer understandably worries about the safety of his down payment. If the house costs $300,000, for example, and the down payment is 15 percent (not uncommon in the New York area for new construction), the buyer will be putting $45,000 in jeopardy for six months or more. The risk could include anything from the bankruptcy of the builder to some freak occurrence, such as his sudden death.

The partners, counsel, senior counsel, associates and staff of Proskauer Rose LLP mourn the loss of our esteemed and beloved senior partner and former Chair of our Litigation and Dispute Resolution Department, Stephen Rackow Kaye. Steve joined Proskauer more than 40 years ago, a graduate of Cornell Law School, where he was Managing Editor of the Cornell Law Quarterly and from which he graduated with distinction. Steve became one of the nation's preeminent litigators, with a wealth of trial and appellate experience. In recent years, Steve, a member of the American Arbitration Association's Commercial Panel of Neutral Arbitrators and its Panel of International Arbitrators, increasingly served as an arbitrator or mediator in major disputes. Steve was one of the great trial lawyers of his generation. He had a practice of astonishing breadth on behalf of a roster of well-known clients. Among the matters for which he is best known, he successfully represented: the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority in appellate proceedings in 2003 rejecting challenges to fare and toll increases","excerpt":"Reed Elsevier and Matthew Bender (Lexis-Nexis) in prosecuting their suit against Jurisline.com to final judgment and dismissal of the copyright preemption and antitrust claims asserted against them; 83 American and European publishers of scientific and technical journals at trial and on appeal in a landmark case against Texaco for copyright infringement by unauthorized intra-corporate photocopying of journal articles; and Starrett Housing Corp. in its expropriation case against the Islamic Republic of Iran, resulting in the recovery of $59 million after two major international arbitration hearings at The Hague and many months of valuation proceedings before Tribunal-appointed Swedish experts. Throughout his career, Steve was a leader in efforts to improve the quality of legal practice in New York and raise the esteem in which our court system is held. He was a member of the Policy Committee of the First Department Disciplinary Committee and Hearing Panel Chair for that Committee; member of the New York State Judicial Institute on Professionalism in the Law; Chair of the Committee on Professional Discipline and Chair of the Committee on Professional and Judicial Ethics of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. Until recently, he served as a Trustee of The Historical Society of the Courts of the State of New York. Steve was a prolific author and lecturer. He was the principal author of the ninechapter, 645-page text concerning trial of complex commercial cases in the treatise, Commercial Litigation in the New York State Courts (West Publishing Company), known as the ''bible'' of complex state court litigation. Steve's love of the law manifested itself in many ways, including his joy in teaching younger lawyers, many of whom became successful partners at Proskauer.Steve's devotion to his clients was unwavering and he was dedicated to the highest standards of professional conduct. In the tradition of great lawyers, Steve delighted in shouldering great responsibility, in making the crucial decisions and in charting the path to a successful outcome. He was an inspiration to all of us and we were profoundly privileged to have worked with him. Prior to attending Cornell Law School, Steve served with the 25th Infantry Division in Korea in 1953-54. He is survived by three grown children and six grandchildren, along with his spouse, one of the nation's most esteemed jurists, the Hon. Judith S. Kaye, Chief Judge of the State of New York and its highest court, the Court of Appeals, and by several generations of Proskauer litigators whom he trained, for whom he served as mentor, and by whom he will always be warmly remembered.

When I asked them why, I expected responses like, \\"My oven is broken,\\" or, \\"We're going camping this year.\\" But that wasn't the case. They were planning to prepare Thanksgiving dinner at home, but had opted not to tackle the turkey. Why all the turkey anxiety?<!--more--> One friend has never cooked a whole bird, and is still haunted by memories of her aunt's dry turkey. Another says his oven was inconsistent, not to mention that it takes too long to cook. The third wants to focus on the sides, and the turkey takes up too much oven space. By addressing each of their concerns, I was able to convince them that roasting a turkey is easy enough: Rinse bird, pat dry, massage with butter, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on a rack in a roasting pan and plop in the oven. I agree with <a href=\\"http://curiouscook.com/cook/home.php\\">Harold McGee</a>, who wrote an interesting <a href=\\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/12/dining/12curi.html?_r=1&#38","excerpt":"ref=dining&#38;oref=slogin\\">article</a> in Dining In/Dining Out last week making a case for the unbrined turkey. I want to cook my turkey as quickly and easily as possible, and I want to be able to pull it out whole from the oven. But I also want it to taste good. I like brining meat, but it's a pain to do with turkey. I don't have space in my fridge for a vat of water. And if you over-brine, you can ruin your bird. I'd rather too dry than too salty. One trick, McGee says, is to dowse the breast meat, thinly sliced, in gravy. (Please make your own gravy. It's so easy. I describe how to below.).

But how else to describe what Robert Venturi has just done at the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego?         The museum, which maintains a small exhibition space in downtown San Diego but has its main quarters here, a few miles up the coast, has occupied the landmark Ellen Browning Scripps house, a triumphant 1916 work of the great California architect Irving Gill, since the institution's founding in 1941. During the 1950's and 60's, as the museum grew, local architects oversaw the evolution of the building from a house to a public institution by adding a series of gallery and service wings. None of these were distinguished, and they  had the collective effect of almost obliterating any sense of the magnificent structure that was at the museum's core.

With the use of aluminum for the frame, the Lite, which was first introduced last year, weighs only 6.78 pounds and folds up after use. It is available in six colors for about $80 at golf shops and sporting-goods stores. For information, telephone Bag Boy in Milwaukee, Ore., at (800) 955-2269. TENNIS  Proceeding from the premise that consistency brings service power, Serv-O-Meter is the latest gadget for the tennis player who has everything and wants more. A 5-inch plastic meter for measuring swing speed and ball speed during practice, the Serv-O-Meter is being pitched by Nick Bollettieri, the coach who operates a tennis academy in Bradenton, Fla.   The meter, which weighs less than an ounce and fits onto the side of a racquet frame with Velcro straps, operates on a calibrated, spring-loaded internal mechanism, according to Eric Kercher, marketing director. Each time you swing the racquet, you must reset the meter by turning a small knob. The meter registers racquet speeds from 40-80 miles an hour, and ball speeds, from 60-100 miles an hour. Available in eight colors, the Serv-O-Meter costs $19.95. Telephone: (800) 232-3687. RUNNING A reflective vest that blinks in the dark for runners who jog at night operates on a 9-volt battery. Set in a small pocket of the fluorescent orange mesh garment, the battery powers two 7-inch lighting strips on the front and back of the vest. The strips are made up of phosphorus, a luminescent material that is silk-screened onto an electrical field. When you turn the vest's switch on, the strips blink like a strobe light, with an intermittent on-off flashing sequence.   The vest's manufacturer says that the light can be seen at night from as far away as a half-mile. Available from Firefly Safety Vest, Inc. of South Bend, Ind., in six sizes, from S to XXXL. Telephone: (800) 451-5397. BIKING A tire iron, the plastic or metal lever used to pry a flat tire over its rim, is a tool common to most cyclists. But a lever made out of recycled milk cartons?   Pedro's USA of Newport, R.I., a company that makes biodegradable bike grease products, has developed the Milk Lever. At $2.95 a pair, this product makes an inexpensive stocking stuffer. It is a useful tool for any bike rider, espcially those with the environment on their mind.

SKIING  The North Face of Berkeley, Calif., a ski-wear company that also makes technical clothing and gear for serious climbers, has produced a new line of ski clothing originally designed for the Professional Ski Instructors of America. The Sensor Jacket looks more like a flight jacket than a winter ski coat.   It is made with several synthetic materials, including wind-and-water-repellant Gore-Tex, to keep the cold out. The jacket has numerous zippered pockets, including a pouch on the back, and elastic drawstrings at the neck. An insulated hood folds into the stand-up collar. An inner elasticized waist liner snaps closed below the belt. Available at sporting-goods stores for $425 in four color combinations, in men's sizes S-XL (for women, adjust accordingly).

Whiffs of jazz and blues and Haitian folk tunes could be heard, but neither these works nor the fourth piece -- Jonathan B. Holland's \\"Martha's Waltz,\\" inspired by Edward Albee's \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\\" -- attested to a hyphenated identity. At times it seemed that their composers and the others at the symposium were unified only by their apparent lack of interest in black pop culture.   Defining a black American musical tradition for the concert hall was one of the symposium's preoccupations, and it was difficult not to sense that this tradition is now tenuous. Although blacks continue to play crucial roles in jazz, blues, gospel, hip-hop and other popular styles, fewer than 2 percent of orchestral musicians and perhaps only a few dozen classical composers are black. But as Eileen Southern's distinguished work \\"The Music of Black Americans\\" shows, a long history of black involvement with the concert hall precedes contemporary affirmative action programs.

How do bankers feel about lending mortgage money to anyone who already has some sort of financing on their home?  Will rates be even lower if the homeowner holds back until the spring?  What about the homeowner who already holds a high interest mortgage from a bank but who now wants to take advantage of lower rates?  And what about the individual who is eager to liquidate some of the capital locked in the home for other needs such as college costs?  While any significant dip in mortgage interest rates has traditionally triggered demand from homeowners seeking a more favorable deal, this time bankers in the area expect most of their refinancing demand to come from holders of short-term seller financing. Bankers also say that in the past they were not always able to take over second mortgages but they are now in a better position to d o so because of recent changes within the banking world.   Seller financing was the name given to temporary private loans that became popular during the last two years when interest rates at lending institutions were prohibitively expensive.

Still, many events  become clearer with hindsight, when newer developments have given them context.  The MOVE bombing in Philadelphia has reached just that point.         In 1985, the police firebombing of a West Philadelphia cult called MOVE seemed a horrible though isolated blunder. But a lawsuit brought by a survivor opened this week in an atmosphere defined by the law enforcement disasters in Waco and Ruby Ridge -- not to mention an enormous police scandal in Philadelphia itself. The MOVE bombing is now being cast not as a plausible if tragic response, but as an example of police misconduct and law enforcement gone wrong. With the possibility of a big payout in the MOVE case -- and other damage suits  in the corruption case -- Mayor Edward Rendell has ample reason for worry.

The dark-haired Brian (Terry Curry) describes himself as bisexual. They meet in a bar one night, go back to Bryan's place, have unsafe sex, sleep for a little while and then wake up to get to know each other. P. J. Castellaneta's \\"Together Alone\\" is the record of their discoveries.   The film, opening today at the Film Forum, is an earnest, carefully choreographed dialogue, set entirely in one room, in which the two young men debate their conflicting values, recall key events in their lives and slowly, reluctantly reveal themselves. They talk about sexual identity, role-playing, homosexual and heterosexual relationships, the gay liberation movement, feminism, loneliness and Emily Dickinson. Giving a desperate edge to everything that's said is the possibility of AIDS.

Rumors are swirling that the last straw may have been trouble between Cobain and his wife, Courtney Love, or worries about their child, Frances Bean Cobain. Yet in retrospect, everyone could have seen it coming.    The songs Mr. Cobain wrote with Nirvana, heard by millions of fans, testified to rage and confusion, to ambivalence and loneliness, to a torment beyond relief. All the turmoil was in the way his voice suddenly shifted from a matter-of-fact drawl to an accusatory howl, and in the way his guitar parts jumped from riff to stubborn single notes to squeals of feedback, as if determined to grate. And it was in the words he wrote and sang.
