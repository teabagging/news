The conflict, which has centered on the architectural importance of Smith Hall, a 99-year-old building, has primarily involved faculty members and students in the history and sociology of science department, the current tenants, against administrators and engineering and chemistry professors who would work in the proposed laboratory.    Two years ago, the university completed its first new laboratory since 1973, and faculty members have called for more new research centers.    \\"Some of the most exciting new research developments in engineering and chemistry are really hitting limits without new space,\\"the university's provost, Michael Aiken, said in an interview last week. \\"If you look at these departments, they really cannot carry out their research and educational missions without new space.\\" Historic Section    Opponents of the project have charged that the university has ignored the historical and esthetic value of the ivy-covered building, saying that demolishing it would damage the campus.    \\"It's the only place on Penn's campus where you can look all around and see only 19th-century buildings,\\" said Elizabeth Hunt, a doctoral candidate from Bloomington, Ind., who is studying the history and sociology of science. \\"When they put a new building in, that will all be lost.\\"    Ms. Hunt and others interested in preserving Smith Hall point to its historic significance as one of the first teaching laboratories in the nation, having been built in 1891. \\"It's the first fully realized laboratory of hygiene or public health,\\" she said.    But administrators have repeatedly countered that the university should not be committed to keeping all of its historic buildings, if they come at the cost of more important new ones.    \\"It is important for the university community to understand that the mission of the university is education, and the intent is to be a premier institution of research and learning,\\" said Arthur Gravina, the vice president for facilities management.    Several multimillion-dollar renovation projects on some of the West Philadelphia campus's other historic buildings have been completed recently or are under way.    University officials hope to make room for the Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. Administrators are trying to sercure more than $10 million from the Department of Defense for the $75 million project. Military Research    But those opposed to the building and its placement have found ammunition in the proposed financing as well, saying that the university should not perform potentially weapons-related military research.    \\"The universities and the D.O.D. are hand in glove,\\" Ms. Hunt said. \\"I would hope that they build without D.O.D. money and build it with a humanitarian mission.\\"    But administrators have said that such research could not be performed in the building, despite Defense Department financing, pointing to a research policy dating to the late 1960's against research that cannot be published.    \\"The university has a policy that prevents secret research,\\" said Shelley Green the university's general counsel. \\"Whatever money we get from those agencies meets the same requirements as other monies.\\"    The university hopes to begin construction on the new laboratory by winter, but several hurdles remain. Continuing Debate    After the City of Philadelphia defied the university's wishes by declaring the building a historic landmark last year, the university returned and asked permission to demolish the building.    The Philadelphia Historic Preservation Commission granted permission to raze the building but Smith Hall advocates, including an ad hoc group called Friends of Smith Walk, appealed the decision. That appeal has not been resolved.    The Friends of Smith Walk was formed last spring in an effort to involve alumni and others with ties to the university to bring pressure on the administration. It also raises money to pay for legal fees in trying to block the preservation commission's decision.    \\"It's kind of an action group to do something about the university's desire to destroy an historic building and a very charming walkway,\\" said Robert E. Kohler, a professor of history and sociology of science and a member of the Friends of Smith Walk.    \\"We're hoping that if people get excited about Smith Hall, then the university will decide that it's more in their interest to compromise and build their project somewhere where it doesn't require the destruction of an historic building, walk and precinct,\\" Mr. Kohler said. \\"What's appalling is that compromise has not been sought.\\" CAMPUS LIFE: Penn","excerpt":"Plan to Raze Building Produces Legal Battle"},{"year":"1940","title":"Realty interest revived Interest Revives in Ninth Avenue Realty","excerpt":"Plan to Raze Elevated Line Spurs Deals"},{"year":"1961","title":"opera house property leased to investors group which plans to replace it with commercial bldg, '64 Investors Lease 'Met' Property","excerpt":"Plan to Raze Opera House in '64; INVESTORS LEASE SITE OF THE 'MET'"},{"year":"2004","title":"New York City education officials plan to overhaul up to two-thirds of city's 218 middle schools, eliminating many of them, as part of major effort to improve schooling for young adolescents","excerpt":"plan to re-create old-style kindergarten-through-eighth-grade grammar schools and open new high schools for 6th to 12th grades; say that up to 36 of new schools will be in place by September, but that many conversions will have to await construction of new buildings over next five years; Michele Cahill, aide to Schools Chancellor Joel I Klein, says school configurations are part of wider effort that will include changes to curriculum, organization of school day and student support services; changes will include greater personal attention for students; photo (M) Broad Overhaul in New York City To Replace Many Middle Schools"},{"year":"1959","title":"3 Negroes drop out, NC Univ, for acad reasons","excerpt":"plan to re-enter after bldg up grades 3 NEGROES IN SOUTH QUIT COLLEGE CLASS"},{"year":"1937","title":"Bill to be offered to assure country of necessary supplies and resources in event of war","excerpt":"plan to re-establish pre-war neutrality policy SWITZERLAND SEEKS WARTIME SAFEGUARD; Government Plans a Law to Assure Country of Necessary Supplies and Resources"},{"year":"1959","title":"ST.
