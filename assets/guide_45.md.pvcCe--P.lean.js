She does it brilliantly, without mawkishness, in a role that brings to stage center the sweet, dotty little old lady who is so often a bit part in other presentations.It is a role that can so easily be purely comic or purely pathetic. Dame Edith's little old lady quavers, maunders, communicates with imaginary voices, informs the police about plots that never happened and insists to the welfare people that she will no longer need them as soon as she comes into money that is due her.Yet, under Bryan Forbes's direction and script, she becomes a full person, asserting a certain dignity despite her fantasies and dependence upon charity. Dame Edith evokes the surface rakishness of an unwanted and unloved old crow and the interior sensibility of a woman who has to install herself in a cocoon of fantasy to give some meaning to her life.This is brought out not so much in words as it is in little fussy motions of hand and face, the tremulous lips and a studied diction that is in sharp contrast to the speech of those with whom she deals. The camera close-ups of the old lady and her dingy flat emphasize these eloquently, in shades of black, gray and white.Mr. Forbes might have done better to have remained focused on Dame Edith. Instead he adds incidents that impose a distracting \\"real\\" fantasy on the imaginary fantasy one wants so much to explore and understand.Eric Portman, as the husband","excerpt":"Nanette Newman, as the upstairs neighbor, and Avis Bunnage, as the greedy, scheming friend, carry off their roles in an attractive, thoroughly believable style.

Gottfried, an analyst for ESPN, also withdrew his name from consideration Friday, after a Thursday interview with Dean.   Hallman said he and the Southern Miss athletic director, Bill McLellan, had talked with Dean by telephone on Thanksgiving night. \\"My contact has been made,\\" Hallman said. \\"When I will be going, etc., and all that has not been set.

Hallman, 43 years old, has three years left on his contract, which is his first head coaching post. In three years, Hallman has coached the Golden Eagles to a 23-11 overall record.

Yet they waived mission rules that the seals have effective backups, so that if one component failed, another would be available to do the job.

Even accepting for the sake of argument that the mission is, as the NASA administrator, Michael Griffin, put it on Friday, ''magnificent,'' the shuttle returns to a realm of enormous uncertainty. NASA cannot yet say when shuttles will fly again, or how many missions can be flown before the 2010 retirement date that the Bush administration has set for the shuttle. Designs for follow-on vehicles are taking shape, but are still vague -- and the president's plan to use those new craft for missions to return to the moon and go beyond are even more so.     The primary goals of Discovery's mission -- resupplying the space station and testing the cameras and sensors that let NASA truly measure the extent of launch debris for the first     time -- were accomplished handily by the commander, Col. Eileen M. Collins, and her crew.     Beyond that, it has been a mission with high and low points. Discovery's external tank shed so much less debris than earlier ones that the shuttle had just 25 scars on its tiles, onesixth     of the usual amount. But the largest chunk of foam, at 0.9 pounds, was more than enough to cause another catastrophe if it had fallen at an earlier point in the ascent and hit the vehicle","excerpt":"NASA officials announced that no shuttle could fly again until the problem was fixed.     There were also the dangling strips of cloth called gap fillers that might have led to damaging heat during re-entry. To remove that threat, NASA ordered the first-ever spacewalk to the underside of the shuttle. The astronaut Steven K. Robinson plucked the offending bits of rigid cloth from between the tiles with ease. But mission managers decided against a spacewalk to correct an insulating blanket that had puffed out from a spot near the commander's window. The engineers could not come up with a fix they had confidence in, and which made it worth     the risk of a spacewalk.     Discovery is scheduled to glide to the ground as early as 4:46 a.m. Eastern time Monday at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The time is dictated by the way the shuttle's orbit brings it in line with the approach to Cape Canaveral; if necessary, a second opportunity will come slightly later in the morning, at 6:21.     If the weather does not bode well for landing in Florida on Monday, NASA managers will consider two additional landing sites for Tuesday -- Edwards Air Force Base in California     or the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The strong preference is for a Florida landing, however, since the shuttle does not need to be ferried to Florida.     At a briefing on Saturday, the deputy manager of the shuttle program, N. Wayne Hale, said mission managers believed that the return would be safe but that if a landing at Edwards     was necessary they would adjust the shuttle's orbit to avoid flying over Los Angeles. Current weather predictions for Florida, he said, are ''about as good a forecast as you're going to get.''     There are still risks in re-entry, where the fiery plunge into the atmosphere exposes surfaces of the craft to thousands of degrees of heating. NASA hands say they were not always deeply concerned about this leg of the mission, however.     ''Frankly, de-orbit was considered, for lack of a better word, a less risky part of flight than ascent,'' said John Ira Petty, a spokesman for NASA, ''until Columbia.''     The descent gives few clues of its progress. By comparison, the launching has milestones that help observers mark the progress past the various dangerous stages: the solid rocket     boosters break away from the shuttle after two minutes, and the external tank separates at eight and a half minutes. Moment by moment, the spectators' tension eases.     Dr. Griffin, the NASA administrator, said at the news conference Friday that descent was different: ''We don't have those kind of milestones,'' he said. ''We just have to go through     it and see how it comes out.''     That is why he has warned that the risks of space flight do not end until the mission does. On NBC's ''Meet the Press'' last Sunday he was asked, ''When will you be absolutely confident     that it's safe for Discovery to return home?''     Dr. Griffin wryly replied, ''When Eileen has Discovery stopped on the runway and is ready to be towed off.'' He added, ''There is no elimination of all risk.''     But now, with the return in sight, the shuttle families, mission managers and NASA officials are beginning to talk about what to do when it is all over. Pat Youngs, Colonel Collins's husband, says his wife has told him in several e-mail messages from space what she wants when she gets home: Mexican food. ''She's an enchilada fan,'' said Mr. Youngs, who is a commercial pilot.     In a briefing for reporters on Friday morning, Paul Hill, the lead flight director for the mission, was asked how he might celebrate. ''I'll probably shake hands, hug a few people in the control room and go back home to be with my family,'' he said. ''And drink.''     And Dr. Griffin, who prides himself on maintaining an unemotional mien, when asked the same question, paused briefly. ''I'll smile,'' he said.

The instruments defer to his luminous voice, which glides from a fond, limpid tenor to an angelic falsetto, the perfect vehicle for lyrics that seek spirituality in nature and in human love.
