Plagued by ballhandling problems and an uncertain lineup, the Tar Heels quickly found themselves trailing Connecticut, 13-1, in the finale of the Atlantic Coast Conference-Big East Challenge.   But North Carolina's superior size and depth wore down the Huskies. The Tar Heels took the lead late in the second half and pulled away to a 79-64 victory before a capacity crowd of 21,572 at the Dean E. Smith Center.   Earlier in the evening, Villanova defeated Wake Forest, 91-82, as the Big East concluded the second year of the series with a 6-2 edge. Home-Court Edge     \\"We would have never beaten Connecticut except here at home, the way we played,\\" said Dean Smith, the North Carolina coach. \\"We have a lot of work to do.\\"   In the first half, UConn's withering defense produced 16 North Carolina turnovers and a 34.5 percent shooting percentage from the field.   \\"I never thought in my wildest dreams that their press would bother us as much as it seemed to at the beginning of the game,\\" said Smith, whose team improved its record toJU 4-1 despite committing more turnovers (28) than it scored field goals (25). Connecticut fell to 3-1.   Gradually, the Tar Heels regrouped, forging their first lead, 54-52, with seven minutes remaining on a basket by the senior forward Pete Chilcutt. The shot highlighted a 17-4 run by the Tar Heels that broke open the contest.   \\"We weren't going to beat them the way we were playing in the second half, mentally,\\" said Jim Calhoun, the Connecticut coach. He criticized his team's shot selection and decisions down the stretch. \\"Carolina just wore us down. We succumbed to their pressure.\\" Tar Heels Too Tall     The Tar Heels held a 59-32 rebounding edge. The sophomore forward George Lynch had 14 rebounds to lead North Carolina, along with 12 points, while the forward Rick Fox had a team-high 18 points and 10 rebounds before fouling out.   Chris Smith, the UConn guard, led all scorers with 21 points, but missed 13 of 21 shots.   In the first game, Villanova raised its record to 4-1 on the strength of an aggressive, trapping defense and an opportunistic attack that produced numerous inside shots and 63 percent shooting from the field.   The Wildcats, who started three sophomores, frittered away an 11-point first-half lead, and trailed byJU 61-53 with 13:14 remaining in the game. Then they went on a 16-3 run, scoring repeatedly after penetrating Wake Forest's inner defense, and never trailed again.   \\"We tried to trap more, we tried to go after it more, like we had in the first four games,\\" said Rollie Massimino, the Villanova coach, who in his 18th season has embraced what he dubbed a \\"chucking and ducking\\" style.   Villanova was led by the forward Arron Bain, who had 22 points in 28 minutes, and the guard Lance Miller, who had 21.   Wake Forest (3-2) was paced by the forward Chris King, who scored 26 points. Rodney Rogers, the freshman forward, had a game-high 13 rebounds and scored his 19 points in the second half.   Last year the A.C.C. and Big East split the eight-game series. This season the only Big East losers were Connecticut and Pittsburgh, which fell to Virginia in the opener at Richmond, Va.   \\"I think what it says is, we happen to be better in the first week of the season,\\" said Mike Tranghese, the commissioner of the Big East.   Bryant Stith, the junior forward from Virginia, was selected the A.C.C.'s most valuable player on the strength of a 28-point, 12-rebound, five-steal performance. David Johnson of Syracuse was the Big East m.v.p. after contributing 24 points and 17 rebounds in a win over N.C. State. Rutgers 75, St. Joseph's 69     PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Keith Hughes scored 31 points and grabbed 15 rebounds to lead Rutgers to an overtime victory in the Atlantic 10.   Rutger's (4-0 over all, 2-0 in the conference) trailed, 36-24, at halftime but rallied behind Hughes and Craig Carter, whose 3-point shot with seven seconds to go forced the overtime at 62-62.   With Rutgers up by 66-64, Hughes made a jumper and Earl Duncan made two free throws to seal the victory over the Hawks (1-4, 0-3). Pittsburgh 105, Marshall 75     PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Brian Shorter scored 17 of his season-high 20 points in the second half to spark the Panthers (5-1).

Dirks, the man who blew the whistle on the Equity Funding Corporation of America scandal nearly 10 years ago.   Mr. Dirks - who was in the public eye last year when the brokerage firm in which he was a general partner, John Muir & Company, went bankrupt - learned in 1973 that Equity Funding, an insurance brokerage company, had sold vast quantities of bogus insurance policies to reinsurance companies.   The commission has one view of Mr. Dirks's use of that knowledge while Rex E. Lee, the Solicitor General of the United States, has another.   According to the S.E.C., Mr. Dirks, then a securities analyst at Delafield Childs Inc., was illegally using insider information when he told his clients about the scandal before it became public.

Music from the Viennese Classical period, even the early Romantic, bore the stamp of Haydn.  Earlier in this century, Arnold Schoenberg spread the 12-tone catechism throughout Europe and America. And John Cage, who himself studied briefly with Schoenberg, formed his own topsy-turvy academy in the late 1950's. He taught students and colleagues alike how to be free, and also subtly impressed upon them the importance of self-imposed systems.    On Tuesday night at the Paula Cooper Gallery, 155 Wooster Street in SoHo, the Brooklyn-based S.E.M. Ensemble brilliantly re-created the atmosphere of those years. With the aid of two original participants (Mr. Higgins and Jackson Mac Low), Petr Kotik, the director of S.E.M., followed the letter of the scores without seeming to dryly re-enact them. He restored the past to the extent that it looked like a possible future. Review/Music","excerpt":"S.E.M.

Upstairs, brightly colored scribblings on the wall strongly indicate a nursery school or a kindergarten. But now there are strange, dangerous noises coming from behind a second door. Walking into a white, high-vaulted auditorium, you see 20 musicians dressed in black, pealing forth the mountainous, molten dissonances of \\"Deserts,\\" by Varese.

For at that time no one foresaw the changes in the development of the national government which were to come later. In those early days everything Nazi in book, theatre, film, was necessary propaganda. Quantity alone could give weight to the political steam roller. The making of a \\"Horst Wessel\\" film would surely have full governmental support. Was he not their officially sanctioned idol? Did not the mediocre song he had composed become their revolutionary chant? The program proves that earlier support: Supervision and music, Ernst Hanfstaengl (Hitler's press chief)","excerpt":"SA adviser, Richard Fielder (Nazi organizer); a number of Nazi military organizations and, above all, the actual police force.Then about six weeks ago came the previewing of the film by a Nazi compendium with Dr. Goebbels at its head. One could now afford to be fastidious—the film was forbidden \\"for the heroic figure of Horst Wessel was incompetently interpreted, thereby endangering the interest of State and German prestige.\\" Two weeks ago the film censor announced his okay on \\"Hans Westmar\\" (phonetic substitute for \\"Horst Wessel\\"), yesterday we had the première at the Capitol and today it has the unreserved approbation of the government. It proved to be a hundred percenter.Jazz and Communism.It shows the student, Hans Westmar, returning from a genial waltz loving Vienna to an objectionably international Berlin, where, in a bar, a Negro jazz band plays havoc with the martial rhythms of \\"Die Wacht am Rhein\\" and a Spanish dancer toys with the morals of a somewhat less martial burgher of the democratic year 1929. It shows communism as a corroding force and its head, a Russian, a serf to Moscow. Hans Westmar sees delivery from all this and more in the tenets of National Socialism. He becomes active. His organizing gifts are extraordinary, but he believes the party's growth to be in the masses. So he gives up his studies and becomes a manual laborer. He goes to live in the East of Berlin, the stronghold of the Communists. They plot against him, for he succeeds in winning over too many of their members. He is shot, and, though he lingers on a few days, the wound is fatal—he dies.Emil Lohkamp, who takes the title part, has the physical propensities of a fanatic. His abrupt manner of acting and speech underlines this to an almost unsympathetic degree. This must have been the cause of Dr. Goebbels's unfavorable verdict. Irmgard Willers, as the submissive creature of the Communists in love with Hans West-mar, outlines figure of such frail intensity in this first screen appearance that one may hopefully add her to the scant list of the more personal film faces. There are tow parts taken by Jews: a university professor advocating internationalism, which Siegmund Nunberg plays with direct simplicity; the other, a Communist leader and member of the Reichstag, is mugged by Hugo Döblin, who invests this rôle with all the approved bugbear characteristics — a contemptible performance. Neither of these two actors is mentioned in the program. The audience found cause for a laugh when the screen showed two bearded Jews watching a street fight, their whole attitude expressing a childlike and worried wonder at these combative doings—a reaction unthinkable outside the Reich's border.There is an intensely dramatic but very much abbreviated shot of a \\"Mensur,\\" the German student's sabre practice, with the opponents standing close, deftly parrying heavy blows. A close-up shows their cheeks pouted. I take it this is to protect their teeth in case of cuts, which are frequent. But it did look comical and little in keeping with the seriousness of the situation and the dangerousness of this drill, which has caused the loss of so many lives. The ban which since the war had been put on this \\"exercise\\" has recently been lifted. Another one of the numerous Nazi reversions to pre-war practices.The most realistic and therefore the most vital parts of this picture are its mass scenes. The supposed to be historically exact street fight as the funeral cortège passes the Karl Liebknecht house, the Communist headquarters, is brutally convincing and gives one the sensation of an eyewitness. In the transition from \\"Horst Wessel\\" to \\"Hans Westmar\\" the film loses continuity and takes a knowledge of the book too much for granted. Because of this and in spite of an overabundance of close-ups, the intent of the picture is reversed—the story of Hans Westmar merely becomes background to a forcefully documented national movement.\\"Bedside,\\" which is about an X-ray photographer and the fortune he made by cultivating his professional manner, will be turned loose on Broadway soon by First National. It features Warren William and Jean Muir.\\"The Heir Chaser,\\" James Cagney's latest film, will be released by Warner Brothers under the title, \\"Blondes and Bonds.\\" This is scheduled for an early Broadway showing. Bette Davis and Alice White are the women in it. Out in Hollywood Mr. Cagney is preparing to begin work with Joan Blondell in \\"Without Honor,\\" which marks the first Cagney-Blondell collaboration since \\"Blonde Crazy.\\" Most of the action takes place in a small fishing village and Lloyd Bacon, the director, has been hunting good location scenes along the California coast.Harry Wilcoxon, the young English actor, has gone to Hollywood to become Marc Antony in Cecil B. De Mille's \\"Cleapatra.\\" Although he planned to spend several days in New York seeing plays and the sights, the studio demanded his presence and he sternly boarded a plane for the Coast. Mr. Wilcoxon holds a British aviation pilot's license and plans to do all his traveling in this far-flung country by plane. Just before leaving England, he played the leading rôle opposite Evelyn Laye in a British film, \\"Princess Charming.\\" FILM NEWS OF THE GERMAN CAPITAL; The Widely Read Story of Horst Wessel, the Nazi Movement's Almost Legendary Hero, Reaches the Screen"},{"year":"1936","title":"Paris paper repts secret organization of followers of Capt E Roehm, slain in 1934 blood purge, is waging terrorist campaign","excerpt":"SA and SS members found murdered REICH TERROR LAID TO AIDES OF ROEHM; Followers of Late Nazi Chief Threaten Party Leaders, Says Paris Paper."},{"year":"2001","title":"A brief article last Sunday about people who became the subjects of popular songs misspelled the first name of the woman behind ''The Girl From Ipanema.''

Neither so charmingly cynical as his previous \\"The Story of a Cheat\\" nor so wittily philosophical about French manners as his \\"Champs Elysees,\\" this last picture made in Paris by M. Guitry before the outbreak of war is nevertheless a delightful drollery and a sly bit of Gallic wit.M. Guitry, you know, has never regarded matrimony with exceptional piety. As a matter of fact, he himself has roamed quite casually about that blessed state. So it comes as no surprise whatsoever to discover that \\"Nine Bachelors\\" is just a lot of farcical twisting and tying of marriage bonds. It seems that its deus ex machina—no one but M. Guitry, of course—is a sort of freelance promoter and semi-professional schat-chen who sets up, for personal reasons, a highly ingenious marriage mart. For the benefit of alien ladies anxious to obtain French citizenship via the easy expedient of marriage (but with no responsibilities attached), he recruits a panel of elderly bachelors as readily procurable mates.The bachelors, of course, are old gentlemen of reduced circumstances and hopes, but with assorted ideas of honor and masculine dignity. And the film thus becomes a recital in a slightly ribald vein of the matches which M. Guitry makes for seven of these antique candidates with seven variously inspired females. One of the ladies is a beautiful English miss, one an American nightclub singer, one a Chinese dancer, and so on. But the star is a Polish countess, and it is her whom the sly M. Guitry, by a very adroit manoeuvre, pre-empts for himself.True, this bit of risqué teasing is played around a single joke and inclines to become repetitious when told for longer than an hour and a half. Nor does M. Guitry himself contribute much in the way of humor when he sits at a table and spouts, in French, which is well translated into subtitles, his arch philosophies.

The proud burghers who have borne gracefully such weighty burdens as a capricious baseball team should have a time of it explaining away this limp fable about a borough barge captain whose amazing love for his late mother unwittingly involves him in bigamy, murder and other sordid indiscretions. The authors, and they include Arthur Kober, who has earned a well-deserved reputation for original humor, have freighted this vehicle with enough alleged Flatbush malapropisms to satisfy every fan in Ebbets Field, but the gags, like this yarn, simply do not come off. \\"Don Juan Quilligan\\" merely is a drawn-out jape which is more tedious than hilarious.As the captain of the scow, which is hauled between Brooklyn and Utica, William Bendix finds himself spliced to Brooklyn's Joan Blondell (because her laugh reminds Bendix of his sainted mother) and Utica's Mary Treen (because her cooking has the same effect). Mr. Bendix faces these predicaments as well as an ensuing murder rap and enlistments in both the Army and the Navy with little help from the dialogue. What mirth is derived stems from the absurd situations and Bendix's familiar dead-pan and gnarled phraseology. And the remainder of the cast, including Phil Silvers as his mentally agile first mate, fare no better with their assignments.

White wrote, ''All dwellers in cities must live with the stubborn fact of annihilation.'' Now more than ever this rings true. ''Safe: Design Takes On Risk,'' a meditation on contemporary design's response to a dangerous world, opens at the Museum of Modern Art on Oct. 16. It features more than 300 products and prototypes that address ''everything from fear of a paper cut to fear of genocide,'' says the curator Paola Antonelli. In addition to obvious items like land-mine-removal equipment, there are also more disquieting objects. For example, oak ''hideaway furniture'' blends into a room's décor and can conceal its owner inside. The Shmartaf Toddlers Protection System is an air-filtration hood to be used in case of chemical and biological attack. The show highlights the conflict between innovation and comfort.

A1    German officials said they were preparing to extradite to the United States a Sudanese suspect arrested in connection with the bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi.   A8    Malaysian Challenger Arrested  The former Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim, was jailed after a bitter struggle against his one-time mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. The arrest of Mr. Anwar followed his ouster on Sept. 2 and the most lurid political battle that the conservative Muslim country has seen in years.   A3    China Cracks Down on Dissent  Chinese authorities have stepped up a crackdown on dissidents' efforts to form a political party, sending a clear signal that despite liberalization in many areas of life, they will not allow such organized dissent.   A4    Narrow Victory in Sweden  Sweden's governing Social Democrats won by a narrow margin in a national election that signaled a shift to the left. Though the result represented a drop in the party's support, it appeared sufficient to allow the Social Democrats to form an alliance with parties farther to the left, frustrating the effort by Carl Bildt, the Moderate Party leader, to regain the Prime Minister's job, which he held from 1991 to 1994.   A3    NATO's Failure in Kosovo  NATO indecision about whether to act against a three-month-old military offensive in Kosovo by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has severely threatened the credibility of the alliance and almost insured a winter-long human catastrophe, Western diplomats said. A diplomat noted that the alliance has given Mr. Milosevic comfort by failing to live up to repeated threats of using its air power.   A4    Crash Kills Duchess's Mother  Susan Barrantes, mother of the Duchess of York, died in a car accident in Argentina, where she lived. The Duchess, the former wife of Queen Elizabeth II's second son, Prince Andrew, received the news in Italy and left for Argentina.   A3      NATIONAL   A10-17    In a Besieged White House, A Sense of Powerlessness  Nothing is quite the same for President Clinton and his senior aides, advisers and friends these days, and they make little pretense that the White House is other than a shaken, static place where some feel powerless.   A1    Hillary Rodham Clinton is playing her role as First Lady with a no-time-to-waste-hello-goodbye intensity that is both breathtaking and unnerving, struggling to change the subject with passionate talk about health care, education and family, and fighting to win back disillusioned voters, especially women.   A16    If President Clinton wants a sense of how dangerous a place the world has become in the midst of a scandal over his personal conduct, he might want to study the grim faces in the audience when he rises at the green marble podium of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.   A17    The day before President Clinton's grand jury testimony beams into television sets across the nation, White House officials stepped up their accusations that Republicans are conducting a smear attack against Mr. Clinton while a key Democrat suggested the President should personally visit Congress to answer its questions.   A17    Several rabbis in the Washington area have asked the House Judiciary Committee to postpone releasing the videotape of President Clinton's testimony until after the Jewish holiday of Rosh ha-Shanah.   A16    Puerto Rico Prepares for Storm  With Hurricane Georges, the most powerful storm of the season, bearing down with 135 mile an hour winds, residents of Puerto Rico and a dozen smaller Caribbean islands south and east of here braced for what authorities warned could become a disaster.   A10    Lockheed Martin Plans Merger  Moving away from the military business and towards global telecommunications, Lockheed Martin Corporation announced plans for a $2.7 billion acquisition of the Comsat Corporation, a communications satellite company created by the Government three decades ago.   A13    Maui Mayor to Run for Governor  Linda Lingle, the two-time mayor of Maui, won the Republican gubernatorial nomination in Hawaii by a wide margin and will face Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano, a Democrat, in November.   A12    Exhibiting on a Canvas of Skin  No one dons black tie for the annual Inkslinger's Ball in Hollywood, Calif. That would be in bad taste, for a tuxedo would cover too much skin at the one of the country's biggest conventions of tattoo artists. For the last seven years, people from around the world have gathered in Hollywood for three days of tattoo contests, tattoo tips and tattooing.   A14    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-10    Cancer Cluster Residents Redefine Scientific Debate  People who live in areas where the incidence of cancer is higher than expected are turning to politics, posing a challenge to traditional science. While many scientists say that there is a lot of cancer everywhere and that neighborhood concentrations of the disease result from chance, residents have become the driving force behind tens of millions of dollars in new research on cancer clusters.   A1    Union Leader Faces a Challenge  A fast-growing dissident movement at District Council 37, the giant union representing 120,000 New York City public employees, is mounting a major challenge to Stanley Hill, the union's executive director, demanding that he move decisively to stop the corruption that has rocked the union.   B1    Education Officials Criticized  A new report by the New York state comptroller criticizes higher education policymaking as haphazard and often politically influenced and calls on the state to establish a higher education coordinating board to replace or supplement the Board of Regents, the panel that is responsible for education planning in the state.   B6    Young Suspects' Drug Use Falls  Heroin use and the injection of drugs have declined sharply among young people arrested in Manhattan and some other urban centers.   B5    ARTS   E1-8    SPORTS   D1-10    Ripken Ends His Streak  Cal Ripken, the Baltimore Orioles' third baseman who had not missed a game since 1982, removed himself from the lineup a half an hour before the opening pitch, after 2,632 consecutive games.   A1    OBITUARIES   B12    Muriel Humphrey Brown  The widow of Hubert H. Humphrey who filled his seat in the Senate when he died in 1978, she was 86.   B12    Ernst Rudolph Jaakson  The Estonian Ambassador to the United States was 93. He maintained a consulate in New York after the Soviet Union absorbed his country, and was the longest-serving diplomat in the world.   B12    BUSINESS DAY   C1-10    Administration and Agency Differ on Internet Privacy  After more than a year of heated debate within the Government, the Federal Trade Commission has all but decided it will part company with the Clinton Administration over the contention that business can regulate itself when it comes to Internet privacy.   C1    A New Theory on 'Deep Throat'  ''Deep Throat,'' the man credited with being the source of Washington Post articles that unraveled the Watergate conspiracy, was a composite, a plot device used by the reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in their book, ''All the President's Men,'' their former literary agent claims.   C7    Stocks Down in Tokyo  Japanese stocks fell 2.3 percent in morning trading, amid worries about a fragile political deal to fix the banking system. The Nikkei average dropped 321.12 points to close the morning session at 13,661.99, after reaching 13,658.79, the lowest trading level since March 1986.
