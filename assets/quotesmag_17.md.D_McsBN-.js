And, to tell you the truth, for that matter, she almost succeeds in squashing the film, so insufferably strident and humorless is her domination of the whole affair.This tempestuous, termagant creature starts browbeating right at the start and she continues at that occupation until two or three minutes before the end. She browbeats her gentle Cockney husband, her simpleton sister-in-law, her dutifully unresisting daughter and the nice young sailor the latter is about to wed. She browbeats so hard the fearful sailor finally leaves the daughter waiting at the church, whereupon she tries to browbeat the vicar. He's the one who sets things right at the end.If there was some sort of spicy British humor in this basically dismal account, it might be objectively amusing and therefore endurable. But there's nothing about this old woman, played by Peggy Mount, that has any more amusement in it than a steam-roller plunging down a hill. She is big, broad, beetling and noisy, without variety or finesse. To get in her way is disastrous. She just about flattens everything.Shirley Eaton is winsome as her daughter, Ronald Lewis is pleasant as the tar and Esma Cannon is cheerfully flighty as the simpleton sister-in-law. Cyril Smith is even likely as the husband and Gordon Jackson is fairly droll as a Scottish shipmate of the bridegroom who hasn't altogether lost his Scottish ways.But the lot of them take a downright beating from Miss Mount and from the script, which we learn is from a play that has run three years in London!The ocean is growing wider every day.???in like fashion gave us \\"Don Giovanni\\" in toto (and how!) Mr. Czinner rates the highest respect for his extended close-up of a superlative ballet group in action and apparently at its peak, in six repertory excerpts, including a long selection from \\"Giselle.\\" Add one solo whose beauty defies description. The reason is a lady named Galina Ulanova, as \\"The Dying Swan.\\"What is labeled Mr. Czinner's \\"new technique\\" of filming is simply this: He shoots close, medium-far and, occasionally, as far away as possible with his camera anchored the whole time at stage center foreground. Most of the time, when it really matters, the amazing Bolshoi feet remain visible.Two of the fragments, the \\"Dance of the Tartars\\" from Asafiev's \\"The Fountain of Bakchsarai\\" and the \\"Spanish Dance\\" from Tchaikovsky's \\"Swan Lake\\" are splendidly galvanic. But the plain, almost threadbare, décor pales beside the magnificent sets for the same numbers in Russian-made Bolshoi films already shown here.The dancing is just as fine, and the mounting just as unimpressive, in a youthful pas do deux to Rachmaninoff's \\"Spring Water\\" and the group's Polonaise and Cracovienne from Glinka's \\"Ivan Susanin.\\" The picturesqueness of the \\"Walpurgisnacht\\" from Gounod's \\"Faust\\" lies primarily in the way so much exposed flesh smites a black backdrop.The lengthy \\"Giselle\\" section, excluding one strange cut at the climax, is satisfactorily compressed. Nikolai Fadeyechev makes a fine, virile hero","excerpt":"Miss Ulanova, again, is wonderful.

Here's a look at the games (all times are Eastern) compiled by Michael Sisak of The New York Times: Mazda Gator Bowl Kickoff At Jacksonville, Fla., 11:30 A.M., ESPN. Teams Michigan (8-3) vs. Mississippi (9-2). Rank Michigan: 12 (A.P.), 12 (U.P.I.), 11 (Times)","excerpt":"Mississippi: 15 (A.P.), 14 (U.P.I.), 20 (Times). Season Review Nine more points and Michigan would have been 11-0. After Stanford upset Notre Dame, the Wolverines were No. 1 for a week until their tainted 28-27 loss to Michigan State. Tripping in the end zone on Michigan's potential winning 2-point conversion pass was not called. Mississippi played with inspiration for its paralyzed defensive back Chucky Mullins and surprisingly challenged Tennessee for the Southeastern Conference title. But Tennessee ended the 7-victory Ole Miss streak, 22-13. Matchups \\"You're in for a rough afternoon,\\" Bo Schembechler warned the free safety Todd Sandroni, and that was from a    retired    Michigan coach. To Mississippi, Michigan's monster line looks like Tennessee's. It has blocked for the 11th-best rushing offense in the nation, 253.1 yards a game, led by the 11th-best back, Jon Vaughn, 6.1 yards a carry and 112.36 yards a game. Challenging the Mississippi all-America strong safety Chris Mitchell will be the wide receiver Desmond Howard, who had 57 receptions this season. Mississippi's Randy Baldwin had 970 yards rushing. Hall of Fame Bowl Kickoff At Tampa, Fla., 1 P.M., NBC. Teams Illinois (8-3) vs. Clemson (9-2). Rank Clemson: 14 (A.P.), 11 (U.P.I.), 10 (Times); Illinois: 16 (A.P.), 17 (U.P.I.), 27 (Times). Season Review Adjusting slowly to its new coach, Ken Hatfield, Clemson recovered from losses to Virginia (20-7) and Georgia Tech (21-19) to lead the nation in total defense, allowing only 3.5 yards a play and 216.9 yards a game. The Tigers were second in scoring defense, 9.9 points a game and second in rushing defense, 71.7 yards a game. Illinois beat Colorado, 23-22, to begin a six-game winning streak but collapsed against Iowa, 54-28, and Michigan, 22-17. Matchups The biggest surprise for Illinois was the sophomore quarterback Jason Verduzco, who made the offense more effective than Jeff George. Verduzco completed 64.5 percent of his passes, second-best in the nation, for 2,446 yards and 16 touchdowns. The tailback Howard Griffith broke Red Grange's school record of 5 touchdowns in a game when he set an N.C.A.A. record with 8 against Southern Illinois. Florida Citrus Bowl Kickoff At Orlando, Fla., 1:30 P.M., ABC. Teams Georgia Tech (10-0-1) vs. Nebraska (9-2). Rank Georgia Tech: 2 (A.P.), 2 (U.P.I.), 2 (Times); Nebraska: 19 (A.P.), 13 (U.P.I.), 15 (Times). Season Review Georgia Tech, the season's biggest surprise, can't find respect even though it dislodged Virginia from No. 1 and beat Clemson. The Yellow Jackets are underdogs although they were the only undefeated Division I-A team. Their 17-1-1 surge includes 15 straight unbeaten games. Nebraska was 8-0 and No. 3 before falling to Colorado by 27-12 and to Oklahoma by an embarrassing 45-10. Matchups Georgia Tech's Shawn Jones, a sophomore who chose Coach Bobby Ross because he coached Boomer Esiason, was the second-best quarterback in the Atlantic Coast Conference, completing 57.9 percent of his passes for 2,008 yards. The all-America safety Ken Swilling leads a defense that allowed only 110.9 rushing yards a game. Nebraska's I-backs averaged 340 yards, second-best in the nation.  Over all, Nebraska averaged 444.4 yards, 13th-best, and 37.5 points, sixth-best. But Nebraska is without its quarterback, Mickey Joseph, whose calf injury against Oklahoma required 125 stitches. Mobil Cotton Bowl Kickoff At Dallas, 1:30 P.M., CBS. Teams Texas (10-1) vs. Miami (9-2). Rank Texas: 3 (A.P.), 3 (U.P.I.), 1 (Times); Miami: 4 (A.P.), 4 (U.P.I.), 4 (Times). Season Review Texas won nine consecutive games since being overtaken by Colorado, 29-22, on Sept. 22. The Longhorns came from behind for seven victories. Miami, the preseason No. 1, lost at B.Y.U., 28-21, and at Notre Dame, 29-20, and escaped at San Diego State, 30-28, signs of a shaky road team. Matchups Miami averaged 483 yards, fifth-best nationally, and 36.5 points a game, eighth-best. The rushing defense is led by the Outland Trophy winner Russell Maryland and it allowed only 79.7 yards, third-best. But the passing defense was porous for Ty Detmer's 406 yards and for Dan McGwire's 323. Its pursuit may be exploited deeply by the quarterback Peter Gardere and his veteran receivers, Keith and Kerry Cash, and Johnny Walker (Burnt Orange). The Texas defense scrambled the heralded Houston quarterback David Klinger and will pressure Craig Erickson, who was fifth-best in total offense with 338 yards a game. The Texas defense will try to keep Miami offbalance with disguised blitzes. Sunkist Fiesta Bowl Kickoff At Tempe, Ariz., 4:30 P.M., NBC. Teams Alabama (7-4) vs. Louisville (9-1-1). Rank Louisville: 18 (A.P.), 16 (U.P.I.), 19 (Times); Alabama: 25 (A.P.), 22 (U.P.I.), 17 (Times). Season Review Louisville won its last six games and accepted its first bowl bid in 13 years when many colleges turned down the Fiesta Bowl after Arizona voters rejected a paid holiday for state workers to honor Martin Luther King Jr. Louisville has not played since Nov. 10, but Coach Howard Schellenberger said he prepared the Cardinals the way he did Miami for its 1983 national title victory. \\"I feel we can compete with anybody in the United States,\\" he said. Alabama began 0-3 and won seven of its last eight games, including the 6-3 upset that knocked Tennessee out of No. 1 contention. Matchups About Alabama's defense, Schellenberger said: \\"We're going to have to play with reckless abandon. We're going to attack them from sideline to sideline.\\" Alabama was No. 1 against the pass and No. 6 against the rush (91.5 yards) and No. 3 against both (229.4 yards). The quarterback Browning Nagle is the 13th-best nationally. The Louisville linebacker Mark Sander, two tackles shy of Doug Buffone's school record, was stabbed in the abdomen on Nov. 23 but expects to start. Rose Bowl Kickoff At Pasadena, Calif., 5 P.M., ABC. Teams Washington (9-2) vs. Iowa (8-3). Rank Washington: 8 (A.P.), 7 (U.P.I.), 5 (Times); Iowa: 17 (A.P.), 15 (U.P.I.), 22 (Times). Season Review Washington exceeded expectations and is in the Rose Bowl for the first time in nine years. The Huskies were No. 2 before a 25-22 upset by 21-point underdog U.C.L.A. in Seattle on Nov. 10. Iowa won the Big Ten berth by beating Michigan, 24-23; Illinois, 54-28, and Michigan State, 12-7, after being embarrassed at Miami, 48-21. But the Hawkeyes have lost two of their last three games. Matchups: Washington is led by the senior tailback Greg Lewis, who was fourth in the nation in rushing with 127.9 yards a game and seventh in all-purpose running with 162.4 yards a game, better than the Rocket, Raghib Ismail. Iowa will counter with Nick Bell, a 225-pounder whom Coach John Mackovic called a \\"tailback in a fullback's body.\\" The Washington defense is led by the gambling and relentless sophomore Steve Emtman, a 6-4, 280-pound tackle. It allowed only 66.8 yards a game rushing, best in the nation. Federal Express Orange Bowl Kickoff At Miami, 8 P.M., NBC. Teams Notre Dame (9-2) vs. Colorado (10-1-1). Rank Colorado: 1 (A.P.), 1 (U.P.I.), 3 (Times); Notre Dame: 5 (A.P.), 6 (U.P.I.), 6 (Times). Season Review Notre Dame twice was No. 1 for a total of six weeks, longer than any other team. The first reign came after Miami's loss on Sept. 8 at Brigham Young until 5-6 Stanford upset the Irish, 36-31, on Oct. 6, as the potential winning pass was dropped by Derek Brown in the end zone. When Georgia Tech dislodged Virginia from No. 1 on Nov. 3, the Irish regained the top ranking for two weeks until Penn State upset them, 24-21. Colorado was 1-1-1 and ranked No. 20 before making its climb to No. 1. The Buffaloes were tied by Tennessee, then escaped Stanford and lost to Illinois, 23-22. Then they dealt Texas its lone loss, 29-22, and beat Washington, 20-14. A controversial victory came at Missouri when they scored on a fifth-down plunge after the officials had lost count for the 33-31 victory on Oct. 6. The 27-12 rout of Nebraska put them ahead of Notre Dame. Matchups In the last Orange Bowl, Notre Dame won, 21-6. But Colorado is more mature and productive, and Notre Dame, defensively, is poorer, allowing 440 yards and 23 points a game. In each game the Irish have allowed 96 more yards than they did last season. Colorado's all-purpose wide receiver, Mike Pritchard, will wear a cast on a broken left hand suffered in practice on Dec. 24. Pritchard, a 5-11 senior, was the team's most valuable player with 1,515 all-purpose yards in 75 plays (20.5 a play and 26.2 a catch). The game features three Heisman finalists: The Notre Dame flanker Raghib Ismail, second, and the Colorado tailback Eric Bieniemy, third, and the Colorado quarterback Darian Hagan, fifth last year. Bieniemy was second in the nation in rushing with 1,628 yards (148 a game and 5.7 a carry), and he had 17 touchdowns. He was fourth as an all-purpose runner with 2,038 yards (165.27 a game) and Ismail was ninth with 1,726 yards (156.91). Colorado's Alfred Williams won the Dick Butkus Award as the nation's best linebacker, and Notre Dame's Chris Zorich won the Lombardi Award as the best defensive lineman. U.S.F.&G. Sugar Bowl Kickoff At New Orleans, 8:30 P.M. Teams Tennessee (8-2-2) vs. Virginia (8-3). Rank Tennessee: 10 (A.P.), 10 (U.P.I.), 16 (Times); Virginia: 27 (A.P.), 23 (U.P.I.), 21 (Times). Season Review Tennessee tied Colorado, 31-31, and lost its tailback, Chuck Webb, in the second game of the season. The Vols were tied by Auburn, 26-26, after trailing by 26-9. Then they were upset by Alabama, 9-6, before losing to Notre Dame, 34-29. Virginia was 7-0 and had been No. 1 for three weeks before being upset by Georgia Tech, 41-38. That began a series of three losses in the last four games. Prophetically, Coach George Welsh had said: \\"Maybe it's like Andy Warhol said. Maybe this is our 15 minutes of fame.\\" Matchups How well Virginia does will depend on the quarterback Shawn Moore, who suffered a dislocated thumb on his passing hand in the loss to Maryland on Nov. 10. Moore led the nation in passing efficiency with a 160.7 rating, throwing for 2,262 yards and 29 touchdowns, and also ran for 306 yards and 8 touchdowns. Virginia's Herman Moore was the third-best receiver in the nation, averaging 108.18 yards a game with 13 touchdowns, and Tennessee's Carl Pickens was 17th at 83.36 with 16 touchdowns. Virginia had the fourth-best scoring offense at 40.2 points a game. Tennessee was seventh at 36.8.

More recently discovered by Midwestern and Northern tourists and golfers, the Coast has, despite devastation by hurricanes and the proliferation of hotels and motels, maintained its appealing ambience &#8212;its 26&#8208;mile&#8208;long stretch of beaches, huge old oak trees, year&#8208;round golf and tennis, interesting architecture and historic landmarks. And its waters yield vast quantities of fish, shrimp and oysters. Unlike many parts of the country, where property owners have closed off beaches for their own private use, the Mississippi Gulf Coast has democratically kept its waterfront land open to the public, for strolling, picnicking or launching a boat. It's possible to swim, too, if one doesn't mind warm, calm water and wading out beyond the shallows. The main towns are Pass Christian, noted for its Southern beachfront homes; Gulfport, a busy port town; Biloxi, with a concentration of hotels; Ocean Springs, a village reminiscent of some New England coastal villages, and Pascagoula, an industrial and fishing center.
