She observes that empathy is the emotional cornerstone of moral judgment. At first, children are governed almost entirely by self-interest. Two-year-olds are less able to discern right from wrong than five-year-olds. As most parents would agree, to a kindergarten child, fairness often means doing it his way.   Empathy instruction occurs in gradual increments. It begins at home with loving parents explaining how they feel about the child's thoughts and actions. Research demonstrates that parents who use this method have children with fewer behavioral problems. Gradually, children develop an understanding of how they themselves might feel in another person's situation.   To teach the strategies for peaceful resolution of differences requires painstaking instruction and forbearance. We and our children must be willing to rely on logic, negotiation and argument. We must be able to undergo a change of mind by the strength of opposing arguments and have the flexibility to compromise. That takes time and energy. Sometimes it seems simpler to use force.   Even if your children and mine learn their lessons well, they will not fail to notice that there are others who do not always play fair. What are they to do when confronted by a bully on the street? Since we do not have the wherewithal to transform the world's people into peaceful problem solvers, it is foolhardy and self-destructive to be unprepared to combat aggression. Knowing when to stand up to challenges and when to capitulate requires insight into human behavior, wisdom and self-control.   As kids get older, they become capable of dealing with shades of gray and perplexing problems. Even if we've gotten used to it, let's not surrender to war as inevitable. It is our responsibility to strive toward the ideal. LAWRENCE BALTER  New York, Feb. 10, 1991 he writer is professor of applied psychology at New York University.

This time, they said, knowing there would be skeptics, they mean it. It was a significant breakthrough, but true to the spirit of a conference that began last October, it also underscored how much more work remains. First, the full committee must endorse the tentative settlement. Then it must take up new energy taxes, matters that are not as simple as they seemed before the deadlock over gas developed last December. Then the entire energy package, including elements settled months ago, must be voted on again by the full House and Senate, which had passed quite different bills.

This picture has been produced with a sense of drama and also a sense of humor. There are moments when the impossible is accomplished, but as Hobart. Henley has directed it so intelligently one is willing to accept them, together with convenient co-incidences, as interesting imaginative feats.Ben Hecht, author of \\"Underworld,\\" is responsible for the story, and his work is strong enough to withstand studio attacks. Perhaps it inspired Mr. Henley and the players, for one cannot point to a single disappointing performance in this film nor to a scene that does not hold the attention.Charles Ruggles, well-known for his characterizations of inebriates, is perceived in this tale both drunk and sober. It falls to his lot to talk a lot of twaddle over the telephone to the city editor of a Chicago newspaper and at the same time to tick off by dots and dashes the story of a murder by rum-runners and the fact that a chief of police of a suburb of the Windy City is one of the leading figures in a liquor ring. One can't help thinking while Willie Bindbugel (Mr. Ruggles) stands in the telephone booth, with a desperate bootlegger a few yards away, and talks in one line and uses the Morse code in another, that he is straining his mighty brain. Be that as it may, the message is quite successful.While this is going on, one also wonders why Sam Horner, the bootlegger, played by Fred Kohler, does not grasp what's happening, for he appears to be intelligent if lawless.In a final episode of this narrative, Helen Morgan, as Lola Fagan, takes a leaf out of \\"Broadway\\" and saves her old-time sweetheart, Bindbugel, by putting a bullet through Horner's heart. This is accomplished with stirring effect and without the tried and trusted methods of old movie tactics.In the beginning James Hanson, a reporter, is sent out by his city editor to look up a report on Horner's bootlegging activities. Hanson calls up to tell the result of his investigation to the newspaper and the city editor is seen listening at the telephone to Hanson, whose voice is heard. Suddenly the talking ceases. In another scene Horner is perceived putting his pistol back in his pocket and then taking a paper with penciled notes from Hanson, who is dead.The city editor presumes that Hanson has been drinking, and so he sends Bindbugel out to follow up the story. Mr. Bindbugel has little knowledge of the den of iniquity run by Horner. He meets Lola, whom he recognizes as a girl from his home town. How he subsequently is sent away after being drugged and then returns is a mixture of comedy and drama. His persistence finally wins out, but he would have paid for it with his life had not Lola been ready with a pistol.Horner's retreat is filmed impressively, for everybody in it, from the entertainers to the waiters and cook, have the appearance of desperadoes. Horner is a ruthless gunman, who expects to be obeyed or he will know the reason why.Miss Morgan gives a human interpretation to the rôle of Lola.

There are several kinds of cogeneration systems in use, but recently a steam-injected gas turbine, or STIG, process has been gaining in popularity.   According to a study at Princeton University's Center for Energy and Environmental Studies, STIG systems generate more power than other cogeneration approaches, but use the same amount of fuel. Eric D. Larson and Robert H. Williams, research scientists who conducted the Princeton study, said that a STIG plant could produce as much as six megawatts of power, compared with three and a half megawatts for a standard gas turbine plant using the same amount of fuel.

Or is \\"Western culture\\" in reality an ideology of white males who, in the name of progress and reason, have psychologically dominated the earth? In recent years, this debate has become especially heated on American campuses, with upholders of the Western tradition accusing their opponents of imposing their own ideology, based on calls for multiculturalism and a rejection of Western civilization. This supposed new orthodoxy is sometimes derisively called \\"the tyranny of the politically correct.\\" The Week in Review asked people at several universities for their views from the front lines.  Educational Democracy    The tyranny of the politically correct? Multiculturalism as Exhibit A? You must be kidding. Perhaps unfortunate phrases, coined in California, play differently on the East Coast. Speaking from California, where the nonwhite population is rapidly becoming a statewide majority (and already is so in grades K through 12), dismissive talk about political correctness sounds just plain silly. The students are already in the classroom. They are diverse, and they do talk back.   If the pain of changes under way is great, the pain of no change is even greater. I remember what it was like as a Chicano in junior high school during the 1950's in Tucson, Ariz. The punishment was bending over, holding your ankles, and getting swats with a board. The crime was speaking Spanish on the playground. Somehow, fluency in Spanish was a deficit in elementary school and an achievement in college. When will we discover that diversity is a valuable resource?   Try beginning to teach a diverse classroom with: \\"We must first learn our heritage. It extends from Plato and Aristotle to Milton and Shakespeare.\\" The students ask, \\"Who's the 'We' ?\\" At Stanford, over 40 percent of the entering undergraduates are Asian-Americans, African Americans, native Americans and Chicanos. Who, they wonder, is included in the phrase \\"our heritage?\\" Are they included? Must they continue to look into the curricular mirror and see nothing?   Sure, there's lip service, trendiness, insensitivity, confusion and all the rest. Sure, multiculturalism can sound inadequate or worse to those historically left out. But many people are also using multiculturalism as a tool for grappling with vexed issues. Newly diverse classrooms often do not work by the old rules. Newly selected texts cannot always be read in the old ways.   Educational democracy will not come easily. It will involve what I have come to call questions of cultural citizenship. How can diverse groups retain their diversity and participate in a democratic community? Can they be full and equal citizens who enjoy the privilege of shaping their destiny? Can they do so without having to surrender their heritages? -- Renato Rosaldo, Professor of Anthropology, Stanford University  'The Light of Reason Goes Out'     Deriding those who seek to understand the world, Marx said, \\"The point is to change it.\\" That too is the point of \\"pluralist\\" academics who promote \\"diversity\\" and \\"multiculturalism.\\" The terms are seriously misleading: one is naturally led to think of pluralists as fostering academically demanding programs requiring mastery of one or more foreign languages and thorough study of some (non-Western) culture(s). The agenda, however, is political: to transform an academy (ultimately, a society) that has \\"silenced\\" women and minorities. Pluralists tend to believe that the American university, supposedly liberal and humane, serves to perpetuate an oppressor class. (For feminists this is the \\"hetero-patriarchy\\"","excerpt":"more generally, it is the white, \\"Eurocentric\\" elite that \\"imposes prevailing cultural norms.\\") Finding the ideal of disinterested scholarship hypocritical, pluralists advocate a pedagogy that \\"empowers\\" students by alerting them to the need for struggle against partriarchy, racism and classism.   Pluralists tend to be latter-day Sophists, holding a Protagorean view that truth is not \\"out there\\" but \\"manmade.\\" The contrasting phrases are Richard Rorty's, who has also said he finds no useful distinction between propaganda and the use of reason. Is it any wonder that pluralist classes tend to be \\"workshops\\" in consciousness-raising? When the intellectual is the political, the light of reason goes out. -- Frederic T. Sommers, Professor of Philosophy, Brandeis University  When Is Something 'Political'?    George Orwell once wrote that \\"no book is genuinely free from political bias. The opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude.\\"    Orwell's point was that literature shapes our political attitudes all the more when it isn't explicitly    about    politics. Language silently thrusts all kinds of political assumptions on us if we don't become alert to them -- assumptions, for example, about whose sexuality is normal and abnormal and which groups have the right to run things.   Often, these assumptions are taken for granted as going without saying in the culture, as Milton took it for granted in \\"Paradise Lost\\" that Eve was mentally inferior to Adam, or as Tom Wolfe takes it for granted in \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" that blacks will get out of hand if the whites who naturally run society don't have the guts to control them.   The Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe has said that no novel is ever politically neutral, because \\"even the attempt to say nothing about politics is a big political statement. You are saying, then, that everything is O.K.\\" Yet I'm described as being political if I discuss a work's treatment of gender and race with my students, but if I don't mention such matters because I'm satisfied with the existing arrangements I'm not taken to be doing anything political. There's a double standard here: criticizing the status quo is political while accepting it isn't. -- Gerald Graff, Professor of English, Northwestern University Who's to Say What's 'Acceptable'     I am a black woman with a memory of what things were like before the advent of affirmative action, feminist theories, African-American studies, and diversified faculties and student bodies. I recall the time when virtually no people of color or white women taught at the great research universities, many of whose undergraduate student bodies were exclusively male.   In the 1960's and 1970's, most of academia rejected racial/ethnic and women's studies as narrowly particular, as though only nonwhite people had race and only nonmale people had gender. Hence black graduate students were warned away from racial topics, and women were told that if they wanted to be respected intellectually, they should avoid women's studies. We were steered toward more acceptable subjects, which were the lives and works of the wealthy, white and male.   In those days, the champions of orthodoxy described their own preoccupations in handsome, universal terms such as \\"truth\\" and \\"intrinsic worth.\\" They disdained our ways of thinking as \\"political,\\" while they wrapped themselves in the unassailable: \\"excellence.\\"   I wish that those who take potshots at what they see as a new \\"political correctness\\" would give a thought to what American universities used to be like. Then, perhaps, they would hesitate before assailing the attempt to forge a pedagogy appropriate for newly diversified student bodies and faculties. -- Nell Irvin Painter, Professor of History, Princeton University  Indoctrination Is Not Education     The chief danger posed by academic leftists -- advocates of radical feminism, the normalization of homosexuality, Marxist revolution, and the like -- lies in the principled refusal of so many of them to allow others the space in which to articulate objections to their way of thinking -- space that is indispensable to survival of critical thought. When all dissent is immediately labeled as bigotry or ascribed to self-interest, dialogue and debate become impossible, and education degenerates into indoctrination. This poisonous process, most pronounced in literary and religious fields, has undone many of the most distinguished programs and faculties. Its antidote is something the radicals themselves often endorse loudly: diversity and pluralism. But they tend to define diversity exclusively by gender, race and sometimes class, ignoring the more subtle differences of intellectual and religious tradition and moral vision.   It is especially regrettable that the preoccupation with race tends to assimilate the experience of all whites to that of elite Protestant groups from northwestern Europe and helps perpetuate the anti-Catholicism still potent in academia. The source of this cramped definition of diversity is the neo-Marxist idea that class, race and gender determine consciousness. Ironic, is it not, that as so many nations discard the legacy of Marx, American professors embrace it all the more tightly?   The most alarming aspect of the current ideologization of academic life is the impression students receive that truth reduces to issues of power. As this impression spreads, the \\"deconstruction\\" of the university accelerates, for the transcendent horizon that alone justifies our enormous investment in humanistic education is not just ignored, but denied. -- Jon D. Levenson, Professor of Jewish Studies, Harvard Divinity School  'Europhobia' In the High Schools     We must urgently look at how these currently fashionable orthodoxies at the university level have begun to affect the public schools. Most pre-college students are too naive to understand how university-trained teachers or curriculum developers are manipulating them. And school committees and parents are usually totally unaware of what is going on because the Europhobia, national self-hatred and inter-ethnic hostilities that these orthodoxies are promoting have been cleverly disguised by current buzz words like multiculturalism, critical thinking and diversity.    All these terms can have straightforward and positive academic meanings, and in many school curriculum guides or individual courses they do. That is why manifestations of the ideology they cover up are difficult for unsophisticated parents to discern.   A current example of how a school committee is allowing a once outstanding academic curriculum to be transformed into a curriculum for political indoctrination is taking place right now in Brookline, Mass., where I live. Last year, the school committee voted to drop one of the high school's most popular and intellectually challenging courses -- Advanced Placement European History -- when its assistant superintendent for curriculum and most of the high school's social studies department argued that such a course was now incompatible with a multicultural curriculum. This year, large numbers of students have petitioned to have the course reinstated and obtained support from a legal ruling by the State Department of Education. High noon comes on Dec. 18, with a confused school committee caught between the intellectual demands of its own students and the fierce hostility of a Europhobic social studies department. If the course is reinstated, the department wants, as its pound of flesh, ninth graders henceforth to have to choose between taking European history in their sophomore year and taking the advanced placement course when they are seniors. If students are forced to forego as sophomores a European history course in order to be eligible for the advanced placement course as seniors, the remaining sophomore alternatives include a course in African-American history, which discusses the trans-Atlantic slave trade but conveniently omits discussion of the Arab slave trade in its coverage of African history, and another controversial course that focuses on three unrelated areas of conflict in the world: Northern Ireland, Vietnam and the Middle East. The school committee wants to believe that such courses are justified by the \\"needs\\" of the diverse population at the high school. The basic purpose of these and the other sophomore courses, however, is to balkanize students ethnically before they take U.S. history in grade 11 and to encourage them to view Britain, America and Israel as oppressor nations. -- Sandra Stotsky, Director, Summer Institute on Writing, Reading and Civic Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education  Weeding Outc The New Puritanism     Like the Puritans, the politically correct have an apparently desperate need to create an exclusive community. Their rituals are the conferences they attend; their liturgical language, an indecipherable jargon that belies their commitment to openness. Ultimately, American Puritanism centered itself around the need to distinguish between the saved and the damned. Making that distinction was an endless process, as it is for the politically correct. The saved -- in p.c. language, the \\"oppressed\\" -- are good no matter what they do; racial minorities, for instance, are, by definition, incapable of racism. The damned -- the white male \\"oppressors\\" of p.c. language -- are evil, even when they teach or act politically in favor of the oppressed.   But oppression is real, injustice based on gender, race and class is profound, pervasive and morally indefensible. The problem for the universities is not that the issues are less important than the politically correct make them, but that a Puritan style of reform is incompatible with the life of the mind. Many bonafide liberals have been startled to find themselves condemned, cursed, occasionally even physically attacked, by the politically correct. There is no room for the hesitations of reason in matters of faith.   There is a less noble dynamic at work here. Consider the endless possibilities political correctness holds out for research and publication, especially in the field of literature. Each new critical weapon opens the whole Western textual tradition to a new campaign of slash and burn. This is serious stuff. Academic careers are made and unmade in these waves of puritan heresy hunting. -- John E. Becker, Director of the Core Curriculum, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Madison, N.J. The Diversity Of Women's Studies     In fields such as women's studies, there is scarcely agreement on the assortment of positions claimed to be hegemonic. Currently there are over a half dozen ideological and theoretical \\"schools\\" in women's studies itself. Theories also overlap. Some conservative thinkers share with some radical feminists the belief that there are innate, biological differences between men and women. Arguments over the role of the state in the regulation of pornography and prostitution have allied conservatives with radical feminists against sexual liberals and libertarians. All of these disagreements form the basis for Women's (or Gender) Studies 101. While there is agreement that these issues should be discussed within the university by conservatives and radicals alike, there is not agreement among the scholars who adhere to and publish about these various schools of thought. -- Lois West, Assistant Professor of Sociology and Women's Studies, Florida International University  It's Not Simply 'Us vs. Them'     The criticism of political correctness usually comes in one of two versions: conservatives gripe about the politicization of academia (as if it had ever been unpolitical) and liberals whine about academic freedom (as if the issue were not precisely what that is). There are always only two sides to the issue, and if \\"we\\" are on the right side, \\"they\\" must be in the wrong.    I am interested in undercutting such binary logic. Rather than fruitlessly condemning the phenomenon, I would ask what makes p.c.-ness tick. I suspect that political correctness is much like other better-known fundamentalisms in that it is primarily concerned not with achieving its stated goals, but with preserving its own coherence. What counts about a fervent belief is not the belief itself (be it racial harmony, equality between the sexes, or the literal truth of the Bible) but the fervor with which it is held. People latch onto an orthodoxy because it provides them with a mental grid with which they organize their experience; the content of the orthodoxy is almost irrelevant.    A critique of political correctness need not imply a conservative political agenda; conservatives and p.c.-niks both like to give up contentious argument for orthodoxy, which puts a halt to thinking and takes the last bit of fun out of academia. -- Michel Chaouli, Department of Comparative Literature, University of California, Berkeley  A Bad Case of Academic Autism     'The 80's taught us a lesson about how the critical hairshirt could become more of a fashion statement than a political one.  In the old days, an academic book review might chastise a work of scholarship for inaccuracies in citation and such. Of late, for equally venial offenses, you'd probably be accused of complicity with the ideologies of oppression, of silencing all the wretched of the earth with a single paragraph. It is heady stuff: real politics never felt that good.   How did we come to appraise works of cultural criticism in terms more appropriate to combat? Academics made a pendular swing from the silly notion that scholarship existed wholly apart from politics to the equally silly position that everything we did had the very gravest political significance. We fell into what I call academic autism: close your eyes tight, recite the mantra of race-class-gender, and social problems will disappear.   A friend of mine cynically suggested that we institutionalize something that used to happen implicitly at conferences on \\"minority discourse\\" -- award a prize for the most oppressed speaker or respondent. At the end of the year, she added, we could hold a sort of Oppression Academy Awards ceremony. Once the invocation of oppression became another move in a game of academic one-upmanship, it was easy to lose sight of what's happening on the streets outside -- where almost half of the black children in this country live below the poverty line, and a black male in his 20's is more likely to end up in jail than in college.   Joining mood rings and Earth Shoes, \\"political correctness\\" has now entered into the realm of the merely facetious. Which isn't to say that the academy is no longer a theater for larger social conflicts. It's just that the academic intellectuals no longer have to pretend to know all the answers ahead of time. After all the shouting is over, is it too much to hope that the real conversation, long deferred, may begin? -- Henry Louis Gates Jr., Professor of English, Duke University The Nation: A Campus Forum on Multiculturalism; Opening Academia Without Closing It Down"},{"year":"1943","title":"Axis losses, Stalingrad area, since mid-Nov NAZI ARMY BEATEN","excerpt":"More Generals Captured in Final Assault on Axis Survivors"},{"year":"1993","title":"One day in March, Maj.

Yet you lost an excellent opportunity to question why there has been an increase in strike-related violence in this country.   With the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, William N. Cooke writes in \\"Union Organizing and Public Policy\\" (Upjohn Institute, Kalamazoo, 1985) that the legal system has attempted to restrain the hands of both unions and employers, seeking peaceful resolution of disputes by balancing the power of both parties and restricting activities disruptive to commerce and, hence, the public. This balanced legal framework, which served the country successfully for 30 years, was destroyed in eight by the Reagan Administration.    As Mr. Cooke states, current application and inadequate enforcement of the law have allowed the pendulum to swing out of balance.    He writes: \\"In 1981 there were nearly 10,000 charges against employers to bargain in good faith, a seven and a half fold increase since 1950. In 1981 over 25,000 workers received back pay because of employer discrimination, more than 11 times the 1950 figure of 2,250. For those unfair labor practice cases that need to be resolved at the National Labor Relations Board level, a median delay of 490 days was incurred in 1981.\\"    How is the failure of American labor law to serve the working people of this country related to the violence erupting in the streets of New York? Simply, the perceptions of the workers have changed. They have lost faith in the law, the collective bargaining system and, most important, in the fairness of the system.   As William H. Wynn, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers states in the Cooke volume: \\"The National Labor Relations Board was originally established to move labor management relations out of the 'law of the jungle.' The ideologues appointed by the Reagan Administration have accelerated a process that began years ago to gut the protections for workers contained in the labor laws of this country. As a result, labor management relations are back in the jungle.\\"   If this seems far-fetched, let us examine circumstances very similar to The Daily News strike that occurred almost 100 years ago in the steel mills of Homestead, Pa., where Henry Clay Frick had just become Andrew Carnegie's partner and general manager.    \\"During negotiations,\\" Thomas R. Brooks writes in \\"Toil and Trouble: A History of American Labor\\" (New York, 1972), \\"Frick had demanded the dissolution of the union. While negotiations were in progress Frick had a tall fence built around the mill and erected searchlight platforms in the mill yard -- hardly a peaceful gesture. Frick, as a Congressional investigation later found, was clearly eager for a showdown with the union. The workmen at Homestead hung Frick and a mill superintendent in effigy on company property, by then so fortified that local citizens dubbed the work 'Fort Frick.'    \\"A hose was turned on the men sent to cut the figures down. Frick thereupon used the incident to shut down the Homestead works, two days before the agreement expired on June 30. The infamous Homestead strike began as a lockout.    \\"Meanwhile Frick pushed through arrangements -- initiated before the lockout -- with the Pinkerton agency for 300 armed men. On the night of July 5, the Pinkertons arrived on the shores of the Monongahela River, met by the townspeople. . . . When the Pinkertons finally ran up the flag, three detectives and seven workers lay dead and scores were wounded.    \\"On July 12, Gov. Robert E. Pattison of Pennsylvania responded to company pressure and sent the state militia to take over the peaceful town. The company pressed legal action against the Homestead leaders. Although the men of Homestead were vindicated against counts of treason against the state of Pennsylvania, murder and riot in the courts, their cause was lost.\\"   As Daniel Bell writes in \\"Out of This Furnace\\" (Pittsburgh, 1976): \\" 'Do not think we will ever have any serious labor trouble again,' the triumphant Frick cabled to Carnegie in Italy. 'We had to teach our employees a lesson and we taught them one they will never forget.' Carnegie replied with a congratulatory message beginning, 'life is worth living again.' \\"   One hundred years later the same management attitudes and goals exist","excerpt":"more important, American society is making the same mistakes. Is it so beyond understanding and belief that the workers of this country have lost faith in the system?   Sadly the workers of this country can no longer rely on the N.L.R.B., the labor laws or a collective bargaining system that worked successfully for more than 50 years. Is this the example we want to set for changing Eastern Bloc nations or developing third world nations? Your editorial vision has become nearsighted. Violence is deplorable. But when a pattern and practice have been established for the last five years, let's step back and ask why. FRANK M. PERSICO JR.

It goes genre-hopping from hard-rock to funk to thrash to ska to progressive-rock, often with a different style in every verse of a song.

The impression is that the story, by Katherine Newlin Burt, from which the photoplay was derived was more subtly, and therefore more surely, done.Hugh Garth is a deformed, ugly tempered exile from civilization who has committed a murder in an unreasonable outbreak of anger and hidden himself with his younger brother and the latter's former nurse in the wilds of the Canadian Northwest. For fifteen years the three have lived alone; the young brother has grown into a prepossessing young man, straight in body and mind, and the former nurse has made herself the patient slave of the malformed older man, but he does not appreciate the finer qualities of either the woman or his brother, and bullies both of them, as though in doing so he found some relief from his constant fear of the police authorities.One day the older man finds a girl lost in the snow. She is a member of a traveling vaudeville company who had tried to walk from a broken-down sleigh to the nearest trading post and had been blinded by the glare from the whitened earth. Garth takes her to his cabin. The delicacy of her features and her comparative refinement of manner are something different in his rough life. He falls in love, and to establish himself exclusively in the girl's affections he tells her that Bella, the woman who loves him, is a dried-up old hag and that Pete, his brother, is a gawky, overgrown boy of 14. He also spins heroic yarns about himself, and the blinded girl believes him. Meanwhile the younger brother, naturally in love with the girl, and the patient woman remain doggedly loyal to the man and do not undeceive her. But suddenly her sight returns and she sees the truth.There's the situation. Of course, it results in a happy union of the girl and the younger brother, and, less persuasively, in the regeneration of the older man and his final appreciation of the devotion of the faithful Bella. The ending, however, is not as strong as it might have been, and, as said, the treatment of the story as a whole lacks the vivifying touch. However, some of the scenes are effective: there is some good frozen-north photography, and the acting for the most part is good. Russell Simpson, as Hugh Garth, brings his character to life a number of times; Pauline Stark, as the girl, is adequately appealing; Mary Alden, as Bella, does restrained and expressive work, and Cullen Landis as Pete looks his part. The picture was directed by Reginald Barker.Also on the Capitol program is an unusually interesting Prizma scenic of the settlement of the Mozabites in the Desert of the Sahara, entitled \\"The Sacred City of the Desert,\\" and a Mack Sennett comedy, \\"She Sighed by the Seaside,\\" with Ben Turpin and others.After more than a year's absence, Marguerite Clark returns to the screen this week in \\"Scrambled Wives,\\" at the Strand Theatres in Manhatan and Brooklyn. She has a flapper rôle in this adaptation of the play by Martha M. Stanley and Adelaide Matthews and has little to do beside being cute. She still has the knack for this, so the part gives her no difficulty.The comedy is bright in places, but not substantial enough to fill the five or six reels of film allowed it. Consequently, it is by no means constantly amusing. The story begins with the elopement of a school girl with a youth whom she scarcely knows. The father of the girl promptly has the marriage annulled and takes his daughter abroad. Two years later the girl, her momentary husband, his more permanent wife and the hero, whom the heroine hopes to marry forever and ever, meet, with an assortment of other stock individuals, at a house party—in a palatial residence near New York, of course. But credit must be given for originality. The palace is not on Long Island. It is on an island in Long Island Sound.The others in the cast haven't much more to do than Miss Clark, and don't do it quite so well, except Ralph Bunke, who, after several poor scenes at the beginning, has a number of moderately well-done comedy bits near the end.Edward H. Griffith directed the production and touched it up here and there cleverly, but apparently found the job of enlivening 5,000 or more feet of film beyond his human powers. If he had been allowed to make a two-reel comedy but of his material, the indications are that he would have turned out something delightful.\\"The Bakery,\\" with Larry Semon, is also at the Manhattan Strand.This is designated \\"Comedy Week\\" at the Rialto.

The hemline above the top of the knee -- and then some -- is the overwhelming choice.    A couple of trend-setting designers did show a very few longer skirts. But these were red herrings: The hems of everything else in their collections were way up there. Two who tossed in some longer skirts, Geoffrey Beene and Isaac Mizrahi, both referred to them simply as options for a modern woman. More to the point, several longtime designers of the most conservative styles, like Pauline Trigere and Gloria Sachs, have finally hiked their hemlines up above the knee. In doing so, they are reflecting the preference of many fashion-conscious women today.    These few new longer hemlines will undoubtedly be worn by those who like to experiment with the most forward of fashions.

This Sunday at 9 P.M., and continuing on Tuesday at 9, \\"J. F. K.: Reckless Youth\\" comes to television on ABC as a fairly standard four-hour movie. Commercial television once again runs true to form. The more inflammatory portions of the book are eliminated or muted, perhaps because the Kennedy family and their friends have publicly attacked the Hamilton book. What's left is another television portrait of John Kennedy that promotes style over substance, focusing on what ABC calls \\"intense passions and inspirational courage.\\" TV Weekend","excerpt":"More on John F.

Some of them have been revivals of mauve decades of misdeeds and others have had plots grimly looking to the twenty-first century.Villains have been hissed—hissed plenty—all up and down the country, pretty girls have been rescued vicariously from the jaws of death or What Is Worse than Death, and there have been instances too numerous to mention when three men and a boy with cap pistols have stood off whole armies of Orientals pending the arrival of the United States marines. The marines have been in step with Sousa.The latest addition to that growing collection of trapdoor postulates is \\"The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu,\\" which now shoots darkly from the screen of the Rialto Theatre. Its type and its theme may be seen from the fact that among its props are the before-mentioned doors, cut telephone wires, peepholes, Limehouse gambling dens, a castle overlooking the sea, poisoned darts and three Scotland Yard detectives. And, of course, Dr. Fu Manchu.This last character is well known. During the sixteen years of his career Fu has broken up the midnight rest of thousands. He has aided in keeping politicians fit for the battle of life and small boys at Choate in furtively passing away study periods designed for the assimilation of Hannibal's agra??? desires. Fu holds a place not far behind Sherlock Holmes.In translating \\"The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu\\" to the vocal screen Paramount has taken the story more or less in its entirety and has not lost sight of motivation in an effort to capture chance customers by the wistful Summer phrase of \\"Hear Them Talk!\\" The whole, with the usual qualifying comment, \\"if you like melodrama,\\" is very good. Saturday's children, struggling past the ushers and the green dragons lining the walls, liked both melodrama and Dr. Fu.The picture has that Broadway pair, sound and dialogue, and runs its bloodthirsty course over the Boxer Rebellion (shooting), a wind-swept, ghostly castle (wail of the wind) and the low-voiced mutterings of Limehouse (mutterings). The conversation is all in English, some of it flowery English, and the recording apparatus has done its work with a sense of the dramatic. Not, as in some dialogue pictures, a feeling for the melodramatic.Warner Oland, who started three decades ago as an opera singer and gradually shifted his art to the screen, is the Menace in the film, Fu Manchu, himself. He gives a good performance, whether peering intently from a peep-hole or pointing a gloating finger at the quicklime into which he plans presently to drop the nominal hero. His voice is low, clear and it carries a sufficiently sinister air as to be convincing.Jean Arthur has the rôle of Lia Eltham, the hypnotized ward of Fu Manchu and his weapon for exterminating his many enemies. The hero—although Fu is the chief character he is the villain—is played by Neil Hamilton. And then there is O. P. Heggie, late of the stage, who bounces into sundry rooms and various dark situations, his pistol in hand and his whole manner brightly saying, \\"Nayland Smith of Scotland Yard.\\"The story starts in Pcking, when Fu's wife is killed by soldiers putting down the rebellion. Fu starts out to murder all the officers who had a part in it. His m??? against the Petrie family take up the greater part of the film. Fu, after slaying two Petries, is captured and drinks poison.

Those responsible forgot the marines—and the American flag waving triumphantly at the end. Otherwise they have everything.\\"Hot News\\" is a good picture for the middle-aged sentimentalist whose recollections carry him back some dozen years, when as a young man he would sit in the movies and glory in the punch on the jaw vice took at the end of every picture. This work will make him think of the cat-calls he gave the villain, and the shrill cheers with which he greeted the muscular young hero when that worthy jumped in to save the girl.Miss Daniels carries on the doctrine that women are equal to men in all things—even to being newsreel photographers. Maybe they are, but if feminism rampant in any way resembles the activities of \\"Pat\\" Clancy, the world, as it is sometimes asserted, is not the same as it used to be.The picture deals with two newsreel companies, the Sun and the Mercury, the names giving Mr. George Marion Jr. (who probably saw the picture in its real light) a pardonable chance to shyly note as a title, \\"While the Mercury was going down the Sun was rising.\\" A man named \\"Scoop\\" Clancy, evidentally pretty good at his job, is shown leaving that job because he won't teach his boss's daughter the art of photography.The daughter, \\"Pat,\\" no less, then steps forward to show \\"Scoop\\" that he is only a man, while she is the incarnation of the feminist movement. That she does so is to be expected. The end comes after she has taken pictures of a Maharajah being beaten and robbed, is captured (along with \\"Scoop\\") by the robber and finally is saved by the wireless, the coast guard and a smoke screen.In fairness it must be said that there are one or two amusing situations, but they are in the earlier part of the picture and are apt to be overlooked in a composite recollection of the whole. One of them is when Michael Clancy, the father of \\"Pat,\\" has the run-in with \\"Scoop\\" which results in the latter's resignation. Alfred Allen takes the part of Michael.The picture will add nothing to Miss Daniels's reputation as a comedienne. She goes through the greater length of it on the very verge—and sometimes over—of being silly. Neil Hamilton, as \\"Scoop,\\" does not have as many foolish situations to get over, so he turns in a fair card.Paul Ash is still leading the orchestra in the stage performance, with Helen Swan, the Foster Girls, Pallo and Braille, Paul Small and Harry Savoy taking part at various times in the entertainment.

It deals primarily with animals and birds, rather than with the hardships of man in South Georgia. There is good photography and great pains obviously have been used in acquiring the best available snapshots of penguins and sea elephants.\\"The Bottom of the World\\" was produced by Dr. Ludwig Kohl-Larsen on an expedition sent by the American Museum of Natural History to look into the whale industry of the far South, as well as the Antarctic's bird and animal life.There are a few initial pictures of South Georgia, and then the photographers—and Dr. Murphy—start on the record of the birds. There are portraits of three types of penguins—Johnny, Macaroni and King—and each is carefully described as to habit and mode of life. After that are other birds, and a few sea leopards, and then certain of the ancient mariner's albatrosses.The cameras were then piled aboard a whaler and were taken out to sea. The photographs show the harpooning of a blue whale, and the somewhat gruesome history of what happened to it then. There is also an aside by Dr. Murphy to the effect that at the rate whales are being killed they will not last forever.Perhaps the best part of the film shows a fight between two sea elephants—either as large as the amiable Goliath which now tours the country under the aegis of John Ringling. They pound one another at first on the land, and then in the water. It was about a woman, of course, and the record doesn't show which of them won.Also on the Cameo's program is \\"The Son of the Sheik,\\" with the late Rudolph Valentino and Vilma Banky.

Yet such spoilage is all too common, not only with food served in restaurants, but also in retail groceries, health food stores, candy shops and bakeries, and even in samples offered at fancy food trade shows. One might conclude that there are, in fact, people who list ''rancid'' among their favorite flavors","excerpt":"more probably, many simply do not recognize it and assume that the flavor is typical of the food being eaten.   Rancidity is a form of spoilage that occurs in fats and oils and, therefore, in all foods that contain fats and oils: nuts and seeds and the oils derived from them, vegetable-based salad and cooking oils, margarine, butter and other animal fats and all grains but most especially wheat. Rancid foods are unpleasant and not healthful, not only because they sicken the stomach, but also because they destroy the body's own supply of vitamins B and E. Those are the very nutrients many rancid-susceptible foods such as wheat germ and wheat germ oil supply so generously when fresh.
