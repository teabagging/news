CHIEF APPEARS AT RALLY IN ULSTER"},{"year":"1994","title":"On the day seven years ago when Frank Durente circled over Manhattan Island for the first time, he looked down and genuinely believed that the buildings, the sidewalks, New York itself, was reaching up expressly for him. He saw himself living in one of the tiny buildings below, finding regular work and proudly sending some dollars home to his family in Guyana from the city he had conquered. \\"This is where I belong,\\" he wrote in his red pocket diary as he was about to touch down.   Now Mr. Durente sees New York from below ground, through the smashed window of a door jammed against garbage cans and thrown-away furniture. Time for him is a withering experience. He spends most of it in his 5-by-8-foot room, in the basement of an apartment house in Brooklyn that has five other spaces just like his, on a block where dozens of men and women and even children live in exactly the same way. Untold Fire and Health Hazards    They are part of a population of immigrants in New York who exist literally beneath the boards, invisible to the city that once beckoned them so promisingly. They carry on their lives in rooms -- really cubicles -- illegally carved out of the basements of private homes and apartment houses, presenting untold fire and health hazards and subtly altering the personality and quality of life in dozens of neighborhoods throughout the city.

This oral history follows a familiar format: numerous personal accounts arranged by topic, with short introductory sections by the author. Marilyn P. Davis, an independent scholar, draws on the experiences of a wide variety of Mexican immigrants (both legal and illegal), from field hands to professors, from those who stay only briefly in the United States to third-generation American citizens. Inevitably, the stories of immigrants who have adapted to life in    el norte    and have attained successful middle-class careers in this country are the least interesting and do not seem appreciably different from similar stories involving other immigrant groups. The portrayal of the broader Mexican experience, on the other hand, is fascinating. The economic motives for Mexican immigration to the United States are well known, but \\"Mexican Voices/American Dreams\\" shows that there are also deep cultural ramifications. For many Mexican children, stories about \\"over there\\" take on the aura of myth and exert a pull independent of economic necessity, so that immigration has become a rite of passage for Mexican youth. The separation of parents from children and husbands from wives -- often for years -- can devastate families, as some of Ms. Davis's most poignant pages show. An excellent chapter covers what is in effect an underground railroad for crossing into the United States","excerpt":"illegal immigration has become a major service industry along parts of the border. The book's major disappointment is that it lacks the lyric quality that characterizes the best oral histories. Nevertheless, \\"Mexican Voices/American Dreams\\" provides a welcome contrast to the depersonalization characteristic of some treatments of Mexican immigration, which all too often is considered only from the viewpoint of the American border patrol.

To Ms. Lui, the 45-minute ride in the back of a van packed with fellow Chinese-speaking New Yorkers is far more comfortable than a longer trek on the N or R subway lines -- known among some Brooklynites as the Never and the Rarely. \\"The subway is dirty  and dangerous,\\" she said, shaking her head. \\"If we can choose, we prefer the van.\\"    NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SUNSET PARK","excerpt":"Illegal Van Express Overtakes Slow Trains to Chinatown"},{"year":"1951","title":"Appeals Ct hearing on W K Macy appeal from lower ct refusal to enjoin certification of E Greenwood election as Repr","excerpt":"illegal voting charges revd; Greenwood atty and others hold ct without jurisdiction; urge Cong action; Greenwood unable to take seat MACY HOUSE FIGHT REMAINS IN COURT; Appeals Bench Defers Ruling --Delay Prevents Seating of Greenwood Today"},{"year":"1999","title":"Jaywalkers, declared endangerd species in Jan 1998 as part of Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani's quality of life campaign, seem to be thriving in midtown Manhattan","excerpt":"illegal walkers say they have seen no change in behavior by pedestrians or police in 15 months since Giuliani hiked fines for jaywalking tickets from $2 to $50 and suggested that police officers starting writing them; Transportation Alternatives exec dir John Kaehny says it was much more 'rhetorical crackdown' than actual crackdown; Police Dept issued 99 jaywalking tickets last year; photo (M) Cross at Green?
