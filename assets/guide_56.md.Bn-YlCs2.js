There were garish color photographs that bordered on the pornographic, as well as nearly abstract images of chairs, candlesticks and other domestic objects. Even in his treatment of the human body, his most enduring subject, he ranged from savagely explicit to purely symbolic.   The portfolio \\"101 Nudes,\\" made when he was 20 years old, helps explain much of what Mr. DeSana was about. Consisting of mediocre half-tone reproductions of inexpert black-and-white prints, the series, on view at Simon Watson, makes clear the extent to which he rebelled against normal photographic standards. He also rebelled against photography's most artistic pretensions, picturing his nudes not as Venus or Adonis, but as overweight next-door neighbors and slightly awkward friends.   One result of this anti-art strategy is that the pictures are almost embarrassingly intimate, as if they were leftovers from a suburban pornographer's first session. There are women with telephones and behind window curtains, and men perched on sofas and pianos. The poses are enough to make one laugh. The lighting is usually direct flash, which often turns the foreground figure into a ghostly, abstract patch of white.   The subversive, self-deprecating quality of this work is typical of all of Mr. DeSana's photographs, and one suspects he would have become better known if his subject matter had not been so incendiary. But \\"101 Nudes\\" is charming precisely because of its lack of pretension and offhandedness","excerpt":"later in his career, the artist often tried too hard not to please.   The photographs are also interesting as an effort to strip the nude of its inflated idealism, perhaps even to change the terms of figure photography from nudity to nakedness. In this respect, Mr. DeSana's nudes bear comparison to those Lee Friedlander has been taking for 20 years.   The show \\"101 Nudes\\" remains at Simon Watson, 241 Lafayette Street in Manhattan, through tomorrow. Hours: today and tomorrow, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission is free. Information: (212) 925-1955.

Ms. Ronell is the author of, among other titles, ''The Telephone Book: Technology, Schizophrenia, Electric Speech,'' which is sort of how a serious academic volume would read -- and look -- after a few spins through a blender.

NEW ON CD  The multi-instrumentalist Andrew Bird releases ''The Mysterious Production of Eggs'' (Righteous Babe, $15) today. It's got some of Arcade Fire's orchestral-rock charm, but without the big production and the angst -- and a lot more whistling and songs about science. Meanwhile, the Relativez, former Southern California gangbangers, take rap's conspicuous consumption to a new level with their third album, ''Money Respect Money'' (Ball'r/BMG, $17.98).    THEATER ON TRIAL  In the world of publicity stunts, few are either as shameless or as genuinely fascinating as the new scheme from the producers of ''Twelve Angry Men.'' Every Tuesday this month, there will be a post-performance panel discussion of legal experts, including, each week, at least one juror from a recent high-profile trial. On the bill tonight: an unnamed juror from the trial of L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former Tyco chief executive. And next Tuesday, another Tyco juror will appear plus two Martha Stewart jurors will spill the (hand-selected and painstakingly prepared) beans.

The DVD of Spike Lee's 1992 film ''Malcolm X'' (Warner Home Video, $26.99) gets re-released, with a making-of video, 10 additional scenes and even a 90-minute film about Malcolm X, directed by Arnold Perl, which was nominated for the Academy Award for best documentary in 1972. In much-missed comedy television, both ''Murphy Brown'' and ''Night Court'' (Warner Home Video, $29.98 each) see the DVD release of the shows' first seasons. ''Bright Young Things'' (New Line, $27.95), the actor-turned-director Stephen Fry's (almost) perfectly faithful adaptation of the vicious Waugh novel ''Vile Bodies,'' is released with commentary by Mr. Fry.    LIVE FROM TIBET  The 15th annual Tibet House benefit takes place at Carnegie Hall with Lou Reed, Philip Glass, Patti Smith and Ray Davies, and it will be presided over by -- well, not by the eminent Buddhist scholar, Robert Thurman, but by his daughter, some actress named Uma.

Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street; 8:30 p.m.; $20 to $40.

THURSDAY 2|10    YOUNG PIANISTS IN ACTION  The Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, for 30 pianists under 30, begins in Fort Worth in May. But 46 of the audition recitals take place in New York, and they afford a rare chance to see that much collected talent that early in its career.

(No afternoon session on Friday.)    MUSICAL VIOLENCE  The Trophy Wives, a band that plays Eastern-European-inflected rock, have altered the video game ''Mortal Kombat'' so they can play it using their keyboards instead of the standard controls. The result, a thrilling cacophony, serves as a soundtrack while the musician's on-screen avatars kick each other in the head. Also on the bill: the dance-friendly world music groups Wonderland Afrobeat Orchestra and Asiko.  Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side; 8 p.m.; $12.    ON WAGNER  The 1912 film ''The Life of Richard Wagner'' has been digitally remastered by the scholar Paul Fryer, who will be on hand today to discuss it. It's also been given a new score, by the composer Barry Seaman, which follows the progression of Wagner's own style.  Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street; 7:30 p.m.; $10.    THE MAZES OF CHAMBER OPERA  Usually, when a composer's been around as long as Handel, his premieres are all long behind him. But according to the Gotham Chamber Opera -- formerly known as the Henry Street Chamber Opera -- tonight's performance of Handel's 1733 opera ''Arianna in Creta'' is a premiere of the original score (minus the composer's later revisions and embellishments). This is the first of the company's productions of operas that treat the Ariadne myth: expect many minotaurs to be slain.  Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side; 7 p.m.; $30 to $60. (Through Feb. 18.)    FRIDAY 2|11    SIGNING IN MOVEMENT  The choreographer Ronald K.

THE TREND DANCE  Early in Mike Albo's new one-man performance, ''My Price Point,'' he breaks into a frantic dance about the speed of cultural consumption -- in about three minutes, he takes us from Tae Bo and pilates to yellow ribbons, rainbow flags and Lance Armstrong bracelets to pashminas, trucker hats and adopted babies. Mr. Albo, a veteran monologist, wrote the show with his frequent collaborator (and Times television critic) Virginia Heffernan.  P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village; 8 p.m.; $15. (Through next Sunday.)    NEW FILMS: G AND NOT G  ''Inside 'Deep Throat''' is not a Watergate movie; it's an NC-17 documentary about the cultural impact of the infamous 1972 porn film, featuring interviews with Helen Gurley Brown, Hugh Hefner and others. (A behind-the-scenes blog by the film's co-producers can be found at www.worldofwonder.net/insidedeepthroat.) It opens today in nine cities in the United States. For an entirely different audience: ''Pooh's Heffalump Movie,'' a new Disney film at megaplexes near you, is rated G, and Carly Simon contributes new songs to the soundtrack.    SATURDAY 2|12    SHAKESPEARE AT WAR  Previews begin tonight for a new production of ''Coriolanus,'' directed by Karin Coonrod, whose ''Julius Caesar,'' also for Theater for a New Audience, cleverly positioned the play as an early precursor to the contemporary genre of the thriller.  John Jay College, 899 10th Avenue, at 59th Streets; 7:30 p.m.; $60. (Through March 6.)    ORGANS AND MACHINES  A major midcareer retrospective of Tim Hawkinson, who goes to great technological lengths for a joke or impressive effect, opens this weekend. His machines and robots, including a very handy one that endlessly signs his name on a long feed of paper, will be on the fourth floor. But his ''Überorgan,'' a musical instrument that functions like the world's biggest lung, is too large for the Whitney's galleries, and will be doing its inhaling and moaning at a nearby sculpture garden. It is not to be missed.     Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street; 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; $12, $9.50, students and 62+. (Through May 29.)

Feldman, the film's producer, says he thought of Mr. Cooper's performance in ''Friendly Persuasion'' when it came to casting the leading role of John Book, the Philadelphia policeman who goes into hiding with an Amish family. ''I thought of Gary Cooper wearing that Quaker outfit,'' Mr. Feldman recalled, ''and I asked myself, 'Who today is a reactive kind of actor who would also look funny in an outfit like that?' '' Harrison Ford came to mind, and the movie was on its way.   When Mr. Feldman first came across a draft of the screenplay, by Earl W. Wallace and William Kelley, it was much longer, with sections taking almost a documentarylike approach to the Amish and their customs. ''There was nothing wrong with the writing, but it really needed editing,'' Mr. Feldman recalled. It needed enough to make 20th Century- Fox pass up the screenplay twice","excerpt":"later on, when Mr. Feldman optioned it himself and took the idea to other studios, some had reservations about whether Mr. Ford could carry the whole film.

It was 1956, the year of her first marriage and two years before her first solo show in San Francisco. So when she hit Manhattan in 1960 with the first of several shows at Staempfli Gallery, the artist, then 22 years old, was still something of a prodigy. The canvases from this phase are loaded with pigment, much of it red","excerpt":"later on, when Ms. Brown switched to enamel, the turbulence subsided but the ingenuousness remained for the rest of her life, which ended in an accident in 1990.    To judge from the 1970's works on view in the Joseloff Gallery at the University of Hartford, the artist was selectively naive, producing an improbable painting of revelers one moment and sophisticated drawings of nudes the next. A clue to her outlook may be found in six self-portraits in which the headgear changes while the face, with its large pale green eyes, remains consistently bland.

In CLAUDE MONET: Life and Art (Yale University, $40), the distinguished Monet scholar Paul Hayes Tucker undertakes a critical examination of the work and reputation of the master of Giverny. Combining an analysis of the social context in which Monet worked with close examinations of the paintings, Mr. Tucker, an art professor at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, challenges the longstanding formalist interpretation of Monet's work. Examining Monet's landscapes in the context of shifting social, economic and political circumstances, and of the artist's own position as a successful and highly ambitious member of the new suburban bourgeoisie, Mr. Tucker sees Monet's work as intimately connected to the process of industrialization. He notes, for example, that Monet's early paintings of the Parisian suburb of Argenteuil, where he and his family moved in 1872, register confidence in the promise of industrialization","excerpt":"later pictures show the erosion  of the landscape and the degradation of rural life brought about by overdevelopment. Monet's ultimate retreat into the garden world he constructed at Giverny, following his stunning success as his generation's pre-eminent painter of French subjects, was at least in part, Mr. Tucker argues, a response  to a political event, the Dreyfus affair. Monet's involvement, Mr. Tucker suggests, ultimately prompted him to withdraw into a secluded garden of his own  making, and in contemplation of this orderly world to paint the monumental pictures that are undoubtedly his best-known works today.

Yet, as the author's intelligent introductory essay to the 150 elegant duotone photographs reproduced in TINA MODOTTI: Photographs (Philadelphia Museum of Art/Abrams, $45) soon makes clear, Ms. Lowe means what she says. She has done extensive research about the political, social and cultural contexts of Modotti's many whereabouts. Tina  Modotti was an uneducated working-class girl in turn-of-the-century Italy and a  sophisticated actress, muse and femme fatale in Hollywood before spending the years from 1923 to 1930 in Mexico, where she became an increasingly political photographer","excerpt":"later, among other activities, she was a relief worker in the Spanish Civil War. Ms. Lowe, an art historian and curator, puts the facts of Modotti's life in illuminating perspective, tracing the artist's esthetic development, her ties to the Modernist movement and her awareness of the conflict between making art and making politics. If \\"Experiment in Related Form\\" (1924) -- a double exposure of five glasses of differing sizes whose rims seem to float, intersect and shine all at once -- means freedom from the austere esthetic of Edward Weston, Modotti's lover and teacher of photography, the sea of sombreros in \\"Workers Parade\\" (1926) marks Modotti's first expression of her  disappointment with the unfulfilled promises of the Mexican revolution and her commitment to a new social order. From portraits of Aztec mothers with their infants to \\"Mella's Typewriter\\" (a close-up of a Communist lover's instrument of intellectual and political activity), Modotti's tight cropping and still-life esthetic excelled at melding Mexican culture and Modernist photography.

Of all the genres least in need of invention, moralizing pornography is high on the list. Nevertheless, French readers were entranced by ''Lila Says,'' purporting to be a narrative by the pseudonymous Chimo, who is supposed to have scrawled it in ballpoint pen in two notebooks and sent it to publishers through an attorney. Set in one of Paris's grim urban housing projects, this slender book is about how Chimo, a disadvantaged 19-year-old Arab boy, becomes erotically transfixed by Lila, a blond, 16-year-old Roman Catholic vixen. Lila begins telling Chimo about her various sexual fantasies","excerpt":"later, on a moving bicycle, she performs acts on the lucky Arab lad that would be difficult for even the most gifted circus performer. This amatory improbability, and the fact that impoverished young men don't often have attorneys, are clues that ''Lila Says'' is not an authentic diamond in the rough but a calculatingly polished literary conceit. Another is Chimo's penchant -- in between sessions of writing his book at an abandoned construction site by candlelight -- for ruminating on the oppression of the underclass, a theme that seems to turn him on much more than his acrobatic pal does. Once Lila claims to have had sex with the Devil, things pretty much go downhill for her in the religiously volatile projects. Because this tale atranslated from the French, fittingly enough, by a man or woman who wishes to remain anonymous -- aspires to be art rather than pornography, it ends in a dismally predictable act of violence. Lila, it turns out, doesn't have any say at all.

He even reproaches her for the kind of bread she buys. He's furious when she leaves the house for work, and the children tend to build dangerous little fires in her absence. There's no apparent friendliness in this marriage—the man and woman seem to share only a nose-wrinkling disgust. As a chemist who prefers research to wageearning, he lets her support him by performing abortions—which he deplores.From the content, you might think that Alexander Kluge's \\"Part-Time Work of a Domestic Slave\\"—which played Tuesday and last night at the New York Film Festival—is sympathetic to women's issues. And I suspect that the director may fancy himself a male feminist. However, \\"Slave\\" manages to be reactionary in several ways—partly because you can't possibly like either of these one-note characters: the wife (Alexandra Kluge, the director's sister) is presented as a dreary clod, and the husband (Franz Bronski) is just a grouch. The shallowness of the characterization, combined with the pretentious bleakness that runs throughout, results in a paralyzing pessimism that makes the lives depicted seem contemptible.There's an exceptionally grim abortion that should please the Friends of the Foetus — especially since this foetus quivers after it's removed. (Program notes state that the operation was simulated.) The patient appears to be dressed for a festive occasion (indeed, who would wear an off-the-shoulder blouse to her abortion?). It's hard to know what this scene is supposed to prove—unless it's a device to establish the director's toughness.The husband reluctantly takes a job, and the wife becomes a political activist. Most of the time, she's hopelessly inefficient, naive, and ineffective. Her social concerns are made to appear faddish, until she manages to rally the workers at her husband's firm against the management. Hence her husband—who doesn't like her politics—is fired. The conclusion implies that the effort for change is useless. All in all, the movie would be depressing if it weren't so dull.Also on the program is a marvelous adaptation of Henry James's \\"The Bench of Desolation,\\" directed by Claude Chabrol for television. A fastidious man is faced with a breach of promise suit by a woman who eventually makes him pay a sum that plummets him into a lifetime of debt and destroys his marriage.Years later, the woman reappears and offers to repay him—with interest. Her love and her revenge took the same form: of making money for him (and out of him), and of creating his need for her. She has blighted his life so that she may later have the chance to comfort him—that is, if he no longer loathes her.The James tale respects the pain of both characters—the rejected woman and the crippled man—while stressing her appalling ruthlessness and condemning the aptitude for suffering plus the dread of vulgarity that made him unable to defy her. (She's also the kind of controlling, semi-maternal figure that frightened James himself.)The movie is faithful to the original, and it's admirably performed. Catherine Samie achieves an extraordinary shift of character: early on, she's formidable, threatening in her upright posture","excerpt":"later, she's extremely touching, also acrid and sensitive by turns. Meanwhile, the contrast between Michel Duchaussoy's cautious glares and his moments of raw suffering fully express his sense of a wasted life. These people even have the pallor that James described, and the film is merely a small triumph for Mr. Chabrol.

That notion is beautifully illustrated in Max Ophuls's adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's \\"Liebelei,\\" which was shown at the 12th New York Film Festival last Friday. As elsewhere, Schnitzler also stressed the importance of living in the present, of savoring what may be suddenly snuffed out.The movie, made in 1932 and set in Vienna, 1910, focuses on a touching love affair between a shy singer (Magda Schneider) and a vulnerable young officer (Wolfgang Liebeneiner) whose feelings surface most sensitively, despite all his strict military training. Before they met, he was involved with a married baroness. He breaks with his mistress—but although the liaison is over, her husband kills him in a duel. Evidently, being punished for the wrong thing—or paying for a chapter of life that's past—were recurrent themes of Schnitzler's. And meeting the right person after you've spent too long with the wrong one was the kind of irony that the playwright was fond of exploring.\\"Liebelei\\" embodies what Edmund Wilson defined as Schnitzler's gift for \\"lightly handled tragedy,\\" and Ophuls's own lightness of style is as beguiling here as it later was in Schnitzler's \\"La Ronde.\\" Amid the waltzes, the cafes, the elaborate staircases and winding back streets, the moments of emotional consequence are marvelously detailed. When the Baron (Gustaf Gruendgens) learns of his wife's adultery, he runs through his own palatial home and glares at the rooms where the couple met in a manner that's truly frightening","excerpt":"later, when he discovers that one of her keys fits her lover's door, he grinds it to and fro in the lock with outraged bitterness.Ophuls was at his best when he caused climates of feeling to build or change. As the singer and the officer begin to fall in love, their mutual absorption is subtly conveyed as they dance very slowly to rapid, noisy music—they don't know that they're not with the rhythm. This scene is cleverly contrasted by the next one, in which the officer dances correctly but unenthusiastically with the woman whom he no longer wants. When the hero—celebrating his freedom from the Baroness—romps and fools about with his friends before a party, he and they seem particularly childlike and innocent; hence they (and we) are utterly unprepared for the Baron's sudden, threatening entrance.The movie makes the code of \\"honor\\" appear very stupid — and when another youthful officer protests that any shot that isn't fired in self-defense is \\"criminal,\\" his rebellion against the military is a denunciation of all senseless duels. All in all, it's a privilege to see a movie that is romantic without being sentimental. Since that distinction is rarely respected now, it's exhilarating to learn what Ophuls achieved more than 40 years ago.

This week brings two television specials celebrating the holiday, both of them geared to young audiences.

As usual, Ms. Lewis goes straight for the hearts of tots and toddlers. She is determinedly nonthreatening, Unfortunately, in this ill-conceived exercise, she  is also exasperating. With herself as executive producer, the program, earnestly pedantic, goes on far too long -- a full hour -- to keep her target audience's attention. And the entire premise is overly cute.

For reasons that remain a mystery, that connection was never made in my family and I believe I was about 30 years old when I first heard that the two were linked.
