A substantial tax shelter investor who cannot prove that he reasonably believed that his tax return was ''more likely than not'' correct now risks a penalty of 10 percent of any tax understatement, on top of the deficiency and interest at market or above-market rates.

Timed to coincide with the Miami drug trial of the former Panamanian strongman, the program goes back to the years when, as the evening's reporter, John Camp, recalls, General Noriega was considered \\"Washington's man in Panama.\\" He was courted by American intelligence services despite suspicions that he was chronically corrupt.
