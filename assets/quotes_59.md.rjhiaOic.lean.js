It is not a simple realization or even a close adaptation of the work of the great writer, and some critics have, with an appearance of justice, questioned the right of the author of the film to appropriate, though indirectly, the prestige of Zola's name. M. Marcel L'Herbier has taken from the novel the general idea of the worship of Mammon and the tragic play of one man's speculations on the lives and fortunes of others. His portrait of the financier Saccard has some spiritual resemblance to the Saccard of the novel, in the sense that both are adventurers of the Bourse, and other characters, like the rival financier Gunderman and Baroness Sandorf, the woman gambler, bear the names conferred on them by Zola. But the plot is essentially M. L'Herbier's, and he has added two entirely new persons, the aviator Hamelin and his wife Line, who play parts of first-rate importance. In harmony with this general conception, the whole surroundings of the story have been modernized, and one of the most important episodes in the piece is a transatlantic flight, which Zola would have considered better placed in a romance of his contemporary, Jules Verne, than in one of his own.Curious Camera Angles.Leaving aside the pretty quarrel about the respective rights of deceased authors and very live film producers, it is best to take M. L'Herbier's work on its merits. He has made a powerful film. The action has the proper volcanic energy. The recurrent pictures of the Bourse, taken from all sorts of curious angles—they are photographs of the real Paris Bourse—are cleverly employed to reiterate the main idea of the tyranny of money. There is a striking night view of the Place de l'Opéra crowded with the promenaders of the Fourteenth of July. In the tensely dramatic scenes, several of which are powerfully conceived, the acting, especially that of Alcover and Brigitte Helm, is arresting. The story itself serves M. L'Herbier's purpose well. At the beginning Saccard's Universal Bank is in difficulties. Chance throws him in the way of Hamelin, who has an airplane invention and an option on oil fields in Guiana. Seizing the opportunity, Saccard founds a subsidiary company to exploit the invention and the option, persuades the modest and unwilling Hamelin to be vice president, and, as a supreme piece of publicity, organizes a transatlantic flight to be made by his new associate. The public subscribes capital with enthusiasm and Saccard floats on a wave of prosperity. His position is not so sound as he thinks, however, for his rival, Gunderman, has bought up considerable parcels of the new shares on several foreign markets for hostile action when the time comes. Gunderman has, moreover, a serviceable ally in the intriguing Baroness Sandorf, who had been Saccard's mistress and still has an attraction for him. The transatlantic flight succeeds, but a false report that it has failed gains currency. Regardless of the torture which he is inflicting on Line Hamelin, the airman's wife, Saccard allows the false report to go uncontradicted in order to achieve a financial coup by the rise and fall of the shares.Strong Scenes.With Hamelin absent in South America, Saccard pursues Line with his unwelcome attentions. He encourages her to draw cheques on the Universal Bank. When she repulses him he brutally tells her that she has been committing a legal offense, because there was no money in the bank to meet her cheques and he had paid them out of his own pocket. Furious at this deception. Line unsuccessfully attempts to shoot the banker at a magnificent reception which he gave in his house, and afterward flings on the market all the shares in the Universal Bank that are in her possession. Gunderman, on the look-out, supports this action by selling his shares on foreign markets. Under the succession of blows the Universal Bank crashes. The ruined Saccard is sentenced for fraud. With the help of Gunderman the innocence of the Hamelins is proved, and the reunited couple are left to enjoy a calmer life after their adventure in the cruel and delirious world of money.Alcover, who has a massive presence, succeeds very well in giving an impression of the brutal energy of Saccard, though there are occasional lapses. He is, perhaps, at his best in a striking scene in which Baroness Sandorf (Brigitte Helm) wheedles a secret out of him. In this episode, and throughout the film, Brigitte Helm's rare temperamental quality gives a strange, feline charm to the character she portrays, which would suffice of itself to confer distinction on the film. Mary Glory is effective in the long scene in which she bids farewell to Hamelin, with the waiting airplane droning outside. Alfred Abel plays excellently the patient and sure Gunderman. Yvette Guilbert makes a picturesque appearance as a woman dealer in shares.Carcassonne Again.Last year's fêtes celebrating the splendid antiquity of Carcassonne gave a remarkable advance publicity to \\"Le Tourmoi,\\" the film of historical romance for which the wonderful old fortress city was chosen as the setting. Those who ??? the site will, perhaps, have a feeling that the film, picturesque and moving as it is, does not use on a sufficiently grand scale the decorative quality of this natural piece of stage scenery. The tournament itself, with its parade of chivalry, its duel between Francois de Baynes and Henri de Rogier, with the historic walls and towers as a background, is a stirring scene, but the best effects in the film are undoubtedly obtained in the many excellent pictures of interiors. Some of the rich dresses, too, are exquisite. The story has the quality of a romance of chivalry, Catherine de Médici, the Queen-mother in the reign of the young Charles IX, in pursuit of her policy of appeasing the quarrels between Protestants and Catholics, brings about betrothal of Francois de Baynes, a Huguenot leader, and her own cousin, Isabella Ginori. Isabelle submits unwillingly, for she was already promised to the Catholic Henri de Rogier. The resulting feud between the two men is the theme of the film.Refined Villainy.The turbulent de Baynes, the villain of the piece, a Don Juan who, nevertheless, has something of the Gascon quality of Cyrano de Bergerac, is an admirable film character. He slays in a duel, and with a refinement of cruelty, the brother of Isabelle. In spite of that, he pursues the project of the marriage and after one unpremeditated encounter with Henri de Rogier he agrees, with the permission of the Queen-mother, to a more formal meeting at the tournament to be held in honor of the King. This \\"judgment of God\\" is to decide which of the two men shall marry Isabelle. The fierce duel is interrupted by the arrival of the guard, with orders to arrest Francois de Baynes, whose killing of the brother of Isabelle has just been discovered. De Baynes, true to his reputation, resists arrest and dies in a desperate fight against twenty men-at-arms. De Rogier thus reaches the goal of his hopes by an unexpected stroke of fate. The grand requirement of the film was an artist of overwhelming brio in the part of François de Baynes. Aldo Nadi, the famous fencer, whose playing in this exacting rôle is stated to be his first introduction to film acting, is admirably athletic in the fighting, but one could have wished for a richer character drawing. The delicate beauty of Jacky Monnier makes Isabelle a charming portrait. Blanche Bernis as Catherine de Mèdici acts with subtlety, and it was agreeable to see that fine actress Suzanne Després in the pathetic part of the mother of de Baynes.\\"La Marche Nuptiale.\\"Another play of the late Henry Bataille has been made into a film. \\"La Marche Nuptiale\\" has, of course, the usual qualities of the author's work—a clear theme and clear, direct action. M. André Hugon has performed competently the task of making a pictorial version of it. It is hardly necessary to tell the story at length. Grace de Plassans, the heroine, is a girl banished from the house of her parents because she has fallen in love with Claude Morillot, a teacher of the piano who had been giving her lessons. The two lovers go to Paris, where Claude obtains work in the office of Lechâtelier, a manufacturer, whose wife was an old school friend of Grace. Claude, unable to live without a piano and not rich enough to buy one, steals from his employer. While this complication is still unsolved, Lechâtelier, who has already tried to make Grace his mistress, becomes more pressing in his attentions. The young woman really loves Claude, but with a purely sentimental affection, and now, to her horror, she finds that she is being drawn to Lechâtelier by physical attraction. The conflict between sentiment and physical desire leads to the crisis. In the end, rather than be unfaithful to the purer feeling, Grace kills herself. M. Pierre Blanchar plays the rather thankless rôle of Claude skillfully and Louise Lagrange, as Grace, confirms the position she has won among the artists of the French cinema.

It is a narrative quite well-suited to France inasmuch as the action takes place on the Riviera and in Paris. In its new guise it is still an intriguing production and it proves that the only way to make a foreign language picture is to have a native cast or those who are as familiar with the language as Mr. Menjou is with French.It is, of course, rather amusing to perceive a Frenchman impersonating a nouvenu riche from Chicago and to observe the gestures of his wife. But as good as Miss Colbert and the others are in their rôles, it is Mr. Menjou who shines in this production. He is just as competent in this picture as he has been in his American silent films. It is his third talking picture. His first audible venture was \\"Fashions in Love,\\" and his second was one produced in Paris and called \\"Mon Gosse de Pere.\\" This current offering was made in Hollywood and the director had the distinct advantage of having witnessed the production in American form.It is the story of two polished crooks, Mr. Parkes and an American girl posing as the widow of an Austrian count, who are eager to steal a valuable pearl necklace owned by Mrs. Sylvester Corbett. Until the last episode the Countess imagines that the enigmatic Mr. Parkes is a detective, but he eventually explains that he does his best to keep at a safe distance from the police. The Countess hopes that the purloining of the Corbett jewels will be her last crime, for she is weary of working for a Russian crook who is known as Malatroff. As Malatroff makes his world's exit in a struggle with Parkes, the author has little difficulty in bringing the Countess and Parkes together and furnishing an ending in which it is to be presumed that Parkes has enough money to warrant his staying away from nefarious activities after stealing the Countess's heart. And the Countess, satisfied that Parkes is not a sleuth, harkens to his soft words of admiration and affection. The Cote d'Azur police help along the triumphal state of affairs by congratulating both Parkes and the Countess on the death of the notorious Malatroff.On the same program is a French short film, produced by Robert T. Kane in Paris. It is the best of its kind, very amusing and well acted. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"M. Menjou et Mlle.

One misses fire almost completely. The other could hardly be more effective.Watching the obviously faithful reprise of Rachmaninoff's one-act opera, \\"Aleko,\\" the Western spectator can easily understand why the work remains less than hallowed over there and here. Handsomely tinted in Sovcolor by Lenfilm Productions, and superbly sung throughout, it emerges as a static, old-fashioned opera—and film—rigidly checked by footlight staging, under Sergei Sidelov, director. It also is long on recitative, short on melody.Lenfilm cameras have shown a surprising lack of nimbleness, considering the opera's brevity and its passionate text, which traces a tragic romantic triangle in the steppes. But the pulsations remain strictly vocal, as A. Ognivisev, in the title role","excerpt":"M. Reizen, I. Zubkovskayu, S. Kuznetsov and the chorus ponderously throng a one-set background spiked with some realistic countryside glimpses. And they all sing wonderfully.Still, the sound-track of this stilted curio should intrigue Rachmaninoff devotees as an index of the composer's simmering talent at 24. The Rimsky-Korsakov overtones are obvious, but the orchestral colorations and many interludes are strikingly his own. Take the marvelous title aria, one tender lakeside duet of the young lovers and the opening lament by M. Reizen, by far the most distinguished voice. It all sounds wonderful, and, unfortunately, looks long and dull.\\"Chekhov,\\" made by the Moscow Documentary Studios under A. Leoniv's splendid direction, should satisfy anybody, even Mickey Spillane die-hards. Using photographs, prints and a superlative roving cameraman, the producers have assembled a graphic, intimate tribute, marred slightly by a few clanging thrusts at bureaucracy in an otherwise excellent English narration. Chekhov would never have been so obvious.He also comes vividly to life in the picture, which spans his youth and final retirement in the minutely-scrutinized Yalta mansion that all but steals the show. Almost as intriguing are the vintage glimpses of the Moscow Art Players performing Chekhov's first stage experiments, the endless succession of faded manuscripts and playbills. A personal reminiscence by his actress-widow of the opening night of \\"The Three Sisters\\" is alone worth the admission price.

He was born February 5, 1915 in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Harold A. and Mary (Pugh) Strickland","excerpt":"m. Ruth Voigt, May 29, 1940 (dec. 1982); m. Anne Muir King, May 18, 1985 (dec. 1992); m. Betty Spangler Levenson, January 4, 1994. He was awarded a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering by the University of Michigan in 1937 and an M.B.A. from Harvard in 1938. He was an executive engineer at Budd Wheel Company, 1938-1950, where he helped design the first automotive disc brakes and the first anti-lock brake skid control systems. More than 70 patents were granted in his name. From 1950-1964 he served at General Electric as Vice President and General Manager of Industrial Electronics. At GE, the businesses for which he was responsible created the first solid state electronic computer, the first automated bank check processing system-including magnetic character imprinting and high speed reading and sorting, and the first heart pacemakers. The mass flowmeter was invented for highperformance aircraft, managing fuel consumption on the supersonic Concorde where more than half the fuel is consumed on takeoff. In addition, computer-controlled electric generator stations were produced as well as numerical control systems for machine control and computer-aided design. From 1964-1980 he was President of General Signal Corporation. Under his tenure it grew from an annual volume of $35 million in sales to over $1.6 billion and achieved a position in sales and profitability among the upper half of Fortune 500 companies. He served on the boards of General Signal, Cross & Trecker, Prime Computer, Machinery & Allied Products Institute, and in Vero Beach, the Atlantic Classical Orchestra and the Center for the Arts. Club memberships included the Moorings Club, Vero Beach, and the University Club, New York City. Among his hobbies were music, travel, photography, boating, working in wood, metals, and electronics, and collecting paintings and antiquities. He was also interested in the genealogy of his family, which on his mother's side included Major Moses Van Campen, a Revolutionary War hero, and the Crandall family, who maintained a station on the Underground Railroad. He is survived by his sister, Elizabeth Forrester; his wife, Betty; three children-Stephanie Strickland, Leslie Strickland, Harold Strickland III; four grandchildren-Robin Pfaff, Alexander Pfaff, Douglas Pfaff, Samuel Strickland; and four stepchildren-Suzanne King, Melissa Klingenberg, Ann Roan, and Tom Levenson. The family will receive friends at home, 172 Springline Drive, Vero Beach, Florida, on Friday, September 5, 1997 from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M. Services will be held in the chapel at the Second Congregational Church, 139 East Putnam Avenue, in Greenwich, Connecticut on Sunday, September 7 at 4 P.M.

And, though world championships may someday be savored by Murphy, Sandberg and Rice (who was m.v.p. in 1978 but was injured when Boston went to the Series in 1975), not one of them will get his chance this fall. But that still leaves the Yankees' Baylor, California's Carew and Toronto's Burroughs, each an aging veteran with an American League contender. SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS","excerpt":"M.V.P.

Interment: Arlington National Cemetery. Memorials: Gifts in his honor may be made to The National Space Society, 1620 I Street NW, Suite 615, Washington, DC 20006. Glen P. Wilson was born in Waco, Texas, on December 10, 1922. He lived in Houston until moving to Austin to complete his education at the University of Texas with three degrees: a B.S. in Aeronautical Engineering, 1943","excerpt":"MA, 1948 and Ph.D. in Psychology, 1952. He served honorably in the US Navy during World War II. In 1955, he came from Austin, where he had done research and taught at the University of Texas, to work as assistant to Senator Lyndon B. Johnson in Washington, DC. In 1957, as the result of Sputnik, and because of his background as an engineer and scientist, he was transferred to the Armed Services Committee's Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Johnson, and later transferred to the Special Committee on Space and Astronautics, also chaired by Senator Johnson. This is the committee that wrote the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 and created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In 1958, the standing Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences was also created and Glen Wilson was a key staff member of this committee until it was abolished by a Senate reorganization in 1977. He was the only staff person to serve on the committee throughout its entire existence. This committee played a crucial role in supporting NASA's Apollo program and post-Apollo Space Shuttle development. In 1978, he became a member of the senior executive service at NASA, where he developed the Shuttle Student Involvement Program (SSIP) for the agency. This innovative program is designed to increase students' interest in mathematics and science by encouraging them to compete by proposing experiments to fly on the Space Shuttle. Since its inception, several million students have used materials developed for this program and more than 20 experiments have actually flown. For this outstanding work, he was awarded NASA's Exceptional Service Medal in 1981. He retired from NASA in 1982. In 1982 he also established the Marie D. and Glen P. Wilson Foundation, which served as a supporting organization to the National Space Institute at a crucial time in its development. The Foundation also established and provided financial support for the Space Educator Award, awarded annually by the National Space Club, to an outstanding high school teacher who has had a national winner in the SSIP program. In 1984, he became Executive Director of the National Space Society (formerly Institute), an advocacy organization devoted to promoting research, exploration, development and habitation of space. In 1985-87 he played a key role in the negotiations with the L5 Society which led to the merger of the two organizations in 1978. By the time of his retirement from NSS in 1988, he had more than doubled (to 20,000) the membership of the organization and laid the foundation for its continued growth. Upon his retirement, he was given the title of Executive Director Emeritus and served on the Board of Governors until his death. He received AIAA's Special Presidential Citation and had also been honored by being elected to the International Academy of Astronautics and to the Cosmos Club of Washington, DC. He was selected by the Engineering Foundation Advisory Council as one of five alumni to be honored as a Distinguished Engineering Graduate for 2000 of the College of Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. He is in numerous Who's Whos, including the 48th and subsequent editions of Who's Who in America. Glen Wilson had more than 45 years of experience in Washington and had been continuously involved in the Nation's space program since its inception in 1957. He was preceded in death by his wife, Marie. He is survived by his brother, Thomas W. Wilson, M.D., and his wife, Jean, and their family.

For in this, his latest feature and one in which a supporting cast of \\"live\\" players is refreshingly absent, Mr. Disney, abetted by his staff, such perfect narrators as Bing Crosby and Basil Rathbone, and a pair of durable literary works, has fashioned a conclave of cartoon creatures, which, by and large, have the winsome qualities and charm of such noted creations as \\"Mickey Mouse,\\" \\"Dumbo,\\" et al.This is not to report that Mr. Disney has reached perfection in \\"Ichabod.\\" He is still short of the mark. The \\"human\\" figures in these \\"adventures\\" are stilted, awkward creations and second cousins to Snow White, her Prince and other \\"people\\" in the dossier who were not an especial tribute to Disney and his animators. But in \\"Mr. Toad\\" he has limned a wondrously blithe bucko from Kenneth Grahame's \\"The Wind in the Willows.\\" And he has surrounded him with a crew to warm the cockles of the hearts of both the young and the old.In unfolding his story, the producer is merely presenting two yarns, the first of which is \\"Mr. Toad,\\" a frog, it may be remembered, whose utter disregard of his fortune and estate, Toad Hall, is the despair of his boon buddies, the Mole, Water Rat and Mac Badger Mr. J. Thaddeus Toad epitomizes his \\"positive mania for fads\\" by careening around the countryside in a \\"yellow gypsy cart\\" drawn by Cyril, as whacky a steed as has every galloped into a Disney horizon.He follows this antic by buying a hot car through the simple expedient of selling Toad Hall to a gang of weasels. Although he is jailed, his friend Cyril manages his escape, and the final denouement, the film's high point in hilarity, should even get laughs from cynics and realists well into the age of reason.Basil Rathbone's clipped narration is entirely in keeping with the tone of this fairy tale of rural England. Water Rat, the epitome of the genteel but stuffy country \\"gentleman\\"","excerpt":"Mac Badger, the irascible but kindly manager of Toad Hall, and Mole, a timorous, shy and loyal bumpkin, are creations equal to the best in the Disney zoo.Although Mr. Crosby states that the \\"colonies\\" also produced a few notable characters in his introduction to \\"Old Icky,\\" the tale of Ichabod Crane lacks the subtlety and satirical bite of its predecessor. Following the \\"facts\\" as relayed by Diedrich Knickerbocker to Washington Irving, the saga of the lanky, pin-headed \\"posturing pedagogue\\" is related almost literally and in broad splashy sequences.A few scenes, such as Ichabod's comic courting of Katrina van Tassel, the beauteous belle of Sleepy Hollow, and the dance at her Dutch farmstead, have wit and imagination. But that famous scene where the gullible and terrified Yankee schoolmaster, astride his bony nag, is chased through the Hollow by the Headless Horseman may be as terrifying to youngsters as any previous Disney hair-raiser.The amiable Mr. Crosby's narration and the couple of songs he casually tosses in with the assistance of the Rhythmaires, is smooth and professional. The same may be said of \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\\" It, too, is smooth and professional but it lacks the inventiveness and genuine whimsey of \\"Mr. Toad.\\"But the credits outweigh the debits and Mr. Disney has included enough elements of entertainment to make his newest film package a solid entertainment.

GOING OUT Guide"},{"year":"1963","title":"BRIGITTE BARDOT, who is 29 years old and has been exposed in about the same number of films since 1951, is not deviating from the norm in \\"Love on a Pillow,\\" which opened at the Fine Arts and Forum Theaters yesterday.The Fine Arts is the haven for those who want their French straight, with English subtitles, and the Forum is the place for those who like dubbed-in English dialogue. In both versions, the steamy, photogenic \\"B.B.\\" again is grappling with a new amour as though love were going out of style. The results are graphic but hardly new or penetrating.Draped, semi-draped or draped to the nines, Miss Bardot is easy on the eyes, especially in the lovely colors in which this stormy romance was filmed. What she has to say and do, on the other hand seem hardly earthshaking. It may not be this anguished woman's fault, nor that of her hard-working colleagues, but much has been made of fragile situations to which it is difficult to relate.Roger Vadim, her former husband and frequent film collaborator, adapted and directed the movie from a novel by Christiane Rochefort. The film was called \\"Le Repos du Guerrier\\" (\\"Warrior's Rest\\") in France.Mr. Vadim has focused the major attention on Miss Bardot, a Parisian heiress, who has jilted her fiancé, and the gruff, laconic, strange and roughly hewn gent she has saved from suicide. If love doesn't conquer all, it certainly gets a quick decision over Miss Bardot, who clings desperately to him despite his destructive attitude toward her, himself and life in general. The hero is callous, makes passes at streetwalkers and tells Miss Bardot to get lost for her own good. However, on the advice of a friend, she is strong in her devotion and, as noted, her nihilistic man finally pleads for her hand in marriage.As the odd light of her life, Robert Hossein is a multitalented citizen. Fleeting shots indicate that he plays the piano, does sculpture, speaks English, knows jazz and was a Resistance fighter. But for vague reasons he is bathed in bathos and doubts and drinks to forget. One wonders if it all couldn't be solved if he took a job or stuck to one of the talents he merely dabbles at. Miss Bardot is not much of a help, either. She is, for the most part, a pouting child despite her lush figure, which is caught in more than one revealing pose. Except for rare occasions, her reasoning does not indicate a high I.Q.There are some fine vignettes of Florence, including the shell of a towering gothic church, sumptuous villas and colorful lofty vistas. And the jazz background composed by Michel Magne, is brilliantly reminiscent of 18th-century harpsichord-accented scores. But Mr. Vadim's pointed direction gives few of the supporting players important opportunities, with the exception of James Robertson Justice, as the sculptor-friend of the hero","excerpt":"Macha Meril, as his girl; Jean-Marc Bory, as Miss Bardot's ex-fiancé, and Jacqueline Porel, as her mother.
