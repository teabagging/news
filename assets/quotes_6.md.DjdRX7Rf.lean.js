In Tennessee, Mississippi and Arkansas, local and state economies are reeling because of widespread layoffs of workers and shutdowns of plants in industries ranging from auto parts to pulp and paper to garment making.   The troubling news comes from the Southeast, far from the industrial corridor of the Middle West and Northeast and in sharp contrast to the widely held perception of the Sun Belt as a continuous flow of prosperity from East to West. Many people believe there is more to the Southeast's problems than the current nationwide recession, asserting that underlying troubles will increasingly hinder the ability of the region's industries to remain competitive.   The Southeast, quickly industrialized since the 1960's, is distinguished from the four other subregions of the Sun Belt as the manufacturing heart of the southern tier of states.

Canada is geographically the second-largest country in the world, but most of its territory is very sparsely settled. The vast majority of the country's 32 million people live in a narrow band along the border with the U.S. Despite a long tradition of national independence, Canada's history has been dominated by relations with Great Britain, the U.S., and, to a lesser extent, France. Canada's earliest inhabitants arrived via the Bering land bridge from Asia around 15,000 years ago and diversified to form the various Inuit (Eskimo), Northwest Indian, Plains Indian, and forest Indian cultures that still contribute significantly to Canada's national identity. The earliest-known European settlers of Canada were Vikings, who established a short-lived colony in Newfoundland around A.D. 1000. Other European explorers made numerous voyages to Canada during the 16th century, stimulated by Canada's rich resources of fish, forest products, and furs. The first permanent European settlement in Canada was the French trading station at Quebec, founded by Samuel de Champlain in 1608. Fur traders rapidly spread into the interior along the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes; European diseases, particularly smallpox, decimated Native American populations as the explorers advanced. In 1663 New France was organized as a French Crown Colony, and royal governors replaced private commercial interests in governing Quebec. The Hudson Bay Company was chartered by the British Crown in 1670, inaugurating a long period of commercial and territorial rivalry in Canada between Britain and France. In general, France sought to expand New France northward and westward, while Britain sought to expand its domination southward and westward from Hudson Bay. French and British interests clashed directly along the Atlantic coast, where both British and French settlements were established. Local and regional wars between the French and the British were endemic in Canada throughout the 17th and 18th centuries; each side enlisted Native American allies. These wars were often inconclusive, but in Queen Anne's War (1702–13), Britain gained a significant advantage by winning control of Acadia and Newfoundland, and by driving the French from Hudson Bay. The French and Indian Wars of 1756–63, a North American extension of Europe's Seven Years' War, proved to be the decisive turning point in the Anglo-French rivalry in Canada. Prior to the outbreak of full-scale war, in 1755 the British deported some 7,000–10,000 French settlers from Acadia, in Nova Scotia, to the West Indies; many later settled in Louisiana. When war broke out in Europe in 1756, Britain employed its superior sea power to cut New France off from Europe and captured Quebec in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759. Montreal capitulated in 1760, leaving Britain in control of New France. Faced with the problem of governing New France's large and rapidly growing French population (which far outnumbered Canada's English-speaking population), the British in 1774 passed the Quebec Act, which recognized the territory's legal code and manorial system of land tenure, and granted legal status to the Roman Catholic church. The act also extended Canadian territory south to the Ohio River, enraging the inhabitants of the 13 American colonies and helping to fuel the American Revolution. During the American Revolution, nearly 40,000 loyalists fled to Canada from the rebellious colonies, establishing English-speaking settlements in New Brunswick and western Quebec. Friction between English- and French-speaking Canadians led the British in 1791 to divide Canada (west of the Atlantic maritime provinces) into two provinces, Upper Canada and Lower Canada. Each was granted a legislature; Upper Canada's was based on British institutions, Lower Canada's retained the French forms established by the Quebec Act of 1774. During the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the U.S., Canada became a battleground; Toronto was captured and pillaged by the Americans in 1813. Many Americans hoped to expand the territory of the U.S. at the expense of Canada, or even to entice Canada into a continental American union, but Canadians, whether English- or French-speaking, showed no enthusiasm for joining the U.S. A small British garrison, with the support of Native American irregular forces, kept the Americans at bay. The Convention of 1818 established the border between Canada and the U.S. at latitude 49° north, as far west as the Rocky Mountains, and provided for joint U.S.-British control of Oregon (i.e., the entire Columbia River basin). Following the War of 1812, British authorities encouraged British immigration to Canada, and between 1815 and 1855, one million Britons answered the call. This immigration radically altered Canada's ethnic balance, making French-speaking Canadians a minority population for the first time. The francophones of Lower Canada, hemmed in on all sides by English speakers, rose in rebellion under the leadership of the Parti Patriote in 1837–38. Lord Durham recommended in 1839 that Canada be united under a single government, and the Union of Canada was enacted in 1841. This move did not, however, quell the growing nationalism of French Canadians. War with the U.S. threatened in 1844, as the U.S. claimed the entire Columbia River basin north to 54°40′ (“fifty-four forty or fight”). But diplomacy triumphed in the end: In 1846 the boundary at 49° was extended westward to the Pacific Ocean. Meanwhile, gold was discovered in British Columbia in 1856, leading to a gold rush and a substantial increase in the population of western Canada. Growing trade between Canada and the U.S. from the 1840's onward, and the development of a continental system of railroads in both Canada and the U.S. in the 1850's, led to a relative decline in British influence in Canada. The American Civil War had the indirect effect of prompting Canadians to seek self-government in a federal union. Previously, there had been little contact between the Canadas (Upper and Lower) and the maritime provinces, while the vast territories of the west were still privately administered by the Hudson Bay Company. A federal union was forged in a series of conferences beginning in 1864, and the federation of Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick was recognized by the British North America Act of July 1, 1867. The Dominion of Canada thus established in 1867 became a self-governing entity within the British Empire; Sir J.A. Macdonald became Canada's first prime minister (1867–3). The dominion rapidly expanded. In 1869 it purchased the western territories of the Hudson Bay Company, and in 1870, in response to a rebellion of French-speaking Métis in Manitoba, Manitoba was granted provincial status within the federation. In 1871 the union of British Columbia with Canada was secured with the promise of a transcontinental railway; the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed in 1885. Prince Edward Island joined the federation in 1873, but neighboring Newfoundland remained a British colony outside the Canadian federation until 1949. A second francophone rebellion broke out in Saskatchewan in 1885. Its leader, Louis Riel, was executed and became a symbol of French Canadian grievances against the English-speaking majority. Wilfred Laurier became Canada's first francophone prime minister in 1896, but he was unable to solve the problem of the rights of Catholics and French-speakers outside Quebec. Legislation restricting those rights had already been enacted in Manitoba in 1890. The Klondike Gold Rush of 1897–98 brought Canada worldwide attention and indirectly helped promote the settlement of rich agricultural lands in the Canadian west. Immigrants to the prairie region came not only from eastern Canada, but also from Germany, Scandinavia, and the Ukraine. Japanese farmers and Chinese railroad and mining workers settled west of the Rockies, further increasing Canada's ethnic diversity, though Asian immigrants were denied citizenship. Alberta and Saskatchewan were granted provincial status in 1905; the Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories continued to be governed by controllers appointed by the federal government and patrolled by the famous Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Urbanization and industrialization were stimulated in the early 20th century by the exploitation of extensive mineral resources in western Canada and in northern Quebec, and by the development of hydroelectric projects and transportation facilities throughout the country. The long-lived Laurier government fell in 1911, when his proposal for free trade with the U.S. evoked widespread fears that Canada's nascent industries would suffer without protective tariffs. Laurier's Conservative successor, Robert Borden, sent Canadian troops to fight in World War I in 1914 and bolstered Canada's war efforts in Europe through national conscription in 1917. The distinguished performance of Canada's armed forces in the war bought the country renewed international respect. Borden's wartime English-speaking Conservative-Liberal coalition collapsed in 1921. He was succeeded by the Liberal leader William L. Mackenzie King, who was to be Canada's prime minister for over 20 years (1921–30, 1935–48). He skillfully managed the economic prosperity of the 1920's, which saw the establishment in Canada of branch plants of many American industrial firms. The Statute of Westminster, which created the British Commonwealth in 1931, had the effect of granting full self-government to Canada within the Commonwealth. Canada's federal structure was ill-equipped to manage the economic collapse of the 1930's, which brought both industrial depression and a drought-induced agricultural crisis. Efforts to deal with unemployment, land foreclosures, and other economic ills fell to the provincial governments, which were not up to the task. Canada's recovery from the Great Depression was stimulated by the advent of World War II, which Canada entered in 1939. Although the war brought price controls, rationing, and other emergency measures, the overall effect of the war was to strengthen all sectors of Canada's economy and to enhance Canada's international status as a leading military and industrial power. A Liberal electoral victory of 1945 gave Mackenzie King a renewed mandate for the postwar era. The two decades following the war saw the gradual expansion of federal financial responsibility for national welfare measures, including pensions, unemployment insurance, and comprehensive medical care, though the administration of such programs remained a provincial matter. These developments coincided with an increase in urbanization and industrialization in the major centers of Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal. Formal “equalization payments” were enacted in the 1950's to reduce economic disparities between rich and poor provinces. The early stages of these developments played a part in persuading Newfoundland to join the federation as Canada's 10th province in 1949. A landslide Conservative victory in 1958 brought John Diefenbaker to the prime ministership, but the Conservatives proved unable to offer a coherent political program and were ousted in the elections of 1963, which returned the Liberals to power. Canadian politics since the 1960's have been marked by increasing regionalization; the Liberal party is based largely in the east, while the New Democratic party, organized in 1961, has little support east of Ontario. The Conservatives offer a broad but insecure national alternative. The language issue continues to divide Canada politically and ideologically. The rise of an aggressive Quebecois nationalism in the 1960's led directly to the Liberal prime ministership of Pierre Trudeau, a Quebecois known as a supporter of a strong federal constitution. Trudeau's efforts toward conciliation and for constitutional guarantees for Quebec within a strong federal structure proved unavailing, however. In 1970 he invoked the War Measures Act to send troops to Quebec to put down a wave of separatist terrorism, leaving the province subdued but sullen. The 1976 electoral victory in Quebec of the Parti Québécois under René Lévesque provoked fears that Quebec would secede from Canada. Lévesque's plan for a separate “sovereignty-association” status for Quebec was rejected by a popular referendum in 1980, but only because of Trudeau's pledge to seek full autonomy for Canada in order to secure constitutional protection for Quebec's special interests. In 1981, Canada's provincial governments reached agreement on proposals for constitutional change. The result was the passage by the British Parliament of the Canada Act, which came into effect on Apr. 17, 1982, granting full independence and constitutional autonomy to Canada and severing its last colonial ties to the British government. Canada's new 1982 Constitution more clearly delineated the powers of the federal and provincial governments, provided for Supreme Court review of legislation, and included a Charter of Rights to protect civil liberties. A nationwide recession contributed to the defeat of Trudeau's Liberal government and to the election of the Conservative party leader Brian Mulroney (also a native of Quebec) as prime minister in 1984. The Mulroney government encouraged foreign investment and privatization as a means of revitalizing Canada's economy. But its most significant achievement was the negotiation and passage, in 1988–89, of a free-trade agreement with the U.S. (that also came to include Mexico). The Meech Lake Agreement, containing a number of articles clarifying the 1982 Constitution, was worked out between Mulroney and Quebec's Liberal premier Robert Bourassa, along with the leaders of Canada's nine other provinces, and signed on June 23, 1987. Its provisions enhanced the power of the provinces; a key provision gave constitutional protection to Quebec's efforts to remain a “distinct society,” linguistically and culturally French. But the aggressive measures of the Quebec government to eradicate the use of English in the public affairs of the province provoked a backlash against bilingualism. The Meech Lake Agreement failed to become law when the legislatures of Newfoundland and Manitoba declined to ratify it by the June 23, 1990, deadline. Canada plunged into the most serious constitutional crisis in its history. An alternative agreement to restructure the federal government and give more power to the 10 provincial governments met initial opposition in Quebec, and was decisively defeated in a national referendum, leaving the nation to deal once again with the awkward status quo. Faced with a decline in his popularity, Mulroney resigned in 1993. The Progressive Conservative party convention chose Kim Campbell to lead the government, the first woman to do so. In the 1993 general election, the Conservatives were routed by Jean Chrétien and the Liberals. The new government announced plans in early 1995 to cut the budget deficit through higher taxes and spending cuts on health care and social programs. Although they accomplished this goal, many Canadians were disconcerted because of high unemployment and a decrease in benefits. Chretien was also vulnerable on the problem of Quebec because he and the Liberal Party seemed to favor giving special status to the French province, where in 1995 a separatist referendum was only narrowly defeated. In 1997 elections, the Liberals lost 19 seats, but still held a slim majority. Since the other major parties (Reform, Bloc Quebecois) are not united, the Liberals have been able to govern. The issue of separatism rose again in Aug. 1998 when the Supreme Court ruled that a referendum on Quebec secession would be invalid without negotiations on the terms with both the provinces and the federation as a whole. On April 1, 1999 the government officially created a new Arctic territory called Nunavut which is governed solely by the Inuit tribe (called Eskimos in Alaska and Greenland). In Nov. 2000 Chretien's Liberals won their third consecutive victory by a very large margin. The thorny issue of Quebec independence seems to have reached a settlement in April 2003 provincial elections in Quebec as the Liberals won 76 of 125 seats, denying another term to the Parti Quebecois, which carried 45 seats.

Irving Berlin has written a score for the occasion, with a tune or two ear-marked for his next Alexander's Ragtime Band. Mark Sandrich's direction is fast and facile. Hermes Pan (of all names) is credited with the ensemble numbers. Clearly, a happy event","excerpt":"second only to the shining of the sun again.In case you haven't heard, Rogers and Astaire dance, sing and have the knack—bred out of past necessity—of investing even ordinary lines and situations with extraordinary comedy. Here, for a change, their task has been made easier by a quartet of writers with inventive humor and a lively turn of phrase. Mr. Astaire, upon their suggestion, has ceased to be a dancing man and becomes a psychoanalyst who also happens to enjoy dancing. Miss Rogers is the fickle Amanda Cooper who has postponed her wedding day so often that her fiancé (Ralph Bellamy) insists she consult his best friend and psychoanalyst, Dr. Astaire—that is, Dr. Flagg. Thereafter it's the story of Flagg and quirk.Chief quirk, naturally, is that Amanda fails to respond to Dr. Flagg's treatment, or, rather, responds the wrong way by falling in love with her doctor. This in spite of anesthesia and hypnosis, lectures on the harmonization of the conscious and the subconscious, and a special Flagg diet of seafood with whipped cream, cucumbers and buttermilk, welsh rarebit and lobster. There is time, too, we should add, for a few dance routines—of which the trickiest is something called The Yam—and a song or two delivered in the best R-A style.While it is not exactly a secret, we might confide that Miss Rogers has become one of the gayest of our comediennes, equally practiced with the verbal foil or the slapstick. She uses both here with devastating affect, flooring Mr. Astaire with a line or chirruping a covey of elevators into frenzied ascent as she spreads a one-woman reign of terror under the influence of an inhibition-freeing anaesthetic. Possibly the best of it all, though, is the way she brings down a Tyrolean hat in a skeet-shoot.Mr. Astaire's dry humor and liquid grace on the dance floor are almost equally valuable, and he has added a new routine—a combination sword dance and trick shot exhibition—which should bring envious tears to the eyes of a golfing duffer. The rest of the cast—Luella Gear, Clarence Kolb, Mr. Bellamy, Franklin Pangborn and Jack Carson—busies itself amiably with the amiable duties prescribed for it and the result of it all is happy indeed.
