Behind the News -- The surprise finding was a bit of good news in the fight against the virus, which health officials fear could mutate into a form that would cause a human pandemic. Officials had expected that European birds would take the virus with them in the fall when they migrated to Africa, and bring it back in even greater numbers in the spring. That could still happen, but for now many European countries have relaxed poultry industry restrictions intended to help prevent the spread of the virus.    The News -- Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, under pressure from members of his own party to step down, refused to set a timetable for doing so.    Behind the News -- Mr. Blair reshuffled his cabinet after the Labor Party, beset by scandal, fared poorly in local elections. But that wasn't enough for the party's anti-Blair wing: they wanted him to set a date to quit, presumably in favor of their favorite, Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer. Mr. Blair talked only about wanting a ''stable and orderly transition'' but hinted that he may abandon a pledge to serve out his full third term, until 2010.    The News -- Colleges reported significant declines in SAT scores among this year's crop of applicants.    Behind the News -- Average SAT scores usually move up or down by a point or two from year to year. But some admissions officers say they've seen declines of 10 points or more this year. One explanation, testing officials say, is that there may be fewer students taking the test more than once","excerpt":"scores usually increase the second time around. Fatigue may be a factor, too: the SAT now includes a third section, for writing, that lengthens the test time to nearly four hours.    The News -- Subcommander Marcos, the Mexican rebel leader, gave his first lengthy interview in years, part of an effort to win support for his socialist movement.    Behind the News -- Appearing in his trademark ski mask and fatigues, Marcos tried to capitalize on a recent clash between farmers and the police outside Mexico City, accusing the state of provoking violence. What is he up to? Times have changed since Marcos, whose real name is Rafael Guillén, electrified the country by leading a rebel army in the southern state of Chiapas in 1994. The federal government is less corrupt and more democratic now, and there is less of an appetite for his Marxist views.    The News -- A dispute arose over the provenance of the cheesecake recipe made famous by Junior's, the landmark Brooklyn restaurant.    Behind the News -- Could New York's quintessential cheesecake have originated in Florida? That's the claim of Jeffrey Horowitz, whose father opened a restaurant in Miami Beach in 1947, three years before Junior's opened in Brooklyn. Mr. Horowitz said that his father, working with the restaurant's baker, came up with the dense cream-cheese-laden concoction. But the family that owns Junior's flatly denies the claim.

Her old man was a member of the New York department's narcotics squad, killed in the act of arresting the mob and Chris has a burning mission to dispel some ugly doubts about her father's honesty.That is a plot which the movies have hashed over more times than a reviewer can be expected to remember, but there are no surprises in \\"Undercover Girl.\\" The film details in interesting fashion, however, how the L.

Minnesota (5-5, 4-3) gave up two interceptions, both of which led to touchdowns.   Michigan, Illinois and Michigan State are only one game out of first place in the Big Ten at 5-2, but the front-runners are Iowa, which is in first at 6-1, and Ohio State, which is a half-game out at 5-1-1.

Iowa (8-2, 6-1) retained its half-game Big Ten lead over Ohio State going into the final week of the season. Purdue (1-6, 2-8) hasn't won at Kinnick Stadium since 1979.   The Boilermakers held Iowa's usually potent rushing attack in check. The Hawkeyes, third in the league in rushing with a 245-yard average before today, gained 215 for the game.   Rodgers completed 21 of 28 for 255 yards. Illinois 24, Indiana 10     BLOOMINGTON, Ind.

The Spartans didn't put it away until Duckett, who gained 137 yards, scored with 3:41 left in the game.

But their clubs' scouts, baseball's appraisers of uncut diamonds, had put them in those uniforms. The scouts always do. General managers make trades and dugout managers develop players, but the scouts discover or ignore the talent. And last night, before Fernando Valenzuela struggled to a 5-4 victory after two Yankee triumphs, each left-hander might have been in the other uniform if not for the scouts.   Fernando Valenzuela joined the Dodger organization after a Yankee scout in Mexico had overlooked him as a teen-ager.  Dave Righetti stayed with the Yankees last year because their scouts spurned a deal with the Dodgers for Don Sutton.  In the scouting offices at Dodger Stadium, several cards on Fernando Valenzuela are on file, dating back to Jan. 24, 1978, not long after he had turned 17 years old. On that first card, Corrito Verona, a Dodger scout in Mexico, had reported that the pudgy lefthander, then pitching in the Mexico Winter League, had ''a chance'' to make the major leagues.

Shakespeare himself, set down before it, might have a tough time recognizing his play.For the great Mr. Welles apparently decided, when he set out to make and play this film in the authentic locale of Venice some six or eight years ago, that the text and even the plot of the original were incidental to the dark and delirious passions enclosed in its tormented theme. That theme is, of course, the tragic downfall of a man racked by jealousy, aroused by the treacherous rumor-mongering and conniving of an ungrateful friend.What matters it that Othello bears a sense of social stigma in the play, based on the fact that he is an alien, a professional soldier and, particularly, a dark-skinned Moor? What matters it that Iago, his villainous and deceitful \\"friend,\\" hates him because he fancies Othello has captivated his wife? These are details and motivations that have been completely overlooked by Mr. Welles. All that he seems to find intriguing are the currents of hate and villainy.And so this extraordinary picture, which it took more than three years to make and equally as long—or longer—to re-dub and prepare for showing here, is strictly an un-literate, inarticulate and hotly impressionistic film, full of pictorial pyrotechnics and sinister, shadowy moods.Let's be completely forth-right about the talent revealed by Mr. Welles. He has a wonderful skill at image-making but a blind spot where substance is concerned. For instance, he makes of the murder of Desdemona a chilling, nightmarish display of stark faces, frenzied movements, architectural compositions and shifting lights, cut into a montage with accompanying music and screams. But he backs up this hot, erratic action with little feeling for character or regard for the genuine human torment that is implied in this melodramatic display.It would be hard to improve upon this rendering of \\"Othello\\" for sheer mise enscène. Mr. Welles has got Venice and Cyprus (or what passes for Cyprus) down to the ground. All the urbanity and stony beauty of the great Adriatic port and the island of Othello's triumph are made sharply visual in this film.But, alas for the import of the drama! It is mainly spectacle — elaborate, expensive, complicated—with no continuity, meaning or soul. Mr. Welles' own dusky Othello is a towering shadow of a man, monstrous in his pictorial movements but as hollow and heartless as a shell. And Michael MacLiammoir's Iago, which should be the sparkplug and fuse of the play, is not only vague in behavior but also almost impossible to understand. You can't expect much from a Iago when you can't hear the little that he says.Suzanne Cloutier's Desdemona is a beautiful, frail and gauzy girl who might he tremendously moving if you could sense her in relation to her man. But Mr. Welles has kept her an image of feminine anguish and nothing more. Her grief and the tragedy of her murder are purely theatrical displays. Robert Coote's Roderigo and the Cassio of Michael Lawrence are almost undistinguishable figures in a decidedly unclear plot.There are flashes of brilliant suggestion in this tumbled, slurred and helter-skelter film. But they add up to nothing substantial — just a little Shakespeare and a lot of Welles.

The German film producers are on an ascending curve. \\"Storms on Mont Blanc,\\" \\"Dimitri Karamas-off\\" and now \\"Ariane\\" at the Capitol. In this last film the miracle of Elisabeth Bergner has been caught on celluloid and in a scenario that is mountain tops above the average film. Pounded on a subtle little novel of Claude Anet, it gives us much of the delicacy of emotion and feeling which distinguished the original. Its viewpoint on love is grown up, it does not hedge the physical but it treats it with a tenderness which removes every suggestion of objectionableness, even to the most puritanical.Ariane, a little Russian girl studying at the university in Berlin, meets a sophisticated man of the world, a modern Don Juan. And because he remarks casually that he does not care for women inexperienced in love she conceals the fact that she was pure when she gave herself to him. She interrupts their most idyllic moments with tales of her former, of course imaginary, love affairs. He returns from a protracted business trip, but can only remain a few days. They have both been longing to see each other, but, when she learns of the shortness of his stay, she begins talking with forced callousness about the affairs she has had since he left.A Stirring Climax.This is more than he can bear, so he orders a berth for the Rome express which leaves in half an hour and starts packing his trunks. And now begins one of the most moving sequences that the film, visual or auditory, has bestowed upon us. Ariane, unable to stand this, confesses to him that he has been the only man in her life. But he does not seem to hear her. His packing is finished and the porters come and call for his trunks. He leaves the hotel room without ever looking at her and she follows beside him like a beaten dog. They do not speak a word to each other. At the station platform she stands outside, apparently unnoticed by him. His bags are in his compartment and he stands gazing out the end door but not looking at her. They do not speak a word. Steam and smoke pour from the engine, the train begins to move out of the station, she gazes up at him, he is still shut within himself. They have not exchanged a word. Then suddenly he wrenches the door open, springs out and catches her and leaps with her back to the train. He is kneeling before her kissing her hands. The train plunges into the night. They have not spoken a word.A Voice That Helps.For this we must he grateful to Elisabeth Bergner, to Rudolph Forster, the lover, and to Paul Czinner, the director. Fräulein Bergner was never more than half herself on the silent screen, but the microphone has given us considerably more of the richness which she has on the stage. Though it is sad to have to acknowledge that her voice seems not ideally suited to the labyrinths of the loudspeaker. I had expected that her louder and more dramatic moments would be hard to catch, as her voice then becomes harsh. But I was surprised that her quieter moments were lacking in vocal beauty and without individual color. But, for all that, there is enough of her to fascinate and to move us. It is hopeless to try to describe an actress as personal as Elisabeth Bergner. If I tell you that she is slim and boylike, that her eyes are large, clear and dark, that her gestures have a pleasing artificiality and that her way of speaking has a suggestion of Galicia about it, you will her as far away from the secret of her fascination as you were before. I can only say that she is one of those players whose very faults seem to enhance their charm—a wonder of flashing gayety and of sadness that chimes low like a copper bell.\\"The Beggar's Opera.\\"The \\"Dreigroschenoper\\" (The Beggar's Opera) is also a film which belongs on the credit side of German production. This filmization of Bert Brecht's adaptation of the old English piece, with new music by Kurt Weil, stirred up considerable dust before it came out, because both author and composer protested against the way in which it had been filmed. But their suits were finally settled with a general compromise, and the film had its première at the Atrium last week.There were two courses open to the producers: either to make an artistic picture which would catch the spirit of the original, or to make so violent an adaptation that the film might just as well be called \\"Grapefruit in Bed\\" as the \\"Dreigroschenoper.\\" The appeal of a really faithful transcription would only have been to a limited few who could savor its fantastic humors. So I naturally expected the adaptation method to be chosen. But instead of that they decided on a compromise between the two. In politics compromise may be a splendid thing, but in art-!On the stage the \\"Dreigroschenoper\\" was light and fast, with a bitter, sardonic humor that nipped but was tonie. It made no attempt to be realism that its very fantastic grotesqueness helped you to stomach its brutality. We always realized that the actors were only playing at crime and sensuality, weaving a Stylized pattern for us. There was a good deal of the appeal of the nursery toy theatre about it. But on the screen it is difficult to escape the sense of reality which photography gives us. And so the satirical edges were lopped off, taking a good deal of the vitality with them. On top of that the direction and the scenery also extracted a good deal of the lightness of the original. The sets by the Russian Andreyeff were fascinating in themselves, but they were too monumentally somber and inflated the whole spirit dangerously. Also G. W. Pabst's direction, for all its many felicitous moments, let the tempo of the acting drag. There was not enough of exuberance and gayety of the English original which Brecht had set so skillfully over into the Teuton.The Cruel Camera.The production also suffered from the error of using two players from the original stage performance: Carola Neher and Lotte Lenia as Polly and Jenny. How ill-humored the camera was to their faces and how hard-hearted the loud-speaker to their voices! Only Rudolph Forster, who is even more successful here than in \\"Ariane,\\" showed that he is going to repeat his stage success on the screen. He has the John Barrymore profile and also something of the engaging madness which is typical of that playboy of the American screen.On a somewhat different level but still a very cheering product of the German screen is the latest production of Geza von Bolvary, the director of \\"Zwei Herzen im Dreivierteltakt\\" to which you were so good-humored in New York. It is called \\"Die lustigen Weiber von Wien\\" (The Merry Maids of Vienna) and had its première at the Ufa Palast. This is a very considerable advance over the earlier work, both technically and photographically. It catches the unadulterated aroma of Vienna of the year 1875. Here in Europe we get violently tired of Viennese charm as it is artificially cranked up in banal little films and operettas. But here the spirit of the city with its transparent gayety and its heartwarming \\"Gemütlichkeit\\" (translate that if you can) is transfixed with an agile rapier point. The rococo interiors wind their curlicues around our hearts, the slow paced street scenes of old Vienna give us for a moment the feeling that we would like to make a bonfire of all horseless carriages.His Charming Daughters.In the course of the action we are introduced to a dancing teacher, Augustin, who is very much taken by the daughter of a coffee-house owner. But she will have nothing to do with him because she believes that he is keeping a harem. However, this collection of females is merely the ten charming daughters of a famous architect who have left home because their father, a widower, is threatening to remarry and the lady does not appeal to them. So they persuade Augustin, who has been their teacher, to get them an engagement as a ballet. Their appearance in a variety theatre breaks down the father's resistance and he lets Augustin palm his fiancée off on the Minister of Fine Arts. So the youth is able to convince his sweetheart that he was merely a platonic Casanova.Around and about it all are swinging waltzes from the quill of Robert Stolz, who did so nicely by \\"Zwei Herzen.\\" Willi Forst, whom you will remember as one of the librettists in that film, is at his agile best as Augustin, and he is surrounded by ten delectable girls who would make even Hollywood pale with envy. And the delightful Viennese dialect drips pleasantly from the lips of the whole cast and especially from those of Paul Hörbiger, who squeezes the last ripple of humor from the rôle of the father.A Ufa Production.This week the Ufa, which usually stands at the head of the industry, has to take the last position. Their latest production, \\"Ihre Hoheit befiehlt\\" (\\"Her Grace Commands\\") at the Gloria Palast is below their high standard. And this despite the fact that Hanns Schwarz, who directed it, was also responsible for \\"Elnbrecher\\" (\\"Burglars\\"), to my mind the best talker that Germany has turned out. The fact is that we have had of late too many pictures which follow in the trail of Lubitsch's \\"Love Parade.\\" Here the atmosphere is exactly the same and the plot, although in no wise a copy, is reminiscent. The variation is a princess who falls in love with a young lieutenant she meets at a ball to which she goes incognito. She has him advanced to a very high rank in her personal regiment, but when he finds out who she is he shuts up like a clam. For purposes of state the princess is supposed to make a royal marriage, but at the last moment, much to the surprise of nobody, she elopes with the officer.

If this adaptation of the thirty-year-old play \\"When We Were Twenty-One\\" really followed the promise of its cinema title, Phyllis would ponder seriously before rejecting a handsome and tempestuous young man in favor of a sentimental bachelor twice her age.Nevertheless, this is a good screen story, told briskly and well, and it holds the interest. David Manners, whose excellent diction and personal charm are an asset to any film, appears as the ward of three old cronies.One of them, played by Conway Tearle, goes to extraordinary pains to see the boy wedded to Phyllis, the charming daughter of his house-keeper. But the Imp, as the young man has been known all his, life because of his impulsive conduct, has other plans. He falls in love with a notorious cabaret dancer, played by Myrna Loy. The old bachelor learns of the attachment and takes on himself the burden of hiding the truth from Phyllis, by pretending that he is the \\"Richard\\" to whom the dancer had addressed a passionate missive which the Imp had thoughtlessly left lying around the house. He is finally convinced that his ward's attachment to him is more than that of a daughter to her father.Mr. Tearle celebrates his return to the screen with an excellent performance. As the two other members of the \\"Trinity,\\" as they call themselves, J. Farrell MacDonald and Harry Stubbs are amusing.

The train is late, Henri has time to linger, and on a trip to the men's room he discovers what is suddenly of great and passionate interest to him: men. One man in particular, a thug who implicates Henri in a robbery and then gives him a violent kiss, becomes for Henri a figure of enduring erotic fascination.    ''L'Homme Blesse,'' which opens today at the Waverly, has a violent undercurrent that manifests itself as edginess. Most of its characters are furtive and nervous, from Henri's parents to the men's room regulars to Henri himself. Mr. Anglade progresses quickly - too quickly - from soft-eyed bashfulness to near- hysteria. As for Jean (Vittorio Mezzogiorno), the object of Henri's attention, he is rough, mercurial and somewhat indefinite from the very first. The role cried out for Gerard Depardieu, who was undoubtedly busy elsewhere.    ''L'Homme Blesse,'' which does not allow Henri to consummate his passion until the very last, functions as an extended flirtation, as much between Henri and the audience as between Henri and Jean. Its commingling of violence and sexuality is potentially powerful, and the key performances have a crude visceral energy.     However, Mr. Chereau's approach is solemn to a fault, and the result is a sexually explicit melodrama laced with a certain amount of inadvertent comedy. In one scene, for instance, Henri's father gravely advises his son that ''there are clubs for boys to go to - if you signed up, you'd meet other youngsters.'' And when Henri, well beyond the youngsters' club stage by this point, is brought home overnight by Jean to the apartment he shares with Elisabeth (Lisa Kreuzer), she seems to be choosing just the wrong moment to complain ''You forgot my birthday.''

Hawks, the master storyteller who died in 1977, put his clean, uncluttered stamp on every genre. He was the test case not only for the politique des auteurs but of the studio system as a collaborative enterprise, one that in its heyday allowed a miraculous number of good movies to emerge from the talents of directors, actors, script writers, cinematographers, set designers and assorted craftsmen.\\n\\nIn the most complete retrospective of Hawks's works ever, which started yesterday, the American Museum of the Moving Image is showing all 38 of his surviving movies, which range from the 1929 silent \\"Trent's Last Case\\" (never released in the United States) on Saturday to a special screening in September of the 1948 film \\"Red River,\\" with two different versions of the ending. Viewers can decide whether Hawks was responsible for the best film in every genre, as was claimed by his most ardent French supporters, or merely close to it.
