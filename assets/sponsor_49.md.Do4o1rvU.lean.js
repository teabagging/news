adds that Albany County Dist Atty A W Proskin has recd information relating to state law that candidates must file campaign statements with State Sec in Albany; inquiry has focused in part on office of Assembly Speaker P B Duryea; announcement makes no reference to individuals or to Repub figures whose campaign statements have been scrutinized; refers to complaint about purported Liberal literature used in '72 Assembly campaign; Nassau County Repub Com acknowledges providing to Liberal party postage mailing labels used to send out some of anti-Dem campaign literature under investigation by Lefkowitz; both Repub and Liberal officials in Nassau disclaim any knowledge of how labels apparently came to be used by H J Relkin, former Queens Liberal who sent out literature and who holds patronage job on Assembly Repub staff; basic question in inquiry is whether Repub Assembly campaign funds were improperly channeled to help Liberal party in certain marginal dists in '72 to cut Dem vote and preserve Repub majority in Assembly; Duryea spokesman denies rept that Assembly Repubs' communication dir J C Threatte delivered copies of suspect literature to Queens printer, who has contended to state investigators that he had printed 'Liberal' literature and was paid with check from Repub campaign fund; literature, printed over Relkin's signature, has been denounced by Liberal party officials as unauthorized; Relkin insists that it is legitimate; Duryea meets on June 18 with Assemblyman J E Kingston, Repub majority leader who was chmn of Repub Assembly campaign in '72; Kingston has said that he had very little to do with campaign com's activities and knows nothing about Lefkowitz inquiry; in related development, officials of NY Com to Re-elect the Pres cast doubt on Repub Assemblyman A A DelliBovi's suggestion that Pres Nixon campaign was responsible for Repub literature on Long Island linked to material under investigation by Lefkowitz;

4th verified instance of campaign mailing sent out by Relkin is disclosed on June 18 by Assemblyman V F Nicolosi, freshman Queens Dem who declares that his '72 campaign was evidently 'ripe' for mailing;
