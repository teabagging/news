Young Howard then marries her \\"to protect the girl.\\" The three new arrivals and other mutinous members of the colony escape the following morning in a submarine which is conveniently near by and in running order.This queer tale, while not particularly helped by the addition of sound, appears as a relief from the musical films and those audible photoplays in which dialogue holds the centre of the screen.Despite several discrepancies that creep into the picture, it flows interestingly on with many imaginative passages.Jason Hobards as Howard is manly and natural as the hero, who not only knows all about ships, radios and women, but who also can man a submarine and teach a crew its operation in three minutes.

In a first-round match lacking excitement and quality play, the 20-year-old South African was able to beat Borg despite a thigh problem that affected his play throughout the match. Ferreira had to receive treatment to the back of his left leg after the third game. He continued to play, making errors but still keeping pace with the 35-year-old Borg. Ferreira is ranked 22d in the world and beat John McEnroe in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. Borg is currently tied for 1,094th. After a first set that lasted 71 minutes, Ferreira raced through the second set in 25 minutes. After losing the opening set despite having a set point in the 10th game, Borg said he became frustrated. The match was almost a duplicate of Borg's first-round loss last week in Nice, when a flu-weakened Frenchman, Olivier Delaitre, beat him, 7-5, 6-2.

Its Egyptian setting, after all, is a fanciful affectation: apart from the pyramids, which do double duty as Egyptian and Masonic symbols, the work's connections with Egypt are tenuous. The Masonic ritual toward which the tale so elegantly leads is, mythical Egyptophilia notwithstanding, entirely Northern European. And its characters seem almost Alpine. Papageno, for one, may have a connection with the bird-men of Egyptian hieroglyphics, but surely those fierce-looking figures are not meant to be Papageno-like dunces. Indeed, the work's blend of low comedy and high seriousness argues that the setting is the least of the work's concerns.   But for all the leeway this opera offers, directors who update it, transport it or otherwise depart from the traditional staging are few. The production that returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Saturday evening is not among the renegades.

Musical sympathy among the four musicians is difficult to detect, and although passages fall nicely into place now and again, more often one hears four musical lines that either keep their distance or seem locked in an angry battle. Individually, the players sometimes make appealing, shapely sounds. But together their timbre is usually an uninviting shade of gray.   The pianist Peter Serkin was moderately successful in his attempts to light a fire under the quartet on Wednesday evening at Alice Tully, when he joined the group for a new quintet by Hans Werner Henze and the Dvorak Quintet in A (Op. 81). In both works, Mr. Serkin's colorful, textured playing was the glue that held the performance together and a catalyst point for the kinds of responses that the Guarneri players seem not to evoke from each other.

It is as if the tune's unsung lyrics were referring to the theme itself, about to return after a long sojourn through canons, gigues, fugues, arias and dances: 30 of the most exquisite variations written for the keyboard. The explanation for the absence of the theme is in the words to another melody Bach quotes in the final variation: \\"Cabbage and turnips have put me to flight.\\"    One problem with Peter Serkin's survey of this remarkable set of pieces at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night was that Bach's playful allusion to mishaps of digestion after eating cabbage -- his coded suggestion that the theme was pushed into a fantastical flight of variation by something earthy and physical -- was completely overlooked. Mr. Serkin didn't care much at all about the physical world of movement and dance, the prismatic energy in the hand-crossing patter of the score, the body that listens to or creates this music. There was something precious and detached about the performance.

Mr. Serrano has been a fashionable figure since right-wing protests against government financing of his art several years ago catapulted him onto the national stage as a martyr to freedom of expression. Moreover, he has seemed especially eager to push the sorts of hot buttons that give his art an air of urgency and risk. Having made works involving homelessness, the Ku Klux Klan, body fluids and the Roman Catholic Church, he has now turned his camera on a subject that, while timeless, could not be trendier or more sensationalistic in this era of AIDS and rampant street crime: death.   His new larger-than-life, glitzy photographs, taken in a morgue, offer close-ups of corpses -- a decomposed head here, a charred torso there, each belonging to some unidentified victim of disease or violence. With black backdrops and the hyped-up coloration of Cibachrome, the photos are at once calculated in their artsy presentation and also poorly carried out, promising an emotional impact without delivering more than an occasional shiver. They seem big not because the images demand it but because bigness is de rigueur nowadays for ambitious photography.

In the course of reading the daily paper recently, reporting chilling details of famine in Africa, the passage of the missile ''peacekeeper bill'' and the ambiguity of our foreign policy in Latin America, I noticed I had begun to save articles closer to home like the one reporting 40 percent of New York City children live in poverty, or that 60 million American adults cannot read the front page of a newspaper.\\n\\nAmid my reading and saving, I noticed a less troublesome article proposing scrutiny of the United States military academies to investigate for inefficiencies and overlapping. Our military academies - West Point, Annapolis, the Air Force, Merchant Marine, Coast Guard academies - have proud traditions, yet re-evaluation is sensible. But then an idea come to me - would it be possible - could it be possible as we rethink service academies to consider a new kind of academy - one committed to studying the complexities of American democratic survival?

This system allows a count of the number of people waiting for service, their demographic profile and the kinds of services they are awaiting.   The needs assessment survey is operated by the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, through its local offices, with voluntary, not-for-profit service provider agencies, local governments and service consumers and advocates. Registration involves completion of a one-page form that provides basic demographic information on the person needing service and an indication of the types of service needed. The immediate goal of the system is to account for every person waiting for service.    As of last Oct. 2, 11,170 people were registered. In the next year or two, we expect to have a near complete count.
