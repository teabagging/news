State Comptroller since 1990, lawyer, State Senator from 1979-83, ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 1982, former political director of Freeze Voter, the political arm of the nuclear-freeze movement.    EUNICE S. GROARK, 56, A Connecticut Party. A one-time Republican, Lieutenant Governor since 1990 when she ran on the third-party ticket of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker. Lawyer, corporation counsel for Hartford from 1987-90, and a Hartford City Councilwoman from 1981-85.   JOHN G. ROWLAND, 37, Republican. Congressman from Waterbury from 1985-91, barely lost the 1990 race for governor, member of House Armed Services Committee. Consultant since 1990 for several military contractors based in Connecticut.    TOM SCOTT, 36, radio talk-show host, State Senator from 1981-1991, led anti-income tax movement in 1991, ran unsuccessfully for United States House of Representatives in 1990 and 1992. THE ISSUES    The state income tax, imposed in 1991, has been the central issue. Mr. Rowland and Mr. Scott promise to scrap it without raising other taxes. Mrs. Groark would not change the income tax, and Mr. Curry wants to keep it and economize elsewhere to provide money to cities and towns to cut property taxes. All candidates have called for expanded efforts to reduce crime, and all four favor the death penalty. Mrs. Groark has been attacked over the Weicker administration's policy of giving tax breaks and cash incentives to attract and retain companies, an approach she favors. Mr. Rowland and Mr. Scott says tax cuts would do more for the economy than such incentives. Mr. Curry would shift economic assistance to smaller companies. ANALYSIS    Mr. Rowland has been the front-runner since the campaign began, and has had a large advantage in financing, spending much of his money on television commercials. But Mr. Scott, who appeals to many of the same conservatives, has drawn off some support, and many voters, particularly women, have been troubled by Mr. Rowland's efforts to suppress a police report on a domestic dispute with his ex-wife in April. After a surprise primary victory, Mr. Curry has campaigned aggressively, but in a close race he may lose critical votes to Mrs. Groark. OTHER STATE RACES  (x denotes incumbents)   LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR M. Jodi Rell, Republican","excerpt":"Joseph P. Ganim, Democrat; Audrey Rowe, A Connecticut Party; Glen R. O'Keefe, independent   TREASURER Christopher Burnham, Republican; Joseph M. Suggs, Democrat (X)   COMPTROLLER Gene Gavin, Republican; Nancy Wyman, Democrat, A Connecticut Party   ATTORNEY GENERAL Richard Arnold, Republican; Richard Blumenthal, Democrat, A Connecticut Party (X)   SECRETARY OF THE STATE Andrea Scott, Republican; Miles S. Rapoport, Democrat, A Connecticut Party UNITED STATES SENATE  CANDIDATES    GERALD LABRIOLA, 62, Republican, retired pediatrician, State Senator from 1981-83, ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 1982 and for the Republican nomination for governor in 1982 and 1986.    JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN, 52, Democrat, United States Senator since 1991; State Attorney General from 1983-89, State Senator from 1971-81. THE ISSUES    Mr. Lieberman's TV advertising depicts him as an advocate for creating jobs, fighting crime and making Congress more accountable. Dr. Labriola, relying largely on handshaking and yard signs, assails Mr. Lieberman for backing President Clinton's budget plan last year, calling it the largest tax increase in history. Dr. Labriola says Mr. Lieberman \\"fakes right and votes left.\\" ANALYSIS    Mr. Lieberman has had a commanding lead in the polls from the beginning and a huge advantage in fund raising, allowing him to air television commercials that focus on his family and his achievements and do not mention his opponent. Dr. Labriola has had little money for television ads. Some Democratic Party analysts have predicted the most lopsided victory in state history. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  SECOND DISTRICT CANDIDATES    SAM GEJDENSON, 45, Democrat, dean of the Connecticut delegation to the House of Representatives, seeking his eighth term.    EDWARD W. MUNSTER, 53, Republican, a retired statistician at Pfizer. Served one two-year term in the State Senate before challenging Mr. Gejdenson in 1992, a race he narrowly lost. THE DISTRICT    The Second Congressional District is the state's largest, geographically, covering most of eastern Connecticut. It has been in flux economically as military jobs have declined and as gambling and tourism jobs have increased with the rise of the Foxwoods casino in Ledyard. THE ISSUES    Mr. Munster campaigned last time on the argument that Mr. Gejdenson had lost his local bearings after more than a decade in Congress. This time, the debate has centered more on effectiveness. Mr. Munster's commercials attack Mr. Gejdenson's attendance record for major votes. Mr. Gejdenson's commercials say Mr. Munster failed to do much of note as a State Senator. ANALYSIS    Mr. Gejdenson did not appear to take Mr. Munster seriously in 1992, but he is fighting hard this time, trading blow for blow in a negative campaign that seems to have shifted the advantage to Mr. Gejdenson. He has portrayed his Washington savvy as reaping huge benefits for the district in business for military contractors. FIFTH DISTRICT CANDIDATES    GARY A. FRANKS, 41, Republican, seeking his third term, the first black Republican elected to the House of Representatives in 60 years. Former labor-relations executive.    JAMES H. MALONEY, 46, Democrat, State Senator from Danbury since 1986. THE DISTRICT    The district is economically diverse, encompassing wealthy enclaves like Wilton and Ridgefield and blue-collar cities like Waterbury and Meriden. Once a Democratic stronghold, it was seized by the Republicans in the 1984 Reagan landslide. THE ISSUES    Mr. Maloney, with far less name recognition or money than his opponent, has tried to portray Mr. Franks as a Congressman more interested in gaining a national reputation than serving constituents. Mr. Franks has contended that Mr. Maloney has no real agenda to pursue if elected. ANALYSIS    Mr. Franks was considered vulnerable in 1992, when Bill Clinton carried Connecticut in the Presidential election, but he won with a 43 percent plurality when two Democrats -- one running as an independent -- split the Democratic vote. This year, he could benefit from having John G. Rowland, the Republican candidate for governor, on the ticket. Mr. Rowland represented the district from 1985 to 1991, and remains popular there.

In much of last Sunday's program by Joseph Penrod, a baritone, the situation was compounded by the absence of size in the singer's voice, not necessarily a drawback in the repertory that he chose to perform, and by his lack of resonance in the lower part of the range, which can be a disadvantage even without competition from the accompaniment.\\n\\nAs a result, a program that had much to offer in terms of stylistic variety and musical substance ran aground on interlocking technicalities - at many points Mr. Penrod could not be heard over the admittedly impressive playing of the pianist, Margo Garrett, and at those points where he could, it was frequently evident that the tessitura of what he was singing was too low for him. The baritone's account of ''Der Liebliche Stern,'' one of a set of five songs by Schubert on the program, illustrated the latter half of the dilemma, and ''Uber Wildermann'' proved a good example of the former.

A1    Siren Call of the New Economy  Policy experts say the State Department is losing talented diplomats who are leaving for careers that they believe have more power and prestige in the new global economy. The State Department is losing recruits to investment banks, dot-com companies and the Treasury and Commerce Departments.   A1    Debate on China Trade Deal  The United States Senate, after months of delay, opens debate this week on President Clinton's trade pact with China, setting the stage for a final showdown between free-trade supporters and their foes. Each side expressed optimism that it would prevail.   (Reuters)    Concorde Crash Inquiry  A metal fragment that was lying on the runway and that figures in the crash of the Air France Concorde in July apparently came from a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off from the same runway minutes earlier, French investigators said.   A6    Russian Mogul Cites Threat  Boris Berezovsky said a senior Kremlin official had ordered him to transfer his holdings in Russia's primary state-owned television channel to the state or face the prospect of going to jail. Mr. Berezovsky made the assertion in a letter to President Vladimir V. Putin.   A10    Court Weighs Fate of Twins  England's Court of Appeal was asked to decide whether doctors could proceed with an operation that would separate conjoined twins but would sacrifice the life of one to save the other. The infants' parents object to the plan, although doctors say both children will probably die without the surgery.   A5    Seeking a Peacemaking Role  President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria said in an interview in New York that he was ready to step into a larger role in mediating an end to his continent's debilitating wars, beginning with Congo. He said he recently volunteered to go to Congo to talk with President Laurent Kabila, who has blocked efforts to end the war.   A12    Violence in Sri Lanka  Fighting gripped Sri Lanka for a second day, leaving at least 344 people dead as the military mounted a major offensive ahead of crucial parliamentary polls, officials said. The separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam launched two attacks against military positions in the northern peninsula of Jaffna but were repulsed, the officials said.   (AFP)    World Briefing   A8    NATIONAL   A16-25    Spurned Networks Express No Interest in Rival Debates  The ABC and CBS television networks, which were left out of Gov. George W. Bush's presidential debates proposal, said they had no intention of carrying debates sponsored by rival networks like NBC and CNN. The Bush proposal, announced on Sunday after negotiations with officials of six cable and broadcast networks, has thrown into turmoil the work of the Commission on Presidential Debates, the panel created in 1987 by Democrats and Republicans to avoid squabbling over debates. Since the creation of the panel, no candidate has gone so far to circumvent its work. The panel's executive director said she still hoped to negotiate an agreement under which Mr. Bush would consent to the commission's schedule.   A1    Mr. Bush derided Vice President Al Gore for rejecting his debate proposal during a Labor Day campaign swing through two hotly contested states, Illinois and Michigan.   A22    Mr. Gore, accompanied part of the way by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, concluded a 28-hour campaign swing that included stops in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Kentucky.   A22    The Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that endorsed Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries and considered supporting Ralph Nader in the general election, has decided to endorse Mr. Gore, officials of the group said.   A23    Congressional Priorities  Members of Congress return from recess this week for a final session compressed by the election campaigns and dominated by tax cuts, education, health care and government spending. The Republican majority's first step will be to try to override President Clinton's vetoes of the repeal of the marriage tax and the estate tax, but they are not expected to be successful.   A1    Judge's Doubts in Spy Case  The federal judge who tried to release the fired nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee from jail on $1 million bail said in a written opinion that he was no longer convinced that Dr. Lee had downloaded some of the country's most sensitive nuclear secrets. The judge had ordered Dr. Lee freed on bail on Friday, but an appeals court halted the release while it considered a government appeal.

A1    SPORTS   D1-10    Sampras and Williams Win  Pete Sampras weathered a rain delay and an early challenge from Hyung-Taik Lee to advance to the United States Open quarterfinals with a 7-6 (4), 6-2, 6-4 victory.   D1    Serena Williams, the defending Open champion, survived a first-set tie breaker to defeat Jelena Dokic, 7-6 (7), 6-0, to move into the quarterfinals.   D4    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-8    In Holiday Campaigning, One Walks and One Talks  Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio were miles apart, in geography and approach, for the traditional start of the general election campaign. Mrs. Clinton marched in the West Indian American Carnival Day Parade in Brooklyn but gave no speeches or news conferences. Mr. Lazio marched upstate, attended a fair and held two news conferences in which he contrasted himself with his Senate opponent on issues and qualifications.   B1    Parade Thrives Despite Ban  The city's ban on alcohol sales at the West Indian parade did not seem to dampen the spirits of participants or the thousands who came to watch.   B5    Bronx Evangelical Rally  Several thousand Latino evangelicals endured rain and delays to hear the Rev. Yiye Avila, a 74-year-old Puerto Rican who is a force in the conversion of hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholic Latinos to evangelical Protestant denominations.   B1    EDUCATION       Teacher Shortage Persists  New York City's 1.1 million public school children return to class on Thursday to face a worsening shortage of qualified teachers, even as tougher standards make the path to graduation more arduous. Most of the 150 or so certified-teacher vacancies in failing elementary schools have been filled, but by Friday officials were still well short of filling 250 such openings at the lowest-performing middle and high schools, as required by a court order.   A1    Strike Looms in Philadelphia  The union representing 21,000 city teachers said it would ask members to authorize a strike in a vote today, citing a lack of progress in negotiations on several issues. The 200,000 children in the system are to return to class on Thursday.   A18    SCIENCE TIMES   F1-12    Debate on Cholesterol Drugs  New research indicates that even more people should be on cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, like young men with high cholesterol levels. But some experts caution that the drugs are too new and too expensive and their side effects still too uncertain to prescribe them widely.   F1    Secrets of the Albatross  A French researcher says the wandering albatross does not wander aimlessly in the years it does not breed, but rather flies to its own part of the ocean, often far from its nesting ground, and stays there until it is time to breed again.

The eight-year-old orchestra recently signed a recording contract with EMI/Angel and is about to release its first album. And on Christmas it is leaving for a tour of Japan, its first performances outside the United States.    On Saturday afternoon at Carnegie Hall, Mr. Henderson gave his home audience a sense of what he will be showing the Japanese -- a polished ensemble of New York freelancers who are equally at home in standard symphonic repertory and lighter fare. This time, in fact, the orchestra was particularly impressive in the standard works, the Largo from Dvorak's \\"New World\\" Symphony and the Nocturne from Aaron Copland's \\"Rodeo.\\" Both were gently paced and showed off the warmth of the orchestra's string and wind tone.   The first half of the program also included a robust account of Wagner's \\"Meistersinger\\" Overture and a playful reading of Victor Herbert's \\"March of the Toys.\\" Less pleasing was a suite of Japanese children's songs in an orchestral arrangement so grandiose that the melodies' innocent charm was obscured.   After the intermission the orchestra was joined by the Dallas Symphony Chorus, a well-trained ensemble that brought a bright, clear timbre to a pair of selections from Tchaikovsky's \\"Nutcracker\\" and a mellower sound to Cole Porter's \\"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye.\\" But the choir was at its most exquisite when its own director, Ronald Shirey, led it in a velvety performance of Rachmaninoff's a cappella setting of \\"Ave Maria.\\"    The choir and orchestra also performed an international collection of carols in colorful, outgoing arrangements by Randal Bass, who also contributed a \\"Gloria\\" setting that was attractively bittersweet, if somewhat cinematic in its orchestration.

As that romantic hero, Ermanno Randi is given to earnest and sometimes distraught expressions and little else.

Marshall Thompson speaks the narration with an agreeable folksy touch, but it is the quiet dignity of Joel McCrea's performance as Parson Josiah Doziah (J. D. for short) Gray that does most to hold this delicate blend of sentiment and pathos on a steady, sturdy course.Continuity is never a strong point in recollections of boyhood experiences and a certain coloration is bound to creep into such reveries. In this respect it may be said that \\"Stars In My Crown\\" is a sentimental reflection of an unassuming minister who loved his fellow man with a burning zeal. But we feel sure that anyone who is willing to cast off the phony armor of sophistication which most of us unconsciously acquire in the process of growing older will experience a real spiritual uplift as a result of having seen \\"Stars In My Crown.\\" For here indeed is an eloquent Sunday sermon done with a deft touch that best may be described as a richly rewarding entertainment.Life's full cycle is played out in \\"Stars In My Crown\\" as the parson ministers to his flock. His own happy home life is saddened when his wife's young nephew contracts typhoid fever and there is a crushing feeling of hopeless terror when an epidemic sweeps the town and the parson, after being upbraided by young Doc. Harris as a possible carrier of the disease shuts himself in from his people in their greatest hour of need.There is pulse-quickening excitement when greedy townsmen attempt to drive an old Negro off his land and, hiding under the cloak of the Ku Klux Klan, set out to lynch him. There is an easy, winning camaraderie between the parson and his old army buddy who will have no truck with God until He plows his lower forty acres. And there is an unobtrusive touch of romance in the relationship of the doctor, who succeeds his father under customarily difficult circumstances, and the attractive schoolmarm.\\"Stars In My Crown\\" is that kind of picture which cannot stand up to strenuous adjectives, for it is far off the beaten track of commercial entertainment in the usual sense of that connotation. It is more like a visit to church, a refreshing experience that is very personal and can never be made through mere words to seem quite as good to the next fellow. Mr. McCrea gives the picture an impeccable performance whether praying at the bedside of a dying person or brandishing his two guns in a saloon to command attention while he reads from the Bible. Ellen Drew is fine as his wife","excerpt":"Juano Hernandez is excellent as the aged Negro, and Dean Stockwell, the late Alan Hale, James Mitchell and Amanda Blake head a supporting cast that is uniformly very good. With the help of a screenplay by Margaret Fitts and the direction of Jacques Tourneur \\"Stars In My Crown\\" has become a real cinematic treasure. Joel McCrea Film at Park Avenue"},{"year":"1960","title":"THE theme of racial tension—as a Negro soldier is tried for a double-murder and the rape of a white girl—has been firmly imprinted by director John Ford on his favored post-Civil War canvas of the Southwest in \\"Sergeant Rutledge.\\"With Jeffrey Hunter, Constance Towers and a newcomer named Woody Strode in the main roles, the Warner's release opened yesterday at the Palace. This is a good picture—thoughtful, well-acted, biting, interesting and stimulating—with the steady hand of an old pro like Mr. Ford evident every step of the way. Unfolding in picturesque color at a remote cavalry stockade on the craggy floor of the old Apache country, the drama remains strong, rather than powerful. Admirably, scenarists James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck (co-producer with Patrick Ford) have explored a little-known chapter in Army history: the solid, brave service of a group of Negro recruits, including former slaves, under white officers during the Indian Wars.As an exceptionally stalwart \\"top kick,\\" Mr. Strode, stoically stands trial for his life, defended by an officer friend, Mr. Hunter. The picture succintly etches the court-martial testimonies and atmosphere, beset with bias, sympathy and ugly evidence. These realistic vignettes also hold wry humor, as the presiding officer subtly jousts with a bench confrère and his own twittering wife.Dominating the entire film, and even the overwhelming evidence against the sergeant, are the granite sensitivity and strength in the face of Mr. Strode, a gaunt giant of a man. Almost from the out-set, it is simply impossible to believe that such a proud, professional Army man would yield to heinous crimes. Furthermore, while the flashbacks of various testimonies impressively prove the defendant a born leader of his people, they continually slacken the pace. While the longest backtracking sequence also allows a nifty, small-scale Apache battle—a Ford special—it dawdles a bit in developing the attraction of Mr. Hunter and Miss Towers. But why that campfire scene, to a serenade, with the captured Mr. Strode nobly posed like a Mount Rushmore profile?Justice does triumph, inevitably, in a surprising, joltingly human revelation. But not before the best scene of all, with the defendant's anguished outburst about a \\"nigger from the swamps\\" turned soldier and man. \\"And I am a man!\\" cries Mr. Strode, and indeed he is.Mr. Hunter and Miss Towers, as his befrienders, are quite persuasive. Likewise Willis Bouchey, as the caustic presiding officer","excerpt":"Juano Hernandez, as a wise, aged Negro, and Carleton Young, as the unctuous prosecutor.
