The self-deluding, smug clergyman. The intelligent woman pondering spinsterhood. The imperious grande dame. The high-minded student and her married suitor, well into his midlife crisis. These and other characters familiar from Barbara Pym's later books assemble for the first time in this early work (1939-40), now published posthumously. As is ever the case in a Pym novel, the scope of the action is constricted but made compelling by understatement, an underlying sense of compassion and a precision of language through which mundane vocabulary is elevated into art. Crampton Hodnet is the name of a parish invented by the clergyman as an unnecessary alibi for an innocent walk in the woods, and it comes to signify all the imaginary excuses and rationalizations by which the book's inhabitants live. They watch themselves and each other closely, alert for any lapse of North Oxford decorum, and together preserve a world of interchangeable parts where no one is indispensable and equilibrium is maintained above all else. The novel is framed with three flirtations - two improbable, one predictable and all ultimately transitory. ''Falling in love is never ordinary to the people who indulge in it,'' a woman says, settling into her unmarried state.

Mention hitting totals to her sister, Beverly McLaren, and she'll be off and running about hits per game. Bring up the subject with their brother, Jim, and the next thing you know he'll be trying to sell you an asterisk.         There's a reason for this solid sibling stance. Shirley Cobb Beckwith, Beverly Cobb McLaren and James Cobb are Ty Cobb's children, and as Pete Rose closes in on their father's record of 4,191 hits, they want to make sure you understand the difference between 24 seasons with 154 games each and 23 seasons  with 162 games each. (Factor in such variables as walks and injuries, and it works out to a couple of thousand extra times at bat for Rose, or the difference between Cobb's career batting average of .367 and the .305 average that Rose, the Cincinnati player-manager, brought into his 23d season this year.) ''Batting average is really more important,'' said Mrs. Beckwith, a resident of Portola Valley, Calif., who was born in 1914, an otherwise off year for her father. That season he played in just 95 games and got only 127 hits, well below his 24-season average of 175. Her sister, Mrs. McLaren, 65, who lives in Menlo Park, Calif., agreed with the emphasis on hitting rate, as did their brother, a retired Lockheed Corporation employee who lives in Santa Maria, Calif., and is the only survivor of Cobb's three sons. ''Pete Rose is getting too many extra games,'' he said, suggesting that if Rose sets a new record it should be marked  with an asterisk, the way Roger Maris's 61 home runs in the 162-game season of 1961 are distinguished from Babe Ruth's 60 in the 154-game 1927 season.

They have included the citified country-rocker Laura Cantrell's shows at Mo Pitkin's, the indie glam-popper Mark Mallman's gigs at Pianos, and the Spinanes frontwoman Rebecca Gates's series at the Knitting Factory, which a few weeks back included Stephen Malkmus of Pavement. Now, in preparation for the release of his album ''Mineral'' (Secret Sun), the singer-songwriter Jesse Harris, above, will play a regular Tuesday-night slot at one of his favorite clubs, the Living Room. Mr. Harris was making music as part of the duo Once Blue (with the singer Rebecca Martin) long before his breakthrough collaboration with the folk-jazz chanteuse Norah Jones on her hugely successful album ''Come Away With Me,'' but that partnership is his major claim to fame. He also contributed deft indie-folk guitar work to Bright Eyes' 2005 album, ''I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning.'' His own music has the same easy-rolling warmth that defined his and Ms. Jones's Grammy-winning hit, ''Don't Know Why.'' His new material recalls the rootsy but ethereal mood of Paul Simon's early albums. But his lyrics are more basic than Mr. Simon's, evoking, as you might suspect, more dreamy ennui than solitary pathos. On past albums and live outings, he has collaborated with the likes of Bill Frisell and Van Dyke Parks.

The likely involvement of organized crime provides a dash of local color. But instead of sticking around to blame his troubles on regulators, Joseph Mollicone Jr., the bank's president, vanished. He had made $13 million in what investigators describe as fraudulent loans to himself. An investigation caused a run on deposits, draining the private fund that insures 45 banks and credit unions. The state's Governor, Bruce G. Sundlun, declared a bank emergency on Tuesday, shutting the affected institutions. Many will reopen with Federal insurance, but depositors at the weakest might lose their money. Will the story end in Rhode Island? Probably not, said Bert Ely, a financial institutions consultant. With private insurance programs for banks and credit unions elsewhere, he said, \\"One serious hit that isn't quickly and convincingly dealt with can bring the whole plan down.\\" Some other states are likely to require privately insured institutions to switch to Federal coverage, resulting in depositor losses or state bailouts for those too shaky to qualify.

The rate rose two-tenths of 1 percent in December to the highest level since mid-1987. Non-agricultural payrolls fell by 76,000, but the decline was less than a third the drop in November. William C. Dudley of Goldman, Sachs said that even these figures overstate the economy's weakness, since hours worked in December rose six-tenths of 1 percent. \\"The report makes you more comfortable that the production cutbacks happened quickly enough in October and November so that further big cutbacks may not prove necessary,\\" he said. A record 5.9 percent plunge in November factory orders was worse than economists expected, but no great surprise after news of low orders for durable goods. Dinkins, the Optimist  First Donald J. Trump came up with his forecast for Atlantic City casinos. Then Robert Campeau and his New York deal-makers issued their outlook for retailing. Last week the Dinkins administration raised its 1991 earnings estimate for the York City's pension fund to 9 percent, more optimistic than about 9 in 10 of the nation's other cities. New York City's hopefulness certainly doesn't spring from its 1990 record, when forecasted earnings of 8.25 percent actually came in at just eight-tenths of 1 percent. More likely, the city's optimism comes from its need to reduce pension contributions and come up with millions, quickly, to finance 5 percent raises for workers under contracts reached last week. At this rate, Yankee management, come April, is bound to predict a pennant. A Skeptical Eye at Christie's  For conservative valuation and fiscal prudence in New York, look instead to Christie's. The auction house prepared for the sale this week of the Ferdinand E. and Isabella Marcos collection of Old Master paintings by scrutinizing several pieces. Seven of the Marcos Canalettos were busted down to the Circle of Canaletto. What was a Giovanni Bellini in Manila, valued at perhaps $1 million, is School of Bellini in New York, worth a tenth as much. Several million dollars worth of English silver is for sale, too","excerpt":"no doubts, apparently, about whether copper lurks underneath. In Brief  For the first time since 1979, American semiconductor makers gained in 1990 against the Japanese. Their share of the worldwide market rose to 36.5 percent from 34.9 percent.  The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether the makers of infant formula colluded to raise prices. The prospect of Middle East peace talks pushed oil prices down to $24.90 a barrel, the lowest since the day after Iraq invaded Kuwait. There Goes the Prime  The nation's major banks lowered their loan rates last week for the customers they still consider unquestionably credit worthy. The prime rate, a benchmark for many other loans, fell half a percentage point, to 9 1/2 percent, the first decline in a year. COMPANIES   Hello? Hello? New York?  Wish fulfillment? New York was cut off from the rest of the nation on Friday when an American Telephone and Telegraph Company line was severed in New Jersey. Airline flights were delayed and diverted, and the New York Mercantile Exchange closed. Last January, computer troubles shut down A.T.& T.'s long-distance system nationally for about nine hours. Sears Slashes the Work Force  Sears, Roebuck & Company is hoping that fewer people in the stockrooms, loading docks and back offices will lower costs and bring more shoppers into its stores. The nation's largest retailer announced on Thursday that it would cut 21,000 jobs. Some analysts shrugged. \\"The announcement shouldn't be over-read,\\" said Samuel G. Liss, director of research at Salomon Brothers. Most of those laid off will be part-timers, he said, and in a slack economy, the savings are unlikely to be evident for several quarters. Sears's overhead has been twice that of its competitors; some stores still keep track of merchandise shipments with handwritten logs. Sears had slower sales in December than several discount chains. Comparing sales in the same stores with the year before, Sears suffered a three-tenths of 1 percent decline. The Best Products Company went private in 1988. On Friday, it became the latest retailer to seek bankruptcy protection. Giving Back LBO Loot  Wall Street's wheeler-dealers might want to see about malpractice insurance. Bankers, lawyers, maybe even shareholders who profited from leveraged buyouts that later failed could be forced to surrender their gains. Barry L. Zaretsky, an examiner appointed by the Federal Bankruptcy Court, said that Revco D.S. could sue to recover fees paid in a 1986 buyout. Professor Zaretsky, of Brooklyn Law School, concluded that Revco's advisers and investors pulled out so much capital that they rendered the company insolvent. Revco filed for bankruptcy protection in 1988. Mideast Flights Grounded  Nobody wants to insure flights to the Middle East anymore. So Pan American World Airways announced on Thursday the suspension of flights to Tel Aviv and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Insurance had risen to $65,000 for the Israeli flight, $162,500 to Saudi Arabia. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines canceled its three weekly flights to Amman, Jordan. Matsushita's Yosemite Crisis  Now that the Japanese own the concessions at Yosemite National Park, Washington has become eager to protect the wilds. Last week, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. threatened to cancel the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company's newly acquired contract to run the park's hotels, shops and restaurants. Profits from the park should not flow abroad, he said. He demanded that Matsushita donate its subsidiary, the Yosemite and Curry Company, to the United States, or sell it to a foundation at a low price. Matsushita picked up the concessions in its $6.6 billion purchase of MCA Inc. Environmentalists have accused Curry of abusing its franchise, packing convention facilities and a virtual shopping mall into the park and luring enough tourists to choke the area with traffic and smog. MCA has called Mr. Lujan's threats \\"Japan-bashing,\\" but agreed to put its Yosemite earnings in escrow for the time being. A Bank on the Brink  The Bank of New England Corporation said it expected to post a fourth-quarter loss of $450 million, more than wiping out its net worth and bringing it to near-collapse. The Boston-based institution is trying to raise capital to avert a Government takeover, which would lead to major losses for the Federal deposit insurance fund. The nation's 33d-largest banking company, the Bank of New England has suffered severe losses on real estate loans. INRTERNATIONAL   Walesa on the Free-Market Path  Poland's march toward free markets appears likely to continue under Solidarity leader and now President Lech Walesa. During his campaign, Mr. Walesa had the habit of promising faster progress and less pain at the same time. But he is filling his Government with ministers committed to economic reform. His Prime Minister, Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, is an economist so devoted to capitalism that he founded a trucking business while the Communists still held sway. Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of the nation's economic programs and Finance Minister to Tadeusz Mazowiecki, whom Mr. Walesa defeated, appears likely to keep his job. Keith Crane, an economist at Planecon Inc., cautions that Mr. Walesa might bend to pressure to ease the impact of free markets. But Mr. Crane doubts the Government will reverse direction, saying, \\"In no way will it undo what has been done before.\\" Mexico's Market Miracle  The Mexican stock market completed its third straight year as the world's strongest. Mexico led the 24 markets in the Financial Times World index last year by advancing 79.6 percent in dollar terms. . \\"Money is coming back to Mexico, and new money from the U.S. and Japan is going in,\\" said Robert A. Pastor, director of the Latin American program at the Carter Center. Dr. Pastor said coming trade talks with the United States are likely to accelerate the investment flow. A possible danger: As demand for the peso helps improve its performance against the dollar, Mexico's exports could suffer. On an early December visit to Mexico, Dr. Pastor said, \\"I was surprised by how much more expensive things had become.\\"   BUSINESS DIARY/December 30-January 4"},{"year":"1996","title":"Several of the Knicks were handed videotapes today after practice by an assistant coach, Bob Salmi.

Big oil has been accused of a lot of things - creating false shortages, gouging, price-fixing at the pump - but not even the worst critics had dreamed they would heist water.   The first thing Exxon said when the story broke was that it couldn't understand what the fuss was all about, since the Coast Guard and the Customs Service knew all along that the company's tankers had been lifting water from the Hudson to use for cooling and other processes in its refinery on the Caribbean island of Aruba, where water is short.   Which turned out to be true, as far as it went. You see, the Coast Guard and Customs Service have never put much of a priority on stemming the flow of water smuggling.

Elected to the United States Senate in 1982","excerpt":"no experience in elective politics before that. A millionaire businessman who co-founded one of the most successful computing services in the world, Automatic Data Processing. Born in Paterson, now lives in Cliffside Park. Has raised $7.4 million for this race.   GARABED (CHUCK) HAYTAIAN, 56, Republican. An electrical engineer first elected to the State Assembly in 1981; Speaker of the Assembly since 1992, which makes him the third most powerful elected official in New Jersey. Born in the Bronx, now lives in Independence, in rural Warren County. Has raised $4.4 million.                    --------------------         ANDREA LIPPI, independent   RICHARD J. PEZZULLO, Conservative Party   GEORGE PATRICK PREDHAM, independent   ARLENE GOLD, Natural Law Party   JOANNE KUNIANSKY, Socialist Workers Party   BEN GRINDLINGER, Libertarian Party   MICHAEL P. KELLY, independent THE ISSUES    Politically, the candidates are polar opposites -- Mr. Lautenberg's politics are liberal to moderate and Mr. Haytaian is a strict conservative. The centerpiece of Mr. Haytaian's campaign is a flat Federal income tax, and one of his campaign props is a slick brochure outlining 94 ways to cut waste and spending in Washington. Mr. Lautenberg says the tax plan is a fraud that would add $1 trillion to the national deficit over five years; he calls other Haytaian ideas unworkable or unoriginal.   Although both candidates have been in office a long time, each is trying to cast himself as the outsider and his rival as the career politician. At times, however, Mr. Lautenberg portrays himself as an inside outsider, saying that he would be able to do more for New Jersey as a third-term Senator than Mr. Haytaian would as a novice in Washington. ANALYSIS    Though polls throughout the campaign have shown Mr. Lautenberg with a comfortable lead, the New Jersey electorate is notorious for last-minute volatility and there is still a large bloc of undecided voters.   Mr. Lautenberg needs a good turnout from the traditionally Democratic urban areas. A year ago, Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, lost to Christine Todd Whitman by about 25,000 votes out of 2.5 million votes cast, largely because he did poorly and she did surprisingly well on that kind of turf. For Mr. Haytaian to win, he must rally his bedrock of conservative voters and the rest of the Republican faithful, but as importantly, he must match Mrs. Whitman's performance in urban areas, particularly among black voters.  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  SECOND DISTRICT CANDIDATES    FRANK A. LOBIONDO, 48. Republican from Vineland, a State Assemblyman who works as the operations manager for his family's trucking business. A former member of the Cumberland County Board of Freeholders, first elected to the State Assembly in 1987.  Has earned a reputation as its most conservative member. Sponsored law making \\"stalking\\" a crime. Lost 1992 race for Congress against the Democratic incumbent, William J. Hughes.   LOUIS N. MAGAZZU, 37, Democrat from Vineland. A lawyer, currently the solicitor for the city of Vineland; has never held elected office. THE DISTRICT    Before 1974, the Second could be counted on to vote Republican. But Mr. Hughes rode to victory that year on the Watergate wave that swept dozens of Democrats into office. In spite of his party label, his conservative politics and his support of environmental protection, anti-crime legislation and senior-citizen issues helped him hold on to that office for 20 years before he decided earlier this year to retire. It is expected that with the popular Mr. Hughes now off the political scene, the district will return a Republican to office. THE ISSUES    Mr. LoBiondo has campaigned unwaveringly on conservative beliefs: lower taxes, spending cuts and reduction of the Federal Government. Mr. Magazzu has stressed fighting crime as the main theme of his campaign, including championing gun control laws. ANALYSIS    In land mass, southern New Jersey's sprawling Second District -- which encompasses all of Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem counties and parts of Gloucester and Burlington counties, is the largest in the state. In politics, it is bedrock Republican and conservative. In 1992, registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats 85,000 to 70,000 with about 150,000 unaffiliated voters. If Mr. LoBiondo loses, it will rank as a major Election Day upset. The Republican candidate has raised more money than his opponent by a 3-to-1 margin and polls show him with at least a 30-point lead.   The race has significance beyond even the impressive boundaries of the Second. Under the redistricting that reduced the New Jersey Congressional delegation to 13, Mr. Hughes's lock on the Second District gave Democrats a 7-to-6 majority. The majority will assuredly shift to the Republicans on Nov. 8. In practice, it will give the Republicans little more than political bragging rights, but it will be another blow to the political psyche of New Jersey's Democrats, who in the last four years have also lost control of both chambers of the Legislature and the Governor's mansion. EIGHTH DISTRICT CANDIDATES    HERB KLEIN, 64, a Democrat and a lawyer from Clifton. Served in the State Assembly for four years in the 1970's. Won Congressional seat two years ago in an expensive and bitter race. A prominent Democratic fund-raiser between his two stints in elected office, Mr. Klein spent more than $500,000 of his own money and $1.2 million overall in his victory two years ago.   BILL MARTINI, 47, a Republican and a lawyer from Clifton. Served on Clifton City Council and is a Passaic County Freeholder; also a former Assistant United States Attorney for New Jersey. THE DISTRICT    The Eighth was redesigned two years ago after New Jersey lost one of its 14 Congressional seats as a result of the 1990 Census. When Representative Robert A. Roe, a 12-term Democrat, saw the new district lines, he decided to retire. The district, once a haven for Democrats, is now highly competitive. It includes the blue-collar urban centers of Paterson and Passaic, as well as suburban towns like Glen Ridge, Cedar Grove and Verona. THE ISSUES    Both candidates say fear of crime is the chief concern of voters, with the economy, taxes and government spending also high on the list. Mr. Klein points to the recently enacted Federal crime bill as the first initiative coming out of Washington in years that offers real hope of increasing public safety. Mr. Martini calls the bill \\"pork laden,\\" with programs that have little to do with crime-fighting. He has said that only the certainty of prison sentences will reduce violent crime. Mr. Klein said he voted against the Clinton budget because it did not have enough spending cuts, and has consistently opposed tax increases that affect the middle class. Mr. Martini charges that his opponent later voted for all the spending proposals in the budget he opposed and that he repeatedly passed up opportunities to vote for further deficit reductions. ANALYSIS    Leaders in both parties agree that this is the closest Congressional race in the state this year. Both sides have spent heavily on campaign advertising and have been supported by visits from party luminaries from outside the state.

As a lawyer in a firm where 7 of the 15 other members are women, as a man whose  spouse is a lawyer and a former judge, and as the father of 3 daughters, I reject the suggestion that women suffer a gender-based disability in law schools. Cultural attitudes and pedagogical insensitivity at schools and colleges disadvantage female students. But by the time one is admitted to graduate school, presumably an adjustment has been made to compensate for that disadvantage. Legal concepts in our society demand rigorous examination.

The film is a whimsical allegory of self-reliance in which the wispy-voiced princess, Irene (Sally Ann Marsh), guided by the ghost of her great-great-grandmother (Claire Bloom), grows into a take-charge woman who survives all sorts of punishing physical ordeals.

The facts, as recorded by many cameras in various corners of the world, are simply drawn up in chronological order and allowed to speak for themselves. And the consequence is a document which admirably reviews the momentous events of the last ten years‚Äîthe years in which this country, as a foreword states, passed from \\"peaceful security to grave danger\\"‚Äîwith consistent objectivity.The newsreels, when seen from week to week, are seldom more than dramatic illustrations, isolated and without context. But when edited and strung in sequence, as they have been in the present case, they assume a meaningful pattern. And, in \\"The World in Flames,\\" they derive great cumulative effectiveness from the ever-increasing tension of events themselves. Thus the record begins with scenes of world-wide depression in 1929 and 1930, and continues with the inevitability of a prepared scenario through the evidences of unrest in Europe, the growth of totalitarian power, the futile gestures made toward appeasement and the eventual clash of arms.With commendable restraint, the makers of this film have avoided the inclusion of \\"classic\\" newsreel shots which have become hackneyed with repetition, and have made it out of the ordinary run of material. The pre-war years, as they were lived both in this country and abroad, are covered swiftly and without confusion. And the phases of the war itself, following the invasion of Poland, are reviewed with dramatic economy and clarity. An informative, restrained narration accompanies the film, and it ends with scenes of preparations for defense currently being made in this country.One feature of this film for which we are grateful is its careful apportionment of the element of horror. It does not scream out with pictures intended merely to shock. It retains an intelligent perspective. Thus, when it does show briefly the consequences of a decade's collapse‚Äîthe heartless destruction of cities and the misery of homeless refugees‚Äîthe evidence is all the more compelling. There are no words for such a record of despair.At the Broadway Cine RomaOnce again the movie folk have used the French Revolution as the picturesque and bloody setting for high-flown romance. This time the language is Italian, and the name of the film is \\"II Conte di Brechard\\" (\\"The Count of Brechard\\"), based on a semi-historical novel re-worked by Giovacchino Forzano, who is the drama collaborator of Benito Mussolini.Nobility has a fine, likable representative in the dashing Amedeo Nazzari in the title r√¥le, while the revolting peasants are led by a vicious type ably played by Ugo Ceseri. His only redeeming trait (if it may be called that) consists in being the father of pretty Luisa Ferida, whose loyalty and love for the young Count are rewarded in the fade-out. As usual in celluloid history, there are hardly any decent people on the revolutionary side, while the ranks of the royalists fairly teem with them.The picture, now at the Broadway Cine Roma, is eye-filling and runs smoothly under the guidance of Mario Bonnard, the EIA director.
