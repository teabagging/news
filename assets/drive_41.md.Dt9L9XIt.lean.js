Blakelock, who was born in New York City in 1847 and died in 1919, is also known for a life of such suffering that it reads more like a soap-opera version of artistic sacrifice than the real thing, as a small exhibition at the Heckscher Museum here makes abundantly clear. Recognition had  once seemed likely. A self-taught artist with exceptional gifts as a draftsman,  Blakelock had seen his work exhibited at the National Academy of Design when he  was only 20.         Nonetheless, however grounded his work may have been in the increasingly familiar styles of the Barbizon and the Hudson River Schools, it seems to have been deemed overly personal and idiosyncratic. He never found a gallery to represent him, exhibited rarely and usually to critical condemnation, struggled  without relief to support a family that included his wife, Cora, and eventually  eight children and, in desperation, frequently sold his paintings for ludicrously low amounts. In the catalogue to an exhibition at the Whitney Museum on the centenary of the artist's birth, Lloyd Goodrich, who was then associate curator at the museum, wrote that Blakelock once sold 100 paintings to a Third Avenue junk dealer for $33.

Only gradually does a thread emerge: the 18th-century story is Jane Austen's ''Sir Charles Grandison,'' a 1977 discovery and her only play, a very brief and childish effort based on Samuel Richardson's novel.

Such long-term associations in films are rare. Offhand, I can only think of a handful of others: Billy Wilder and his writing collaborator, I. A. L. Diamond; Luis Bunuel and Jean-Claude Carri ere, who worked with Bunuel not only on his screenplays but also on his autobiography, ''My Last Breath,'' published this summer just before Bunuel's death at 83; and Francois Truffaut and Jean-Pierre Leaud, the young actor who actually grew up in front of the camera in Mr. Truffaut's Antoine Doinel films made between 1959 and 1979.   It may have something to do with the terrific pressures in commercial filmmaking that such collaborations, which are much like difficult marriages, tend to fall apart too soon, that is, before the collaborators have had time to accumulate the experiences that would enrich their work.

A show that begins with a glimpse into the cultural void of postwar Japan gives way to the queasy sensation that the West has also been swallowed up by a nuclear-age vacuum. This is a beautiful show, and it looks terrific in the great big blond galleries Mr. Isozaki has designed with James Stewart Polshek for the Brooklyn Museum's newly renovated West Wing. But a profound malaise lurks beneath the beauty.   Born in 1931 in Oita, Japan, Mr. Isozaki came of age in a country that was not only physically and economically in tatters but had also been torn from its cultural moorings. With its emperor demoted from a god to a figurehead and many of its ancient social customs outlawed by a new constitution, Japan veered toward the condition of a blank cultural slate. It is apt that the country later cornered the market in cameras, tape recorders and VCR's. With its own culture in a state of partial erasure, it is as if Japan had no choice but to fill the vacuum by recording the sights and sounds of the world beyond its borders.

A bill under consideration in the House would revoke President Clinton's certification of Mexico as fully cooperating in fighting drug trafficking. But the White House threatened a veto, even though the bill would allow Mr. Clinton to waive the legal effects of the decertification, and the likelihood that it would pass appeared to be dwindling.   A1     Key Testimony in Drug Case   A former Mexican police officer, testifying in a civil trial in Houston, identified a former deputy attorney general of Mexico to whom he said he delivered narcotics protection money in 1994. It was the most important testimony to date in the case, in which United States prosecutors have been constructing an image of systematic narcotics corruption, showing Mexico's law enforcement officials as being in the pay of drug traffickers.   A12     Rebels Near Albanian Capital   Rebel gunfire pressed closer to the Albanian capital, Tirana, where gangs carried off weapons from two military sites and Western embassies organized evacuations. Looters also stormed an arms depot near Elbasan, 22 miles southeast of Tirana. In the oil refining center of Ballsh, 50 miles from the capital, insurgents plundered an armory and took control over a main highway through southern Albania.   A5     Nigeria Charges Dissidents   Nigeria's military Government charged a Nobel laureate, Wole Soyinka, and 11 other dissidents with treason in connection with a series of bombings of army installations. The charge against Mr. Soyinka carries a potential death penalty, though he fled Nigeria in November 1994 and lives abroad.   A6     Peru Talks Deadlock   Talks to bring a peaceful end to the hostage crisis in Peru broke down, with both sides saying they had failed to agree on important points. While the discussions had been expected to produce the outlines of an agreement toward ending the crisis, the meeting ended with no progress. It was the first meeting since talks broke down over rebel allegations that the Government was building tunnels to attack them.   A13     Israeli Premier 'Fed Up'   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel declared he was ''fed up'' with charges that his actions had violated the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. The Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, who has apparently refused to talk to Mr. Netanyahu, prepared to convene a meeting in Gaza to discuss the peace agreements","excerpt":"Israel was not invited.   A10     The United Nations Palestinian observer opened a General Assembly debate on the Israeli Government's plan to build a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem by condemning the plan as illegal.   A11     NATIONAL   A16-24, B9-11    President Shelves Plan For Price Index Commission   Administration officials said President Clinton had decided to shelve the idea of establishing a commission to look into recalculating the cost-of-living adjustments in the consumer price index, which studies said was overstating inflation.   A1    U.S. Tipped on Lobbying Plan  The Government began to investigate China's lobbying efforts early last year after the National Security Agency picked up hints about China's effort, including its willingness to funnel money to American politicians, law enforcement officials said. They said the hints were discovered while eavesdropping on conversations between Beijing and Chinese officials in the United States.   A1      Transportation Plan Announced   The Clinton Administration announced a six-year transportation plan that would raise the amount of money available for maintaining major highways, including interstates. Other elements of the proposal would increase money for enforcing truck safety and drunken driving laws. Overall, it would increase spending on transportation by $17 billion from the amount in the previous six-year plan.   A16       Republicans Seek New Budget   The Republican majority in the House endorsed a nonbinding resolution to require the White House to submit a second budget for the coming year. Congressional analysts have described the first one as flawed by overly optimistic assumptions about the economy. The White House said it had no intention of offering a new budget and called on the Republicans to propose their own alternative. B11       Philadelphia Worries Over Trial   Testimony concluded in the trial of two men in the killing of a 26-year-old jogger in Center City Philadelphia in November 1995. The defense focused on allegations of misdeeds by the police, leaving some Philadelphians worried that the guilty would go free and others fearing that the real killer was still at large.   A16     Restraint Urged on Cloning Ban   Scientists and ethicists testifying before a Senate panel urged Congress not to rush to ban research on the cloning of human beings. The specialists, including Dr. Ian Wilmut, the Scottish scientist who announced the first cloning of a mammal, said there was no immediate crisis because the methods for sheep would have to be made much more efficient before being used with humans.   B11     High Court Rebuffs Muslims   The Supreme Court rejected a Muslim group's request that it remove a 66-year-old marble depiction of the prophet Mohammed from its courtroom.

Sure, Bibi doesn't want to give up the Golan Heights, but I don't want to give up Lebanon,  so we'll trade: I keep Lebanon, he keeps the Golan -- and Bibi gets the blame.

What bad luck! Oh, what a cruel twist of fate!' Bibi will also give me a new chance to drive a wedge between Israel and the U.S., which was never possible under Shimon Peres, and to break out of my isolation in the Arab world. Those Likud hard-liners will eventually push all the Arabs back toward me. The best part is that Yasir Arafat thought he had outfoxed me by making peace on his own with the Jews, leaving me out on a limb with no leverage.

David Ivri, director general of Israel's Ministry of Defense, and Gen. Ehud Barak, deputy chief of staff of the Israeli armed forces, held a series of meetings with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff, to discuss Israeli concerns that Iraq may fire Scud missiles with chemical warheads against Israel.   Israeli officials would like to improve the performance of the Patriot system to intercept Scud missiles at a greater distance from their targets. Interception of missiles at longer ranges would help prevent dispersal of poisonous gases over populated areas of Israel, if Iraq employs chemical weapons. So far, all the Iraqi missile attacks have involved conventional warheads, and American and allied officials are uncertain whether Iraq can put chemical warheads on its missiles.    A second purpose of the meetings, according to administration officials, was to discuss Israel's requests for better intelligence sharing and coordination in the event that the Israeli leadership changes its current policy of not retaliating for Iraqi missile attacks.   One Administration official said the meetings resulted in no changes in the American policy of urging continued restraint by Israel's defense forces.
