Relationships always come to dead ends; lovers find themselves behind walls, unable to communicate. Throughout the show, Ms. Chapman rarely modulated her voice to express specific emotions.

It also marked the rightful acknowledgment of what has become one of the most expressive large groups in jazz. The playing on ''Concert in the Garden'' captivates both in solo and ensemble terms","excerpt":"Ms. Schneider's billowing compositions, laced with Latin American harmony and rhythm, breathe in such a manner as to mask their scrupulous precision. This deceptively airy quality multiplies in concert, as the orchestra has proved on countless New York engagements. One, in January 2000, yielded ''Live at the Jazz Standard -- Days of Wine and Roses,'' a recording originally issued only to buyers of a Maria Schneider Riesling. Now available through ArtistShare (at www.mariaschneider.com), the album offers a glimpse at Ms. Schneider's history as a composer and arranger; several pieces date as far back as her student years at the Eastman School of Music. Most of the arrangements were staples of a mid-1990's residency at the now-defunct Greenwich Village club Visiones; Ms. Schneider, above, led the orchestra there every Monday night for five years. It was during that time that she began to reshape the harmonically astute big-band syntax of her mentors, the composers Gil Evans and Bob Brookmeyer, into a dialect of her own. Returning to the Jazz Standard this week, Ms. Schneider and her colleagues will speak it fluently.

Music often tries for a metaphoric reproduction of its surroundings","excerpt":"Ms. Schneider's sounds as if it belongs in Northern California, lush and trouble-free.   After a year's work -- and with some fine soloists, including the trumpeters Greg Gisbert and Tim Hagans and the saxophonists Tim Ries, Rich Perry, Rick Margitza and Mark Vinci -- Ms. Schneider's band is precise in its execution. She sits or stands in front of the band, and with a casual gesture cues a section; to draw out more volume from the trumpets, she waves her hands, like an animal trainer in a circus trying to get a reluctant horse into the ring. She's after dynamics and control, and she gets both.

The 24-hour daily service offers a collection of videotapes featuring pop-music stars playing their own material. Some of the tapes are more or less straightforward recordings of concerts before enthusiastic audiences. At the other end of the spectrum, some tapes contain elaborate dramatizations that are keyed to the lyrics, sometimes rather loosely but often very cleverly. The result in any given hour can resemble a sea of capped teeth and fashionable leather togs, all held together with a variety of rhythmic beats. In any event, younger audiences evidently like the product, and MTV is establishing an important presence in both cable programming and record sales.\\n\\nThe problem is that MTV seems curiously bent on returning the black musician to the status of ''invisible man.'' The program can be watched for hours at a time without detecting the presence of a single black performer. Critics have wondered if this ''oversight'' is intentional, a demographic ploy for making MTV more palatable to the suburbs of middle-class white America. MTV executives, for their part, have insisted, not a little arrogantly, that their product is focused on rock-and-roll, an area of music that supposedly is not frequented by black performers.

A. Milne to write the famous Pooh series. Besides, she said, she detected in the faces of the British-made toys a certain unhappiness with their display-case accommodations.    This lone cry sparked a series of semi-comic responses in the United States. Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York introduced a resolution in Congress saying that the British must have ''their heads in a honey jar'' to suggest returning the dolls, which were given to the library 10 years ago by the author's American publisher, E. P. Dutton. Mayor Rudolph W.

For it is a drama of the West—not in those virile Indian days, but rather of the present. Where, not so long ago, the hero would have met the heroine struggling with the ropes that tied her to the railroad track, he now introduces himself by smashing his airplane into the room in which she is taking a shower. Perhaps this is progress, perhaps it is a salute to an age that has all but forgotten its remote tradition.But no melancholy light should glow on Monday morning, regardless of the state of melodrama, wherein all seems to be vanity. \\"A Holy Terror\\" is here to take its meager bow, and with George O'Brien to solve its twin mysteries of murder and love. On the framework that was once the endless flickering serial he and his associates have added the Gothic structure that is 1931—in sound. And so, while death still rides the Western plains on horse, youth plays polo in the East and then leaves for Wyoming in an airship.The picture is not for those whose memories cannot forget the earlier days, who would prefer Sally.

Horses gallop over the mesa and bullets fly over the yawning cavity of Devil's Gulch. Then there is the explanation and the end, not the \\"Continued Next Week.\\"The Roxy has its usual effective stage show, but it might have taken thought and filled the first few orchestra rows with small boys howling for blood and urging Mr. O'Brien's horse onward.

An American businessman takes his wife and four sons to the island of Elba in the 1950's to search for gems and a fresh start. Nearly 50 years later, his youngest son returns to extract the truth of his family's troubling experiences there, reconstructing the past through village gossip and the residue of marital distrust. This philosophically probing novel ''once again shows Joanna Scott to be a writer who takes different directions from book to book,'' a quest that ''separates the genuine artist from the fake,'' Jeffrey Eugenides wrote here last year.    By the Sword: A History of Gladiators, Musketeers, Samurai, Swashbucklers, and Olympic Champions, by Richard Cohen. (Modern Library, $15.95.) This idiosyncratic history of swordplay in combat and sport ranges from ancient Greece to the contemporary Olympics (the author is a five-time British saber champion and a four-time Olympian). The author renders ''that most iconic of weapons as both mythic and accessible,'' Robert S. Boynton said here earlier this year, leaving one ''with the sense that the sword is an integral artifact for understanding everyday life.''    When Eve Was Naked: Stories of a Life's Journey, by Josef Skvorecky. (Picador, $15.)

The result is ''a delight only Skvorecky could write,'' Laura Secor wrote in these pages in 2002.    I Don't Know How She Does It: The Life of Kate Reddy, Working Mother, by Allison Pearson. (Anchor, $13.95.) The heroine of this first novel is a 35-year-old hedge fund manager in London trying desperately to be supermom, loving wife and business whiz while compiling endless ''must remember'' lists, fending off guilt and teetering on the edge of exhaustion. Her travails make for ''a sharply observed, sometimes painfully sad story about the sordid disparity between the ideal and the reality of 'having it all,' '' Kate Betts said here last year. ''You root for Kate the whole length of her roller coaster ride.''    The Gatekeepers: Inside the Admissions Process of a Premier College, by Jacques Steinberg. (Penguin, $15.) In 1999, the author, a reporter for The Times, got permission from Wesleyan University to observe its admissions procedures for a year and see how the process really works for both the applicants and those well-meaning adults who sit in judgment of them. The gatekeepers, he found, are dedicated but under intense pressure to protect the college's image and financial prospects. ''Steinberg is a good suspense writer,'' Andrew Delbanco wrote here in 2002.    Near a Thousand Tables: A History of Food, by Felipe Fern&#225;ndez-Armesto. (Free Press, $14.) A skilled historian unafraid of big subjects (he has recently tackled civilization and truth) turns to the history of eating, which he sees as a testament to mankind's powers of invention. He documents eight revolutions in our attempt to improve on mere survival, beginning with the harnessing of fire, which transformed solitary eaters into communal ones. Fern&#225;ndez-Armesto ''is a polymath who writes with the ease of a genial host at an enormous buffet,'' Betty Fussell said here last year. He ''brings a humanity, civility and excitement to serious food writing that may not have been seen since Brillat-Savarin.''    The Ringer, by Bill Scheft. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $12.95.) This first novel by a humorist and monologue writer for David Letterman revolves around a New York neurotic called College Boy, who supports his gambling habit by toiling as a hired gun for 13 softball teams. Though the results are mixed, ''the jokes are plentiful and very high in quality,'' Joe Queenan wrote here in 2002.    A World Turned Over: A Killer Tornado and the Lives It Changed Forever, by Lorian Hemingway. (Simon & Schuster, $12.) The author, a granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway, tells of a tornado that swept through Mississippi in 1966, killing 57 people and ravaging her hometown of South Jackson. Years later, she returns to pay homage to the scarred place she left behind. ''Hemingway's prose, recalling this universe, is lush and evocative,'' Michelle Maisto said here last year.

Forty years ago the source of the mortgage madness was the vast army of veterans taking advantage of low-cost Government financing","excerpt":"much of the past year's crush of mortgage activity came from homeowners who are refinancing existing loans.   Of course, it is easy to see why. For one thing, under the proposed tax law, consumer credit would become a more expensive proposition, since the plan shuts the door on the longstanding deduction for credit card finance charges and consumer loans. The tax bill would allow people to borrow against a first and second home, but mortgage deductions would be limited to the original purchase price, the cost of home improvements plus amounts needed for educational or medical expenses. In recent months, many homeowners have been taking out larger mortgages, eager to cash in on their increased home equity and reduce their installment debt before the proposed restrictions take effect next year.   At the same time, mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest level in seven years.
