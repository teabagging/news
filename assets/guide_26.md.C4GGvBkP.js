This time the focus is on the boldly decorated ceramics produced by British and American factories beginning in the late 19th century, wares that reflected the growing interest during the period in natural forms, in technological innovation, in the Japanese esthetic and in historical references from ancient Egypt onward.   The wealth of majolica material that emerged a century ago can be seen in ''English Majolica,'' on view through June 13 at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Design, at 2 East 91st Street. Since this is the first show in this country - and, perhaps, anywhere - of these late 19th-and early 20thcentury ceramics, most of which are still in private hands, the selections on view probably represent the tip of the iceberg. A fullscale revival would, no doubt, flush from the attics of England and America specimens that equal, and even surpass, some of the 70 examples in this exhibition, all of which were produced between 1851 and 1910. A comprehensive majolica show will one day, it is to be hoped, document all of the variations of the basic majolica themes that are expressed in this presentation.

That total exceeded the estimate by more than 50 percent, according to Dr. Alan Walker, a cataloger for Bank Leu Ltd., the Zurich company that staged the extravaganza.\\n\\n''The really good things went for really amazing prices,'' Dr. Walker reported. Among the most amazing was the price of the auction's highest single lot, an 8-escudos 1724 gold piece of Spain's King Luis I. Expected to bring 75,000 Swiss francs, it was hammered down for 240,000 Swiss francs. With the addition of the 10 percent buyer's fee charged on every item, its cost came to 264,000 Swiss francs, or approximately $105,600 at the 2.5-to-1 exchange rate then in effect.
