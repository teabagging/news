In different cases, judges found that regulators overstepped their authority by reneging on promises to buyers of troubled savings and loans, by pushing healthy banks into insolvency, or by illegally trying to squeeze millions of dollars from owners of failed financial institutions.    Only a score of such lawsuits have been brought against the Government -- a minuscule number compared with the thousands of failed banks and savings and loans seized by regulators each year -- and many rulings are being appealed. But the trend has been against the Government, and some think it points to a disturbing pattern of regulators trying to reduce the cost of Federal bailouts at the expense of the law.      The validity of that interpretation, however, is still a matter of debate.   Rosemary Stewart, a lawyer with Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in Washington and former director of enforcement for the Office of Thrift Supervision, thinks the courts have recognized that regulators \\"are going too far.\\"   \\"In a vengence mentality after the savings and loan crisis,\\" she said, \\"the Government is trying to get everything it possibly can.\\"    But Alfred J. T. Byrne, general counsel of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation, feels the court decisions \\"reflect either a misunderstanding or a misapplication of the new law, or both.\\"    \\"We do not draw any conclusion that there is a tide flowing against the Government agencies,\\" he said.    No one contests the power of regulators to seize assets of insolvent banks and savings and loans in order to protect depositors' money. But several cases turn on interpretations of the savings and loan industry bailout legislation enacted by Congress in August 1989.    Two cases test the retroactive application of that law. They involve the seizure by regulators in March 1989 of several healthy Texas banks after their parent banks, MBank in Dallas and the Texas American Bank in Fort Worth, became insolvent.   Regulators pushed more than a dozen healthy subsidiary banks of the two companies into insolvency by failing to fully repay loans that the subsidiary banks made to the parents. Two courts have said that the subsidiaries are owed full payment under then-prevailing banking laws, but the Government is appealing on the ground that the 1989 bailout law permited only partial repayment.    The F.D.I.C. has since lobbied successfully to have the 1989 bailout law permit unequal payments to creditors of failed banks.    In another group of cases, regulators' attempts to abrogate concessions given to entice investors to buy failing savings and loans have been challenged. Eight of these cases have gone against the Government, four have gone in its favor and, in two others, the court said it had no jurisdiction.    The Government has lost three other cases that involved attempts by regulators to collect money from owners of failed savings and loans by forcing them to put up new capital after institutions were declared insolvent.    The 1989 bailout law is also being questioned in a group of cases involving concessions given by regulators to buyers of troubled savings and loans before the law's enactment. Regulators contend that the new law permits them to disregard these concessions, which are generally forbearances allowing newly acquired savings and loans to operate with lower capital requirements or more liberal lending policies than permitted by law.    One of the best known in this group of cases involves Far West Federal Bank, a Portland, Ore., savings and loan that regulators sold to investors in 1987. In return for investing some $27 million of capital, the Government gave the new investors 10 years to meet capital requirements and approved a liberal lending policy.    But with the 1989 bailout law, regulators told Far West that it was out of compliance with the law and that its owners faced daily fines of up to $1 million. Far West quickly complied, but as a result began losing money","excerpt":"officers and depositors fled and its balance sheet shrank.   Far West's owners now say the Government can take the institution back -- they just want their $27 million returned, along with $100 million in damages. United States District Judge Owen M. Panner agreed, ruling that regulators violated Fifth Amendment guarantees against illegal seizure of property and that their action was \\"economic suicide\\" for Far West.\\" Damages have yet to be set.     A final batch of rulings against the Government involves attempts by regulators to collect money by enforcing capital requirements after a savings and loan failed. One leading case involves a Texas company named Tetco, which in 1983 bought a Texas savings and loan in San Antonio called the Bexar Savings Association. To get deposit insurance, Tetco agreed to certain capital levels and to add more when necessary. Over time, Tetco sunk some $25 million into Bexar.    Bexar, however, suffered losses and was declared insolvent and seized by regulators in February 1989, wiping out Tetco's investment. The Government then sued Tetco for $558 million -- the amount needed for Bexar to meet its capital requirements if it were still alive. But United States District Judge Lucius D. Bunton in San Antonio dismissed the Government's claim, as did judges in two similar cases elsewhere.
