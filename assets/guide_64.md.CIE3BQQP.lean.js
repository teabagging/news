The next time the earth's giant tectonic plates slip a few yards, both people and property may be at far greater risk.   By Government estimates, a quake hitting the wrong place at the wrong time of day could kill up to 95,000 and leave a $100 billion cleanup bill. Los Angeles and San Francisco are prime targets, of course. But the peril is hardly confined to California: the Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that Seattle, Salt Lake City, Memphis and Charleston, S.C., are also at \\"major\\" risk.     If the Big One hits -- make that \\"when\\" it hits -- who will pay? Even in California, relatively few property owners are covered by earthquake insurance. But Robert E. Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution, estimates that damage from quake-related fires and injuries could still result in up to $50 billion in insurance claims. Honoring these claims, he argues, could severely deplete insurers' reserves, driving some into bankruptcy and turning others into risk-taking zombies.   Mr. Litan's preferred fix, described in the latest edition of The Brookings Review: mandatory Federal earthquake insurance, with premiums set to cover actuarial risks.   Just one California property owner in four carries earthquake insurance","excerpt":"nationwide, the figure is below one in 20. If such insurance is available and most people choose not to buy it, why should the Government insist?   One reason, Mr. Litan suggests, is that the private market overprices the product. Only those atgreatest risk currently buy coverage, and insurers are apparently unwilling or unable to attract lower-risk customers with lower premiums.    Another reason is that owners have insufficient incentives to pay for insurance because the Federal Government stands ready to reimburse them for a portion of their losses. American taxpayers, Mr. Litan reckons, shelled out $17 each for disaster relief in last year's San Francisco quake.   Uncle Sam could play hardball, giving legal notice that in the future the Treasury would help only those who help themselves. But the threat would probably not be credible: Americans are no more likely to deny relief to uninsured victims of an earthquake than they are to deny medical care to injured motorcylists who did not wear helmets.    A third and perhaps most compelling reason is that casualty insurers are poorly geared to bear the earthquake risks already on their books. A not unlikely $50 billion hit, Mr. Litan calculates, would drain the industry of about 40 percent of total reserves. Some insurers would go bankrupt; others would be forced to raise rates sharply to meetregulatory requirements.   The process might be manageable in theory, but would certainly be problematic in practice. Mr. Litan, a longtime analyst of the savings and loan debacle, worries that earthquake losses would be injurious to the casualty insurers' financial health, much the way the interest rate squeeze of the early 1980's started savings and loan associations down the path to collective ruin.   When faced with the alternative of double-digit premium increases, he believes, vote-conscious regulators might allow insurance companies to operate with low (or negative) net worths. And once insurers were deep in a financial hole, they would have powerful incentives to generate premium revenues by taking ever greater chances.      Mr. Litan favors legislation that would effectively require anyone who wanted a home mortgage to buy Federal earthquake coverage. The bill, sponsored by Representative Al Swift, a Washington Democrat, and David Dreier, a California Republican, would set premiums according to actuarial risk. Buildings designed or modified to minimize quake damage would get a break on rates.    The average premium in California for a no-deductible policy, Mr. Litan believes, would run between $104 and $194. In Memphis and Charleston, the same coverage would run from $15 to $28.    Federal earthquake insurance would still leave private insurers with enormous exposure to quake-related claims for fire, disability and death losses. The Swift-Dreier bill would cover the gap with Federal reinsurance, giving private insurers years to spread the costs across their premium base.   Federal involvement is no panacea. If Washington's record in insuring farm crops is a precedent, setting premiums at actuarily sound levels would prove very difficult. But one way or another, Mr. Litan argues, Washington is going to bear a lot of the cost of the Big One. Any step that forces property owners to protect themselves is probably a step in the right direction.

In ''New York'' (Little, Brown), an anthology compiled by Mike Marqusee and Bill Harris, E. B. White describes New York as seen by the native, the commuter, and the settler.   There are roughly three New Yorks. There is, first, the New York of the man or woman who was born here, who takes the city for granted and accepts its size and its turbulence as natural and inevitable. Second, there is the New York of the commuter - the city that is devoured by locusts each day and spat out each night. Third, there is the New York of the person who was born somewhere else and came to New York in quest of something. Of these three trembling cities the greatest is the last - the city of final destination, the city that is a goal. It is this third city that accounts for New York's high-strung disposition, its poetical deportment, its dedication to the arts, and its incomparable achievements. Commuters give the city its tidal restlessness","excerpt":"natives give it solidity and continuity; but the settlers give it passion. And whether it is a father arriving from Italy to set up a small grocery store in a slum, or a young girl arriving from a small town in Mississippi to escape the indignity of being observed by her neighbors, or a boy arriving from the Corn Belt with a manuscript in his suitcase and a pain in his heart, it makes no difference: each embraces New York with the intense excitement of first love, each absorbs New York with the fresh eyes of an adventurer, each generates heat and light to dwarf the Consolidated Edison Company.

Dire claims of Soviet conventional strength must not be allowed to prevent the United States from engaging in arms control that could reduce nuclear weapons, save money and stabilize the nuclear balance.   While the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a whole has consistently outspent the Warsaw Pact on defense since 1965, the prevailing view of the military balance nonetheless is that unequivocally the Warsaw Pact is superior at the conventional-warfare level.

The Butte, as many refer to it, offers a combination of laidback lifestyle, abundant ski terrain at both resort and backcountry, and rugged beauty that perennially attracts some of Colorado's most soulful ski bums.   CINDY HIRSCHFELD    Friday    4 p.m.  1 -- A Walk Through Time    Step into the past, literally, at the Crested Butte Mountain Heritage Museum (331 Elk Avenue, 970-349-1880), in a building from 1883 that housed a blacksmith shop, then a hardware store and a gas station. Portraits of early Butte residents -- many of Croatian and Slovenian descent -- line the back wall, revealing the often hardscrabble character of those who kept the town going before the fading mining industry was eclipsed by tourism and skiing. The backroom ($3 admission) includes exhibits on daily life in the mining era and the evolution of skiing, as well as the Mountain Biking Hall of Fame. Later, as you amble past the town's vibrant Victorian houses and false-facaded storefronts, stop in at Milky Way (310 Elk Avenue, 970-349-2107) for offbeat gifts and eclectic clothing for women and infants","excerpt":"Natural Butte (309 Sixth Street, 970-349-7775) for custom skin potions that counter the drying effects of the high altitude; and the Alpineer (419 Sixth Street, 970-349-5210), which is chock-a-block with ski wear and gear from hardcore brands like Marmot, Mountain Hardwear and Cloudveil. At the Rijks Family Gallery (310 Second Street, 970-349-5289), you can view largescale tableaux (starting at $1,600) by the local plein-air painter Shaun Horne, whom you might even spot at his easel somewhere in town; his smaller paintings run $250 to $450.    8:15 p.m.  2 -- Mining for Morsels    Crested Butte's number of excellent restaurants is disproportionate to its modest population of about 1,600. One of the standard bearers is the petite Soup√ßon (127A Elk Avenue, 970-349-5448), nestled in a renovated miner's log cabin from the early 1900's. Scott Greene, the chef and owner, frequently changes the French/American menu; you might start with Hudson Valley foie gras accompanied by butternut squash prepared three ways ($17), followed by perfectly crisped duck with apricot glaze ($26). Then while the snowflakes pile up outside, you'll be cozily tucking into a velvety cr√®me br√ªl√©e ($9). Reservations are a must for the two nightly seatings.    Saturday    9 a.m.  3 -- Mountain Mettle    Ride one of the free shuttle buses (colorfully decorated by local artists) the three miles to Mount Crested Butte, where the 1,125 acres and 121 trails of the Crested Butte ski area await. In 2004, new owners bought the resort and embarked on a multiyear, $200 million capital improvement project that has breathed new life into the mountain and put Crested Butte back on the ski tourist radar. The double-black-diamond Extreme Limits, 548 acres of vertiginous drop-offs, burly rock outcroppings and wasp-waisted chutes, encompasses some of the mountain's best-known terrain; the U.S. Extreme Freeskiing Championships are held here every February. If your skiing skills are up to the challenge, take a guided tour of the area ($30 a person, 970-349-2252). Or test your relationship with gravity on Rambo, said to be the steepest-cut ski run in North America, at up to 59 degrees in pitch. More than half of Crested Butte's groomed trails, however, are rated intermediate. If fast cruising is your style, there are buffed runs like International and Upper Keystone, off the Silver Queen Express lift. A one-day lift ticket is $69 (800-544-8448, www.skicb.com).    3:30 p.m.  4 -- Apr√®s at the Avalanche    At the slopeside Avalanche Bar & Grill (433 Emmons Road, 970-349-7195), pull up a stool to the fire pit and order a hot buttered rum ($4). The locals don't mind that the d√©cor hasn't seemed to change in 20 years; they're too busy recounting their epic runs in Spellbound Bowl.    4:30 p.m.  5 -- Nice Ice    You can find on-mountain dinners at many ski resorts; few, however, give you the opportunity to ski down afterward. The Last Tracks dinner (970-349-2211 for reservations) begins with a ride up the Red Lady Express lift and a ski (or snowshoe) to the outdoor Ice Bar (970-349-2275), which is indeed made of sculptured ice blocks. Order a Pomotini ($13), a richly crimson martini made with fresh pomegranate juice, from the fur-clad barkeeper. Then head into the rustic wood A-frame for a five-course meal ($69); entr√©es may include medallions of beef tenderloin in brandied shiitake mushroom sauce or Pacific salmon with a ginger demi-glac√©. After dinner the real fun begins as you don headlamps to make your way down the mountain with the help of guides.    9 p.m.  6 -- Hip to Hippie    Lobar (303 Elk Avenue, 970-349-0480), a lounge/sushi restaurant that opened in November, adds a hipster element to Crested Butte's traditionally downscale bar scene (though its unprecedented $100 cover on New Year's Eve turned heads). Sink into one of the black microsuede sectional sofas and sip a Chaitini (Bacardi, green chai tea and Godiva white chocolate liqueur, $9) while you consider the pros and cons of progress in the Butte. For a study in contrasts, pop into Kochevar's (127 Elk Avenue, 970-349-6745), one of Crested Butte's oldest bars (Butch Cassidy allegedly left his gun here when scurrying out the back door to avoid capture) for a round of pool and a bottle of Budweiser ($2.50). Close out your night at Eldo (215 Elk Avenue, 970-349-6125), an upstairs brew pub that also plays host to the sort of up-and-coming roots rock/funk/jam bands that mountain folk love to groove and twirl to ($3 to $10 cover).    Sunday    8 a.m.  7 -- Latkes and Lattes    At Izzy's (on an alley off Elk Avenue, behind the post office, 970-349-5630), squeezed into a former storefront barely wider than a train car, load up on hearty breakfast latkes (eggs and cheese served on a potato latke, $3.95) or a helping of saucer-size blueberry cornmeal pancakes ($5.50). Accompany it with a jump-starting latte ($3.25) made with coffee from Camp 4, a local coffee roaster and coffeehouse.    9 a.m.  8 -- The Backcountry Beckons    Head out with a guide from the Crested Butte Nordic Center (620 Second Street, 970-349-1707; www.cbnordic.org) for a half-day ski or snowshoe tour in the nearby Gunnison National Forest ($50 a person, including rental equipment and transportation). You might kick and glide up Washington Gulch, once a gold-mining hotbed, or take a longer trip to visit the former silver mining town of Gothic (winter population: 5), with its stunning views of the high peaks that rise sentrylike over the valley. If you prefer to explore solo, the Nordic Center grooms 50 kilometers (31 miles) of winding trails just a snowball's throw from town ($12 to $20 for rental snowshoes or skis; $14 for a trail pass). Relive childhood Olympic dreams at the center's free outdoor skating rink (skate rental, $6) or experience the thrill of flying face first through the snow on the groomed sledding hill (sled rental, $5).    THE BASICS    Ski Town Without All the Trimmings       Daily flights from Denver, as well as nonstop flights from Dallas in winter, arrive at the regional airport about 30 miles from Crested Butte. Alpine Express (800-822-4844) offers shuttle service to and from the airport ($53 round trip). The next closest airport with commercial flights is in Montrose, 96 miles away. Crested Butte is about a four-and-a-half-hour drive southwest of Denver.     The 19-room Elk Mountain Lodge (129 Gothic Avenue, 800-374-6521; www.elkmountainlodge.net), two blocks off Elk Avenue, was built as a boarding house for miners in 1919. Today it's a relaxed, homey inn, with the requisite reputed (but rarely sighted) ghost. Rooms range from $120 to $160, including breakfast.     The Crested Butte Club Boutique Inn & Spa (512 Second Street, 800-815-2582; www.crestedbutteclub.com), a former bar and brothel, now has nine luxurious suites, each with jetted tubs and gas fireplaces. Room rates are $130 to $320. Lodging and lift packages are also available.     At the base of the ski area, the Grand Lodge Crested Butte is the resort's largest and only full-service hotel (6 Emmons Loop, 888-823-4446; www.grandlodgecrestedbutte.com). Accommodations include hotel rooms and two-room suites with kitchenettes. Rooms are $89 to $259; suites are $209 to $319. 36 Hours in Crested Butte, Colo."},{"year":"1938","title":"Dies in poverty WOMAN, 65, SUCCUMBS IN 'MEANEST' FLAT","excerpt":"Natural Causes, Says Doctor; Husband Suspects Hanger"},{"year":"1964","title":"A production agreement between Prometheus Pictures, an independent company headed by Jack Garfein, and Embassy Pictures, of which Joseph E.

All undergraduates must now take one course that examines a non-European culture, a second that addresses issues of race, religion and ethnicity in America and a third that explores issues of gender roles and relationships.   Left intact were existing requirements that students take at least one course each in the mathematical sciences","excerpt":"natural sciences; technology and applied sciences; philosophical, social and religious thought; literature and the fine arts. Though the university had previously required students to take a course each in the social sciences and behavioral sciences, it combined these two categories into a single requirement.   \\"Like the four basic food groups, to have a balanced intellectual diet you should have a dish from each of these,\\" said Peter Duus, a history professor who headed the Undergraduate Studies Committee when it oversaw the curriculum changes.   In part, say faculty members, those changes came about as an acknowledgment of the diversity of Stanford's own student body. Of this year's 1,600 freshmen, 45 percent are Asian, black, Hispanic or American Indian. But in broader terms, the revisions reflect the university's changing view of how best to prepare students for the challenges of today's world.   \\"Basic to the general education of an informed citizen of the nation there has to be an understanding of the racial, ethnic and religious diversity of our society,\\" said Albert Camarillo, a history professor and associate dean of undergraduate studies in the School of Arts and Sciences. \\"That is the basic idea.\\"   But unlike many colleges, Stanford does not require students to take the same set of courses. To satisfy the world culture requirement, for example, students can choose from among some 30 courses. One Stanford graduate might walk away with an understanding of Zen Buddhism, while another will have a grasp of the contemporary history of Iran.   \\"You could probably find under any one area that students will take one of five or six courses,\\" Professor Duus said. \\"But if you look at a student's transcripts, the only course they will have in common is 'Culture, Ideas and Values.' \\"   What is lost in the absence of a shared core of classes, said Carol Schneider, executive vice president of the American Association of Colleges in Washington, is discussion outside the classroom among faculty members and students of the ideas they would all be studying.

Occupying the grand ground-floor space in Macy's flagship store on Herald Square, the Flower Show, which opened this week and continues through April 13, is one of the great seasonal landmarks of New York City. Like the Christmas  tree at Rockefeller Center, or Times Square on New Year's Eve, the Flower Show proves that the city's vitality depends as much on transient events as on the buildings around them.         Central Park, of course, is irreplaceable.  It's a durable, reliable escape from the pressures of urban life. But the Macy's Flower Show is also one of a kind. Like flowers, like spring, it has the charm of evanescence.

The boy you mention is exactly the sort who once would have said, \\"Your mother wears army boots.\\" He would not have said it in front of you, however, because he believed that you knew who was naughty and nice.   The world they live in has changed plenty. Master Mall probably learned that word at home. A lot of us moms are more loose in our language than in the days when my mother once said \\"Oh, hell!\\" -- she probably had just broken her toe at the time -- and then clapped her hand over her mouth.    Our children's speech is anatomically correct, which seems like a good idea until the moment, in a crowded restaurant, when a 2-year-old announces stereophonically, \\"Grandmom, I have a penis!\\"    They inhabit a far harsher place than the world in which I waited for you each year. Five million of them under the age of 6 are living in poverty, which means that their toys may come via some church collection program rather than the traditional chimney route.    Fifty years ago, teachers said their top discipline problems were talking, chewing gum, making noise and running in the halls. The current list, by contrast, sounds like a cross between a rap sheet and the seven deadly sins: drug abuse, absenteeism, alcohol abuse, vandalism, assault, teen-age pregnancy, suicide, gang warfare, rape and arson.    But let's not fall prey to good-old-daysism. Let's not pretend that none of the children you visited 50 years ago had abusive parents or empty stomachs. Let's not pretend that the world of Bedford Falls was perfect. I grew up safe, secure and insulated in a suburb in which a Protestant was a rarity and a black family an impossibility. At this holiday season, my kids consider it one of my great shortcomings that I am ignorant of how to spin a dreidel.    This is a good thing.   They grow up faster, Santa. Too many of the Virginias of the world have babies when they are still babies themselves. Too many of them equate maturity with cynicism, and hope with disappointment.    But there is a part of many of them, even some of the most superficially sophisticated or the most deeply scarred, that accounts for the continuing existence of you in a world that seems at odds with everything you stand for. It is that sense of infinite possibility, the genuine \\"Wow!\\" It is that sense that the blinds are not yet drawn between the windows of their eyes and the houses of their hearts.    The preternatural maturity we see in so many of them comes from us adults. It is our response to raising them in a world in which people die from sex and kill for pennies. It is to protect ourselves, to trade their innocence for street smarts for our own sake.    The Virginias of the world will tell you they want a Madonna cordless microphone and a pair of hoop earrings. But it is amazing how many of them still sleep with a tattered fur thing, part bear, part bunny. You may be conscious of how many of them no longer believe. I marvel at how many of them do.    I marvel at the pain it causes even the toughest customers to see beneath your beard and discover you are only a man in costume. It will be many, many years before some of them understand that you are a stand-in for what is best within themselves.   Those are the Virginias who grow wise but never weary. My New Year's resolution is to try to be one of them.  May your days be merry and bright, ANNA QUINDLEN$!
