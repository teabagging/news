As the procrustean bed of Romanticism, the very salt of the musical earth, the Nine are considered the backbone of any serious record collection. From a marketing point of view, they form an ideal product. Unlike Brahms's four symphonies, of which there are too few to give the buyer the thrill of purchasing a really substantial chunk of history, or Mahler's 10 (if one includes, as Kubelik and Haitink have, the unfinished 10th), which are simply too long to yield a manageable package, and still debatable as to musical value, Beethoven's nine symphonies strike the happy balance of aggregate length and unequivocal respectability. Like complete editions of Shakespeare, therefore, The Nine are released in boxed sets conspicuous for their dignity - sober gilt lettering on the outside, cover embellishment usually incorporating a suitable portrait of the composer or a soulful one of the maestro in question, and a substantial book of essays within.

Opera     ''DIE FLEDERMAUS,'' Metropolitan Opera. The Met's 1986 production by Otto Schenk is back with a new book and English dialogue by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Because this version retains the original arias, sung in German, and therefore the characterizations, relationships and plot elements set forth in the original version, Ms. Comden and Mr. Green cannot stray too far. But by transforming Dr. Falke into Freud, and reconsidering the finale -- Frosch's drunken scene is replaced with a comical play-within-an-opera -- they have freshened up the work considerably. Neil Rosenshein, Pamela Coburn and Jochen Kowalski lead the cast, and Patrick Summers conducts stylishly. Tomorrow at 8 P.M., Metropolitan Opera, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets, $98 and $160 (Allan Kozinn).     ''KATYA KABANOVA,'' Metropolitan Opera. The Met has taken its critical lumps for its handling of standard repertory this season, but here it does something fine indeed on the periphery, bringing back Jonathan Miller's understated production of a Janacek gem, from 1991. Catherine Malfitano proves a fine choice for the title role","excerpt":"Katarina Karneus shines as her confidante Varvara, and Charles Mackerras conducts knowingly. Unfortunately, it may be all too easy to find a seat, since everyone seems on board for a fascinating adventure but the audience. Tomorrow at 1:30 P.M., Metropolitan Opera, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $80 to $210 (James R. Oestreich).     ''LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR,'' Metropolitan Opera. The excellent young American coloratura soprano Elizabeth Futral makes her Met debut this weekend in the touchstone title role of this Donizetti opera. Unfortunately, her debut comes in the company's inept, clueless and scenically dreary new production of the work. But perhaps Ms. Futral's freshness will make a difference. Three other singers are new to the cast: the baritone Anthony Michaels-Moore as Enrico, the tenor Gregory Turay as Arturo and the veteran bass Paul Plishka as Raimondo. The ardent tenor Ramon Vargas returns as Edgardo. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $26 to $160 (Anthony Tommasini).     THE MANHATTAN SCHOOL OF MUSIC OPERA THEATER. In a collaboration with the National Opera Association, which is having its annual conference in New York this weekend, the Manhattan School of Music Opera Theater is presenting two new works. One is the New York premiere of Milton Granger's ''Talk Opera,'' a parody of television talk shows; the guests are Gilda, the Duke and Rigoletto; the topic, ''My Father Works for My Boyfriend.'' The second is a premiere of Philip Hagemann's ''Paris and Oenone,'' the story of a Trojan prince, a nymph and some difficult choices. Sunday at 2:30 P.M., the Manhattan School of Music, 122d Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (212) 749-2802, extension 428. Tickets: $20, $10 for students and the elderly (Kozinn).     ''RUDDIGORE,'' the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players. Gilbert and Sullivan's most overlooked operetta may be this sendup of the Gothic horror story. The plot is driven by a wonderful conceit: a curse compels each baronet of Ruddigore to commit a daily crime. But Sir Despard Murgatroyd, having glumly fulfilled his obligation, reforms himself and marries the good, but mad Margaret. Complications ensue, of course, but all ends happily, of course. The music is inventive, wickedly funny and even, at times, dramatically compelling. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 P.M.; Sunday at 3 P.M., Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $25 to $45; Symphony Space members: $20 to $40 (Tommasini).     Classical Music     AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA. To end his tenure as music director of the orchestra he helped start in 1975, Dennis Russell Davies is offering an 11-concert retrospective, ''20th-Century Snapshots,'' which is scheduled to run through 2001. The first thematic installment, ''The Gershwin Circle,'' includes Gershwin's Second Rhapsody, as well as the 1936 Piano Concerto by Oscar Levant, Gershwin's friend and early interpreter, and a previously unperformed piano concerto by the jazz composer Vernon Duke. Ravel's Concerto for the Left Hand closes the program; Gershwin sought Ravel as a teacher, but Ravel learned much from Gershwin about symphonic jazz hybrids. The soloists are Leon Bates, Scott Dunn, Alan Feinberg and Ursula Oppens. Sunday at 3 P.M., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $15 to $45 (Kozinn).     BARGEMUSIC. This barge floating on the East River is always one of the most attractive places in the city to hear chamber music, and as the holidays fade in memory, its homey intimacy is sure to revive flagging spirits. As usual, however, there is nothing fluffy about the program, which presents Melvin Chen, a pianist, in Ravel's ''Tombeau de Couperin'';  Jessie Mills, a violinist, and Mr. Chen in Beethoven's ''Spring'' Sonata, and Ms. Mills, Mr. Chen and Fred Sherry, a cellist, in Mendelssohn's Trio No. 2. Sunday at 4 P.M., Bargemusic, under the Brooklyn Bridge in Brooklyn, (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $23; $20 for the elderly; $15 for students (Oestreich).     A CELEBRATION SERVICE. A new work by Meredith Monk promises to ''transcend the divide between theatrical performance and worship service,'' incorporating writings from Hasidic, Zen, Christian, African and Chinese traditions. Ms. Monk performs with her vocal ensemble. Tonight through Sunday night at 8:30, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $20 (Paul Griffiths).     GUARNERI STRING QUARTET. This group  will celebrate its 35th anniversary this year. Too often these days, however, the members of this once-stellar ensemble sound as if they would rather be doing anything but playing together. But intimate settings can bring out the best in chamber musicians, and the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium at the Metropolitan Museum is an ideal place to perform. The program includes works by Arriaga, Dvorak and Grieg. Tomorrow at 8 P.M., Metropolitan Museum of Art, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710. Tickets: $30 (Tommasini).     RUTH LAREDO. The resourceful pianist Ruth Laredo is an intelligent and articulate musician. So she is likely to have something interesting to say when she discusses three works of Beethoven before playing them in a recital at the Metropolitan Museum as part of its Concerts with Commentary series. The program includes two sonatas: the bracing early Sonata No. 3 in C major, the stormy ''Appassionata,'' as well as ''Fur Elise,'' a work every piano student learns. Clearly Ms. Laredo feels this miniature is worthy of a closer look. Tonight at 7, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 Tickets: $25; the performance is sold out, but returned tickets may be available (Tommasini).     NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY. Zdenek Macal and the New Jersey Symphony begin ''The Symphonic Wagner,'' an unusual three-week Wagner festival offering the four operas of the ''Ring'' cycle in orchestral syntheses. To historic efforts by the conductors Anton Seidl and Leopold Stokowski, Mr. Macal adds arrangements of his own, in this case, his condensation of ''Die Walkure,'' with contributions from Jeannine Altmeyer, a soprano, and Clayton Brainerd, a baritone. Joseph Horowitz, the festival consultant, gives a preconcert lecture, ''Wagner as Father and Daughter,'' at 6:45 P.M. Tonight at 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (800) 255-3476. Tickets: $12 to $49 (Oestreich).     RUSSIAN CHAMBER CHORUS OF NEW YORK. Even before the musical glories of the Russian Orthodox Church came into greater prominence in recent years, this fine chorus, directed by Nikolai Kachanov, did invaluable work in familiarizing New Yorkers with the repertory. Here, just slightly after the fact, it celebrates ''A Russian Christmas,'' mixing  Slavic sacred music by Bortniansky and others with carols arranged partly by Mr. Kachanov, and peasant songs. Sunday at 4 P.M., Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 1071 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 928-1402. Tickets are available only at the door: $15; $10 for students and the elderly (Oestreich).     SEQUITUR. This inventive vocal and instrumental ensemble that specializes in new music has assembled a collection of short songs on interesting subjects, all of them world or American premieres. Among the 16 songs in the group's ''Songs of Sex and Solitude'' cabaret are Thomas Ades's ''Life Story,'' an entertaining setting of a Tennessee Williams text; Brecht settings by Hans Eisler and Dominic Muldowney; and most topically, Richard Adams's ''An Affair Under Oath,'' with a text drawn from the work of Kenneth W. Starr.  Sunday at 8 P.M., the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Tickets: $15 (Kozinn).     ROBERT STARER 75TH BIRTHDAY CONCERT. Mr. Starer's noble and continuing career is celebrated by musicians who have identified themselves with his work. Justin Kolb plays six piano pieces dating from 1946 to 1998. Danielle Woerner sings ''Images of Man,'' a new song cycle to texts from William Blake. Other participants include the flutist Marcia Gates and Innisfree, a Hudson Valley piano trio. Sunday at 3 P.M., Christ and St. Stephen's Church, 120 West 69th Street, Manhattan, (212) 787-2755.Tickets: $10; students free (Griffiths).        Dance     ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT FESTIVAL. This annual showcase of up-and-coming choreographic talents features three groups this weekend. Tonight at 8: Crossing several stylistic borders, the Sean Curran Company offers a prayer of thanks to the gods of the dance in the Indian Bharata Natyam style and takes a witty look at Irish step-dancing. Tomorrow night at 8: Inspired by both modern dance and the virtuosity of trapeze artists, the Lisa Giobbi Movement Theater makes dancing look like flying. Sunday at 2 and 7:30 P.M.: The Kevin Wynn Collection brings its high-voltage intensity to themes ranging from this world's pressures and insecurities to the need for spiritual purification. Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $18 for each event (Jack Anderson).     CONTEMPORARY DANCE AND THEATER FROM JAPAN. The opening program of an ambitious four-month series, this sampling of cutting-edge dance and theater from Japan features Uno Man's ''Doc/Co,'' Kota Yamazaki's ''Ampersand/Coconut'' and the theater group op.eklekt in ''Culture Vulture'' and Doug Varone's ''Need.'' It all sounds worth a look, though probably best appreciated by mouse-huggers and the nose-ring set. Tomorrow at 8 P.M., Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 752-3015. Tickets: $20; $16 for students, the elderly and members of Japan Society (Jennifer Dunning).     THE 40 UP PROJECT. Choreography and performing by dance artists in and beyond their 40's. The dancers in this free program include Peggy Baker (tomorrow only), Janis Brenner (Sunday only), Felicia Norton, Jody Oberfelder, Amos Pinhasi and Claire Porter. The choreographers include Zvi Gotheiner, Tere O'Connor, Jennifer Muller and the Wanted: X-Cheerleaders. Tomorrow at 8:30 P.M. and Sunday at 4 P.M. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, just south of Houston Street, (212) 334-7479. Free, but seating is limited (Dunning).     GHOSTCATCHING. This virtual dance installation, created by Bill T. Jones with Paul Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar, offers a look into the possible future of dance, or at least one of its variations. Movements by Mr. Jones, captured through digital technology, are manipulated via a large-screen computer projection of an original virtual dance set to words and music by the choreographer. The installation is accompanied by drawings from the dance. ''Ghostcatching'' runs through Feb. 13. Tuesdays through Fridays from 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. and Saturdays from noon to 5 P.M. Cooper Union School of Art, Arthur A. Houghton Gallery, Seventh Street at Third Avenue, East Village, (212) 353-4200. Admission is free. The installation is on the Internet at www.cooper.edu/art/ghostcatching. (Dunning).     THE HOLY BODY TATTOO. This Vancouver-based multimedia dance company will present its new ''our brief eternity,'' which explores the plight of individuals and their attempts to establish relationships in the frantic pace of the modern machine age. All in one  hour. Tonight through Monday at 8:30 P.M., P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288. Tickets: $15 (Dunning).     SARAH EAST JOHNSON'S ''VOLCANO LOVE.'' Volcanic eruptions and their connections to moving female bodies are explored in ''Volcano Love,'' a dance that draws on fight choreography, circus skills and wrestling. Performed by Sarah East Johnson and three other dancers, ''Volcano Love'' addresses such themes as the resilience and recovery of life on earth after a geological catastrophe. Ms. Johnson's movement is plain. The metaphors promise to be rich. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday night at 7, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793. Tickets: $15 (Dunning).     NOCHE FLAMENCA. A Spanish company that has been part of New York's summer dance season since 1993 lets its theatrical fire melt winter chill in an earthy show, reminiscent of those in Madrid cafes, that traces flamenco to its Andalusian Gypsy roots. Tomorrow at 8 P.M. and Sunday at 7 P.M., Kaye Playhouse, Hunter College, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212) 772-4448. Limited tickets, $30; $26 for members and the elderly; $15 for students  (Anderson).     NRITYAGRAM DANCE ENSEMBLE. Nrityagram means dance village, and it's the name of India's only village established solely to preserve classical Indian dance forms and martial arts. It was founded near Bangalore in 1990. This ensemble from the dance school, which students usually attend for six to eight years, appears in examples of the sensuous and lyrical Odissi style of northeast India. Tonight at 8, Kaye Playhouse, Hunter College, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212) 772-4448. Tickets: $25; $21 for members and the elderly; $15 for students  (Anderson).     ''SWAN LAKE.'' Matthew Bourne's version of this Tchaikovsky classic may not be as spectacular or profound as the 19th-century original, but it is polished entertainment, clever in its choreography and uninhibited in its tender moments. It will make you laugh; it might even make you cry. And despite Mr. Bourne's well-publicized decision to replace the women with men in the corps of swans, it would be a mistake to see this production as a homosexual cult show. Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52d Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 P.M.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 P.M. Tickets: $15 to $75 (Anna Kisselgoff).     YOUNG SOON KIM DANCE COMPANY. Committed to combining elements of American and Asian modern dance, the Young Soon Kim Dance Company will present ''White Wave,'' a program of new and recent works by Korean-born Ms. Kim, and a premiere by Molissa Fenley called ''La Muse Menagere'' after its Milhaud score. ''White Wave'' is the opening program in the ''Sundays @ Three'' low-cost dance preview series at the 92d Street Y. Sunday at 3 P.M. 92d Street Y Harkness Dance Center, 92d Street and Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5553. Tickets: $10 (Dunning).

Mr. Previn's six settings for soprano, symphony orchestra and occasional jazz combo made a pleasant impression when they were first heard a year and a half ago at Carnegie Hall.

WEDDINGS","excerpt":"Kathleen Collier And Eric Benda"},{"year":"1925","title":"The wild horses in \\"Black Cyclone\\" will not have to drag people to the Capitol this week, as the presence of these animals on the screen will undoubtedly make the journey to this theatre a willing and pleasant one. \\"Black Cyclone\\" is an admirable picture which has been directed with studious ingenuity, and although horses are seen in the principal rôles, there is never a dull instant in the narrative, which possesses its full quota of suspense and some delightful incidental comedy.The manner in which the horses have been handled for the different scenes makes one forget that a camera was anywhere near at the time the scenes were photographed. One sees so much that is surprising, when one stops to think it over, that after a while one is so absorbed that it appears to be perfectly natural to witness stallions in the characters of a hero and a villain, a mare as a heroine and a mangy burro filling the comedy rôle.The long shots as well as the medium ones are most compelling. In certain instances one wonders how the producers are ever going to catch the horses. One of the most remarkable sequences is where Rex, the hero stallion, is caught in the quicksands of a shallow river. He struggles vigorously to free himself and he whinnies for help. Then in the captions it is set forth that his legs are numb and useless, and one cannot help but think of a horse in such a dilemma. A cowboy who knows that the cry comes from a horse in trouble hastens in the direction of the sound, and as soon as he finds Rex he bends the animal's head over so as to force him to kick and use his half-paralyzed limbs. Here you have realism, for there is no doubt that the horse is up to his belly in sand, and that he suddenly struggles partly out of the treacherous swamp. The cowboy then cuts a small load of twigs and places them in front of the horse, who eventually climbs out, joyful in the freedom he has regained.Lady, the mare, has been captured by The Killer, a black-eyed pinto who knows every animal in his herd, which he bosses like a villain characterized by Wallace Beery. The Killer keeps his weather eye on the fair Lady, knowing that in the past he had scared Rex away from the herd when that animal was an ungainly colt.So we have the clever Rex enlisting the aid of the cowboy to get Lady back with him, but like Cousin Egbert in \\"Ruggles of Red Gap,\\" Rex will go \\"just so far but no farther.\\" He has never been accustomed to having a man on his back and therefore although he is friendly with the cowboy who saved his life, he tosses the would-be rider to the ground rather than be encumbered. In the end, however, he directs the cowpuncher to the whereabouts of the herd, and while Lady looks on, Rex has a terrible hoof and tooth encounter with The Killer, who seems surprised that this horse, alluded to as an ebony streak in the sunshine, should be able to defeat him.The Killer looks like a real villain with his fierce black eye. Lady flirts as well as any other motion picture heroine, and she captures the audience when she puts her neck over Rex's back.A burro, known as the Pest, furnishes the comedy. He is the clumsiest looking donkey one could imagine, but at the same time an animal for whom one is bound to feel sympathy. He is a Fuzzy Wuzzy specimen, wild and nonchalant, who apparently knows that he is not the handsomest beast in the world, but—means well.Rex's mother is the victim of a rattle-snake. Later Rex has an encounter with a lioness which attacks Lady, and being a motion picture hero he comes out a victor. These sequences are cleverly pictured through double exposure.We are informed that thousands of acres of Nevada's plains and hills supply the background for this picture, which was directed by Frederick Wood Jackman. It is presented by Hal Roach, who also mapped out the story.There are three human participants in this film. They are Guinn Williams, the cowboy","excerpt":"Kathleen Collins, the girl heroine, and Christian Frank, who officiates as the scoundrel. They acquit themselves in sterling fashion.Rex, the so-called wild horse, was seen last year in a film called \\"The King of Wild Horses.\\" He is energetic and handsome, knowing just when to neigh for Lady. We should imagine that this is a film which will please almost everybody.

A3    A Strike at Iraq Election Effort  The American military recently moved into a small town 10 miles south of Falluja, one of the most violent locales in Iraq, to secure it for the coming elections, and the insurgents took all of a day to respond. They fired a rocket that missed the Americans and landed on a nearby playground, killing a 12-year-old boy and wounding eight other children.  A7    In an unusual public rebuke, President Jalal Talabani angrily criticized other Arab states, saying they had insulted Iraq by not sending diplomats to Baghdad and had not sent condolence letters about the stampede last week in which almost 1,000 Shiite pilgrims were killed.

A10    NATIONAL  A16-25    Bush Returns to South Amid Criticism  As criticism raged over the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina, President Bush returned to the Gulf Coast, and Army engineers resealed two levees that had been breached by the storm and cautiously began pumping water out of New Orleans.  A1    At a tan-colored warehouse next to the modest city hall in St. Gabriel, La., refrigerated trucks began bringing what are expected to be thousands of bodies to the temporary mortuary set up to process the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  A1    The Bush administration has been stung by criticism of its handling of the hurricane by anguished Louisiana officials and by nervous Republicans from across the country, but it has one stalwart defender right in the eye of the growing political storm, Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi.  A25    As President Bush and White House officials fanned out across the Gulf Coast in the White House's campaign to deal with criticism that it had failed in managing the storm's aftermath, there was one unexpected face in their crowd: former president Bill Clinton.  A25    Congressional leaders raced to spell out competing plans to help storm victims, offering proposals for emergency health care, housing and economic support, among other measures. Both parties also announced plans to begin hearings into the government's disaster response and into rising oil and gas prices.  A20    Bush's Choice for Chief Justice  President Bush said that he would nominate Judge John G. Roberts Jr., who had been his choice to fill the Supreme Court seat being vacated by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, to succeed William H. Rehnquist as chief justice of the United States.  A1    Georgia Voting Law Contested  Opponents of a new Georgia law requiring voters to show photo identification at the polls are planning a federal court lawsuit challenging the measure, which they fear will lower voter turnout. The bill eliminates the use of formerly accepted forms of voter identification, like Social Security cards, birth certificates or utility bills.

Caught in the middle are a handful of fallen heroes still trying to deal with the emotional repercussions of 9/11.  B1    Fox Station Won't Air Ad  Local television station Fox 5 WNYW, is refusing to run a provocative advertisement promoting a Democratic candidate for Manhattan borough president.

Despite the quaint period costuming, pleasing Technicolor and pre-World War I score, it is still a trifling fable about the tribulations, romantic and otherwise, of a family vacationing in the Catskills, in which the enthusiasm of the cast is superior to its assignment.In attempting to cull comedy out of the proceedings, Director Roy Rowland has leaned heavily on a script in which the situations are occasionally chucklesome but one in which the dialogue is trite. But one can't blame the Robinson family for their adventures. They are all in there trying to make the most of it. Their annual two-week holiday at Kissamee-in-the-Cats-kills starts out uneventfully enough. But no sooner there than Patti, who is 17 and wishes she were 18 so as to be able to wear corsets and be permitted to man hunt, runs up against love in the person of Demi Armendez, a handsome Latin transplanted by some strange geographic twist to the New York highlands. Then there is Melba, Patti's young sister, a brash customer who makes no bones about her feelings towards the innkeeper's callow son. And, there are Mama and Papa who keep discovering that raising nubile daughters and a brace of sons can be a pretty strenuous business.But summer romance and the competition of Phyllis Kirk does not deter Miss Powell from using her soprano to advantage. Since the time is 1913 she is given no 1950 creations but nonetheless does well by such time-tested items as \\"A Heart That Is Free,\\" \\"By the Light of the Silvery Moon,\\" \\"Oceana Roll\\" and \\"That's How I Need You.\\" In addition, a dream sequence—the film's sole inventive bit for this corner's money—provides her with the opportunity of modeling the acme in corsets and other female fripperies, displaying a trim pair of legs and caroling \\"My Hero\\" to her dream man.As that sought-after gent, Ricardo Montalban is allowed his moments of charm, heroics and a chance to dance a climactic tango with his pretty partner. Debbie Reynolds, seen recently as Helen Kane in \\"Three Little Words,\\" is, in this viewer's opinion, the most promising performer in the piece. As Miss Powell's sister who is doggedly intent on snatching the affections of Carleton Carpenter, she delivers a line of songs and dances such as \\"Row, Row, Row\\" and \\"Aba Daba Honeymoon\\" with professional grace and verve. And, as the parents, Louis Calhern and Ann Harding, who apparently have heard of \\"Life With Father\\" to judge by their antics, are lending their brood adequate support. But considering what occurs in \\"Two Weeks With Love,\\" their vacation could develop into an awfully trying stretch.On the stage at the Capitol are \\"Skitch\\" Henderson and his orchestra","excerpt":"Kay Armen; The Dunhills and The Vagabonds.

It bears the title of \\"Racetrack\\" and has the distinction of having been directed by James Cruze.\\"Racetrack\\" is based on a story by J. Walter Rubin and Wells Root. The screen adaptation was made by Walter Lang and Douglas Doty. Although it is scarcely an intriguing tale, it is well staged and Mr. Cruze's direction is highly satisfactory. Leo Carrillo, who appears as Joe Tomasso, a racing gambler, gives a pleasing performance.Joe first is seen at the track. His immaculate attire includes a white derby, of which he is evidently quite proud. His associate is known as Horseface. It happens that Joe has bribed a jockey to pull the favorite, but when the times comes the rider disappoints the reprehensible gambler and brings his horse home first. This is more than slightly disconcerting to Joe, who has wagered something like $6,000 on another entry. Joe and Horseface are dejected, but they are soon successful again.To win sympathy for Joe the authors have him meet in a restaurant a lad named Jackie, who is arrested because he cannot pay for his meal. Joe tells the magistrate that he will look after Jackie, and in course of time the gambler becomes the foster father of the youngster, who has been deserted by his parents. Jackie is eager to become a jockey. He would sooner ride a horse than go to a military academy. Joe consents and Jackie goes into training. Two years go by and Jackie feels that he has a chance to ride a horse called Warrior, but another jockey is chosen. This makes Jackie so jealous that he resorts to a trick which spoils his rival's chance of winning.Jackie's mother puts in appearance just before this. She wishes to have possession of her son, and Joe so arranges that the lad is ruled off the turf for pulling his first mount. It is all rather implausible, but there you are.Besides Mr. Carrillo, there are in the cast Lee Moran, who does fairly well as the individual known as Horseface","excerpt":"Kay Hammond, who is believable as Jackie's mother, and Junior Coghlan, who gives a good portrayal as Jackie.On the surrounding program is a very interesting film about Singapore, and the newsreel subjects include glimpses of President Roosevelt's inauguration.

Largely because of the slump on Wall Street and the downturn in the financial-services industry, leading law firms are in creasingly dismissing lawyers -- a phenomenon virtually unknown until now.    And for the first time in years, there are jitters at law schools about whether jobs will be available -- especially at those firms that start new lawyers at $85,000 a year.   There are now more than 125,000 lawyers licensed in New York State and a majority of them do business in New York City.    Perhaps the best illustration of the industry's troubles is Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, Manhattan's largest firm, which hired away lawyers by the battalion from competitors. Skadden, Arps built a large national practice around its reputation as a premier Wall Street player. Now the firm has stopped hiring lawyers from other firms, frozen associates' pay at last year's levels and, some associates said, begun laying off dozens of junior lawyers. The Boom in Bankruptcy    Yet, there are some positive trends.   The law, more than most industries, finds profits in the hardships of the economy and is able to weather downturns somewhat better than other economic sectors. Litigation, for example, remains largely unaffected.    And bankruptcy practice, once disdained as a second-rate field relegated to has-beens and lower-rate practitioners, is now a hot practice and will likely remain so for some time. The larger bankruptcies, like those of Drexel Burnham Lambert and Eastern Airlines, require teams of lawyers to represent the companies, creditors and shareholders, and the cases can take years to resolve.   And, to the extent that large real estate developers like Donald J. Trump encounter significant difficulties, law firms can count on substantial business in attempting to keep their clients afloat.    Recognizing this, several leading firms, including Willkie, Farr & Gallagher","excerpt":"Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, and O'Melveny & Myers, have taken steps to bolster their bankruptcy practices.

J., June 19.—A compromise on the question of which referee will officiate at the lack Dempsey-Georges Carpentier bout in Jersey City on July 2 seemed likely today in view of further developments in the tangled situation. There was a general clearing of the atmosphere, and both Commissioner Charles Lyons, who said that New Jersey would name the referee or call off the bout, and Manager Jack Kearns, who was equally emphatic on the other side, were less bellicose in their attitude.The arrival of Robert C. Doherty, Chairman of the New Jersey Boxing Commission, helped to calm the troubled waters. Mr. Doherty supports Commissioner Lyons in the stand the latter has taken, but he appears to be willing to listen to reason and to be in a receptive mood for a possible compromise.In a statement today Chairman Doherty repeats Mr. Lyons's threat that the Jersey Commission will stand by its guns and call off the bout if there is \\"any attempt to bulldoze us or go over our heads\\" in the referee matter. \\"While he was making this emphatic statement, however, the Chairman displayed a conciliatory attitude that raised hopes for a compromise settlement of the dispute.From the viewpoint of the many fight fans gathered here at the shore it is rather to be regretted that Tex Rickard did not arrive at the Dempsey camp as expected. In the end the genial promoter is expected to be the diplomat who will settle the controversy to the general satisfaction of all concerned. Until Rickard actually gets into action there is likely to be a series of vocal explosions which will do little more than rock the boat.Boxing Head Conciliatory.The Doherty statement, coming from the Chairman of the New Jersey Boxing Commission, would be a basis for a general belief that the big match might be called off or at least that complications might result if it were not for the general conciliatory attitude displayed by the official.\\"No outsiders in or out of the boxing game can come into New Jersey and tell the Boxing Commission how to run its business,\\" the Chairman said. \\"We have nothing to lose if we halt the championship affair right where it stands today, and that is what we will do if we are threatened or if there is any attempt to bulldoze us or go over our heads.\\"It was when informed of this statement that Kearns lost some of his former belligerent attitude. \\"It is not so much the question as to who is to referee that makes me angry as the fact that I, as manager of the champion, am being ignored entirely,\\" he declared.Boxing men here who know both sides of the referee matter now believe that there will be a compromise man named for the judge of the big fight, perhaps \\"Slim\\" Brennan. The general belief is that the dispute between Kearns and the commission has gone so far that there must be some semblance of yielding by both sides before the matter can be settled. The forecasters say that Kearns will attend some early meeting of the commission prepared to declare that he will not accept Harry Ertle, reported to be the choice of the commission. The Commissioners then are expected to come back with the declaration that they will not name one of the five nominated in the articles of fight agrèement because that would imply dictation. About this time Tex Rickard and the diplomatic Bob Edgren, according to the prophets, will step in and propose some one like Brennan or Danny Sullivan, another Jersey man, and the choice will be made to appear as a general victory for both sides.Edgren May Be Named.It would be no surprise here if Edgren himself were called to act as referee, thus giving the commission the prestige of having appointed a man of general popularity in sports and giving Kearns the satisfaction of having one of the five men named.The Sunday afternoon crowd at the airport today dropped its discussion of the referee matter when Dempsey stepped into the ring with Philadelphia Jack O'Brien, friend of Tony Biddle, millionaire sportsman, and one of the most popular fighters of his day. From the tap of the gong Dempsey and O'Brien went at each other in real battling style and during the one round of the mixup the big crowd spent most of its time on its collective feet cheering for one or the other of the boxers. Although without the headgear worn by the champion and the other boxers, O'Brien waded into Dempsey and there were several swift exchanges of blows, during one of which Philadelphia Jack received a smack in the mouth which drew blood. O'Brien received hearty cheers as he stepped down from the ring.The other best bout of the day was that between Dempsey and Eddie O'Hara, former amateur champion middleweight, which went two rounds. O'Hara swatted Dempsey several times and in return received some jolting blows which sent him half way across the ring. The champion finished off the day with one-round bouts with Jack Renault and Larry Williams, who also drove their blows at Dempsey with all possible steam.1,500 Watch Workout.The crowd, which paid $1 a head for admission, totalled close to 1,500, and filled the temporary stands at the Airport grounds. Charley White was there with his bride, and Mrs. O'Brien accompanied her husband, Philadelphia Jack. Before the afternoon bouts the champion went through his special training stunts in front of the movie cameras, and scores of amateur snapshooters of both sexes took opportunity to secure pictures from the side lines.K. O. Bill Brennan, who is visiting the resort, was among the interested visitors who watched the workout this afternoon and was willing to make comment. \\"I believe that Dempsey will knock Carpentier out before the fourth round,\\" he said. \\"The Frenchman is a boxer while Dempsey is both fighter and boxer. While I don't wish Carpentier any hard luck, I hope that Dempsey wins. Then it will be Jack and I in the Fall, and I hope there will be a new American champion. There won't be any scrap about referee or anything else from my side if Kearns gives me the chance to fight him,\\" Brennan concluded with a smile.

Units of the U.S. Army's First Armored Division, which will be the backbone of the U.S. peacekeeping force in Bosnia, have to spend time practicing in the villages and are scored on how few  of their men get hit by pretend snipers using laser guns.

That no longer seems to be the Administration's approach. The argument now, which Mr. Perry laid out in an  interview, is that this mission is going to be dangerous, and that even with a peace accord there will be some local pockets of opposition -- but it is worth doing because to not go in will lead to more killing in Bosnia, a spreading of the war and a debasing of American leadership.

Age 74 of Heathrow, Florida, died Tuesday, November 18, 2003. Ron is lovingly remembered for his warm smile, hearty chuckle, and sense of humor. A humble and modest man, he rarely mentioned his achievements. His integrity was without question and he was born a leader. Born in Milwaukee, WI. on May 25, 1929, Ron was the second of four sons born to Patrick Fay and Charlotte Welch. All have predeceased him, as well as Jean Reniewicki, his loving wife of 26 years. Formerly President of Wendy's International, the hamburger chain, Ron's character was formed during his 12 years of parochial school. He graduated from Saint John's Cathedral H.S. in Milwaukee, WI. in 1948. He was a member of Annunciation Catholic Church in Altamonte Springs, FL. and Saint Brigid of Kildare in Dublin, OH., where he maintained a second home. Ron was a veteran of the Korean Conflict and fought in the trenches at the battles of Hamburger Hill and Pork Chop Hill, where he was decorated for his service. Ron's impressive career began as a 14-year old busboy in a W.T. Grants department store in Milwaukee, WI. Ron quickly ascended the management ranks and was National Corporate Director of Marketing and Purchasing when the company filed bankruptcy in 1975. While at Grants, he pioneered a purchasing and delivery system that was adopted widely throughout the food service industry. He joined Wendy's in 1976 as a franchisee, but in 1981, he was named President of Wendy's International, overseeing one of the most intensely competitive periods in the industry's history. Under his leadership, Wendy's launched its widely successful ''Where's the Beef'' ad campaign. Ron retired in 1986. In 1990, he returned to the working world as the Operating Partner with Bob Stine, a Wendy's franchisee in Central Florida. The growing franchise was soon a regional leader in sales and operations. Motivating people by example, Ron visited at least one restaurant every day and was well known by managers and crew people alike. Just a few weeks before his death, the partnership was sold to Wendy's International and he retired. Ron was an avid golfer and former member at Tuckaway Country Club, Milwaukee, Indian Hills Country, Club, Long Island, Cavalier Golf Club, Virginia Beach, and Firestone Country Club, Akron. He was a current member of the county club in Heathrow, FL. and the country club at Muirfield Village, in Dublin, OH. While he had three holes in one, his proudest achievement was shooting a birdie on the 18th hole to help win the Pro-Am at the Memorial Tournament in 1985, teaming with John Bench and Tom Kite. Some of Ron's other distinguished golfing partners included the former Presidents, George Bush and Gerald Ford, and Neil Armstrong, along with a host of professional golfers whom he played with in a host of Pro-Am tournaments throughout the country. Ron was well-known for his homey aphorisms: do the ordinary things extraordinarily well","excerpt":"Keep on keepin' on, Kill'em with Kindness; I can only wear one pair of shoes at a time; you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean.

But Mom always comes in with the bogus excuse of \\"Here are some clean socks and underwear, I'll put them in your drawer.\\" As if I can't get my own socks and underwear from the laundry room. But no, she just needs any excuse to come into my room and yell, \\"This room looks like a tornado hit it!\\" As if she has ever seen anything hit \\nby a tornado. And then she's coming back dragging the vacuum cleaner, as if she has the right to vacuum my room! I go, \\"MOM, NEVER VACUUM IN HERE!\\" I got too many important things of life on that floor. Stuff that dropped that I'll need later. And my tarantula, which I swear to God hates my mom so much that the hairs fall off its abdomen, which is what happens to tarantulas when they get freaked, and Mom is always freaking my tarantula with the vacuum. She said I could have a gerbil, so I got a tarantula. Tell me what is the basic difference? I use the same fish tank that leaked all over the dresser and wrecked it, which I had to hear about for 5,000 years because that was her dresser when she was a kid. LIKE IT'S MY FAULT THE FISH TANK LEAKED AND I DIDN'T NOTICE UNTIL ALL THE WATER WAS OUT! WHAT ABOUT MY FISH, MOM, HUH? So that's why the dresser is all warped. It took a while for the water to leak out. I just thought it was evaporating superfast. I thought it was like a freak of the environment of my bedroom. CAN I HELP IT IF IT WAS LEAKING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE DRESSER I NEVER LOOK AT, MOM? And then you'd think that if it was already wrecked she wouldn't care if I put my eyeball stickers on the mirror and the wood, right? A normal person would normally think, It's Already Wrecked So What's the Dif. But she has a total attack and she has another total attack that I put eyeball stickers on my bed, IT IS MY BED BUT SHE HAS A TOTAL ATTACK, because it was her brother's bed or her cousin's bed or someone of her family's bed WHO IS OBVIOUSLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN HER SON WHO JUST WANTS TO PUT HIS EYEBALL STICKERS WHERE HE WANTS EXCEPT HE CAN'T BECAUSE HE LIVES IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP. Same goes for tape and nail holes in the wall. I go, \\"Mom, how am I supposed to put up my posters, then?\\" and she goes, \\"Oh, I'll buy you a bulletin board.\\" THAT BULLETIN BOARD RIGHT THERE THAT I FILLED UP IN THREE SECONDS! I said, Forget it, man, this is boag, I'm using tape and then she has another total attack and makes me sign a Family Contract that when I leave for college I will personally paint my own room and sand down the tape marks or whatever it is you do with tape marks, which I will have to figure out because as you have noticed there is hardly no wall showing. That is my goal. Total posters. Including the ceiling. Oh, that's another thing. You notice the green light bulbs, right? At first when I bought them WITH MY OWN MONEY, MOM, she totally freaked because \\"Green light bulbs, green light bulbs? The neighbors will think you are growing drugs!\\" I go, Mom, what kind of drugs do you grow with green light bulbs? And she freaked and we had to have a family meeting where my dad was even there, which is totally weird because I think the total times my dad has even been in my room is like around zero AND NOW HE GETS A VOTE ON MY LIFE? Mom was freaking because she said it brought the value of the house down because my bedroom used to be in the front where the world could see it so that is how I scored this room that used to be my sister's. It smelled like a girl for around a month, during which I couldn't have no one over, but it was worth it for the green light bulbs. Don't they make you feel so peaceful? Wait. Listen to this song. Isn't it the perfect combination? I want to just listen to my station and lie in the peaceful green light and let my tarantula free. Its name is Dana, for this girl Dana Speers at my school who I swear to God looks just like a tarantula but in a cool way. No one I know knows I named it Dana. They think I named it Boris. It would be embarrassing if people knew. My mom would get all happy. \\"Oh, a girl in my son's life!\\" So if she comes in call it Boris. Actually, I snuck the actual Dana Speers up here to meet Dana Speers the tarantula. Dana Speers is a more interesting girl than normal. You wouldn't even think she's a girl from the way she is. She doesn't make no one nervous.

That and also she might suck up my tarantula. ENDPAPER","excerpt":"Keep Out! (A Boy's Bedroom)"},{"year":"1995","title":"Keep Out. Keep OUT. THIS MEANS YOU. Keep! Out! But Mom always comes in with the bogus excuse of \\"Here are some clean socks and underwear, I'll put them in your drawer.\\" As if I can't get my own socks and underwear from the laundry room. But no, she just needs any excuse to come into my room and yell, \\"This room looks like a tornado hit it!\\" As if she has ever seen anything hit by a tornado. And then she's coming back dragging the vacuum cleaner, as if she has the right to vacuum my room! I go, \\"MOM, NEVER VACUUM IN HERE!\\" I got too many important things of life on that floor. Stuff that dropped that I'll need later. And my tarantula, which I swear to God hates my mom so much that the hairs fall off its abdomen, which is what happens to tarantulas when they get freaked, and Mom is always freaking my tarantula with the vacuum. She said I could have a gerbil, so I got a tarantula. Tell me what is the basic difference? I use the same fish tank that leaked all over the dresser and wrecked it, which  I had to hear about for 5,000 years because that was her dresser when she was a  kid. LIKE IT'S MY FAULT THE FISH TANK LEAKED AND I DIDN'T NOTICE UNTIL ALL THE WATER WAS OUT! WHAT ABOUT MY FISH, MOM, HUH? So that's why the dresser is all warped. It took a while for the water to leak out. I just thought it was evaporating superfast. I thought it was like a freak of the environment of my bedroom. CAN I HELP IT IF IT WAS LEAKING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE DRESSER I NEVER LOOK AT, MOM? And then you'd think that if it was already wrecked she wouldn't care if I put my eyeball stickers on the mirror and the wood, right? A normal person would normally think, It's Already Wrecked So What's the Dif. But she has a total attack and she has another total attack that I put eyeball stickers on my bed, IT IS MY BED BUT SHE HAS A TOTAL ATTACK, because it was her brother's bed or her cousin's bed or someone of her family's bed WHO IS OBVIOUSLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN HER SON WHO JUST WANTS TO PUT HIS EYEBALL STICKERS WHERE HE WANTS EXCEPT HE CAN'T BECAUSE HE LIVES IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP. Same goes for tape and nail holes in the wall. I go, \\"Mom, how am I supposed to put up my posters,  then?\\" and she goes, \\"Oh, I'll buy you a bulletin board.\\" THAT BULLETIN BOARD RIGHT THERE THAT I FILLED UP IN THREE SECONDS! I said, Forget it, man, this is boag, I'm using tape and then she has another total attack and makes me sign a Family Contract that when I leave for college I will personally paint my own room and sand down the tape marks or whatever it is you do with tape marks, which I will have to figure out because as you have noticed there is hardly no wall showing. That is my goal. Total posters. Including the ceiling. Oh, that's  another thing. You notice the green light bulbs, right? At first when I bought them WITH MY OWN MONEY, MOM, she totally freaked because \\"Green light bulbs, green light bulbs? The neighbors will think you are growing drugs!\\" I go, Mom, what kind of drugs do you grow with green light bulbs? And she freaked and we had to have a family meeting where my dad was even there, which is totally weird because I think the total times my dad has even been in my room is like around zero AND NOW HE GETS A VOTE ON MY LIFE? Mom was freaking because she said it brought the value of the house down because my bedroom used to be in the front where the world could see it so that is how I scored this room that used to be my sister's. It smelled like a girl for around a month, during which I couldn't  have no one over, but it was worth it for the green light bulbs. Don't they make you feel so peaceful? Wait. Listen to this song. Isn't it the perfect combination? I want to just listen to my station and lie in the peaceful green light and let my tarantula free. Its name is Dana, for this girl Dana Speers at  my school who I swear to God looks just like a tarantula but in a cool way. No one I know knows I named it Dana. They think I named it Boris. It would be embarrassing if people knew. My mom would get all happy. \\"Oh, a girl in my son's life!\\" So if she comes in call it Boris. Actually, I snuck the actual Dana Speers up here to meet Dana Speers the tarantula. Dana Speers is a more interesting girl than normal. You wouldn't even think she's a girl from the way  she is. She doesn't make no one nervous. I have sat right here and the actual Dana Speers has sat right where you are and we let the tarantula Dana Speers walk from my hand onto her hand, you know, that thing of letting a tarantula walk on you? And it was a trip because no hairs fell off the tarantula Dana Speers's abdomen when we did that. Which shows you what I said about the actual  Dana Speers.

There is no harm in feeding sunflower seeds to birds, in fact grosbeaks, cardinals, chickadees and many other wintering birds thrive on them. The hulls are the problem; rake them up so they do not accumulate on lawns. Do not toss them on compost piles.Sunflowers secrete a chemical toxin harmful to neighboring plants.

It also made a number of airstrikes after promising a 48-hour pause in its air campaign.  A1    President Bush called the Israeli air attack on an apartment building in Qana, Lebanon, that killed more than 50 civilians ''awful'' but continued to resist calling on Israel to accept an immediate cease-fire. A8    Tarek Mitri, left, Lebanon's acting foreign minister, asked the United Nations Security Council to press for an immediate cease-fire in the war with Israel and to order an international inquiry into the Israeli bombing of the southern Lebanese village of Qana that killed dozens of civilians, many of them children.  A8    Iraqis Intensify Rebuke of Israel  Iraqi clerics and officials, including Vice President Adel Abdul-Mahdi, left, delivered their stiffest rebuke yet over the airstrikes on Lebanon, condemning Israel for the civilian casualties, even as shootings, bombings and mass kidnappings continued to plague their nation. A10    Castro Announces Surgery  Fidel Castro temporarily relinquished his presidential powers to his brother Raúl and told Cubans that he had undergone surgery. A6    NATO Takes Afghan Command  NATO, in one of the most difficult tasks of its history, took over command of international forces from the United States in southern Afghanistan, where the fight against the Taliban insurgency has turned more deadly than at any time since American forces ousted the militant Islamist movement in 2001. A10    U.N.

A3    Sri Lankan Truce May Be Over  The Sri Lankan truce between rebels and the government seemed in jeopardy as government forces and rebels clashed over control of an irrigation canal. A rebel leader said the government had started the war, forcing the rebels to retaliate, while the government said its advance was an attempt to secure access to water for 15,000 Sinhalese, who make up the country's ethnic majority. A6    Costly Russian Pipeline Leak  Roughly 11,000 gallons of crude oil leaked from the 2,500-mile-long Druzhba pipeline in Russia, briefly shutting down a major export route and causing prices to spike to about $75 a barrel on world oil markets.

A1    Push for Redeployment  Leading Congressional Democrats have called on President Bush to begin a phased redeployment of troops by the end of this year, and for American forces in Iraq to make a transition to a ''more limited mission.''  A13    Attacker's Parents Apologize  The parents of a Muslim man accused of shooting to death a woman and wounding five other people at a Jewish nonprofit agency last week wrote letters to Jewish groups saying they ''don't want this to be seen as anything but the act of an ill person,'' a lawyer for the family said.

Most nations pledged last year to stop producing industrial chemicals, mainly chlorofluorocarbons, that are believed to weaken the ozone shield.   Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that the ozone layer had been partly depleted in many areas of the world and that at the latitudes of the United States the loss was more than twice what scientists had previously thought -- 4.5 to 5 percent in the last decade. The E.P.A. calculated that this would let enough harmful ultraviolet radiation pass through the atmosphere to cause 12 million more Americans to develop skin cancer in the next 50 years, and 200,000 more of them to die, than if there were no ozone depletion. Earlier estimates had forecast 500,000 new cancer cases and 93,000 additional fatalities over the same period.   William K. Reilly, the agency administrator, called the findings stunning, unexpected, disturbing and full of unexplored implications. He said they made necessary a reappraisal of national and international policy on ozone, and a possible shortening of the timetable for phasing out chlorofluorocarbons, which are used, for example, as refrigerants.
