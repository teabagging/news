And her associates in the house are equally tarnished with aspects of vulgarity.However, they are all essentially moral or have good, excuses for being there. Cut into any one of them with a cliché and you'll find a heart of gold. There's the one who is earning a living for her tuberculous husband and child. There's another who has spent a long time working to support a growing son. Still another, who seems a crass golddigger and a heartless strumpet toward her most adoring client, is really saving money to get her father out of jail.Even the one played by Miss Kyo, who appears utterly brazen at the start, turns out to be the teen-age victim of a comfortable but broken home. When her smug father comes to try to persuade her to abandon her career of vice, she shamelessly attempts to debauch him. That's how cynical she has been made to be.But for all the high moral purpose—they tell us this film was made as propaganda in the campaign to ban legal prostitution in Japan—it does some old-fashioned leering and lip-licking over the girls, and it makes as good a case for prostitution as a relief for unemployment as it makes against.However, it is old-fashioned, sentimental and generally diffuse, with no particular definition being given to anyone. Aiko Mimasu as the mother who eventually goes mad because her son refuses to have anything to do with her when he learns her profession is most clear. Miss Kyo is vivid in appearance, but her character is thin.The late Kenji Mizoguchi, who directed \\"Ugetsu,\\" failed to show as much imagination in this one as in that one.There are English subtitles.

Porter made \\"The Great Train Robbery\\" and started the feature-film era of dramatic motion pictures. Now comes \\"The Great Mail Robbery,\\" at the Hippodrome this week, to show that the subject has not been exhausted in the intervening years.How can it be, as long as new methods and new means of robbery and its resistance continue to develop? Porter's bandits rode horseback and flourished revolvers from their hips. The bad men in the present instance ride to the scene of the hold-up in automobiles, blow up the train with sunken mines, and pepper an armored mail car with machinegun bullets. And they are defeated by Government forces using airplanes and tear gas. Everything is murderously up-to-date.It all makes a crashing melodrama that isn't in the least ashamed of itself. It flaunts its shooting, wrecks and smash-ups in a string of spectacular scenes. Its characters are what they are and do their stuff. There's Dewitt Jennings as an apparently peaceful farmer, Lee Shumway as a supposedly criminal renegate from the marines, Jeanne Morgan as the girl who loves in the face of doubt, Frank Nelson as a comic sergeant of marines, and Theodore Von Eltz as an heroic young lieutenant. All are clear-cut and effective.And audiences still like the old-time melodrama done in an up-to-the-minute way, according to the testimony of those at the Hippodrome yesterday afternoon.In the surrounding bill of vaudeville, Countess Sonia and her company provide a colorful and lively revue, Pat Henning entertains with real versatility, and Ponzini's monkeys are remarkably acrobatic.

Finkelstein took charge of Macy's New York in 1974, the division - and particularly its Herald Square flagship - had been in decline for years. Many people favored retrenchment by closing off part of the world's largest store. Instead Mr. Finkelstein plunged into a five-year, $15 million renovation that turned Macy's into one of the nation's smartest stores and the company overall into a leading department store chain. All this earned Mr. Finkelstein a reputation as a master merchant.         With yesterday's announcement of a $3.6 billion deal to take R. H. Macy & Company private, Mr. Finkelstein, its 60-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, seemed to be adhering to his gambler's credo: To make money, you have to spend money.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease affects on average about one person in a million worldwide each year.

In Britain, the disease may well be transmitted to humans who eat beef from infected cattle -- although so far this is still in the realm of theory. If it turns out that mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, has indeed  leapt across the species barrier to become a variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, an already existing but rare disorder, then there is little doubt how it happened.

Bound together by a common history of official mistreatment, these people have a finely tuned instinct for silence, mutual help and deadpan trickery. When Silas and his friends cross the borders of the law - to hide a friend escaping from a bogus murder charge by turning him into a law-abiding Pakistani (''He works as a speed bump at a parking lot downtown,'' Silas tells inquiring police) or to prevent the farm of an old dead friend from falling to profiteering ''computer farmers'' by razing its house with a pickup truck - he carries us along with him. Not all the stories are funny, though, and some, like ''Strings,'' ''Green Candles'' and ''Nests,'' seem to challenge the limits of human rage, jealousy and sanity. Unsentimentally poignant, full of the energy and drama of folk tales, these marvelous stories go far in dispelling many lingering myths and misconceptions about the North American Indians - none greater, perhaps, than the one that says they have no sense of humor.

Why should a group of Siamese artists attempt to ape Hollywood in a picture about their land? Why should they take a simple story of rivalry between two ancient kings, one a peaceful elephant-lover and the other a martial bully, and dress it up with chases and battles in the manner of an American Western? True, their mounts are pachyderms instead of pintos—and that does make for an interesting variety of spectacle. But why shouldn't a made-in-Siam picture be truly indigenous, played in pantomime, if need be, and as different from Hollywood formula as it could be made?Selah! We've said our say.

A melanoma, of course, can be lethal, but when, as in Sigrid's case, it's caught early (before it spreads), the rate of cure is 93 percent. Since melanoma is related to sun exposure, Sigrid decided to avoid suntanning as much as possible. She vowed to cultivate an \\"interestingly pale\\" look, which was fine for winter. But now that summer's come, and she is commuting to the Hamptons on weekends, she's been talking about her \\"pasty\\" face and \\"doughy\\" thighs. I was worried that going pale was affecting Sigrid's self-esteem. Her inner child happens to be a California girl who used to slather herself with baby oil and iodine to achieve the proper bronzed goddess effect.

This was no witty, irreverent, self-referential romp, but a glum, inward film, shot in chilly black-and-white by a cinematographer (Willy Kurant) new to the Godard universe. The tone is more documentary than drama, perhaps influenced by Mr. Godard's experience shooting ''Montparnasse-Levallois,'' a segment in the omnibus film ''Paris Vu par ,'' with the American cinéma-vérité cameraman Albert Maysles.

Mlle. Bardot is still not in Sarah Bernhardt's class, but it doesn't really matter. A viewer definitely can share in the fun and games enjoyed by our nobly endowed heroine and her confrères.Mlle. Bardot, to put a fine point on it, previously has been exposed to American moviegoers in more than a half-dozen weightless romances that served merely as frames for her astounding figure. Things have not changed too much in \\"La Parisienne.\\" Mlle. Bardot is not over-dressed in this lampoon, either.And she is not over-burdened by a complicated story. As the daughter of none other than the Premier of France, she pines for her father's handsome, girl-chasing aide, Henri Vidal, whose heart is subdivided among a platoon of mistresses.But director Michel Boisrond, who has kept his cast constantly on the go, and the scenarists, who apparently took nothing seriously, including Mlle. Bardot, do not allow this situation to deteriorate. First thing you know she is caught in a compromising position in our hero's bedroom and the honor of the Premier, his designing daughter, the protesting M. Vidal and even the Republic, are preserved by a hasty marriage.Holy wedlock does not deter our hero for long, however, and the enterprising Mlle. Bardot, employing all her obvious charms with reckless abandon in retaliation, has a perfectly pristine affair with a visiting prince in Nice. Jealousy rears its ugly head during this short separation but before one can say \\"Mon Dieu\\" our newlyweds are nuzzling each other again like mad.M. Vidal, who is dressed most of the time, charges about in broadly comic fashion and in the witless frenzy of a man besieged by more than one woman at a time. As the sophisticated prince, who takes a flier (in a jet plane) with our capricious \\"adventuress,\\" Charles Boyer is suave, restrained and properly condescending.Nadia Gray makes a truly regal and understanding mate for her wandering spouse.

After graduating high school, she began a distinguished and extraordinary career in the fashion industry: starting as a swimsuit model at 18, she ultimately worked her way up as the sole designer and V.P. for a company called Majestic Specialties, Inc. There were many awards: Lord and Taylor, 1955","excerpt":"Mademoiselle Magazine in 1957; and the Designer of the Year award in 1961 from Sports Illustrated. She left Majestic in 1967 to create the American marketing office for a French ready-towear firm called Vaskene et Cie.

Later, she achieved her B.A. from NYU in 1982 and was involved for many years as a volunteer curatorial assistant for the New Museum of Contemporary Art. She also volunteered at Community Board 2 and Independent Curators, Inc. Her family and friends will miss the love and devotion she expressed so generously, and her mean Scrabble game.

Her family would like to express deep appreciation for the care she received over her last years from her health aids, St. Vincents Hospital and finally by the Visiting Nurse Service of NY Hospice Care.
