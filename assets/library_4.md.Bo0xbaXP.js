In 1420, Innsbruck became capital of the Tyrol, a mountainous, semiautonomous duchy that had been incorporated into the Hapsburg Empire some 60 years earlier. The Tyrolean population consisted not of serfs but of yeomen -- a sober, conservative, craftsmanlike lot -- and this free peasant society has left its stamp on the vernacular architecture and ornamented utensils of the region.

Mr. Samaras has long specialized in psychologically charged paintings and objects that feature ornate, obsessively worked surfaces made up of hundreds of pins or nails or bits of brightly colored yarn. But the exhibition of Mr. Samaras's photographic works from the last two decades, at the Museum of Modern Art through Dec. 1, demonstrates how well he has managed to turn this apparently recalcitrant medium to his own ends.    The show, created with a recent gift to the museum by Robert and Gayle Greenhill, offers a comprehensive survey of Mr. Samaras's photographic work, from his first self-portraits, made in 1969, to panoramic collages and multiple-exposure portraits of the mid-1980's. As such, it provides a welcome opportunity to trace the development and continuity of Mr. Samaras's interests and techniques in the medium.

New York can remain the trade and cultural center of the country, but only if it makes its visitors comfortable. This is not accomplished by providing homeless facilities in midtown.

Byron Janis did that Saturday night at the 92d Street Y (the scene of his local debut in 1945) at the end of a program far more enjoyable than most of its kind these days.    It was not the sort of performance you'd clap and clap and go crazy for - there were a lot of wrong notes and fuzzy passages, for one thing - and the audience did not beg him for more encores than the two he gave, but the applause was unmistakably spontaneous, vivid and happy, like the playing.    Mr. Janis has a quirky physical style compounded of nervous hovering, sudden jabs, bounces, brittle taps and tentative caresses. The music emerges a little like that too","excerpt":"occasionally it's disconcerting, but at least he    has   a style, and more often it is engaging. Its main appeal lies in the fact that certain old-fashioned ''liberties,'' eschewed by most pianists today and showing up as apparently aimless eccentricities in the work of others, still seem to mean something real to Mr. Janis.

Using either a trumpet or trombone as the lead instrument, the group allowed the melody of a hymn to appear, only to surround it with call-and-response riffing.

Pudovkin fashioned his distinctive silent film of Maxim Gorky's novel \\"Mother\\"—it first was shown here in 1934 as \\"Mother, 1905\\"—the passage of time appears to have had a slightly mellowing effect on the Soviet moviemakers.The handsome color remake, now simply titled \\"1905,\\" arrived at the Cameo Saturday. It is merely vigorous in its approach without being inventive. The story, originally a fiery account of revolt against oppression, now seems a brooding tale that only fitfully is fired with emotion.Mark Donskoi, like Pudovkin, is one of the Soviet Union's leading directorial lights and he has handled his cameras and some of his principals with professional dexterity. It is still the story of the downtrodden workers in the factory of a provincial Russian town at the turn of the century that he is relating. And it is once again the depiction of the rise from ignorance of an illiterate woman whose revolutionary son leads both the workers and his mother to defiant reaction against their beggarly existence.Although Mr. Donskoi is treating of true heroics in revealing how the seeds of revolt against this tyranny were sown, it is a slightly disjointed","excerpt":"occasionally placid drama that is unfolded. He has derived vivid color and gaiety of an Easter fair with mountebanks, carousel, freaks and drunken fights as counterpoint to the usual depressed existence of the underprivileged of the factory town. He has illustrated violence pointedly as soldiers disperse the marching workers on a May Day with the resultant accidental shooting of an innocent boy tending a flock of pigeons. Unfortunately, the hounding of the conspiring workers by capitalist sleuths and the brutality against a peasant revolutionary appear to be staged and somewhat academic. And his Czarist functionaries are fleetingly portrayed as pompous and hollow figures.However, in Vera Maretskaya, Mr. Donskoi has an actress of rare ability. As the mother who once knew only the domination of a boorish, drunken mate but who gathered strength and knowledge as she followed the teachings and path of her dedicated son, she contributes a sensitive and passionate performance. She incisively portrays Gorky's fearless mother who is \\"protecting a being she brought into existence.\\" It is apparent even without the help of the English subtitles.A. Batalov does a forthright but restrained job as the son Who is determined to escape the oppressed environment of his forebears and spread the desire for drastic change despite imprisonment and other injustices. P. Usovnichenko, as the peasant revolutionary; N. Kolofidin, as Batalov's friend and T. Piletskaya, as Batalov's devoted schoolteacher-sweetheart, add competent stints in brief roles.Mr. Donskoi has captured the essence of the early days of revolt in Russia but not too much of its flaming spirit.

I am confident that it was cleaned at some point during this period. I remember observing the progress of the workers behind clouds of steam, marveling at the contrast between the freshly cleaned areas and the rest of the building, and also noting with pleasure that as the job advanced, our own apartment became significantly brighter. I also recall being horrified that, for whatever reason, the lowest portion of the building was painted, not steam-cleanded.    The building at 178 Fifth Avenue, built in 1862, is a story in itself. Our studio apartment two flights above street level, probably a converted master bedroom, featured a 13-foot ceiling ornamented with plaster festoons, a huge marble fireplace in working order, 9-foot windows, and an enormous bathtub.
