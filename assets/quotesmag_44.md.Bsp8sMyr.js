Smoking is permitted on the side. The trailer this week promises Eric von Stroheim and some juicy business about burying people alive.\\"Fang and Claw,\\" the inaugural item, presents Frank Buck in a pleasant, thinnish, rather too familiar account of a Malaysian expedition in pursuit of wild animals for American zoos. The film suffers from a paucity of excitement and a quality of over-staging. Things happen too patly, the invisible cameraman grinding calmly away, Mr. Buck handsomely in command of the situation, and the animals in the main rather dull-witted.The monkeys, of course, are standard comedy relief in these jungle odyssies, and they give their customary able performance. Mr. Buck's native assistants are less effective. A few years ago, when motion-picture expeditions were comparative novelities in the jungle, the natives managed to seem shy and child-like in their jousts with the camera. But familiarity is breeding a conscious will to act and the ham in them is coming out.Mr. Buck's most exciting exploit occurs when he shoots a tiger that is mangling a young rhino and saves the rhino's life by performing an emergency operation with his knife. His adventure with the python which has coiled itself about one of the native boys is less persuasive, however, and you find yourself wondering how many \\"takes\\" he required to get the scene right. Elsewhere he snares a bird of paradise with an ingenious device, bags a treed tiger by shooting the limb out from under the cat, and traps an army of monkeys by appealing to their fondness for tapioca. \\"Fang and Claw\\" is ably photographed and Mr. Buck is reasonably modest in his off-screen commentary, but I am afraid the enterprise doesn't offer much constructive evidence to support the theory that nature in the raw is seldom mild.

Marcos, who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989, three years after he was ousted from the presidency by Corazon C. Aquino. Mrs. Marcos's lawyer, James Linn, said he would file suit if the passport is denied and that, in continuing to bar her return, the Government was \\"literally forcing her to have to run for the Presidency.\\" He said that Mrs. Marcos considered the country to be in \\"dire straits.\\" The Government's position is that if Mrs. Marcos wants to help, she can start by returning the $350 million or so that she and her husband are charged with stealing from the national treasury.

When my wife warned it might be \\"too sexy for work,\\" I joyfully bought it. I also invested in the perfect tie. Some weeks later, when a high-level meeting and lunch with the Italian Trade Commission came up, I was ready.   My confidence was quickly affirmed when the chief executive of one of our industry's top companies entered, wearing an identical suit. We joked about this being the New York \\"power suit\\" of the year. Later, as our group walked into Harry's Grill for lunch, the maitre d'hotel greeted us wearing the now all-too-familiar taupe Italian-cut suit. We were well into the pasta course when the stylish gent swept by again and our hostess from Milan said, \\"Do you know who that is?\\" I held my breath.   \\"That's the young Cipriani, the Venice Cipriani,\\" she said, \\"and when he married the heiress to the European Ferruzzi sugar empire, his father gave him this restaurant as a wedding present.\\"   Lord, how I love that suit. -- GARY M. FOOTE Dear Diary:   Maybe it was the heat. I got onto a crosstown bus on 57th Street, grateful to be off the broiling sidewalk. As I sank wearily into my seat, I remembered that I had not asked for a transfer. Feeling certain the driver would remember me from only seconds before, I approached him with my request.    \\"Forget it, lady,\\" he barked. \\"Too late.\\"   Not one to be easily cowed, I reminded him that I'd only just boarded and demanded my transfer. After a few more refusals and my own steadfast stubborness, he looked at me angrily, and with a great show of indignation, reached over, ripped off a transfer, and handed it to me, saying ominously, \\"Cuomo's gonna get rid of people like you.\\"   I still have no idea what he meant, but every now and then I find myself looking over my shoulder. -- RITA GARDNER Dear Diary:   The other morning I was on the Deer Park platform waiting for the 7:46 Long Island Rail Road train to Penn Station. I noticed a particularly well-dressed fellow, carrying a well-worn attache case, standing back a bit. Another suit-and-tie-type walked over to him, looking surprised.   \\"Hey, Bill!\\" the second man said. \\"I thought you'd retired.\\"   \\"I did,\\" Bill said. \\"Yesterday was my last day. I've been taking this train for 32 years. A few years ago I began planning for my retirement and promised myself that the day after I retired I was going to get dressed, drive to the station, wait for the train, watch the rest of you get on, watch it pull out and go home.\\"   A few minutes later, the train pulled in. We got on, Bill stayed back. \\"All aboard!\\" the conductor cried. The doors closed and the train pulled out of the station. From the window, I could see Bill standing there. Then he picked up his attache case and walked back to the parking lot. -- MICHAEL L.

From the gritty black-and-whites of her days at Rolling Stone to the crisp, explosive color photographs she favors for Vanity Fair, whether in pure camp or in utter seriousness, Ms. Leibovitz seems ever able to achieve the combination of glamour, intimacy and wit we demand of celebrity pictures. Her concern for intimacy and setting is evident in the early photographs of her mother, and her ability to turn icons of high culture into pop figures seems to have begun in 1974, with her pictures of Tennessee Williams. In her later work, men often appear quite vulnerable -- Willem Dafoe's bare chest looks fragile, not virile, and Michael Jackson, facing a mirror, seems overcome by pain. Women, on the other hand, frequently have an air of authority, defiance or mischief about them: Twyla Tharp and Jessye Norman become regal in black and white close-ups, while the shots of Bette Midler in a sea of red roses or Lauren Hutton in a mud bath look very much like fantasies Ms. Leibovitz helped them achieve. In the end, except for the few photographs that achieve a degree of beauty -- such as a shot of Bianca Jagger standing, cigarette at her lips, beneath a plane on an otherwise empty runway -- the significance of this book appears limited to our fascination with the aristocracy of celebrity and to Ms. Leibovitz's success as the modern equivalent of a court painter.
