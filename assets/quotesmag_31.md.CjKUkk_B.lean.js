She released her exciting (and, let's hope, increasingly popular) debut album, ''The Way It Is,'' in June, and now she has an R&B hit with her third single, ''I Should Have Cheated.'' (It's an appealingly roundabout -- and petulant -- way of saying, I wish you hadn't.) But no collection of Ms. Cole's music is complete without ''Team Invasion Presents Keyshia Cole'' (www.teaminvasion.com), a short but sharp promotional mixtape compiled by D.J. Green Lantern. She plays host to the fierce Remy Ma on ''Soul Sister,'' and does battle with Ghostface over Kanye West's ''Guess Who's Back'' beat. Even better, there's a running joke: a series of brief snippets from Billy Joel's ''She's Always a Woman.'' When he warbles, ''She'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding,'' it doesn't exactly sound like an accident.    D4L       Southern club hits don't get much more ridiculous (or, for that matter, much more lovable) than ''Laffy Taffy,'' by this Atlanta group. Over four tinkly little synthesizer notes, the members ask -- no, beg -- a woman to ''Shake that Laffy Taffy,'' seemingly more interested in the sound of those words than the sense. (Even a medical professional might be hard-pressed to find a female body part that resembles the Wonka candy in question.) Whereas rappers from the Northeast tend to deliver anatomical commentary in a gruff bark, Southern rappers are more likely to express admiration by feigning pain: when one member advertises his skills by comparing himself to Jolly Ranchers (there's a theme, see ), he really sounds as if he can't help himself. The song has already conquered many Southern radio stations","excerpt":"New York listeners can either wait for the invasion or get proactive with a mixtape. One suggestion: ''I Got Dat Drank Part 2,'' compiled by D.J. Kool Kid, at www.djkoolkid.com. Kool Kid has the presence of mind to follow the D4L hit with another high-concept Southern song based on a few electronic notes: Maceo's sublime breakout hit, ''Nextel Chirp.''    Mahoota       Perhaps it should be no surprise that one of the year's best and most exuberant house tracks comes from South Africa. The producer calls himself Mahoota, which is an alias for D.J. Vetkuk, which is, in turn, an alias for Zynne Sibika, who is also a member of the kwaito group Trompies. And the track is a glorious version of Betty Wright's 1975 R&B hit, ''Tonight Is the Night.'' Using snippets of the original, Mahoota creates a deceptively simple seven-minute Afro-house track, mellow but infinitely propulsive. An indefatigable bass line and some rattling drums keep time as fragments of the original lyrics alternate with chants, ambient crowd noise and, near the end, a gentle piano solo. The track has become a pop hit in South Africa (where house music is considered a form of pop, not an alternative to it), and at the very least it deserves a chance to makes its presence felt on American dance floors. ''Tonight Is the Night'' appears on ''Lesedi'' (Gallo Music Productions), a delightful CD of dance-music credited to ''D.J. Vetkuk vs. Mahoota''; half the tracks are original productions, and half are house tracks from around the world. Now the bad news: the CD is not available in America, although it can be ordered from musica.co.za. (E-mail queries@musica.co.za) Here's hoping some enterprising importer finds a way to change that.    Gang Gang Dance       In April, this digressive New York City band released ''God's Money'' (The Social Registry), a surprisingly graceful CD full of seductive rhythmic experiments. Drums and synthesizers combined to create odd, gauzy beats, and the singer Lizzi Bougatsos found a way to intone the mysterious lyrics without wailing them. Now listeners curious about the heavy origins of this light album can hear and see for themselves. The band has just reissued ''Hillulah'' (The Social Registry), a live CD that was previously available only as a limited-edition CD-R. The half-hour disc compiles sounds from gigs in 2003 and 2004, and it captures the heft and occasional chaos of the band's live set: thick, textural noise passages suddenly dissolve to make way for harder, emptier beats that gradually get filled in, as the tumult returns. The CD also includes half an hour of video, but be warned: the sights are even murkier than the sounds.    Backstreet Boys       Still hard at work on their less-than-triumphant (though not quite disastrous) comeback, the Backstreet Boys teamed up with Marc Klasfeld to make a music video designed to inspire mixed emotions. The video, for ''Just Want You to Know,'' pays homage to the 1980's short film ''Heavy Metal Parking Lot,'' a mini-documentary (it captures exuberant fans before a Judas Priest concert) that has enjoyed a surprisingly long shelf life. This video might have been conceived as parody, but Mr. Klasfeld turns it into something sweet and a little bit sad. Dressed up as overgrown headbangers, the boy-banders turned man-banders both mock and embrace their own fate: they look ridiculous. And while the members are clearly making fun of metal fans (and, by extension, their own fans), they're also reminding viewers that performers don't usually age much better than the people who love them. Mr. Klasfeld has helped a former pop leviathan deliver a message to its current supporters: we're all in this together.
