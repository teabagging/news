At the center of \\"Sublime Lives\\" is Richard Mansfield, who is about to commission the play \\"Beau Brummell\\" from an aspiring young playwright named Clyde Fitch. In Mr. Firestone's version, this rouses the jealousy not only of William Winter, the drama critic for The New York Tribune, who wants to write the play himself, but also of Beatrice Cameron, Mansfield's leading lady and future wife, who is afraid Fitch will seduce him.

Fortunately, I gave my opinion of Debussy's pianism in the presence of a pianist who did not need records, historical or otherwise, to know how the French composer played. The pianist, Rudolph Ganz, was born 15 years after Debussy and died in Chicago only two years ago at age 95. He explained to me with the greatest possible tact not only how excellent a pianist Debussy had been, but how little the present&#8208;day listener can rely on historical records, especially certain piano rolls, as a basis for artistic opinions.

Their union produces a child, the light-skinned Queen, who will spend her life searching for her true self while being considered a mulatto outcast by most whites and many blacks. From her teens to her mid-60's, Queen is played by Halle Berry (\\"Boomerang\\"), who, although a touch weak in some of the more emotional scenes, maintains a steady flow of lovely persuasion.

They were long strategically important as the nearest refuge for ships from the dangerous passage around Cape Horn. Their territorial waters are now considered a likely source of oil and gas.   Britain's claim to the Falklands, one of its last colonial possessions, is based on their probable discovery in 1592 by John Davis. The islands have also been claimed and occupied at various times by Spain, France and Argentina. The Argentine claim stems mainly from rights inherited from Spain, which recorded a discovery in 1520 by members of Ferdinand Magellan's round-the-world expedition. The islands were named in 1690 for Viscount Falkland, treasurer of the British Navy. In 1832, a colony of Argentines seized several United States sealing ships, which led to a United States punitive expedition that forced many colonists out. In 1832-33, a British expedition removed the last Argentines and founded a permanent colony of settlers.

If there were any adequate system of exhibition in New York, this film and many others now denied access to the week-run houses would replace some of the tiresome stuff unreeled in them. But as long as different producing and distributing organizations use their screens to exploit all their pictures, the bad along with the good, and leave the managing directors of their houses little or no freedom to select photoplays according to their merit, many worth-while productions will be forced into the by-ways and must be followed there by those who want to see them.The photoplay that provokes this outburst is \\"A Stage Romance,\\" directed by Herbert Brenon for the Fox Film Corporation, with William Farnum in the leading roôle. It is based on Dumas's \\"Edmund Kean,\\" and has a historical, as well as dramatic, interest in that it deals with the life and character of the famous English actor. It seems genuine in its settings and costumes of the early 19th century, and the story, as developed under Mr. Brenon's sensitive direction, is richly romantic, and at the same time plausible and human in its motivation.As is the case with most other screen productions, the photoplay lacks full vitality because it is an adaptation not entirely free from the load of words and word-ideas brought over from its original, but it lives its own life as a motion picture in many of its scenes nevertheless, because Mr. Brenon, above everything else, is a maker of moving pictures with life in them. His settings, composition, photography and intelligently directed action often combine to give his scenes an individual character, to make them beautiful and expressive in themselves. For the usual unanalytical spectator this means simply that these scenes are extraordinarily enjoyable.The performance of Mr. Farnum contributes a good deal to the success of the photoplay as entertainment. Although he appears somewhat heavy at times, he does, in the main, some of the most finished acting of his long career on the screen, and gives his Edmund Kean an understandable and strongly appealing personality. And the easy-going, bantering, frivolously minded Prince of Wales is definitely characterized by Holmes E. Herbert.Here, then, you have a number of things not found in the average photoplay, a genuinely romantic story, historically colored and exceptionally well directed, with two clearly marked and interesting characters in it. The only thing about the picture, in fact, which forcibly reminds you of the films far inferior to it is its silly title.A Romantic History.FOR a long time those interested in motion pictures have wished for a full, authentic and impartial history of their invention and development to the present time. A number of historical sketches have been written, and some of them have undeniable value, but all of them seem to go wrong in one important place or another, in the matter of emphasis if nothing else, and none of them has settled by the authority of unimpeachable records and other testimony the many questions that have become involved in controversy.So, it is of importance, as well as of interest, to report that what promises to be the most nearly complete, and certainly the most readable, history of the motion picture yet written is to be published serially in Photoplay Magazine, and perhaps, later, in amplified book form. The first chapter appears in the current April number of the magazine.The author of the history is Terry Ramsaye, who has been associated with motion pictures in one capacity or another since their early days, and who, by his personal experience, is especially equipped for the work he has undertaken. Many of the things of which he will write in later chapters, undoubtedly, will be subjects of personal observation to him, and to what he knows at first hand, he appears to have added a large fund of information obtained by patient research and the acute questioning of men who lived with and for, and sometimes on, the motion picture in its days of inception. Furthermore, he has taken the pains to check up previously published statements, and in a number of cases has found them unsubstantiated by the ascertainable truth. His history, therefore, in so far as its character and content may be judged by the first chapter, not only unearths new information but buries old fictions under freshly dug-up facts.The present writer is not in a position to say that the history is complete, and entirely free from inaccuracy, but, so far as it has gone, it agrees, in the main, with such information as he has been able to gather on his own account. Also the names and references introduced which have not hitherto appeared in motion picture history recommend themselves by their apparent agreement with what is known. They fit into the story so nicely that the presumption is in their favor.It is likely, however, that Mr. Ramsaye's chronicle will be challenged in some of its details, for there are sure to be persons who will feel, justly or not, that the place of this or that individual or incident in the history of the motion picture has not been made sufficiently clear, or has been misrepresented by too little, or too much, emphasis. To the present writer, for instance, it seems that the contribution of the Rev. Hannibal Goodwin to the discovery of celluloid film has been left rather vague, and the impression given in the first chapter that the motion picture was almost exclusively American in its origination carries with it a suggestion of nationalistic bias that may or may not exist in Mr. Ramsaye's mind, but certainly becomes a suspicion that sticks in the mind of the reader.But these impressions may be removed by subsequent chapters, and, anyhow, this first chapter, as it stands, seems, on the whole, a sincere and true account of the approach to the modern motion picture. That it represents a great deal of conscientious and intelligent work is evident, and that the completed history will be a document of solid value to all those interested in the screen seems assured.Also, it is not irrelevant to mention that the first chapter, as, presumably, will be the case with those to follow, is entertainingly written. Mr. Ramsaye has called his story \\"The Romantic History of the Motion Picture,\\" not because he has indulged in fictitious romance in writing it, apparently, but because the history of the birth and growth of any great invention is essentially romantic, in the sense that it is strange and fascinating and full of adventure, and because his plan was to emphasize this essential character of his story rather than its character as a bare record of facts. To do this he is peculiarly qualified as a writer. His style is easy and clear, his allusions are brightly to the point, and he is quick to perceive the human values of his materials—yet, thank Heaven, he never becomes oozily sentimental. So, as it should be, his history is good reading. SCREEN","excerpt":"HISTORY AND ROMANCE A Historical Romance.

Ms. Bridenthal, a history professor at Brooklyn College, joined teachers and students blocking the street outside CUNY headquarters to protest what they saw as an attack on the institution, which nurtured her as a student and employed her as an educator.    Before Ms. Bridenthal's act of civil disobedience resulted in her first arrest ever, and a summons for disorderly conduct, hers had been a life of hair-breadth escapes. Her family fled Nazi Germany two months before Kristallnacht. They got out of Czechoslovakia in the nick of time, too. As with other immigrant families, life in their adopted city was not easy. Her father, a furrier who was unable to regain the success he enjoyed in Leipzig, killed himself soon after they arrived in New York. Her mother, forced to become a seamstress to support the family, was murdered during a mugging in 1962. Yet Ms. Bridenthal was able to escape a mean fate herself through equal amounts of education and work.

A great many of these glimpses of history making-are familiar, some are not, and quite a few are unexpected and fascinating to watch.This Parliament Pictures package, which Robert Snyder has assembled from international sources, traces the rise and might of Fascism and Communism through its leaders, as mercilessly exposed, informally and formally, to the can-did camera eye.Unfortunately, nearly all of the Hitler chapter scenes are familiar to the point of repetition, and still, of course, chilling. And in scrambling through two world wars in an hour, the film makes some brisk compromises. The observations of Quentin Reynolds, who wrote and spoke the narration, enhance neither the curiously stereotyped air of this film nor its text, which is history.
