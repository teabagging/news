From the number of chess books I keep it seems reasonable that I might review Prof. Raymond Smullyan's new book, ''Chess Mysteries of the Arabian Knights.'' Sadly, except in such fantasy realms as the chessboard, deduction is an imperfect tool, and the truth is that I merely suffer a racking guilt which seems to hit in five-year cycles and moves me each time to buy a new set of chess books, determined, finally, to sit down and master the game. Each recurring bout costs me several antisocial weeks and many anguished self-despairing evenings before the passion recedes. This new little puzzle book arrived in midcycle when I should have been immune. Unfortunately, I was no more able to resist the professor's challenges than I was able to solve them. It has been a miserable month.   The problems are of a peculiar conceptual category requiring retrograde analysis. None of the usual ''mate in two'' nonsense here","excerpt":"Professor Smullyan is not much concerned about how one gets out of a position, but rather focuses upon how one got into it.
