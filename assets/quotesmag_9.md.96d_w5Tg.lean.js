according to documents, Pres Nixon's top White House aides warned that ongoing FBI investigation into Watergate episode could lead to high pol figures; 9 Walters memorandums and 1 submitted by Schlesinger disclose that J W Dean 3d expressed belief on June 26 that B L Barker had been involved in clandestine entry into Chilean Embassy; that then-FBI Acting Dir Gray had been urged by some high level officials to force US Atty H H Titus Jr to stop his attempts to subpoena financial records of Repub re-election campaign com as part of continuing investigation into financing of Watergate team; White House refuses to amplify Pres Nixon's May 22 statement in which Nixon said that he had forbidden FBI to interfere either with covert CIA operations or with matters of natl security that had been handled by special investigations unit set up in '71; Walters memorandums provide strikingly different image of those 1st meetings in late June about ongoing FBI investigation; Walters quotes Haldeman as saying on June 23 that 'whole affair was getting embarrassing and it was the Pres' wish that Walters call on the acting dir (of the FBI) and suggest to him that the 5 (Watergate) suspects had been arrested, this should be sufficient, and that it was not advantageous to have the inquiry pushed'; quotes Gray as declaring in subsequent meeting on same day that 'this was a most awkward matter to come up during the election yr and he would see what he could do'; memorandums say that 3 days later he met privately with Dean--after getting Ehrlichman's approval--and was told by Dean that 'some of the accused were getting scared and wobbling'; quotes Dean at June 28 meeting as declaring that 'problem was how to stop the FBI investigation beyond the 5 suspects...Dean then asked hopefully whether I could do anything or had any suggestions'; memorandums make little mention of Pres Nixon; in introductory message, Walters specifically retracted statement made in earlier memo that quoted Haldeman as specifically declaring that 'it was the Pres' wish' in instructing him to ask the FBI to halt or delay its Mexican money investigation';

Pray silence, then, for the facts. This has been the bloodiest century in the history of the human race.

Unlike many other Judson choreographers, who were minimalists, Waring favored extravagance, and his productions blended classical ballet with modern dance. Waring, with his flamboyance, and the Judson minimalists, with their austerity, helped change the course of modern dance, which at that time was accused of being tied to ponderous literary subject matter.

They have never been pardoned, although the killings have come to be widely seen as a shameful piece of Britain's past.     It is thus some consolation to their extended families that a poignant memorial to the soldiers was recently erected in the 150-acre National Memorial Arboretum, a privately owned expanse, in Staffordshire, England.

Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $25.         In theory, the overarching idea behind Ian Buruma's new book is a good one. With the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II rapidly approaching, it seems an appropriate time to examine the ways in which Germany and Japan have coped with the legacy of that conflict. The generation that bore firsthand witness to the war is slowly dying, and as it does so, the collective memory of  the war passed on to children becomes increasingly important. How the past is remembered, after all, affects how people behave in the present, how they think  of themselves and their place in the world.

And with good reason. The story of the fall of the Romanov dynasty has all the makings of a romance novel: historical sweep, ill-fated love, mysticism, mystery and violent death.          The version of the tale that most will remember come from Robert K. Massie's 1967 book \\"Nicholas and Alexandra,\\" which was made into a movie four years later. Mr. Massie portrayed Nicholas II as a weak-willed czar who preferred family life with his beloved but neurotic wife, Aleksandra, and their children to ruling his empire. The hemophilia of Nicholas's only heir, Aleksei, and Aleksandra's belief that the mystical peasant Rasputin could heal him were presented on an almost equal footing with greater political and economic causes  for the fall of the regime.

Besides the stretches devoted to the uncanny animals, the scenes depicting African savages are most absorbing. There are dusky gentlemen, who decorate their hair and physiognomies, who were deterred from making pot-roast of the photographers by a spoonful of salt and a safety-pin. The last named article is used as a nasal ornament, being fastened through the cartillage between the nostrils, to the intense pride of the cannibals.There are also the pygmies, a race discovered by H. M. Stanley. They are extremely timid and rely chiefly on their accuracy with poisoned darts to keep off intruders. Their costumes are just about as extensive as that worn by Gunga Din. These pygmies permitted the explorers to come within the area of their queer abodes with cameras, but they were thumbs down on any rifles. Nevertheless, they participated in cutting up a giant elephant after it had been slain by the white men's weapons.The savages were much puzzled by the phonograph, being apparently unable to decide where the owner of the voice was hidden.Mr. Burbridge's party slew three giant gorillas, one weighing something like 450 pounds. Two of these were sent to the Belgian Government and one to the Smithsonian Institution. The explorer also brought away with him three young gorillas, one of which weighed 125 pounds and put up a good battle before he surrendered. Mr. Burbridge shows some amusing scenes with these animals, one of them being that of a young gorilla who insists on getting tangled up in a drum of film. Another gorilla has fun with an Irish terrier. It looks on the screen as if the two animate were playing, but the dog is rolled over easily by the baby gorilla. An extraordinary scene illustrates one captive gorilla trying to reach the branches of a tree. He is evidently thinking. He has a small box, which is not high enough for his intent, and as soon as he espies another box, he puts the two boxes on top of each other and his perspicacity is rewarded.Another subject on the Cameo program is the French film version of Anatole France's \\"Crainquebille,\\" which has been issued here under the title of \\"Bill\\" and \\"Old Bill.\\" No matter how many times one views this picture, one is impressed by the masterly performance of Maurice de Feraudy.Charlie Chaplin's old comedy \\"Dough and Dynamite\\" is another feature. It is ridiculous and the titles are written for children, but Chaplin is there, with his clever touches, such as brushing his clothes and one shoe.Woodrow Wilson Film Memorial.Under the auspices of a committee, of which Mrs. Charles L. Tiffany is chairman, the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Film was presented last night in Town Hall. The scenes of the past were stirring","excerpt":"memories of the conflict, brought nearer by living pictures, carried a strong appeal to the emotions. It would, however, have been far more effective if the titles of this series of events of the black yesteryear had been less fulsome, for the moving photographs told a great deal, perhaps far more than words themselves could recount. Here, however, Woodrow Wilson is referred to as a martyr, the great peacemaker and in various other rôles; perhaps his greatest admirers would have preferred a text that left the spectators with the thought in mind instead of having flattering terms thrown upon the screen.This series of film news, arranged in the form of a picture, is indeed stirring. It causes one to reflect that here was a man who lived for years in the quiet of a university town and then became embroiled in politics, soon gaining the Presidency of the United States. Years that followed his more active existence appeared to be so full of great events that they passed in a flash. You see him energetic and hopeful at the time of America's entry into the war. You look upon his moving shadow at Brest, at the Peace Conference and at the shattered towns of the French front. Then he is seen in England, going back to America, where the film title writer accuses 7,000,000 of \\"US\\" of making Woodrow Wilson a failure in electing President Harding.The scenes concerned with Woodrow Wilson's declining health, his last bow to the public and his funeral are impressive.Many tributes to the War President were quoted on the screen.

Hafez al-Assad, the iron-willed military man who ruled Syria for three decades, was in power just a few years when he laid the cornerstone. But lack of materials and equipment, hard economic times and a devastating fire delayed the project year after year. It fell to Assad's son and successor, Bashar, to finish the job. He opened Al Assad opera house with his wife, Asma, last year. Decorated with paintings and sculptures by Syrian artists, offering up classical concerts and works by Arab playwrights, the building expresses something of the elder Assad's vision of Damascus as the Arab capital of cultural, if not political, enlightenment.

This picture, which was presented before a distinguished audience at the Cameo last night, possesses some splendidly conceived war scenes, in which one sees and hears the results of hostilities.

Only the skies above appear to be at peace—on the days when airplanes are not buzzing around and dropping their loads of high-explosives—and occasional puffs of smoke soar up and join the soft clouds that are silvered by the sunlight.This film is undoubtedly another good argument against war, but it is not a good entertainment. It strives to make its point at the end by depicting harrowing scenes in an improvised hospital and as in other sequences there is too much of the same thing. Many of the interesting phases of battles are excluded and granted that the producers of this film wanted to strip war of all its glamour, they might have added to the value of their film by a suggestion of subtlety. There is no relief from Mars' grim havoc on the battlefields or in cities.It is, however, a cleverly acted film, one which, incidentally, was known on its native heath as \\"West-front 1918 Vier von der Infanterie.\\" It gives one some conception of what happens to the four men, and in a last scene a wounded Frenchman takes the hand of a dead German near him.Among the adroitly pictured fighting scenes are some that reveal the French tanks crawling in the direction of the German trenches over No Man's Land. It is an idea that might have been photographed to advantage even though it is interesting as it stands. So far as the sounds are concerned they are sometimes a bit too loud and too prolonged, particularly during the hospital glimpses.Chevalier to Be Guest at Revel.Maurice Chevalier, French stage and screen star, will be the guest of honor at a Greenroomers' gala revel to be held on Saturday evening, March 7, at the National Variety Artists' Club, 229 West Forty-sixth Street.

On Sunday afternoon at the New York State Theater, Peter Boal was seen as the lone man in the feminine world of George Balanchine's \\"Raymonda Variations.\\" Inspired by Marius Petipa's 1898 \\"Raymonda,\\" Balanchine used excerpts from Glazunov's ballet score (conducted here with fine verve by Maurice Kaplow) to hark back to the Russian classical tradition of his boyhood.   The purity of Mr. Boal's classical style made him, as might be expected, a natural for Balanchine's reworking of Petipa. In his first solo, Mr. Boal offered a contrast between the sharpness of his larger leaps and the cascade of small leg beats, especially those known as brises voles. A greater, even brasher assertiveness would compensate for the throwaway modesty that crept into this variation. In his second solo, however, Mr. Boal picked up markedly, ending his turns with a flourish.

At the Galleria shopping mall, Santas work in shifts, alternating every two hours from midmorning till 7 or 8 o'clock at night. This season, the two St.  Nicks who cover weekends (there are others on duty during the week) are a soft-spoken, dark-haired man who fixes cars, and the garrulous, politics-minded student.\\n\\nSaturdays and Sundays, these two coax the seasonal wishes out of hundreds of children, repeating over and over that time-worn refrain, ''And what do you want for Christmas?''

It should be touching and inspiring to read about women who had the strength not only to survive but to triumph in an age when prejudice seemed hopelessly welded to preconceived ideas.
