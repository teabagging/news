Khaled Brahim became one of rai's first recording stars as a teenager in the 1970's, when the music spread via underground cassette tapes and picked up Western elements like cheap keyboards and drum-machine beats. Singing about the problems and pleasures of everyday life in clear, catchy songs, rai singers were considered rebels, and while the music reached Algerian radio in the mid-1980's, its official acceptance was short-lived. Fundamentalist groups in Algeria brutally suppressed it in the 1990's. By then, Khaled had become an expatriate in Paris, where he continued to broaden the music, drawing on funk, reggae, rock and Latin pop, as rai's audience spread worldwide. Khaled's new album, ''Ya-Rayi'' (Wrasse/Universal), includes a song in English, ''Love to the People,'' that features Carlos Santana on guitar, while other songs reconnect to roots with accordion, flutes and hand drumming. For his concert at Summerstage, Khaled, above, is being joined by some of his international collaborators, including the producer Don Was, the producer and D.J. Cheb i Sabbah, the Latin-pop producer KC Porter, the reggae singer Elan and the percussionists Luis Conte and Walfredo Reyes Jr. Yet at the center of all the hybrids is Khaled's voice, gutsy and immediate, using Arabic inflections to convey direct passions.

The death of Kiki and Herb has been greatly exaggerated -- by the duo of course. After what was supposed to be their final performance at Carnegie Hall two years ago (''Kiki and Herb Will Die for You''), the singular performers, right, who blend old showbiz with indie-rock attitude, make their triumphant return to New York in ''Kiki and Herb Alive on Broadway.'' Not since ''Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning'' followed ''Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter'' has there been such a brazen comeback. Kiki is the tipsy chanteuse played with brilliant, and sometimes frightening abandon, by Justin Bond. She was born during the Great Depression and was in an orphanage in western Pennsylvania when she met her partner, Herb, the quiet straight man brought to life by Kenny Mellman. Their popular lounge act features reminiscences of their heyday (playing Monte Carlo in the 60's, singing on the Love Boat in the 80's). There is also an unpredictable musical selection that ranges from Velvet Underground to Eminem, and lots and lots of booze. This new booking puts to rest the notion that the bizarre pair is a downtown phenomenon that belongs in front of an audience with thick, black-framed glasses and huge record collections. To flirt with death and survive unscathed? That's big time. (''Kiki and Herb Alive on Broadway'' opens today in previews and runs through Sept. 10 at the Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, Manhattan.)

The joy when Quentin Tarantino's creations speak is the opposite. Despite their hilariously florid rapping, his folks are also incredibly cagey: they never give the entire game away. This shrewdness is the template for the long dialogues in &quot","excerpt":"Kill Bill, Vol. 2,&quot; the most voluptuous comic-book movie ever made.   In this deliciously perverse picture, everything is operatic, including the despair and the pauses. Uma Thurman, whose speaking voice has a lyric, teasing quality, is just the performer to get the mordant slyness across. Mr. Tarantino's movies are also about loss and betrayal, and &quot;Vol. 2&quot; is a double-burger helping of those motifs. It is rich, substantial and sustained, yet also greasy kids' stuff, a wrapper filled with an extra large order of chili fries, stained with ketchup, salt and cheese. &quot;Vol. 1&quot; was all set-up: the longest first act in movie history, staged and edited like a series of Pablo Ferro trailers. &quot;Vol. 2&quot; is the second and third acts in one convenient serving, told in a languorous flashback-within-a-flashback style with airy long takes. Unlike the 100-meter high-hurdles of &quot;Vol. 1,&quot; this sequel is a marathon, with hills and long stretches of flatland.

It is evident that a device is used to assuage the feelings of the FBI and another device to give the State and city authorities their demanded due. Nevertheless, the picture holds together securely, if somewhat monotonously in the prison scenes. Preston Foster seems rather too clean-cut and civilized as the rowdy Mr. Touhy.

But the closing glimpse, with Cookie Leonard, a racketeer, being escorted by his law-abiding friends, Mike O'Dowd, of the police force, and Molly Pearson, a cheery and attractive young person, from a death cell to the door that leads to the electric chair chamber, is something that could better have been left to the imagination, even if it does offer the producers the inspiration for the title.Casey Robinson, the author, and Erle Kenton, the director, however, have had the temerity to steer clear of a last minute reprieve from the Governor of the State. Leonard is a sympathetic person whose gun is aimed only at the hearts of those who are worse than himself, but he pays with his life for pumping a pound or so of lead into Marino, the bootlegging chieftain, whose day is not complete without putting somebody on the spot.Although it is emphasized that Leonard is in the racket to feather his nest, it seems for some time that he may turn out to be an extraordinarily clever sleuth. Before the killing of Marino, Leonard had promised O'Dowd and Molly that he would abandon the lawless existence. But on the day he is to go straight Leonard learns that Molly's brother, Larry, an enterprising reporter bent on uncovering crime, has been killed by Marino's thugs. The law is not swift enough for Leonard, so he goes forth to silence Mr. Marino.Leonard takes no chances. His weapon is a machine gun, which he conceals in a specially made suitcase. He drives one of Marino's own trucks so as to get into the latter's garage, and it is not long before Leonard is telling Marino that he is going to give him two extra pounds in weight. There is the sound like a giant tearing calico, and one knows that Marino has had a full dose of his own medicine.There are three parades in this picture. The first is formed by recruits for fighting in France. The second is the Armistice Day procession and the third Leonard's faltering walk to \\"the chair.\\"Jack Holt hardly seems the type for Leonard, who starts as an impossible reporter, then is seen as a fearless soldier and eventually as the racketeer. Yet Mr. Holt gives a competent performance, one that is weakened only when Mr. Kenton desires to photograph Mr. Holt expressing anguish. Tom Moore plays O'Dowd satisfactorily, but his speech is a little uneven. Constance Cummings has some rather forced lines, but she acquits herself favorably as Molly Pearson. Robert Ellis makes the most of Marino's part. Clarence Muse is capital as a Negro whose musical soul is aroused by fear. THE SCREEN.","excerpt":"Killing the Killer. Chronicle of Mother Love.

Microsoft, the highest of tech, reports surprisingly strong earnings. So naturally the market nose-dives, led by technology stocks. At one point in Wednesday's free-fall, in fact, with the Dow down 130, Microsoft shares were $18 below where they'd been two days earlier. What happened? Perhaps it was that dreaded \\"correction\\" -- an odd term implying that the notoriously illogical market has some \\"correct\\" level from which foolish investors deviate. Or perhaps it was the Wall Street equivalent of gorging on sweets and then crashing after the sugar high. In any case, traders pulled out of it and the market held steady for the rest of the week. Bill Gates won't have to go to work at McDonald's. GREENSPAN WATCH Flirting With Clarity Alan Greenspan may have had something to do with that market bump, too. If he ever made himself totally clear, of course, the Dow would probably rise or fall 1,000 points in a day. There's no remote danger of him doing that, but last week he did skate perilously close to clarity, saying the economy \\"may have passed the point of maximum risk.\\" In his usual hedging fashion, he added, \\"We have certainly not yet reached the point\\" where no risk remains. But the markets seemed to fix on his optimism, which might mean he has no plans for further interest-rate cuts. Or it might not. ELECTRONICS U.S. TV Maker? No Such Thing Considering that the average American lives and breathes by the almighty Tube, you'd think making TV sets would be the ideal home-town business. Far from it. Yes, many of the names sound all-American: G.E., RCA, Motorola, Zenith, Magnavox. But G.E. and RCA sets are sold by Thomson of France, Magnavox sets by the Dutch company Philips, and Motorola sets have been renamed Quasars by their Japanese manufacturer, Matsushita. Zenith held on alone -- until last week. A South Korean company called LG Electronics, which makes the Goldstar brand, bought control of Zenith. Now Americans can only sit and watch, at which they're proven experts. TRANSPORTATION Metro-North Strike: Never Mind For all the fuss, you'd think there had been a strike. Westchester and Connecticut commuters fretted or stayed home or plotted the least painful trek to the subway's far reaches. They watched and waited and talked, talked, talked -- the Strike That Wasn't provided endless conversational fodder. But then Metro-North pulled a trick out of its hat -- a Railway Labor Act cooling-off period -- and, Presto!, no strike threat for four months. Negotiators can get some sleep now, and commuters, after three days at the edge of their train seats, are left wondering whether the whole mess will be back in November. And why does no one mention, by the way, that Metro-North hasn't even raised New York fares for over five years?  TOBACCO Is the Marlboro Man Happy? A survey out last week showed a sharp rise in teen-age smoking -- a big surprise, since that rate had held steady while adult smoking fell. But now, a tough question: Is this good news or bad for the tobacco industry? Last month Philip Morris announced a plan to cut smoking by minors, so presumably it would find this news disturbing. Yet rarely does anyone but a teen-ager start smoking, and if they don't start, there'll be no customers. But let's take Philip Morris at its word, making the next question this: How do you keep kids from starting? It's already illegal to sell minors cigarettes, of course, but that means little. Another survey shows that, nationwide, minors can buy cigarettes 75 percent of the places they try.  THINGS MADE IN HEAVEN Scott, Meet Kimberly It almost sounded like a consumer-hip young couple finding joy in pooling unusual strengths: \\"Scott is strong in bath tissue and towels","excerpt":"Kimberly is strong in facial tissue.\\" Scott \\"has nothing in diapers and feminine pads\\" but \\"can open a lot of doors in Europe.\\" (As well he should!) But no, this was an analyst talking about Kimberly-Clark's planned purchase of Scott Paper last week, a $7 billion stock transaction the analyst called \\"a very complementary deal.\\" And it's a deal that would create a powerful rival to the true giant of consumer products, Procter & Gamble. And why is Albert Dunlap smiling? Well, he's chairman of Scott Paper, and he could wind up with $100 million. Nothing to, uh, sneeze at.  FRAUD Twice Bitten at Towers? Two years ago, the gloom was deep for creditors of Towers Financial. Towers descended into bankruptcy; its founder, Steven Hoffenberg, pleaded guilty to fraud, and creditors were out hundreds of millions in an unimaginably vast Ponzi scheme. Then came that fuzzy, golden moment when the pure of heart ride in and do their virtuous best to patch things up. A Los Angeles businessman named John Hall entered the scene, with the hope that he'd do all he could for creditors with Towers' tattered remains. But the fairy tale ends there. A lawsuit now contends that Mr. Hall, too, was merely intent on lining his own pockets -- that he siphoned millions from the patched-up venture by having it pay grossly inflated prices for worthless assets.  REGULATION Safety Rules: Hard to Kill Business is dying to get rid of a lot of environmental, health and safety regulations, and it seemed the reigning Republicans would oblige them. Regulation-slaying legislation, way up there on Congress's checklist, was moving along nicely. But last week, outnumbered Democrats managed to kill it, borrowing the tactic that had sunk Henry Foster's chance to be Surgeon General: talk it to death. And as with Dr. Foster, backers of the bill couldn't quite come up with the votes to cut off debate. \\"I regret that we have failed the American people again,\\" said Bob Dole, who would have loved to add the bill to his resume as he applies for that job up Pennsylvania Avenue. But environmentalists surely saw no failure.  PUBLISHING Let 'em Read Balance Sheets \\"I like our core businesses,\\" said Mark Willes. Well, if you say so. It was a bit hard to tell last week. Mr. Willes, after all, is the new head of Times Mirror, whose \\"core business\\" is newspapers, and he had just closed New York Newsday, cutting 750 jobs. Just days later, as part of a broad sweep of the broom, he said he would cut 1,000 more newspaper jobs, including 700 at The Los Angeles Times. Yes, costs must be cut, shareholders must be kept cozy and warm, and Mr. Willes, once a General Mills financial executive, is certainly trying to do that. \\"Core businesses\\" -- that's the way business people talk, not journalists.
