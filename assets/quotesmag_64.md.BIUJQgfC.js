Fertility, a traditionally beneficent notion in the North, becomes a sick joke. Life proliferates and chokes: Too many mosquitoes and snakes. Turn your back on your garden for a minute, and vegetable sex has buried it under fronds and creepers. \\"Guerra Conjugal\\" is a Brazilian film, set in the pastel and languid town of Curitiba, that sees in the relations between men and women the virulence of a poisoned eclair. It is being shown as part of the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors series.Three stories intercut with one another. The first is about a middleaged lawyer who seduces everyone in sight. Finally, in horror and helplessness, he is seduced by an old schoolmate. Don Juan as the repressed homosexual.The second is about a young man who finds his satisfaction in progressively older women. The last is a horrendous crone of at least 80. Don Juan as the mother-fixated infant.If the first two episodes dispose of eroticism, the third lays out marital love. An aged couple quarrel more and more violently. He accuses her of thinking of other men","excerpt":"she tells him he disgusts her. Dying, he asks his son to see to it that the wife doesn't kiss his dead face. He dies; she grows miraculously younger.\\"Guerra\\" is Tropical Gothic: It makes Southern Gothic look like cream of wheat. In its violent disgust for the human animal—in this case the human sexual animal—it occasionally reaches the inspired dementia of a Buñuel. There are some brilliantly harsh and funny episodes.Mostly, though, its means—uneven acting, uncertain direction and overblown writing—fall a long way short of its intentions. If the eclair is half-baked, there's not much use poisoning it.Good things, the saying goes, come in small packages. And the small packages that are the films of Eli Noyes Jr, are crammed with wit, beauty, inventiveness and a keen sensitivity to the lunacy and sadness of the human condition.Eleven of these films—some animated, some live action, one a mixture of the two; some in color, some in black and white—are being shown this weekend and next at the Film Forum in an 82-minute parade that should captivate a great many children, delight adults and disabuse anyone of the notion that when it comes to animation, Walt Disney and his disciples had the last word.Mr. Noyes is the sort of artist who can take a run through the alphabet with pen and ink in six minutes, stirring up comparisons with Maurice Sendak and Saul Steinberg with his drawing and leaving \\"Sesame Street\\" and Richard Scarry in his wake with his humor.In 8 minutes he can speak volumes about evolution, through — appropriately — a lump of clay transformed with seeming magic into all manner of life. In 60 seconds he can run through a lexicon of barks from a creative kennel full of dogs or make wild sport of the world's peanut-butter-and-jelly addicts. Given a country music background and a few grains of sand, he produces marvelous choreography.In live action, he transmits a crafty dog's-eye view of singles' life in New York and takes a bold excursion into one of the city's great conflicts — the war against the roach. His most eye-catching clay animation is reserved for \\"The Fable of He and She,\\" an 11-minute film that suffers, however, from a heavyhanded story about sexual roles that Mr. Noyes did not compose.His own formidable powers of storytelling and political commentary are strikingly displayed in \\"The Dot,\\" a 30-minute film that conjures up an eerie, Orwellian world and combines live action and animation to make a statement against repression.Mr. Noyes is a filmmaker of impressive accomplishment, and his work deserves to be seen.

Broadway    * ''ANNIE GET YOUR GUN.'' Making her Broadway debut, Reba McEntire glides into the title role of Irving Berlin's classic musical like a seabird landing on water. Like Annie Oakley, this chart-topping country singer is a nonchalant showoff, making a highly polished performance look so easy you wonder why we aren't all Broadway stars. Ms. McEntire has also put a highly personal, proprietary stamp on a role dominated by the ghost of Ethel Merman, using her no-nonsense twang and balladeer's throb to make familiar songs sound fresh as this morning, suggesting Berlin by way of Nashville instead of Tin Pan Alley. And she does what even Bernadette Peters, who won a Tony in this revival, could not.

Miss de Beauvoir, who was 70 years old when the film was made, two years ago, would have made a challenging interview subject at any point in her extensive career. But she has never seemed more formidable than she does now, when the power of her conviction has so evidently withstood the test of time.She is a relentless, overbearing speaker, and any film about her might have benefited from more interruption and illumination than Josée Dayan and Malka Ribowska, the co-directors, are able to provide. But at the beginning of the film, when an interviewer asks whether a film about her can amplify her writings, Miss de Beauvoir's response is affirmative, and the completed work does bear out her opinion. The film casts its share of new light as it reveals the exceptional tenacity of her conversation, the pugnacious intelligence with which she approaches any question, the extreme reluctance with which she yields the floor. Simone de Beauvoir brings her own brand of intensity to any subject, even the matter of why she and Jean-Paul Sartre served meat to Picasso and beans to Camus.Some of Miss de Beauvoir's reminiscences are relatively lighthearted, as she remembers which cafes she and Mr. Sartre, her companion for nearly 50 years, used to frequent, or the time she left Mr. Sartre for a brief hike in the woods and found him hard at work on \\"Being and Nothingness\\" by the time she returned. Mr. Sartre is one of several people who interview the author on camera, and his slow, gentle questions have a way of sounding clearer than her more extensive answers.

But the fans who know her only as the TV comedienne who created a huge gallery of vivid loonies in some 2,000 movie parodies and satiric sketches have not seen all the faces of Carol Burnett. She has appeared on stage (in ''Once Upon a Mattress'' early in her career, and more recently in a revival of ''Same Time Next Year'') and in films (''Pete 'n Tillie,'' ''A Wedding,'' ''The Four Seasons,'' and ''Annie'') as well as on television. She has excelled in drama as well as in comedy, most notably in ''Friendly Fire,'' in which her portrayal of a Midwestern woman obsessed with learning the truth about her son's death in Vietnam earned her an Emmy nomination.   In addition, her musical variety specials have won almost as much acclaim as her comedy shows","excerpt":"she warbled duets with Julie Andrews at Carnegie Hall, Beverly Sills at the Met, Dolly Parton at Opryland, and two weeks ago she was paired with such diverse figures as Placido Domingo and Sammy Davis Jr., in the ''Texaco Star Theater's Salute to the American Musical.''

CHINATOWN/BROOKLYN HEIGHTS Anchoring a Bridge In the River and the Air    It is almost a metaphysical question: What holds up a bridge? More specifically, what holds up the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges, which many New Yorkers rattle across while praying silently that the roadway not collapse beneath them?   On Saturday, the New York Transit Museum, in Brooklyn Heights, will explain how the bridges stay up. Engineers from the city Department of Transportation explain the bridges' construction in a Saturday tour called \\"Bridge Game: Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges Close Up.\\"   The tour begins at the Manhattan end of the Manhattan Bridge, where engineers will explain the function of the anchorages that hold the bridge firmly in the river. After lunch (egg rolls and won ton soup; participants should take lunch money) the tour continues with the Williamsburg Bridge, where a new set of engineers will give the inside view.

The shootout followed a chase along the freeway, also known as California Route 91, around midnight after police officers spotted the car of a 40-year-old man wanted after he fled the scene of a shooting of a police officer at an Anaheim hotel on Sunday morning. Sgt. Rick Martinez said two officers had responded to a call about a man exposing himself to guests from the window of his room at a Best Western hotel about a mile from Disneyland. When the officers arrived, the man, who was not identified, was getting into a car. Shots were fired, and one officer was shot in the thigh. The suspect was next seen driving on the freeway about midnight Sunday. While chased by the police, he crashed and ran from his car, Sergeant Martinez said, then exchanged shots with officers and was killed.

For nonfiction writers, however, this kind of domination is practically unheard of. Malcolm Gladwell has pulled it off -- his new book, ''Blink,'' is No. 1 on the hardcover list again this week, and his previous book, ''The Tipping Point,'' sits atop the paperback side. ''The Tipping Point'' was about ''social epidemics,'' about how ideas and trends spread the way viruses do. Interestingly, one of the word-of-mouth ''epidemics'' Gladwell explored in his book was the slow, up-from-the-bottom success of Rebecca Wells's 1996 novel, ''Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.'' Wells's book sold modestly for a year or two before it ''tipped'' in 1998, becoming a paperback best seller for 84 weeks and spawning a Sandra Bullock movie. For Wells's fans, it's been a long, lonely wait for a follow-up, but nine years later that book is finally here: ''Ya-Yas in Bloom'' (HarperCollins) makes its debut on the hardcover fiction list this week at No. 3. What took her so long? According to her Web site, Wells has been ill with a variety of mysterious and increasingly dire symptoms","excerpt":"she was finally told she had advanced Lyme disease. At times she was so weak she was forced to dictate portions of ''Ya-Yas in Bloom'' into a tape recorder. Wells, a former actress, is said to be a sprightly reader of her work at bookstore appearances, but this time around she has nixed a potential book tour. She is getting better, she writes, but will sorely miss ''dressing up and prissing across the stage.''    GEEKGASMS: George Lucas's new ''Star Wars'' movie, ''Revenge of the Sith,'' doesn't hit theaters until May 19, but fans who want an early taste of the film's plot machinations are racing to pick up Matthew Stover's authorized novelization, which makes its debut on the hardcover fiction list at No. 2. Stover is well aware, he told The Associated Press, that he is merely a gun for hire on this project. The novel, he said, is ''Lucas's baby'' -- the director read the manuscript carefully and ordered changes. Stover is also aware that this book isn't going to make him fabulously wealthy; his advance was just shy of $100,000, and he described his cut of the royalties as being ''small.'' What the book will do, he hopes, is attract hordes of sci-fi fans to his other books. If the reviews of his new book on ''Star Wars'' fan sites are any indication, the plan may work. One writer devoured Stover's novel and quickly posted the following estimation: ''Your eyes will melt out of your head, your heart will explode, and your other parts will detonate in geekgasms for the gloriousness of it all.''

Wilsey's book takes no prisoners. It details the very public implosion of his parent's marriage -- his father was a charming multimillionaire, his mother a pushy and glamorous society columnist -- and his later life under the watchful eyes of a hated (and similarly well-connected) stepmother. ''Oh the Glory of It All'' is selling particularly well in San Francisco, Wilsey's hometown, where the book landed like a fragmentation bomb aimed at the city's elite. (Even Danielle Steel didn't escape the shrapnel","excerpt":"she was forced to deny Wilsey's claim she had an affair with his father.) The San Francisco Chronicle has treated the book like a major news event, printing a week's worth of excerpts, listing the names of those who dared to attend Wilsey's book party and drawing up lists of actors for the movie. While San Franciscans with long memories are buying Wilsey's memoir for the old-school dirt he dishes, Wilsey has cred with younger readers, too. He's an editor at McSweeney's and an F.O.D. -- a friend of Dave, as in Dave Eggers. Wilsey's book seems unlikely to be the kind of cultural phenomenon Eggers's ''Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius'' (2000) was; Eggers's book stayed on the hardcover list for more than 3 months, and spent 34 weeks on the list in paperback. But ''Oh the Glory of It All'' is strong enough to put to rest -- for a while, anyway -- some critics' fears that the worker bees at the McSweeney's word-colony were too coy and insular to introduce many other memorably distinctive writers.    OPRAH, BILL. BILL, OPRAH: ''Every word a writing man writes is put down,'' a character intones in William Faulkner's 1927 novel, ''Mosquitoes,'' ''with the ultimate intention of impressing some woman.'' These days, of course, there's really only one woman many writers want to impress. When Oprah Winfrey bravely chose three of Faulkner's novels -- ''As I Lay Dying,'' ''The Sound and the Fury'' and ''Light in August'' -- to be her summer reading group picks this year, Vintage repackaged them in a shiny boxed set and these sometimes thorny books went flying out of bookstores as if they were Clive Cussler novels. Don't look for the Faulkner books on The Times's paperback list, however -- the paper's polling department has long declined to track boxed sets of any kind. Had it been included, the Faulkner box would have ranked No. 2 on the paperback fiction list, right behind ''Black Rose,'' the 150th or so book to drop off Nora Roberts's busy assembly line.

Considered as a spectacle, the Ushigome Palace suffers from the fact that it is situated on one of the gayest thoroughfares in the world. When you have just stepped off a street which in the evening is like a scene from an opera prolonged for half a mile, the best meant efforts of the studio are viewed with a certain objectivity.The bait at the Ushigome Kwan was a film entitled \\"The Dawn of Manchukuo.\\" It turned out to be poor but expensive stuff—a \\"well-constructed\\" scenario in which princesses, patriots, villains and vampires played their mechanical parts. A very pretty actress, whose attractions lose no value from the fact that she is one of an ancient aristocratic family, had been sent over to Manchuria with the appropriate trimmings to be shot on the ground regardless of expense, and equally regardless of the obvious truth that a drama which merely transferred to the Manchurian plains Hollywood's well-worn motives and situations could have been filmed in the factory.\\"Dawn of Manchukuo.\\"But you seldom go out in Tokyo without finding something new. The Japanese, aided by a certain naïveteé in their make-up, have invented a form of screen drama which finds its interest in real events and its personages, if not its plots, in the newspapers. \\"The Dawn of Manchukuo\\" was preceded by a film bearing the singular title \\"Behind the Supremacy of the Water.\\" It really meant \\"Behind the Japanese Swimming Successes at the Olympic Games.\\" One expected a few reels of swimming and diving, and was not disappointed, but they were woven into a moral-athletic drama in which virtue triumphed and vice was lusciously displayed. The picture opened with straight newsreels of the diving tests at the Meiji Pool in Tokyo, where the contestants for Los Angeles were selected.

Intoxicated by his success in being chosen for Los Angeles, he enters on the flowery path which leads to dance halls and infatuation with a \\"modan garu\\" (modern girl) who lolls on couches, puffs cigarette smoke in a manner which gives that innocent act the air of an exotic sin and generally displays the stigmata of the vampire. The diver's good brother, a thin and studious young man; his innocent young sister and his aged mother reason with him in tears and at length. At length, I must repeat, for Japanese playgoers like their moral crises to receive full emphasis. I have sat in the legitimate theatre while a young scapegrace, who had gone off to the gay quarters with the contents of his father's till, was being expostulated with, amid real tears and snivelings for fifty real minutes. They even brought the mother, a hard-faced old dame, to the dance hall and had her confront the vamp, who puffed smoke in her face.The Dudish Rival.Naturally there was a rival, a young dude with a coupé and a sweet little mustache. It is impossible to take Japanese film villains seriously. The serious parts are played here with such a Sunday school air that the villain only needs to look slightly flippant. The villainess would often pass at Hollywood for the loving daughter, only she is too well dressed. A terrible scene occurs between this dude and the diver, the dialogue being unobtrusively furnished by the benshi, or orator, who has stepped into a small pulpit on the O. P. side of the stage. The villain hurls a three-cornered, porcelain ashtray, weighing perhaps a quarter of a pound, and catches the swimmer squarely on the ear. Amid the débris the reel clicks off.Then a reel or two of news from Los Angeles showing Nordic Greek gods doing all sorts of dives with incredible grace. In a hut in Athletic Village we meet our hero again, ear swathed in bandages, a Japanese doctor fluttering around and a sorrowful but angry trainer conveying the news that he cannot compete. Protestations, tears, repentance, tearing off of bandages and general futility follow while a few more Nordics dive. The scene shifts to Tokyo, where the good brother and sister stand by a radio apparatus awaiting results. Their faces grow long and incredibly longer as hope is deferred. A newspaper extra with the results of the finals in the high dive at last puts them out of misery and sorrow is registered as sister slowly tears the sheet of paper. That is what comes of dance halls and vampires in foreign dress.The Ending.It seems hardly necessary to finish the story, but bad films, like bad music, must finish with a loud bang. The picture falls back on reality, always the strongest card. The Chichibu Maru sails majestically into Yokohama harbor. She is beflagged from stem to stern; planes circle overhead; the American hatoba (pier) is crowded with flag-waving multitudes. Our good brother is there, with his face no shorter, but sister primps up a forgiving smile. Japanese women are trained to forgive; after marriage it is their principal duty.In the last scene we see the trio walking along the pleasant roads leading to the Meiji Pool. The swimmer carries a large towel indicating that practice has been resumed, and Long Face and little sister are happy. The coupé passes with the vamp and the villain, but the hero survives the test and stares scornfully after them for quite a while, intimating that his life henceforth will be devoted to training until the next Olympic in 1936. Virtue and athletics have triumphed and what is four years?Critics of wider experience will have to say whether or not this sort of moral news drama is on the right line of progress for the screen. Anyhow, that is how the Japanese do it. It has one good effect. A bank robbery has been committed in this city in the best modern style with automatics and automobiles—the headlines declare that \\"Chicago Has Come to Tokyo\\"—but nobody has yet blamed it on the films.

(Maya Arulpragasam)      I met Maya Arulpragasam about four or five years ago in England when I was on tour with the rapper Peaches, who was also my roommate. We stayed with Justine Frischmann, from Elastica, and she and Maya were roommates. Maya wasn't making music back then","excerpt":"she was making clothes and videos and art, spray-painting jackets. A couple months ago, I was at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, and I saw her onstage, and it was just amazing. I can't stop listening to her new album, ''Arular'' (XL/Beggars U.S.). ''Pull Up the People'' is a song that's always rotating through my head. I didn't know I needed sunshine-dancehall-booty music until I got her record.    Apostle of Hustle      I've been listening to their album ''Folkloric Feel'' (Arts & Crafts) for the past year, though it's only been out for a few months. The album has a Latin-edged, moody, sexy, dark feel with these epic songs. A lot of it uses old drum machines but they're layered over a live drummer, so it's percussion-heavy with these minor key moods.    Willy Mason      Willy Mason is another one I saw at SXSW, at a party on the 17th floor of a hotel. I walked into this conference room with folding chairs and bright lights, and there's this scruffy guy up onstage who looks like he just woke up. I don't think I moved for the next 45 minutes. It was just him and a guitar. He's got an album out, ''Where the Humans Eat'' (Team Love). I've got the lyrics to ''Hard Hand to Hold'' stuck in my head: ''It is tempting to fight/When you know that you're right,/It's hard to lie down/When you don't trust the ground.''    Lhasa (Lhasa de Sela)      I listen to a lot of field recordings, stuff from Smithsonian Folkways and the Library of Congress. The thing that's so hypnotic about them is the repetition of phrases and rhythms that puts you into this deeper state of your mind. Lhasa taps into that. Her melodies are hypnotic. She's Mexican-American, but she's lived in Quebec for a while. She sings in Spanish, French and English on her most recent album, ''The Living Road'' (Nettwerk). It has a lot of organic-sounding percussion and natural sounds; you can hear the size of the room it was recorded in. And there's something about her voice: you can tell her feet are planted on the ground, and she's not even moving -- maybe she's just holding her arm out in front of her -- and she's just singing from the marrow of her bones.    Poni Hoax      The French band Poni Hoax is not the kind of thing I'm normally drawn to. I like things that are a little more broken and falling apart, something that's catching itself and sewing itself back up all while you're listening. Poni Hoax is really sewn up already. They have a record called ''Budapest'' coming out on a French label called Tigersushi (it'll be distributed in the United States in July through Forced Exposure). ''Dark disco'' is the only way I can describe it. They put a disco beat against dark minor-key melodies. They often have guest vocalists, but most of their stuff is instrumental, with live drums, a baritone sax that does a lot of the bass lines, organs and chicka-chicka rhythm guitar soaring over the top.

She was awarded the rank of commander of the Legion of Honor, appointed to the Belgian Royal Academy of French Language and Literature, and elected president of the prestigious Goncourt Academy. Marcel Proust encouraged her, Francois Mauriac heralded her as a \\"pagan and sensual woman\\" who \\"leads us irresistibly to God,\\" and Andre Gide praised her \\"intelligence,\\" her \\"mastery,\\" her \\"understanding of the most deeply kept secrets of the flesh.\\"     In his cautious new biography, the scholar Henry Lottman -- the author of critically acclaimed books on Flaubert, Camus and French intellectuals during World War II -- gives us an oddly bloodless portrait of Colette. He manages to turn her hectic and often scandalous life into a dull almanac of books written, lovers abandoned and shows performed. He manages the difficult task of making Colette's life seem dull.    Certainly the facts speak otherwise. She was given the name Sidonie Gabrielle Colette when she was born in a small provincial town in Burgundy. She fled the problems of her financially pinched family by becoming the child bride of Henry Gauthier-Villars, a Parisian writer and ladies man known as Willy. A habitue of Parisian salons and cafes, Willy introduced Colette to a sophisticated new world of writers and artists, and he also put her to work in his literary factory, a bizarre setup by which other writers fleshed out his ideas and turned them into books that were published under his name.      In the case of Colette, Willy apparently spiced up her schoolgirl reminiscences and turned them into \\"Claudine at School,\\" the first in a highly popular series of books that would turn the naughty, bisexual Claudine into a Parisian fad. According to one story, Willy locked Colette in her room to write","excerpt":"she was released only when she had managed to produce some pages of finished manuscript. Although Mr. Lottman neither confirms nor denies this story, the incident does help to explain Colette's lifelong ability to write for serial publication under distracting and often difficult conditions.     Willy not only took up with younger \\"Claudines\\" he'd met, but he also encouraged Colette's extramarital flirtations. Eventually, he went off with a young woman named Meg, while Colette set up housekeeping with the formidable Marchioness de Belbeuf. Both Colette and Willy would later try to exact vengeance by creating highly unflattering portraits of each other in their fiction.     Colette would eventually marry two more times: her second husband was the charming and seductive newspaper editor Henry de Jouvenel, who would introduce her to journalism; the third was a debonair jewelry salesman named Maurice Goudeket, who would stay by her side throughout the long struggle with arthritis that marked her final years. In between, there was a much-talked-about affair with her stepson, Bertrand de Jouvenel, an affair that would eerily recall the romance between the older woman and younger man described in \\"Cheri.\\"     Although her involvement with Bertrand began after \\"Cheri\\" had been completed, much of Colette's writing mirrored her life as she was living it. Sometimes, as in \\"The Ripening Seed\\" (which also depicted an older woman who instructs and seduces a younger man), fiction echoed real life. In other cases, like \\"Break of Day\\" (which suggested a renunciation of love), it obscured the actual events that were shaping the writer's daily existence.     Always in need of money, Colette wrote constantly. She wrote about her pets, her husbands, her lovers and her mother, and she wrote about the theater, fashion and makeup. She wrote while touring with a scandalous show (in \\"La Chair,\\" her bodice was ripped open on stage, exposing a naked breast), and she wrote while waiting for the Germans to march into Paris. Although her husband Maurice Goudeket was Jewish, she also wrote for collaborationist and openly anti-Semitic journals.     In relating such events, Mr. Lottman neither judges Colette's actions nor tries to portray her state of mind. In fact, his biography is almost devoid of all efforts to interpret her life or her work. There is no real analysis of her politics, no serious assessment of her work (in terms of themes, influences or literary merit), no depiction of her inner, imaginative life.     On many important questions, Mr. Lottman seems unwilling or unable to supply answers. He points out that it's impossible to know just how Colette and Willy began their collaboration on the Claudine books. He says he doesn't know how Colette and Henry de Jouvenel first met, or the exact reasons for the breakup of their marriage. And he leaves considerable gaps in her problematic relationship with her daughter, Colette 2d, as well.     Instead of giving the reader his own hand-painted portrait of Colette, Mr. Lottman relies on other people's reports and reminiscences to string together a series of cameo snapshots. We see the young Colette dressed as a schoolgirl, with Willy dressed in his proverbial top hat. We see her prancing and preening onstage: in one reviewer's words, as a \\"savage little gypsy, only just clothed in rags.\\" And we see her, toward the end, receiving visitors and tributes, as she lies on a sofa bed, surrounded by books and bibelots. Given Mr. Lottman's highly detached biography, these glimpses of Colette end up feeling like pictures of a stranger, not someone we've come to know.

To be a Jew in cosmopolitan America, the child of a national boom that seemed to promise immortality, was to take life, liberty and security for granted. Our identity and language were fixed from birth, our aspirations unlimited. Raised in Westchester County, we thought of ourselves as Americans first and foremost. We knew the basic facts of our Jewish heritage, but the soul of that identity, the awareness of the confluence of history through the veins of Judaism, was not a vital part of our schooling.
