It was one of many scenes of explosive violence in the solar atmosphere revealed in a new scientific motion picture, \\"Action on the Sun,\\" which had its world première yesterday at the McAlpin Hotel. The occasion was the meeting of the astronomy section of the association.The picture, which left its distinguished audience breathless, was exhibited by Dr. Donald H. Menzel, Professor of Astrophysics at Harvard University, in the course of a lecture in which he presented a new theory on the origin of sunspots, a theory based on the new observations of the goings-on on the sun revealed by the motion picture. The pictures were taken at the High Altitude Observatory of Harvard University and the University of Colorado, at Climax, Col.The studies were sponsored jointly by the Office of Naval Research, the Air Materiel Command and the National Bureau of Standards.A careful study of 15,000 feet of the motion picture film, obtained since 1943 chiefly by Dr. Menzel's colleague, Dr. Walter O. Roberts, at Climax, \\"has led to a complete revision of the system of prominence classification,\\" Dr. Menzel said. Solar prominences are filamentary clouds of luminous gas in constant violent motion.\\"In addition,\\" he told the astronomers, \\"the study has resulted in a new theory of the prominences, flares and corona, and in a new explanation of the relationship of these solar phenomena to the earth.\\"The films \\"show clearly,\\" he reported, that downward-moving matter appears to be much more prevalent than upward-moving material. Since what comes down must have gone up, \\"we conclude that a large fraction of the upward-moving gases must rise invisibly.\\"\\"There seem to be two sources of such motions,\\" Dr. Menzel continued. \\"We observe geyser-like activity in the neighborhood of sunspots, although most of the ejected material seems to fall back to the solar surface.\\"Probably the most effective source of the gases is an activity recently discovered by Dr. Roberts and called by him the 'Polar Spicules.' These objects are bubbling, spurting jets, which shoot out a core of luminous gas that fades away while it is still rising.\\"In all probability these expanding jets go to form the solar corona, whose delicate streamers follow graceful curves. As Bigelow showed sixty years ago, the pattern of these coronal rays strongly suggests the lines of force emanating from a magnetized sphere. Later work by Stormer, on the motions of charged particles in a magnetic field, placed the theory on a sound basis.\\"The relationship of the corona to the prominences has, however, not been evident. And yet some very simple explanations are possible. Sunspots, too, possess powerful magnetic fields. Ions and electrons, spiraling along the magnetic lines of force, tend to be focused in the vicinity of sunspots. In fact, the motion pictures exhibit a funneling action, in which matter streams through a funnel-shaped region, whose shape remains the same even though the matter within is constantly changing.\\"Occasionally, he pointed out, the internal pressure of the gases moving inside the funnel are so great that the walls \\"spring a leak.\\"The matter \\"streams in graceful curves,\\" he said, adding that a detailed analysis of the physical situation discloses that \\"the moving matter carries the lines of magnetic force along with it.\\"The complex network of magnetic lines of force around the sun, Dr. Manzel said, must be regarded as \\"a sort of semi-flexible roof to the sun.\\" If the concentration of coronal material in some region becomes too great, these lines of force, namely the solar magnetic roof, will sag, \\"as if a pocket of snow were causing partial collapse of a tent whose roof was made of rubber.\\" The deeper the hole, the more the accumulation will increase.\\"Much the same sort of condition obtains on the sun,\\" Dr. Menzel explained. \\"The prominences other than associated with sunspots are largely due to such caving action.\\"The gradual overlapping of a number of such holes, with the stretched zone between, results in a prominence region shaped something like the Grand Canyon of Arizona. The result is a long, twisting ribbon that may extend more than a million miles across the [solar] disk.\\"Sometimes these filaments become more active than usual. More matter flows from them than the sources are able to replenish. Then, when the 'river is nearly dry,' the natural springiness of the magnetic shell reasserts itself. The forces cause the material to rise.\\"Sometimes the prominences form a huge arch, at other times they resemble a scarf, flapping in the breeze, the pictures showed. This means, according to Dr. Menzel, that the magnetic lines of force, acting in the manner of a child's rubber sling-shot, have catapulted the material upward, whence it cascades gracefully back to the solar surface.\\"This theory,\\" he added, \\"fits quantitatively with the equations describing the action of such a magnetic field and the known properties of solar prominences.\\"The theory even suggests, he said, that sunspots, whose true nature is still unknown, may arise \\"through a collapse of the magnetic roof, with a sharp concentration of the magnetic lines of force.\\" This part of theory, however, was described by Dr. Menzel as \\"quite tentative.\\"\\"This picture of prominence activity,\\" he continued, \\"makes it clear that any matter reaching the earth from the sun probably comes mainly from the polar spicules. The correlation between the occurrence of a brilliant hydrogen flare on the surface of the sun, followed by a magnetic storm on the earth some twenty-four hours later, does not necessarily mean that the flare ejected material earthward.\\"Indeed, the flares seem to be prominence formations, with a definite preference for downward motions. Thus the indication is that the solar flares and terrestrial [magnetic] storms are the effects of a sudden outburst of solar spicule action, from the poles of the sun.\\"Dr. Menzel was aided in his studies by Dr. John W. Evans, Dr. Julian Schwinger, Dr. M. S. Vallarta, Dr. J. H. Van Vleck, Dr. Edward Teller and Dr. Walter O. Roberts.

Valnikov and Natalie Zimmerman are Los Angeles city police detectives and, as written by Joseph Wambaugh and played by Robert Foxworth and Paula Prentiss, they are two of the most unexpectedly appealing characters to be seen in any contemporary movie, though it takes a while to get their measure.Valnikov, a police department veteran due for retirement soon, goes through his days with terrible hangovers that give him the appearance of someone walking underwater. He is painfully polite, as if to ward off any kind of confrontation that would create a noise. When his wife walked out on him some years before, taking their son with her, she told Valnikov that he was boring and, worse, out of date, and he seems to have believed her.Valnikov is still a physically strong man but he is an emotional wreck. Alone at night in the apartment he shares with a gerbil and a parakeet, he has nightmares. When he drinks, which is often, he listens to sentimental gypsy music that recalls his White Russian heritage and a world he could never have known. \\"My parents didn't come here for a better life,\\" he says with a hopelessness that, in California, is both out of date and out of place, \\"they left all that behind them.\\"At the beginning of \\"The Black Marble,\\" directed by Harold Becker and adapted by Mr. Wambaugh from his own novel, Valnikov is a likely candidate for Skid Row in the 80's. As discreetly as possible, he is withdrawing from life, which he would continue to do were it not for a kidnapped show dog, the show dog's weepy owner who gains Valnikov's sympathy, and especially for Natalie Zimmerman, who is appalled by Valnikov's soft heart. As Natalie says more than once, she would never run into a burning house to save a bowl of goldfish.Clearly Valnikov is not the sort of officer to be paired with Natalie Zimmerman, a tall, good-looking, tough-talking policewoman who has no patience with a man who drinks too much and who, as she notices, does his tailoring with a staple gun. Natalie, who's also divorced and has a daughter in college, talks like someone who's read a lot of self-help books. She's worked too hard to put her life in order to allow some rummy, over-the-hill cop to mess things up by reintroducing her to an uncertain future.This is pretty much what happens in \\"The Black Marble,\\" a peculiarly endearing comedy that is hopelessly romantic and bluntly crude. Rather like Valnikov on a binge, the movie sort of lurches along with great good will and an immense desire to please, acknowledging but not being thrown off by urban corruption and craziness — the Big City's distress signals — that surround Valnikov and Natalie from the day of their first assignment until, reluctantly, they fall in love.Largely because of the performances, I think, \\"The Black Marble\\" is far more entertaining as a movie than as a book. Mr. Wambaugh (\\"The Onion Field,\\" \\"The Choirboys,\\" etc.) is better describing characters — how they look and talk — than he is analyzing them.Mr. Foxworth, who was most recently seen in the best forgotten \\"Prophecy,\\" is excellent as the exhausted Valnikov. It's a funny, humane, complex role of a sort that doesn't come along very often. As a pragmatic woman struggling to keep her sanity in a world full of eccentrics, some less dangerous than others, Miss Prentiss is a model of sweetly furious desperation and incredulity. They are very good company.Heading the fine supporting cast is Harry Dean Stanton, who appears as Philo Skinner, a handler of show dogs, a seedy, psychotic, serio-comic villain whose one attempt at extortion ends badly for everyone except Valnikov and Natalie. Equally good is Barbara Babcock, who plays the poor but proud society woman whose dog becomes Philo's unfortunate victim. It's one indication of the surprising way in which \\"The Black Marble\\" works — and how able the actors are — that a scene in which this woman laments the loss of her dog is neither funny at her expense nor cruel.\\"The Black Marble,\\" which opens today at Loew's Astor Plaza and other theaters, is not without its flaws. Its shifts in moods are sometimes uncertain. There are times it seems to want to shock. We're also given a long psychiatric profile of Valnikov — via almost subliminal flashbacks and long speeches of exposition — that is facile as well as unnecessary in a movie so rich in observable detail.Novels exist in a simultaneous past, present and future","excerpt":"movies take place in a continuous present. When a movie is as solidly based in character as \\"The Black Marble\\" is, there's no need to inventory a past that becomes implicit in every moment of the present. That's an achievement of Mr. Wambaugh's script and Mr. Becker's direction of it.\\"The Black Marble,\\" which has been rated PG (\\"parental guidance suggested\\"), includes some vulgar language and some brief but graphic scenes of violence.

And photographers might still be hounding the poor woman. Hundreds and hundreds of photographs are the subjects of ''MARILYN MONROE: STILL LIFE,'' an ''American Masters'' special on PBS (Wednesday, check local listings). Some are reassuringly familiar, some are rarely seen, and a lot are breathtaking. New York plays a major role. Those famous billowing-white-dress shots for ''The Seven Year Itch,'' for instance, were taken on a subway grate at Lexington and 52nd, an intersection that looked very different in 1955. One photographer shows what he says are the only pictures taken when Monroe was pregnant, during her marriage to Arthur Miller. Notable admirers, including NORMAN MAILER, GLORIA STEINEM and HUGH HEFNER, wax poetic. Monroe speaks, too, in audio and video interviews. In one, she recalls growing up and beginning to be noticed by men. ''The world became friendly,'' she says. ''It opened up to me.''    For those who haven't seen the Al Gore global-warming documentary, ''An Inconvenient Truth'' -- or who just can't get enough of the bad news about the future of our planet -- TOM BROKAW covers a lot of the same territory in ''GLOBAL WARMING: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW'' (Discovery Channel, Sunday at 9 p.m.).

It is known as \\"Ein Burschenlied Aus Heidelberg.\\" Its slender but none the less captivating romance is one of the German university, many of the scenes possessing the distinct advantage of having been photographed in Heidelberg.It is another Teutonic film which can be understood to a certain extent by those unfamiliar with German, especially after a perusal of the narrative synopsis on the program. Three of the songs are bound to win great favor. They are: \\"Ich Liebe, Du Liebst, Er Liebt,\\" \\"Komm Herunter, Rosalinde\\" and \\"Mein Herz Haengt An Dir.\\" The music for these renditions was composed by Hans May and the lyrics by Ernst Neubach.But this picture does not depend wholly upon these charming refrains, for its director, Karl Hartl, has endowed his work with imagination and an agreeable sense of humor.Betty Bird, who, notwithstanding her English name, is a Teutonic player, gives a most ingratiating performance as Elinor Miller, Willi forst is excellent as Robert Dahlberg, the student who wins Elinor's love, and Hans Brausewetter does splendidly as Dahlberg's rival, Werner Bornemann.The first few flashes are in New York, but after that the winsome Elinor goes to Heidelberg, where she takes a postgraduate course. She is the only girl in the classroom and her first appearance is not precisely conducive to study. As she wears a hat that covers her hair, it is conceded that Dahlberg may court her without opposition if she is a blonde, and that if she is a brunette the indomitable Bornemann is to be free to pursue her. To satisfy the two students Elinor snatches off her hat and reveals her hair to be the happy medium, a chestnut hue.As Dahlberg teaches Elinor to conjugate German verbs in song, such as \\"Ich Liebe, Du Liebst, Er Liebt,\\" Bornemann soon discovers that he stands no chance against his rival to win Elinor. Bornemann in pique composes a song which he sings before a group of the students, including Dahlberg, and the latter slaps Bornemann's face, with the result that there is a challenge to a duel of honor.The incidents leading up to the duel have their amusing angles and also a suggestion of serious turns. Bornemann's uncle is terrified at the dexterity with which his nephew slashes off the nose of a dummy, and he forthwith persuades the fair, or at least chestnut-haired, Elinor to use her influence to deter her sweetheart from fighting. There is the inevitable contretempts with the temporarily ashamed Dahlberg, but in the end he gives Bornemann the surprise of his life and love has its way.A generous amount of comedy is supplied by Herman Blass, as Sam Meyer, who follows Elinor from New York to Heidelberg to collect an inheritance tax bill. His love of Pilsener results often in delaying his search for the girl. But it is no easy matter for him to ascertain from the university offices where his quarry is quartered. Papers have to be purchased with the exact money and then filled in before Meyer receives the information. These light sequences are acted adroitly by Herr Blass and the others concerned.There are one or two stretches in which groups of students render students' songs, one of them being called \\"Ein Burschenlied aus Heidelberg,\\" which is based on an old-time composition.But the melodies that haunt one on leaving the theatre are \\"Ich Liebe, Du Liebst, Er Liebt\\" and \\"Mein Herz Haengt An Dir.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Movietone News."},{"year":"1931","title":"Lilyan Tashman and Kay Francis impersonate lilies of Broadway's fields in \\"Girls About Town,\\" the present attraction at the Paramount. This handsomely staged and ably directed production is one that affords no little laughter, but unfortunately it is burdened in the latter stages by highly improbable serious sequences.\\"Girls About Town\\" has something akin to \\"The Greeks Had a Word for it,\\" for it is chiefly concerned with the crafty methods of attractive gold-diggers in obtaining gifts from susceptible provincial men of means. Like the play, it was written by Zoë Akins and George Cukor is responsible for the compelling direction. In some respects it is an excellent fashion show, for both Miss Tashman and Miss Francis avail themselves of every opportunity to appear arrayed in the glory of the latest creations, which include gowns pajamas and bathing suits. And these actresses, representing the blonde and the brunette, look very attractive. The blonde, who is named Marie Bailey, sticks to her last, but the brunette, Wanda Howard, being of the species that gentlemen marry, falls in love and becomes the wife of a young man who only has to worry about the income tax.Eugene Pallette has the rôle of Benjamin Thomas of Lansing, Mich. Thomas has an emphatically parsimonious streak in his nature, but so long as he has money, Wanda and Marie feel sure of getting some of it from him. Thomas, a copper king, has a weakness for playing practical jokes, with the consequence that while Marie calls him Benjy to his face, he is an annoyance to her when she is talking about him to Wanda in the privacy of their boudoir.Thomas has discovered a golf ball that dissolves in water. Aboard his yacht one bright morning he offers as much as $3,000 to the girl who will dive and bring up a golf ball he throws into the water. It chances that Marie has observed Thomas, watching one of the golf balls dissolve in a glass of water. She therefore gets a real golf ball, makes her dive and, to Thomas's dismay, appears above the water with the little white sphere in her hand. The stingy Thomas is astonished and he spars for time before paying the $3,000.Marie and Wanda are on call as chatty charmers who consent to dine or sup with millionaires who might otherwise be lonely. One, Jerry Chase, a business man, is in the habit of calling them up and rewarding them with $500 or $1,000. Thomas, being mean, actually believes that Marie likes him for his cheerful disposition, if not for his appearance. On hearing his wife speaking of him as a skinflint when in a jeweler's store, Thomas buys gems worth more than $50,000, just to contradict his spouse, but he gives the bracelets, necklace and a watch to Marie, expecting to have them returned to him.The adapter of this story, however, decided that both Marie and Wanda must do something tinged with nobility. What Marie does with the jewelry has a humorous turn, but Wanda's conversation with her ex-husband over a matter of $10,000 has a ludicrous turn.Mr. Pallette is capital. Joel McCrea does quite well as the young man to whom Wanda loses her heart and Allen Dinehart gives a good performance as Jerry Chase. Others who help this film are Robert McWade and George Barbier.On the stage is \\"Morning, Noon and Night,\\" which was produced by Boris Petroff. Rubinoff conducts the Paramount orchestra.

Every hour or two, round the clock, Mr. Marble checks the barn where pregnant cows are isolated. He could lose both cow and calf if he doesn't act quickly when something goes wrong.

Bahia, the state on Brazil's northeastern coast with the nation's strongest African-Brazilian culture, emerged in the late 1960's as the cradle of the tropicalia movement, which transformed Brazilian pop by connecting local traditions to international rock. In the late 1980's, Brazilians and foreigners became newly aware of Bahia's blocos afros, orchestras of drums and percussion that play songs about black pride and resistance.   Tania Alves, who is to perform through tonight at the Ballroom, 253 West 28th Street, was born in Rio de Janeiro, but her mother is Bahian. And she is climbing on the Bahian bandwagon behind Gal Costa, tropicalia's leading interpreter, and Margareth Menezes, who is remaking current Bahian rock. On Tuesday night, wearing a modified bikini of satin, feathers and beads and dancing with hip-swiveling sensuality, Ms. Alves dedicated her set to the blocos of Bahia and to Brazil's \\"mixed blood,\\" the source, she said, of the richness and beauty of Brazilian culture.

His \\"Hermit Songs,\\" a solo he created for himself in 1961, is in part a response to a song cycle by Samuel Barber.

Though success has come relatively quickly for Everclear, a Portland, Ore., trio that has released two albums of soulful grunge-rock, the band is not new to the music industry. Mr. Alexakis used to work at several small record companies  in addition to running his own label. He has a wife, a child and a history of substance abuse, which he says he overcame a decade ago. All of this adds up to  a lot of experience, imbuing Everclear's songs, which often seem generic and forgettable at first listen, with depth and vitality.

In this 35mm category there is an enormous range of equipment availble that permits the photographer to shoot everything from extreme closeups to distorted wide-angle pictures and distant telephoto scenes.\\n\\nThe same potential photographic ''upgrading'' applies to those who switch from the 35mm format to a medium format or large format camera. Medium format cameras include those with names like Bronica, Hasselblad, Mamiya, Pentax, Rolleiflex and Yashica - all single-lensreflex cameras except for the Mamiya C330F and C220F, and the Yashica. These three models are twin-lens reflexes, like the old faithful twin-lens Rolleiflex cameras, some of which are still available on the used camera market.\\n\\nLarge format photograhy usually means view cameras, 4x5 and larger, which are normally mounted on a tripod when in use. You see the image in a ground glass, but the image is upside down. This, plus the adjustments and controls available with a view camera make the process of taking pictures with one of these cameras a slow, thoughtful process - but one which can provide superb pictorial results.

The Kingdom of Swaziland, a landlocked African country, is surrounded on three sides by South Africa and on the fourth by Mozambique. The Swazi are of Bantu origin. They are believed to have migrated in the late 1700's, under their chief Ngwane II, into what is now southeastern Swaziland, finding several different peoples there. Ngwane II and his successors united these tribal clans by the beginning of the 19th century. Although British and Boer traders began exploring the area in the 1830's, it was not until gold was discovered in the 1880's that settlers began coming in large numbers. They hoodwinked the illiterate Swazi leadership into signing away their rights to the land. The British and Boer governments agreed in 1894 that the Boers would control Swaziland, but power reverted to Great Britain after they defeated the Boers in the Boer War, which ended in 1902. Not until the 1967 did they give Swaziland authority over its internal affairs. Under the Britishauthored constitution, Swaziland gained its independence in September 1968 as a constitutional monarchy led by King Sobhuza II. He set aside the constitution in 1973 and disbanded the legislature. He ruled the country with the aid of a council of conservative ministers and named a committee to write a new constitution that was supposed to be more in keeping with Swazi traditions. A new legislature was created in 1979. The king died in 1982 and was replaced by his 18-year-old son, who took the name King Mswati III, in 1986.

The notes themselves, though not always as easily mastered as Schnabel implies, present few problems -- few, certainly, compared to those in the florid Granados pieces that Miss de Larrocha offered later in her program. In the Mozart sonatas, it is often the very simplicity of means that is intimidating. Every lapse of taste, bluntness of phrase or miscalculation of balances leaps out.   Miss de Larrocha, a one-time child prodigy now in her late 60's, has been performing in New York for a quarter of a century. She has reached a point in her artistic development and in her career that any musician would envy. Attention no longer needs to be drawn to her virtuosity, long since a given in her profession -- that she is known as a Granados specialist would alone testify to that. Furthermore, like Arthur Rubinstein, Rudolf Serkin and a few others, the tiny Spanish artist has drawn to her a fond audience that hangs on her every phrase.

There we find mutual affection and admiration, a seemingly selfless and noncompetitive bond between two superlative musical minds.\\n\\nHigh praise from nobility and even royalty meant little to Mozart, who never doubted his own worth. Haydn was the only contemporary he revered, and it was to him that he dedicated a volume of six string quartets in 1785 with an eloquent inscription addressed to the older master as his ''father, guide and friend.'' At least three of these quartets were already known to Haydn, and prompted from him the enthusiastic statement (expressed to Leopold Mozart) that Wolfgang was ''the greatest composer known to me either in person or by name.'' It should be noted that these quartets could not have been written without Haydn's remarkable and pioneering string quartets Opp. 17 and 20 (published in 1772 and 1782) - a fact of which both composers were aware.

And yet, if these early stage works continue to be revived, \\"La Finta Semplice\\" (1768) may end up more satisfying to audiences than \\"Mitridate, Re di Ponto\\" (1770).   The difference, I think, has less to do with Mozart's startling compositional skills than his subject matter. Like most teen-agers, the composer was more a copier of life's grander themes than a player in them. No matter the powers of description, the tragedian must comprehend before he can describe. It is this, in the end, that makes \\"Mitridate,\\" whose performance on Monday at Alice Tully Hall began two weeks of Mozart operas in concert, less penetrable than \\"La Finta Semplice,\\" which followed it Wednesday evening.

But for one glittering 13-day span, from last Monday through this Saturday, this has become the operatic capital of the country. The reason is the first visit ever to the United States by London's Royal Opera, Covent Garden. The company is playing only here, as part of the Olympic Arts Festival, presenting 11 performances of three productions. Taken together, the three evenings rank as about the most satisfying operatic triple- header in this writer's recent experience.    Part of one's pleasure derived from the locale, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center. With a new, full-sized orchestra pit (expanded at the Royal Opera's insistence), this 3,100-seat theater can take its rightful place as one of America's finest opera facilities. Audiences, paying up to $75 for the best seats, are almost at capacity.

Both are in the opera seria style, and in the best seria tradition they show that even tyrants can be transformed into paragons of fair-mindedness and moral rectitude, usually in the last five minutes of a long work. Not incidentally, the path to enlightenment is illuminated by a parade of virtuosically florid arias that explore rage and rapture, with occasional moments of tender reflection.

For the film biography, which began a stand at the Little Carnegie on Saturday, emerges as a dull, listless and involved tale, and the ill-starred eighteenth-century genius an unconvincing and uninteresting figure. The composer and the brief excerpts of his music heard appear to be the result of uninspired imagination rather than the stuff of a truly great life.The accent in this portrait is as much on Mozart's romantic tribulations as it is on his efforts for recognition in his chosen work. The composer is shown being thwarted by his first love, after which episode he elopes with that fickle lady's sister. The jilter returns to the story as the star of \\"Don Giovanni,\\" thereby nearly breaking up the happy Mozart home. As counterpoint to romance, Mozart is undermined at court and elsewhere by a formula villain, one Antonio Salieri, a rival composer, who fears Mozart's music will supplant his own but who, nevertheless, recognizes his genius.Hans Holt is a handsome Mozart, more juvenile than harried in appearance, while Winnie Markus has a few lachrymose scenes as his love-plagued wife. Wilton Graff, a Hollywood actor, plays the glowering \\"heavy,\\" Salieri, with few flourishes, and Rene Deltgen and Irene von Meyendorff are adequate as Beethoven and Mozart's sister-in-law. Included in the score as played by the Vienna Philharmonic, are passages from \\"The Magic Flute,\\" \\"Don Giovanni,\\" \\"The Marriage of Figaro,\\" \\"The Abduction from the Seraglio\\" and the \\"Requiem.\\" But these, as well as the plot, make an ill-defined picture.

For singers and directors, \\"Die Zauberflote\\" is a peculiar balancing act. Its comic elements are meant to be farcical rather than subtle, yet the opera's main business is to describe the rite of passage from the reactive, egocentric world of childhood to the responsibilities and interactions of a fully adult world.

CITY BALLET REVIEW","excerpt":"Mozartean Elegance and Gritty Street Life"},{"year":"1992","title":"At first glance, Mozart's \\"Schauspieldirektor\\" (\\"Impresario\\") seems tailor-made for the Mozart Bicentennial at Lincoln Center. It offers an expandable framework of an opera, which can hold all manner of theatrical baggage. For the first performance, in 1786, Mozart's librettist, Gottlieb Stephanie Jr., filled it with excerpts from contemporary plays. The Lincoln Center festival, which likes to retire Kochel numbers by the handful, managed to fit nine of them into the work: the completed fragment of the opera \\"L'Oca del Cairo,\\" an aria removed from \\"Cosi Fan Tutte\\" and various numbers added to operas by Mozart and others.   At another time, the assemblage presented on Friday evening at Alice Tully Hall as the second-to-last work in Lincoln Center's two-week Festival of Mozart Operas in Concert might have proved stimulating and satisfying. The selection provided a mildly interesting cross-section of Mozart's stage work over two decades, and it came unified, more or less, with a spoken English connective text and light stage direction by the playwright Albert Innaurato. But arriving on the penultimate evening of the larger 19-month festival, it seemed almost routine: just another Mozart grab bag, of which there had already been far too many.

The comedies are Moliere's ''Don Juan,'' which Mr. Foreman mounted in Central Park for the New York Shakespeare Festival, and Noel Coward's ''Present Laughter,'' which Mr. Scott has just brought to Broadway's Circle in the Square. The two productions, like the plays, couldn't be more different in terms of sensibility or achievement, yet the headstrong (one might say arrogant) modus operandi in each one is identical. Both directors have cut and somewhat rewritten the original texts, partially yanking them out of their social and esthetic contexts. They've also performed radical surgery on Moliere and Coward's famous heroes. While Don Juan and the actor Garry Essendine are both written as debonair, hedonistic rakes, Mr.  Foreman and Mr. Scott transform them into overweight, rumpled, even sexless clowns.

All three candidates have lengthy political records. The Republican candidate, Arliss Sturgulewski, spent 12 years in the State Senate and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1986. Wally Hickel, who served as Alaska's Governor from 1966 to 1968, differentiated himself from Mrs. Sturgulewski on abortion, which he opposes.   The Democratic candidate, Tony Knowles, 47, made his first bid for governor by emphasizing his role as Mayor of Anchorage. Gov. Steve Cowper did not seek re-election.    Personality upstaged policy in the race for Alaska's sole seat in the House of Representatives. The Republican candidate, Don Young squared off against a former Mayor of Valdez, John S. Devens. ARIZONA    Notable among the state's Congressional races was the Second District's. The Democratic incumbent, Morris K. Udall, head of the House Interior Committee, defeated Joseph D. Sweeney, a law school administrator. Mr. Udall, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, said in May that he planned to retire in 1993.    J. Fife Symington, a Republican and a developer, and Terry Goddard, a Democrat and former Mayor of Phoenix, ran a hotly fought race for Governor.    In winning the Republican nomination, Mr. Symington beat out Evan Mecham, who was impeached and removed as Governor in 1988.   Mr. Goddard, the son of a former Governor, resigned as Mayor to run for the post, after serving as the head of the National League of Cities.  COLORADO    In the most hotly contested race in Colorado, Republican Representative Hank Brown won the Senate seat left open by the retirement of William L. Armstrong. Mr. Brown, who raised a large campaign treasury, defeated Josie Heath, a former Boulder County Commissioner who expended nearly all her campaign funds to win a rough primary race.    Mr. Brown's run at the Senate left open his Fourth District seat. The Republican candidate there was State Senator Wayne Allard, a veterinarian who managed Mr. Brown's re-election campaigns in 1984 and 1986. His opponent, State Representative Dick Bond, is a professional biologist and former president of the University of Northern Colorado.    The Governor, Roy Romer, is a popular Democrat who never faced any serious competition. He easily defeated the Republican candidate, John Andrews.  CALIFORNIA     Two former Mayors, Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson, fought a tough race for governor.  Ms. Feinstein is a Democrat and a former Mayor of San Francisco","excerpt":"Mr.  Wilson is a Republican, a former mayor of San Diego and currently a United States Senator.     Gov. George Deukmejian, a Republican, did not run for re-election.     In three major Congressional races, incumbents faced strong challenges: Charles Pashayan, a Republican, from the Democratic candi date, Calvin Dooley; George E. Brown Jr., a Democrat, from the Republican candidate, Bob Hammock, and Alfred A. McCandless, a Republican, from the Democratic candidate, Ralph Waite.    There were 28 ballot issues. \\"Big Green,\\" as one environmental proposition was called, was defeated, as was another proposition to limit terms of state officials.  HAWAII    Senator Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat appointed to the seat after the death in April of Spark M. Matsunaga, defeated Representative Patricia Saiki, a Republican in her second term in the House. Republicans had seen this state as perhaps their best chance to pick up a seat in the Senate, as they hoped Ms. Saiki could make inroads into the customary support Democrats enjoy among Hawaiians of Japanese descent.    State Senator Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat, beat Mike Liu, leader of the Republicans in the State House, for one Congressional seat. Former Representative Patsy Mink, a Democrat who was appointed to Mr. Akaka's seat when he was named to the Senate, defeated former State Representative Andy Poepoe for the other seat. Gov. John Waihee, a Democrat, won re-election.  IDAHO    The incumbent Governor, Cecil D. Andrus, a 59-year-old Democrat, defeated Roger Fairchild, a Republican and former majority leader of the State Senate.    He served as Governor from 1971 to 1977 and as President Jimmy Carter's Interior Secretary from 1977 to 1981 before becoming Governor again.   Earlier in the year he vetoed what would have been a highly restrictive state abortion law. For his part, Mr. Fairchild was a declared foe of abortion before winning the Republican gubernatorial nomination.    With incumbent Republican Senator James A. McClure, 65, retiring, the race for his seat was between Representative Larry E. Craig, a Republican, and Ron Twilegar, a Democrat and former state legislator. The victor was Mr. Craig.   Competing for Mr. Craig's Congressional seat were Larry LaRocco, a Democrat and stockbroker, and State Senator C. A. Smyser, a Republican.  MONTANA    Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat, won a third term after shunning the complacency of his former colleague, Senator John Melcher. Mr. Melcher, a Democrat, ignored his campaign until the summer of 1988 and was defeated by Conrad Burns, a little known Republican.   Mr. Baucus spent more than a year barnstorming the state and raised more than $2 million in his campaign against Lieut. Gov. Allen C. Kolstad, his Republican opponent. Mr. Kolstad evoked criticism last July by calling threats of acid rain and global warming \\"scare tactics.\\"   Representative Pat Williams, a six-term Democrat who was co-author of a compromise measure that continued Federal funding for the National Endowment for the Arts while leaving decisions on obscenity to the courts, was re-elected in the First District race by Brad Johnson, a former state party official. Mr. Johnson accused Mr. Williams of supporting pornography.  NEVADA    Bob Miller, the Democrat who stepped into the Governor's office two years ago when the incumbent, Richard H. Bryan, was elected to the Senate, sought his own gubernatorial victory to run one of the country's fastest-growing states. He got it.    Mr. Miller, the 45-year-old former two-term District Attorney from Las Vegas, stressed improving education and diversifying the state's economy.   He won easily over Jim Gallaway, a 50-year-old lawyer and former Marine who achieved considerable financial success with his own telecommunications companies.    In the Second District, four-term Representative Barbara F. Vucanovich, a Republican, defeated Jane Wisdom, a State Assemblywoman. NEW MEXICO    With the incumbent Governor, Garrey Carruthers, ineligible to try for re-election, former Gov. Bruce King was the Democratic candidate for the post.   In an energetic race, he beat former State Representative Frank Bond, the Republican candidate.   The 66-year-old Mr. King, a rancher and businessman, was Governor from 1971 to 974 and again from 1979 to 1982. In this year's campaign, he stressed education, the environment and economic development. To spur economic development, he called for steps to create more growth in the state's private business sector.    Mr. Bond, a 47-year-old lawyer and rancher with land interests, also stressed economic policies, calling for various measures to promote diversfied development and create additonal jobs in the state.    Senator Pete V. Domenici, a third-term Republican, crushed his challenger, Democratic State Senator Tom R. Benavides.  OREGON    After four terms in the Senate, Mark O. Hatfield, the Republican once best known as a dove on defense issues, defeated Harry Lonsdale, a wealthy Democratic businessman with environmental credentials. But Mr. Lonsdale's appeal forced Mr. Hatfield into an aggressive and uncharacteristically negative campaign.   In the race for governor, Attorney General David Frohnmayer, a Republican, went into the campaign a favorite to succeed Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, a Democrat who is retiring. But by the end of the campaign, Secretary of State Barbara Roberts, a Democrat, came on strong.    Support for Mr. Frohnmayer was partly eroded by a third candidate, Al Mobley, a conservative-independent who emphasized his opposition to abortion.    In the northwest corner of the state, Mike Kopetski, a Democrat, mounted another strong campaign against Representative Denny Smith, a Republican. Mr. Kopetski fell just 707 votes short of Mr. Smith two years ago. This time, Mr. Smith was hurt by a combination of bad publicity over his links to the savings and loan industry, a heavy-handed radio advertisement that featured sound of a Hitler rally as Mr. Smith accused Mr. Kopetski of \\"appeasement,\\" and Mr. Smith's support of the timber industry.   Democrats currently control both the House and Senate, but the loss of only two House seats would cost them control there and give the Republicans a chance to influence redistricting next year.  UTAH    Representative Wayne Owens of Salt Lake City, who has been the only Democrat in Utah's delegation, defeated a challenge from Genevieve Atwood, a 44-year old Republican who is a former state representative and former state geologist.    Another Democrat, Bill Orton, will join the delegation, in the Provo seat left open by Representative Howard C. Nielson, a Republican who is retiring. Mr. Orton, a tax lawyer and first-time candidate, won a battle for the traditionally Republican seat by defeating former State Senator Karl Snow, a professor and administrator at Brigham Young University, who was the subject of a Provo Herald investigation into his ownership of certain stocks and his business association with a convicted felon.  WASHINGTON     Two spirited House contests and ballot refer endums on tax limita tions and the environ ment confronted the voters.    From the moment that Representative Jolene Unsoeld was elected to Congress in 1988 by only 618 votes, she became a leading target of the Republicans. Her opponent was Bob Williams, a former State Representative. He accused Mrs.Unsoeld of being a typical \\"tax and spend liberal.\\" She said Mr. Williams was anti-environment and conservative.     In another contest, Representative John Miller, a conservative Republican in his third term representing the First Congressional District in northern Seattle, was challenged by Cynthia Sullivan, a member of the King County Council. She said Mr. Miller had neglected local problems, including traffic congestion, and voted wrong on environmental issues. But his endorsement by the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters deflated that issue.    The ballot included proposals to limit property taxes to 1 percent of the true value of property and to give preferred treatment to properties that complied with safety and health standards or had low-income housing.  WYOMING    Wyoming Democrats conceded they never had much chance of defeating Senator Alan K. Simpson, a national figure who is the second most powerful Republican in the Senate. The best candidate they could come up with was Kathy Helling, a 32-year-old sociology major at the University of Wyoming who defeated five other equally unknown primary candidates.    It was a lopsided contest. Mrs. Helling spent about $6,000 on her losing campaign, compared with more than $1 million raised by Mr. Simpson.    In Wyoming's sole Congressional district, Craig Thomas, a Republican who was chosen in a special election last year to replace Dick Cheney when he was named Secretary of Defense, ran against Peter Maxfield, a Democratic lawyer.    Gov. Michael Sullivan, a Democrat, won re-election, defeating Mary Mead.

Last year Ms. Akiyoshi, the pianist and formidable jazz composer, put her big band aside, signing off with a terrific show at Carnegie Hall; now she starts the next phase of her career in New York, with the first booking of her trio at the club where she usually plays. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover charge is $40, with a $10 minimum at the tables and one drink at the bar (Ben Ratliff).    * THE BAD PLUS, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Streeet, West Village, (212) 255-4037. With a bona fide jazz pianist (Ethan Iverson) and bassist (Reid Anderson) and a slightly more rockish drummer (David King), the Bad Plus has baited rock-haters by working rock-radio hits into its repertory. The band's semi-joking gestures continue; the latest cover it has been playing is Queen's ''We Are the Champions.'' But so does its more serious side, in strong original compositions, especially by the undersung Mr. Anderson. Tonight through Sunday night at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tomorrow; cover charge is $30 (Ratliff).    CANNONBALL ADDERLEY TRIBUTE, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121. A homage to the sweetest-toned saxophone player in history, by several of his prominent admirers: James Moody, James Carter and Vincent Herring, who can suggest his sound with real gusto. Tonight through Sunday night at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $35, and there is a $10 minimum (Ratliff).    * CHARLES DAVIS QUARTET, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 675-6056. The saxophonist Charles Davis has played in supporting roles with Dinah Washington, Steve Lacy, Kenny Dorham, Sun Ra, Barry Harris and others. He is best known for playing the baritone saxophone, but he plays with a rather elegant understatement, balancing melodic embellishment with the kind of magpie's relationship to chords that Coleman Hawkins practiced. Now in his 70's, he is the kind of musician worth paying attention to: he owns the secrets of the past. Tonight and tomorrow night at 10:30, midnight, 1:30 and 2:30; cover charge is $10 (Ratliff).    * DERVISH, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Dervish, a band from County Sligo, Ireland, plays traditional Irish tunes in arrangements like finely worked lace. It can sprint through dance tunes or delicately accompany Cathy Joran as she sings ballads in Gaelic or English. Tonight at 9:30; tickets are $20 (Pareles).    D.J. LE SPAM AND THE SPAM ALL-STARS, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. D.J. Le Spam's regular club shows became a sensation in Miami, where he mixed the electronic rhythms of dance-club music with live musicians steeped in Cuban salsa, and the balance has tipped toward the live band. S.O.B.'s has given him a New York outpost. Tonight at 11; tickets are $15 (Pareles).    * DO MAKE SAY THINK, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. This Toronto group specializes in rough-edged, slow-building instrumental compositions. Last year, Do Make Say Think released ''Winter Hymn Country Hymn Secret Hymn'' (Constellation), an inviting collection of tracks that cohere along the boundary between formalism and formlessness: chords and rhythms and themes disintegrate just as mysteriously as they come together. Tonight at 10, with Miho and the Mobius Band; tickets are $13 (Kelefa Sanneh).    DUKE ELLINGTON BOULEVARD MUSIC FESTIVAL, West 106th Street between Columbus Avenue and Central Park West, Manhattan, (212) 666-9774; www.columbus-amsterdam-BID.org. A second annual outdoor festival on the block named for Ellington. Featuring Felicia Collins (guitarist for the David Letterman band) and her band, the Life; the drummer Charlie Persip and his group, Supersound; the old school funk-and-soul singer Carlton J. Smith; Jack Jeffers's New York Classics; the Barry Altschul Quartet; New York Jazz Guerillas; and Laura Wolfe. Sunday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.; there will be food stands, and the music is free (Ratliff).    DAVID GRISMAN, Strand Theater, Fourth Street and Clifton Avenue, Lakewood, N.J., (732) 367-7789. Before phrases like ''new acoustic music'' or ''bluegrass revival'' were being bandied around, Mr. Grisman was picking his mandolin in what he named ''dawg music,'' a perfectly noncommittal moniker for string-band music that cheerfully picks its way through country, bluegrass, jazz, klezmer, Brazilian choros and whatever else Mr. Grisman finds engaging. Tonight at 8; tickets are $30 to $35 (Pareles).    GIBBY HAYNES AND HIS PROBLEM, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Gibby Haynes was the growling, taboo-twisting leader of the Butthole Surfers, and his new band knocks together a lot of the same psychedelia, noise and twang, with boasts like ''Been a long time since I lost my mind.'' Tomorrow night at 11:30, with the Fakers at 9:30 and Heroine Sheiks at 10:30; tickets are $12 in advance, $14 tomorrow (Pareles).    EDDIE HENDERSON QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. If you're looking for that quintessential New York jazz experience -- tough as nails yet harmonically stimulating, both a physical and an intellectual experience -- you should try this group, which includes the pianist Dave Kikoski, the bassist Ed Howard and the drummer Victor Lewis. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20 (Ratliff).    INCREDIBLE STRING BAND, the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, between Richards and Columbia Streets, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007; Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. In the 1960's, the Incredible String Band fused Celtic traditions with psychedelic whimsy and all sorts of international inflections, from ragas to Middle Eastern music to Gilbert and Sullivan. A new collegiate generation has rediscovered the band as a precursor to folky experimenters like Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom. Although the group's main songwriter, Robin Williamson, left after a 2000 reunion, two of its three founders, Mike Heron (on stringed and keyboard instruments) and Clive Palmer (on banjo) have kept the name and are leading a five-member band. Their sets have lately been including ''A Very Cellular Song,'' Mr. Heron's playful epic of evolution. At the Hook tonight at 11, with Samara Lubelski at 9 and Espers at 10; tickets are $15. At Joe's Pub tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9:30; tickets are $20 (Pareles).    JEWEL, Ives Concert Park, Western Connecticut State University Boulevard, Danbury, Conn., (203) 837-9226. With a voice that can be sweet and folky or leap up to country yodeling and a repertory of good-hearted songs that have no fear of clichés, Jewel conquered MTV and the pop charts in the 1990's. Her most recent album was a partial dance-music makeover that left her core unchanged. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $30 for lawn seats, $55 to $150 for reserved seats, $25 and $45 for students (Pareles).    * GABY KERPEL, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Gaby Kerpel writes the music for the airborne acrobatic troupe De La Guarda. He's from Buenos Aires, and in his own music fragments of Argentine memory are recast amid cosmopolitan electronics. He is promising a multimedia performance for this show. Sunday night at 9:30; tickets are $12 (Pareles).    * MADLIB, PEANUT BUTTER WOLF, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236. Two of the most successful underground hip-hop producers (Madlib also raps) come to town for a night of dusty old breakbeats and dusty new old-fashioned breakbeats. Expect a casual show full of mutant collaboration and good-natured weirdness. Tonight at 9; tickets are $15 (Sanneh).    NOXAGT, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. A Norwegian trio consisting of bass, drums and viola. The racket they make is sometimes growly and propulsive, sometimes raspy and airy, with lopsided riffs that sound as if they were first written out on a chalkboard, then played. Tonight at 10; admission is $8 (Sanneh).    OLD 97'S, CHUCK PROPHET, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. The Old 97's, from Dallas, use the twang of country and the kick of rock in songs that veer from wisecracks to heartbreak. Lately the jokes have been receding as Rhett Miller's songs reach deeper. Mr. Prophet played guitar in the Los Angeles band Green on Red in the 1980's. Lately, he has been exploring the outcast side of Americana, applying his gruff voice and oblique humor to songs rooted in twangy country, Tex-Mex and blues but mixing them with samples and drum machines, too. Tonight at 8; tickets are $25 (Pareles).    * ONEIDA, THE FIGGS, BEANS, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Oneida leans hard on the keyboard-driven minimal rock of the early 1980's for songs that are joyfully relentless. It revs up frantic, obsessive patterns to carry thoughts about sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll and a dystopian future. Joining the pop-punk lineage that stretches back to the early, rowdy Beatles and any number of 1960's garage bands, the Figgs make their guitars blare through the neat constructions of their songs. They sing about rejects and romantic also-rans, with a streak of resentment that's as strong as their melodic skills. Beans, from Antipop Consortium, is a rapper whose free-associations are ever unpredictable. Also on the bill, a benefit for children's war relief charities, are King of France, Oxford Collapse, the Spunklads and the Quick Fix Kills. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $15 in advance, $17 tomorrow (Pareles).    * HOUSTON PERSON QUARTET, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue, at 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 427-0253. A veteran tenor saxophonist who keeps things pleasurable. His background is in the 1950's, when a good deal of jazz was completely submerged in rhythm and blues, and he is one of the few mainstream jazz performers today who can routinely find access to the deep language of pleasure from that time. (Most of the others became session musicians, went deeper into the studiousness of jazz or into the meat and potatoes of rock 'n' roll, or disappeared.) Mr. Person has an elastic, sequential solo-building style that links him to Sonny Rollins, and a fat, breathy tone that links him to Ben Webster. Enjoy him. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 10:30 and midnight; cover charge is $15, and there is a one-drink minimum (Ratliff).    MADELEINE PEYROUX, Le Jazz Au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 308-9455. A vocalist who emerged in the mid-90's from singing in the New Orleans streets, Ms. Peyroux could inhabit Billie Holiday and Édith Piaf, doing the tragic, pinched-voice thing perfectly. She still can and does -- that little voice remains somehow central to her -- but on ''Careless Love,'' her first album in eight years, she enlarges and updates the repertory, wading into the Elliott Smith and Jesse Harris catalogs. Tonight and tomorrow night are at 8 and 10; cover charge is $40 (Ratliff).    * MARIANNE PILLSBURY, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. On her debut album, ''The Wrong Marianne'' (www.mariannepillsbury.com), Ms. Pillsbury is as frank as Liz Phair and as tuneful and upbeat as the Go-Go's, dissecting romantic disasters and then bouncing back with lighthearted choruses. She's as tough as she is irrepressible. Sunday night at 9 with Steve Shiffman and the Land of No at 10, the Savage Juliet at 8 and Omnisoul at 7; admission is $8 (Pareles).    PRINCE PO, PHARAOHE MONCH, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. The rapper Prince Po headlines this show, but he is to be joined by Pharaohe Monch, his former partner in the surreal 1990's hip-hop duo Organized Konfusion, whose oeuvre includes a ridiculous (or is it sublime?) track called ''Releasing Hypnotical Gases,'' which was both a virtuoso display of sci-fi lyricism and -- as you may have guessed -- an extended flatulence joke. Here's hoping they revive some of the old tongue-twisters at this show. Sunday night at 8, with Rockwilder; tickets are $10 (Sanneh).    THE ROGERS SISTERS, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. This proudly retro trio excavates the sharp, twitchy postpunk of yesteryear, emphasizing not only the music's severity but its propensity for playfulness, too. The Rogers Sisters' new mini-album, ''Three Fingers'' (Troubleman Unlimited), nods to the sing-song choruses of the Delta 5 and even the sardonic pop of Devo. Tonight at 8, with Pilot to Gunner, the noisy hip-hop trio Dälek, Shy Child and more; tickets are $17 (Sanneh).    THE SAW DOCTORS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. The Saw Doctors sing earnest, folk-rocking anthems of small-town life ''for those who feel they've been mistreated/ discriminated, robbed or cheated.'' In Ireland, their populism has brought them a huge national following; even in New York City there should be plenty of voices with brogues singing along. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $30 in advance, $35 the day of the show (Pareles).    * MARIA SCHNEIDER ORCHESTRA, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Some feel that Ms. Schneider's big-band music has been revelatory from the word go, 15 years ago or so, but the music on ''Concert in the Garden'' -- her first album distributed by the Internet-based company Artist Share (at www.mariaschneider.com) -- reaches a new level of beauty and complexity. The orchestra, which has remained remarkably intact over that decade and a half, plays a four-day residence at the Jazz Standard. Tonight through Sunday night at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, $25 on Sunday (Ratliff).    * ANGIE STONE, ANTHONY HAMILTON, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y. (516) 334-0800. On albums, neo-soul is hemmed in by trying to sound like brittle, hop-hop-flavored rhythm-and-blues. Onstage, singers can be more intimate and more dynamic. Ms. Stone sings her tales of tough-minded affection with gutsy directness, not bothering with distracting vocal gymnastics. Mr. Hamilton, sings about love, loyalty and growing up in the South, and onstage he lets loose the revival-tent fervor of old Southern soul. Tonight at 8; tickets are $41.50 (Pareles).    * JEFF (TAIN) WATTS GROUP, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, below Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. Mr. Watts, who played with Wynton Marsalis's group through the 1980's, is one of the most influential, important and complete drummers of the last two decades. His attack can be monsoonlike, but he knows the value of open space, and he can take over a band with a simple, slow-building pattern. His shows this weekend are conceived as a birthday celebration for the pianist Kenny Kirkland, who died in 1998, and they feature members of his regular group (like the saxophonist Marcus Strickland) and others (like the pianist Stephen Scott). Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 a set, $10 for members (Ratliff).    * RACHAEL YAMAGATA, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. All the turbulence of young love is rolled into the songs of Ms. Yamagata, who has touches of Tori Amos, P. J. Harvey and, when she is particularly wounded or riled, Janis Joplin. Sunday night at 7:30; tickets, $15 (Pareles).

Ekaterina Sknarina's involved the Russian national rhythmic gymnastics team and several years in Cirque du Soleil. She has been performing for the last three or so years with the Great Throwdini, aka David R. Adamovich of Freeport, N.Y., a master of the impalement arts whose entertainment career stretches back to a stint as an acrobat at the 1964 World's Fair. Since June 13, Throwdini and Target Girl, who has her own dance and flexibility act, have been among the headliners of ''Maximum Risk,'' a classically styled vaudeville/sideshow revue, on Monday nights at the Soho Playhouse (www.sohoplayhouse.com","excerpt":"Mr. Adamovich's personal site is www.knifethrower.com). To deliver on the promise of the show's title, performers try to break or create a new world's record each week; on June 27, Throwdini will try to throw 120 knives in 60 seconds at Target Girl. (The current record is 77.) Recently, Greg Allen spoke with Ms. Sknarina, who lives in Queens, about her job and what makes a good target girl.    Is targeting very competitive?    Oh, no. It's a very close group of people, and there's no competition. I started in rhythmic gymnastics, I was really into it, and in Russia it is so competitive. Targeting's not like that, though. It's a very nice community.    How's the money?    It's really hard making a living being a target girl. I have my act, which is a little dancy, and a little contortion, and a little rhythmic gymnastics. There's one girl who does a bed of machetes act; she's at Equinox -- a personal trainer. And the other girl [in ''Maximum Risk''], she doesn't have her own act, she just does the targeting. She's a jewelry designer, actually, who just does it for fun.    What does it take to be a good target girl?    It all builds on trust. As long as you trust a person to throw a knife around you, you'll be fine. He has a Web site, and you'd be surprised how many girls e-mail him, saying, ''Can I please be your assistant?'' But he prefers someone who's already been with some shows, who knows how that works, and who realizes it's all about him, and it's his act, not someone who just wants to be in the spotlight.    What goes through your mind when you're up there?    The first few shows, I was nervous, and I was like, ''Don't miss!'' But it was kind of a rush. Now I've gotten used to it. Actually, you can explain the whole thing from a mathematical and physics point of view, and it's a very, very small chance to actually be stabbed.

In good part, say some scholars and other business-watchers, because they took place in different eras. Mr. Agee worked when women executives were few, male executives usually winked at one another's affairs and, in case of trouble, the woman left the company. In Mr. Hoch's time, women executives are often just down the hall, or at customers, suppliers and competitors. Disentangling business and romance can be far more difficult.

Mr. Buscemi (above, right, with Bronson Dudley) plays Tommy Basilio, an unemployed car mechanic (he ''borrowed'' $1,500 from his boss and got caught) whose life is sliding slowly into an abyss. He spends most of his time at a bar. He mourns the loss of his girlfriend (Elizabeth Bracco), who is now married to his best friend (Anthony LaPaglia) and pregnant, although the paternity of the child is questionable. Reduced to driving an ice cream truck, he finds himself flirting with an under-age neighbor (Chloë Sevigny) and that's a mistake.

In this sharp, cynical Chayefsky screenplay, directed by Arthur Hiller, Lt. Cmdr. Charles Madison (James Garner) is a World War II American naval officer in London during the buildup for D-Day.
