She called a lot of shots, said Richard Kozarski, a film historian. Miss Gish decided that Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel ''The Scarlet Letter,'' whose theme of adultery had previously been considered unsuitable for the movies, should be made into a film. She went on a crusade and was largely responsible for its production in 1926. She brought Victor Seastrom - perhaps best known to a later generation of moviegoers as the old man in ''Wild Strawberries'' (1957) - from Sweden to direct, and the 80-minute film became a classic.   Not too long after, another Swede, Greta Garbo, was imported, some say, to clip Miss Gish's wings. Miss Gish was highly paid and had power over her films","excerpt":"Miss Garbo was a newcomer who toed the mark. In the 108-minute 1928 production of ''A Woman of Affairs,'' Mr. Kozarski said, Miss Garbo ''redefines the image'' of an M-G-M star. The cast includes Lewis Stone, John Gilbert and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. GOING OUT GUIDE;"},{"year":"1930","title":"In her first talking picture, an adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's \\"Anna Christie,\\" the immensely popular Greta Garbo is even more interesting through being heard than she was in her mute portrayals. She reveals no nervousness before the microphone and her careful interpretation of Anna can scarcely be disputed. She is of the same nationality as Anna is supposed to be and she brings Anna to life all the more impressively through her foreign accent being natural, because it is something for which she does not have to strive.Miss Garbo's voice from the screen is deep toned, somewhat deeper than when one hears her in real life. The low enunciation of her initial lines, with a packed theatre waiting expectantly to hear her first utterance, came somewhat as a surprise yesterday afternoon in the Capitol, for her delivery is almost masculine. And although the low-toned voice is not what is expected from the alluring actress, one becomes accustomed to it, for it is a voice undeniably suited to the unfortunate Anna.Uunlike most of the film actresses in their débuts in talking films, Miss Garbo suits her actions to the words. She thinks about what she is saying and accompanies the lines with suitable gestures and expressions. There is no hesitancy in her speech, for she evidently memorized her lines thoroughly before going before the camera, and not in a single instance does she seem to be thinking about what she must say next, which has been the case in the first audible efforts of many of the male and female performers.In her opening scene she enters the \\"ladies' entrance\\" of a wharf saloon in New York. Marthe, her father's mistress, a drink-sodden creature well on in years, is seated at a table endeavoring to satisfy an almost unquenchable thirst with a large glass of ale and lager. Marthe quickly realizes that the girl, who orders whisky and lights a cigarette, is Chris's daughter, from whom he had just received a letter. Chris knows nothing of his daughter's crimson career, and at that moment he has gone to eat soup and drink coffee to sober up for the meeting with the girl, whom he has not seen since she was 5 years old.\\"You're me, forty years from now,\\" says Anna to Marthe. The older woman lets the girl know that Chris believes his Anna to be an example of purity. When Chris, played by George Marion, who figured in the same rôle on the stage and in the excellent silent pictorial version of several years ago, enters the bar section of the saloon, he is heard and Marthe decides to go and collect her belongings from Chris's barge and make herself scarce.Marie Dressler, who plays Marthe, may overact occasionally, but most of her performance is exceptionally clever. She, with all Marthe's bibulous nature, elicits sympathy for the dissolute woman and often she relieves the sordid atmosphere with effective comedy. Miss Dressler has done good work in audible screen offerings, but her speech, expressions and her general gesticulations make this far and away her outstanding film characterization.The nervous Chris is told that the girl he was expecting is in the room set apart for women. He enters and gazes upon the daughter he has not seen for fifteen years. After the preliminary greeting and explanations, he says that he thinks that it is a suitable occasion to be celebrated with a glass of port. So the girl who had imbibed spirits sips the glass of wine and subsequently is seen living on her father's coal barge.Clarence Brown, who has directed a number of Miss Garbo's silent films, is also responsible for this audible picture. He depicts with marked ability the girl and the father renewing relations, without the old man ever suspecting his daughter's wayward life in the middle West. Then Matt, the stoker, is washed up with others on a stormy sea and Chris resents this man's attentions to his daughter. Matt, impersonated by Charles Bickford, is a powerful physical speciman of humanity, who scoffs at Chris's interference. He falls in love with Anna, and during one interlude they are seen at Coney Island, where Matt has an opportunity of demonstrating his strength and his prodigious lung-power.The reproduction of the voices was often much too loud yesterday afternoon, but the scenes of the altercation between Chris and Matt and those wherein Anna confesses to her florid past are a compliment to the screen, for these players make the most of their respective opportunities, especially Miss Garbo. Anna's scorching tirade against her father and her revelations of her scarlet days are delivered in a highly dramatic fashion. Matt's disappointment, his eventual return and his satisfaction in knowing that Anna had at least never loved any other man but himself are equally satisfying.Mr. Bickford succeeds splendidly with his portrayal of Matt. Mr. Marion's familiarity with the rôle does not diminish the importance of his present interpretation of the man who shakes his fist at that \\"Ole Devil Sea.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Miss Garbo's First Talker."},{"year":"1930","title":"GRETA GARBO will soon make a film in which she will have the role of the spy, Mata Hari, who, it will be remembered,  was the German agent who became the toast of Paris during the war and who was subsequently shot for her subversive activities.

Inasmuch as she is also in failing health - she first gets about with a stick, then with two sticks, then with a walker and finally in a wheelchair - she would be well advised to have a live-in companion on general principles.

For butter doesn't melt in Gloria's mouth the way it does in Shirley's and music doesn't pour from it as sweetly as it comes from Deanna's. Only time and the box-office bookkeepers can tell.Although it was obviously designed as a show-window for the fledgling's talents, proudly exhibiting her dimples, smiles, tears and vocal accomplishments, the picture is less self-conscious about it than most of these display items are. Actually it has a plot which manages to pivot upon its little star without burying her in the hole it makes, and it has a supporting cast with a will of its own and no mind to serve merely as a gallery of admirers. C. Aubrey Smith, Billy Gilbert, Virginia Weidler, Shirley Mills and Beulah Bondi are too wise a troupe not to know they are within their rights in stealing scenes from a baby, difficult as that usually is.Not to subject the yarn to too much analysis, which it could not stand, we'll simply mention that it is about a tree-starved city tot who is taken off to an exclusive camp for girls as the charity guest of a juvenile sorority. There she meets the usual midget menaces, a poor little rich girl whose parents are thinking of a divorce, a comedy gardener with two Katzenjammer sons, an understanding young counselor and a host of other minor dramatic potentials for a Little Miss-Fixit to handle.

STREIT BOWS IN 5-AND-4 UPSET","excerpt":"Miss Kabler Halts Defender in Quarter-Final Round of National Amateur Golf"},{"year":"1980","title":"\\"FOXES\\" has a melting glamour that will some day smooth its way to the First Los Angeles Nouvelle Vague Film Festival, where it will perhaps turn up on a bill with \\"California Split\\" or \\"American Gigolo\\" or \\"Welcome to L.A.\\" The characters are a little young for this genre, and a little tough. Nevertheless, in the movie's opening sequence they are seen sleeping like angels, prettily intertwined, four teen-age girls in a suburban bedroom bathed in early morning light.Whose room is this? Where are the girls' parents? What time does school start? The movie never becomes energetic enough to wonder. It simply follows four young actresses to concerts and parties and boulevards, to the beat of an incessant Donna Summer theme song. The actresses are quite appealing and a number of the film's teen tableaux have an impressive sense of style. But style isn't enough when questions of logic arise, which they do in \\"Foxes\\" with distracting regularity. The movie, which opens today at the Cinerama 2 and other theaters, is all texture, and the texture has plenty of holes.As a study of angry, rootless adolescents, \\"Foxes\\" bears a certain resemblance to such recent English films as \\"Quadrophenia\\" or \\"That'll Be the Day.\\" It has more glitter than either of these, but less coherence: Adrian Lyne, the director of \\"Foxes,\\" was previously a director of commercials and he seems to have more flair for mounting scenes fashionably than for stringing them together. The screenplay, by the film's co-producer, Gerald Ayres, provides one dying-swan-on-drugs character to bind the story together, but there really isn't much of a thread. Only the actresses' high spirits hold the movie on track.Jodie Foster, whose performance is enough to makes \\"Foxes\\" worth seeing, plays the daughter of Sally Kellerman, whose performance is not. The fault is partly in the casting: Miss Kellerman, like Lois Smith and Randy Quaid who play the story's other adults, has a role that's virtually unmanageable. She's supposed to be a slatternly, negligent, faintly well-meaning mother who loses sight of her daughter for long periods of time, even though the girl and her three friends have taken over Miss Kellerman's household. Miss Foster is supposed to be adrift, although she is by far the strongest figure this story offers.Mother and daughter have two big scenes together. One is a fight that serves mostly to highlight the incompatibility of their acting styles: Miss Foster is stunningly direct, Miss Kellerman hopelessly stagey. The other scene is harder to describe. But it ends, after considerable rambling, with the two of them in bed, reading Plato.If \\"Foxes\\" were a better film, it would be able to make this scene's point more tidily, without invoking the Greeks. It would also be less full of surprises. Mr. Quaid, for instance, plays an older man, apparently an executive in the record business, who falls in love with one of the girls (Marilyn Kagan) and leaves her his house while he's out of town. We have seen very little of this couple before they come to a crisis","excerpt":"Miss Kagan and her friends give a party in the house and the house is ruined. When Mr. Quaid comes home, he and Miss Kagan have a brief fight, and she storms off childishly, refusing to apologize. That would seem to be the end of Mr. Quaid as far as the movie is concerned. But at the end of the film he reappears quite without warning. He and Miss Kagan are getting married.Miss Kagan, Miss Foster, Kandice Stroh and Cherie Currie (formerly of the Runaways, an all-girl rock band) give the film its spunk, and each of them emerges as a striking figure in the large-scale set pieces, the best parts of the film. At a rock concert, they strut and sass. At the supermarket, their principal acquisition is the boy at the checkout counter.The costumes and the soundtrack music contribute to the impression that \\"Foxes\\" is carefully detailed, terribly timely. Only in these departments, and in the performances of the principals, is \\"Foxes\\" really ahead of the game.

Bridal for Karin Ann Lawrence"},{"year":"1969","title":"\\"PIERROT LE FOU,\\" which opened yesterday at the 72d Street Theater, is one of the humblest and most gentle of Jean-Luc Godard's films. Shot in 1965, before the cracks in the young French director's composure really opened up, the film has seams, murders, auto accidents, political harangues. The hero ultimately wraps his head in dynamite and blows himself to bits. But Pierrot is the \\"mon ami, Pierrot\\" from \\"Au Claire de la Lune\\" (a song that occurs uninsistently in the score), and a lot of the film's imagery is of the moon and gentle lunacy. It is in part a delicate, sentimental love story, a little on the order of Truffaut.Jean-Paul Belmondo plays Pierrot, a writer whose girl calls him Pierrot, but whose real name, Ferdinand, is emblazoned on his sweatshirt. (He and the film have some of the sweet loser's ironies of Charlie Brown.) The girl is played by Anna Karina, Mr. Godard's first wife, and no film has ever been more loving in its treatment of a star. Miss Karina makes her particular case for life, clothes, dancing, fields, skies, love and a little violence, and the writer makes his abstract case for \\"Ambition, love, the movement of things, accidents — everything.\\" They have an affair near the sea, with a fox and a parrot for company. They speak of Bernardin de St. Pierre's innocent \\"Paul et Virginie.\\" They despair of each other.They also have some \\"Breathless\\"-style adventures, with many references to Laurel and Hardy, \\"Johnny Guitar,\\" Michel Simon, \\"Pepe le Moko\\" and other cinema presences that are exigently real to the imagination of Godard. The film requires a little patience as it goes its own erratic way. One long drive by night down a highway, with colored lights (the film, shot by Raoul Coutard, is in color) flashing incessantly across the hood and windshield is particularly trying in its affectation. So are the strainings to include a bit of Vietnam and politics. (When Godard is bad, he is terrible:) And the film generates a certain impatience in its oddly felt absence of any scene of sex.But there is so much that is whimsical and beautiful: Pierrot, painting his face blue before he dies, and fumbling, at the last moment, for the fuse","excerpt":"Miss Karina, parodying musicals, unaffectedly singing (the music, ranging from Beethoven to Duhamel, is a careful, thoughtout comment on the script); an incredible, isolated piece of highway overpass abandoned in a field; Mr. Belmondo putting mustard on an immense piece of cheese, during an authentic, cinéma vérité—interview with a frowzy old eccentric who thinks she is the exiled queen of Lebanon; Jean-Pierre Leaud, appearing for one instant, looking baleful, on the screen; a kind of Brechtian bitter, fine misuse of American frames of references, in the \\"Oh, Moon of Alabama\\" style; a superb comic turn, about love and refrains in the head, by the Belgian actor Raymond Devos.The film is poetic, quiet, introverted, personal. The writer and Miss Karina have funny, despairing things to say to each other. There is no bravado in the part Belmondo plays this time, or any real violence in Miss Karina's. They are both charming and fed up, an Idiom that sounds richer in French and that is applied in the film to everyone, including the man in the moon. One moving thing is that a director as proud and forceful, as annihilatingly positivist as Godard should make a film this tentative and forbearing about an artist and his girl in love.
