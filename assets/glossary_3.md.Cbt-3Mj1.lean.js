Redding is now home to an ultramodern $23 million bridge designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava -- the Sundial, which spans the Sacramento River -- and offers a 300-acre natural history park. There are also walking, cycling and hiking trails with stunning views that rival better-known spots in Northern California.    JENNIFER MARGULIS    Friday    3:30 p.m.  1 -- Don't Fight City Hall    No matter where you start your journey, try to arrive before the close of business on Friday so you can take in what can best be described as a free art museum in the new City Hall (777 Cypress Avenue, 530-225-4512). Thanks to the recently retired city manager, Mike Warren, who started Redding's ''Art in Public Places'' initiative, City Hall lines some hallway walls on all three floors with pieces by local artists and from traveling exhibitions. Included in the ''American Spirit'' exhibition currently on display are works by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. But most surprising is a striking 1939 black-and-white photograph of three boys at a fair taken by Eudora Welty, who was a photographer before gaining fame as a writer.    5 p.m.  2 -- Of Time and the River    You have to visit the Sundial Bridge, which has put Redding on the architectural tourist map since it opened in 2004. Designed by Santiago Calatrava, the bridge crosses the Sacramento River and is also a working sundial. It is covered by some 1.3 million pieces of broken Spanish tile. With parents pushing strollers, couples walking hand in hand and tourists snapping photographs, this pedestrian and bicycle bridge has created a sort of town square in Redding -- a place where people meet, visit, walk and enjoy the river and the views of the Cascade Mountains to the north and the Trinity Mountains to the west.    7 p.m.  3 -- French Connections    You're likely to rub shoulders with the most fashionable locals at the city's newest and nicest restaurant, the Maritime Seafood & Grill (1600 California Street, 530-229-0700). The white walls, white tablecloths and white-clad waiters are reminiscent of Spain, but the food is French-style California cuisine. The specialties of the Korean-born and San Francisco-trained owner and chef, Morgan Song, include an asparagus appetizer ($8.50) and a Muscovy duck pâté served on crusty herbed bread ($7.50). The orange roughy on cream of spinach with an accent of butternut squash piled with wasabi caviar ($20.50) wasn't local (it arrived that morning from Australia) but was still deliciously fresh. The chocolate fondant cake ($7.50) served with enormous antennae of edible sugar, like from some sweet alien life form, may lure you back to Redding sooner than you plan.    10 p.m.  4 -- Local Beer, Local Music    After dinner walk down to Billy Bombay's (1730 California Street, 530-244-3089) to mingle with a mixed and not-too-crazy mostly older crowd. ''We get everyone from 21 to 91 in here,'' said the owner, Leonard Crump. Try a Lost Coast beer, brewed in Eureka, just three hours away","excerpt":"Lost Coast's citrusy Great White is the bouncer's favorite. Catch some live music by local and regional acts. If you're feeling feistier (or lucky), drive six miles south on Route 273 to the Win-River Casino (2100 Redding Rancheria Road, 530-243-3377) to play the slots or whoop it up at the martini bar that opens onto the casino.    Saturday    8 a.m.  5 -- Call of the Wild    Fuel up on a huge breakfast at Country Kitchen (1099 Hilltop Drive, 530-223-5438) before heading to Redding Sports Ltd. (950 Hilltop Drive, 530-221-7333) to rent mountain bikes ($8 an hour, $25 for 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., $35 for 24 hours; make sure to ask for a helmet). An access point to the Sacramento Trail system is right up the street, and the 12-mile loop will take you past a fish hatchery, Caldwell Park and the rushing river. Don't be surprised if you see a skinny-dipper in the Sacramento, or startle a deer on the trail -- or vice versa.    1 p.m.  6 -- Logging On    Grab a garden sandwich ($7.50) or a Conductor's Special -- roast beef, Ortega chilies and jack cheese on grilled sourdough ($8.25) -- at Deja Vu (1590 California Street, 530-244-4272). Then head to the 300-acre Turtle Bay Exploration Park, which surrounds the Sundial Bridge (840 Auditorium Drive, 800-887-8532; www.turtlebay.org); admission is $11, and $6 for children age 4 to 15; $9 for those 65 and older. Pick up a map at the visitor center and wander dirt walkways that lead to an extensive museum of natural history (with exhibits on topics like climate change and logging), an exhibition on birds of prey, a Paul Bunyan forest camp aimed at children and a butterfly house. There is also a mile-and-a-half self-guided walking tour around the McConnell Arboretum and Gardens.    4:30 p.m.  7 -- Tin Ceiling, Red Meat    If you don't get to Jack's Grill (1743 California Street, 530-241-9705) by 4:30, half an hour before the kitchen opens, plan to wait at least an hour before you sit down. As much a phenomenon as a grill, this hole-in-the-wall restaurant still has its original tin ceiling from 1938, a 1944 cash register, iceberg lettuce salads with green beans drowned in dressing and a kitchen too small to serve dessert. But Reddingites flock there because Jack's serves the best steaks in town ($10.55 to $26.95).    7 p.m.  8 -- Depression Class    A newspaper article described the Cascade Theater (1731 Market Street, 530-243-8877; www.cascadetheatre.org) as a ''temple of amusement and culture'' when it opened in 1935. Renovated to a pretty close approximation of its original look in a project that involved scraping 10 coats of paint off the walls, the Cascade seats 1,000 and has archways of Aztec-inspired Art Deco gold, silver and copper-colored inlay, and a host of bare-chested Greek goddesses in an elaborate fertility motif on the ceiling. It offers an eclectic range of cultural events, including ballet, plays, live music by the likes of the Indigo Girls and Ricky Skaggs and older movies like ''American Graffiti'' and ''Chocolat.'' And after the show, the Sundial Bridge once again beckons -- this time, for a romantic moonlight stroll.    Sunday    8 a.m.  9 -- A Mocha, Then Spelunking    You could while away your morning by lounging on big comfy pink, purple and green sofas, checking your e-mail messages and playing Connect Four and Boggle at Yaks Koffee Shop (3274 Bechelli Lane, 530-223-9999). Instead, order a butterscotch latte (blended with hunks of real butterscotch) and a maple nut scone to go and drive 16 miles north on Interstate 5 to Exit 695 to visit the Lake Shasta Caverns (800-795-2283, www.lakeshastacaverns.com. The two-hour tour costs $20, $12 for ages 3 to 11; 65 and older $17) and includes a ride across the big artificial Lake Shasta on a diesel-powered catamaran, a bus ride up a vertiginous hill and a guided tour of the dripping stalactites and thrusting stalagmites inside the limestone caves.    Where a Bridge Tracks the Sun       Redding has a small airport -- Redding Municipal Airport -- served by Horizon Air and United Express with direct flights daily from LAX in Los Angeles. The city is about a three-and-a-half-hour drive north from San Francisco. The Redding Convention and Visitors Bureau (800-874-7562; www.visitredding.org) publishes a brochure with more than 35 listings of places to stay.      If you like chain hotels, you'll find them by the dozen, many in sight of Interstate 5 or on Hilltop Drive.      Tiffany House (1510 Barbara Road, 530-244-3225; www.tiffanyhousebb.com) is a Victorian-style bed-and-breakfast in a residential neighborhood that is close to everything. Run by a couple who showcase their family heirlooms -- including century-old needlepoint -- in their home, it has four rooms for $110 to $150 a night (the most expensive is a stand-alone cottage with a whirlpool tub).      If you're allergic to B&B's, the Grand Manor Inn and Suites (850 Mistletoe Lane, 530-221-4472; www.grandmanorinn.com) has spacious rooms, some with balconies (overlooking the parking lot). Its rooms are $91.25 to $110.05 a night.      For something more modestly priced, try the River Inn (1835 Park Marina Drive, 800-995-4341; www.reddingriverinn.net). Ask for a room in the new annex, which has balconies overlooking a pond. Its rooms are $64 to $100 a night. 36 Hours in Redding, Calif."},{"year":"1940","title":"N Porter's cocker spaniel found ILL GIRL'S PET DOG FOUND","excerpt":"Lost Cocker Restored Before Child Knew It Was Missing"},{"year":"1950","title":"BOY'S DOG IS SOUGHT","excerpt":"Lost Collie Is Pet of Child, 8, Who Must Use Wheelchair"},{"year":"1973","title":"The Boston Red Sox, al most halfway through a nine game home stand in Fenway Park, where they hope to reach the .500 plateau in the won&#8208","excerpt":"lost column, continued in the right direction last night.

Nick (D. W. Moffett), a handsome young Time magazine writer whose square jaw and Darien manners match his F. Scott Fitzgeraldesque name, has never seen such an excessive regimen of meals and snacks. \\"What Americans live like this?\\" he asks in affable disbelief.    But in \\"The American Plan,\\" Richard Greenberg's first play since \\"Eastern Standard,\\" the American plan isn't just a matter of enforced menus for resort vacationers. The American plan is instead symptomatic of a larger fate that finally engulfs each of Mr. Greenberg's five very different characters, the golden Nick not excluded. Set for most of its length during the last summer of the Eisenhower years, this sorrowful comedy tells of people who are in one way or another at odds with the ethnic, intellectual or sexual codes by which Americans of their time are required to live. When the play ends a decade later -- in an epilogue set in a Central Park West parlor pointedly overlooking a Vietnam-era demonstration -- the conformist American plan may be under attack, but not soon enough to rescue Mr. Greenberg's characters from the tragedy of assimilation.

In it Chester Morris appears as Mike McGann, one of Uncle Sam's bluejackets, whose outlook on life is changed vastly after he swims to the rescue of the attractive Pat Rockland, an heiress to $20,000,000. But it happens that Pat really was in no danger of drowning, and her screams were intended to interest another man.McGann is presumed to be a rough diamond, but he reveals that he needs a great deal of careful polishing. He is never without a piece of chewing gum to keep his jaws in monotonous action. Be that as it may, he has an eye for a pretty girl and she is Pat.After his discharge from the navy, McGann is employed in a factory run by Pat's uncle. His loud clothes are discouraged and soon he presents himself as a thoroughly respectable citizen, and goes to work running errands. As time goes on he learns that Pat is only interested in him because of a wager she has made and then the doings in the picture become tedious. However, as one surmises from the start, it is a happy ending for McGann and Pat.Frank Craven does well as Pat's wise uncle. Mr. Morris overacts the rôle of McGann. Mae Clarke is quite charming as Pat.On the surrounding program is \\"Camping Out,\\" a Mickey Mouse cartoon","excerpt":"Lou Holtz in a short film called \\"When Do We Eat?\\" and a Fanchon and Marco stage production entitled \\"Side Walk Café,\\" in which are featured Eddie Peabody, Buster Shaver, Duke Art and the Gae Foster dancers.

Schindler Will Alter a Building on Madison Avenue --Operators Buy Up Lease."},{"year":"1991","title":"Where's the Driveway?    Q.     My mother pointed out the office building at 277 Park Avenue to me and said that the previous building had had a circular driveway in an inner courtyard. How could we have let this be torn down? What was the reasoning?    . . .    Alison Merritt Dealy, Astoria.      A.  The prior 277 Park Avenue, an apartment house between 47th and 48th Streets, indeed had a drive in a giant interior court. Completed in 1925 and designed by McKim, Mead & White, the building occupied a full block and had 12 separate sections and 432 apartments. The structure was built by the New York and Harlem Railroad Company over the air rights of their railroad yards below, like other buildings in this section. But it had been built with the possibility of eventual conversion to offices and with foundations that would support a 75-story building, and by 1931 the Real Estate Record & Guide reported that \\"no further long-term leases are being granted.\\"    The railroad had originally net-leased the building to an operating corporation in 1923 for a maximum of 63 years. But the operator defaulted in 1931 and the railroad ultimately took back the building over the operator's protests in 1948, although it denied that demolition was planned. After ownership disputes with another railroad were resolved in the 1950's, the structure was replaced by the present office building of the same address in 1962 -- three years before the Landmarks Preservation Commission was established. At least one other apartment project with such an interior courtyard, 1185 Park Avenue, between 93d and 94th Streets, survives without landmark designation. Wall Safe    Q.     There is a small, round, metal door with a dial in the wall of my mother's apartment built in 1910 and designed by Neville & Bagge. What is it?    . . .    Laurel Levine, Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.      A.  You undoubtedly have a wall safe, a typical feature of apartments of this period. For their other buildings, Neville & Bagge used the Lowrie safe, a foot-square cube set into the wall and anchored to the structural steel. A New York Times article of 1909 indicates that they were typically leased to tenants for $6 a year. Most safe-repair companies can restore the safe to working order for $100 to $200 if the dial is intact.  Mony Building    Q.    The present Mony Building at 1740 Broadway replaced two apartment houses, the 11-story Rockingham and the 6-story Sonoma.   Who designed them and when were they built?    . . .    Robert A.M. Stern.      A.  The Rockingham was designed by Thom & Wilson in 1883 and the Sonoma was designed by Stephen D. Hatch eight years earlier. Turn-of-the-Century Brochure    Q.     We have an original real estate brochure for the rowhouses built in 1905 at 24-30 West 86th Street. Who designed and occupied these buildings? . . . Barbara Cohen, New York Bound Books, Manhattan.      A.  Here the developers W.W. and T.M. Hall worked with the architects Welch, Smith and Provot as they had on many other commissions. The Halls built these houses for sale and the first owner-occupant families were Thomas H. O'Connor, a banker, at 24","excerpt":"Louis B.

Can you give us more information on a photograph in our possession that we believe shows a fire on March 17, 1898, at our New York gallery, 389 Fifth Avenue, at 36th Street? . . . Caroline Durand-Ruel Godfroy, Durand-Ruel Galleries, Paris.      A.  The photograph to which you refer shows the disastrous fire at the Windsor Hotel (on March 17, 1899, not 1898) on the east side of Fifth between 46th and 47th, where about 20 people died, many by jumping from high floors. The photograph shows a marine painting being taken sideways down a ladder, but period business directories show no listings for art galleries at that address. A scan of indexed New York City newspapers for 1898 and 1899 yields no article about a fire at Durand-Ruel -- only a review of Mary Cassatt's paintings there in 1898.  103 East 10th Street    Q.    The small apartment house where I live at 103 East 10th Street seems very old inside but modern outside. When was it built? . . . Dan Shaw, Manhattan.      A.  Your five-story building was originally built in 1880 as the Kenilworth and period photographs show a brownstone-fronted building in the neo-Grec style. Original residents include the families of William Perzel, a grocer, Daniel Cook, a doctor, and Edward J. Shriver, in the iron business. The front was rebuilt in 1959 to the designs of Wechsler & Schimenti.  208 East 32d Street    Q.    When was my rowhouse at 208 East 32d Street built? . . . Judy Linden, Manhattan.      A.  Your brick-fronted house with Greek Revival details was completed in 1856; its first occupant was Peter Asten, moving from 138 Hester Street. He ran a liquor business at 88 Bowery and owned the house from 1857 to 1895.

It is slightly odd that Dukas should be associated with a cartoon icon, since he was an eminently serious composer: one reason that he's not better known is that he was so self-critical that he destroyed much of his own work. One piece that did survive was his major opera, ''Ariane et Barbe-Bleu,'' which had its premiere at the Opéra-Comique in Paris in 1907. Its dense, luminous score has historically won the approval of musicians, and its female lead has been played by some of the 20th century's great sopranos (including Germaine Lubin and Geraldine Farrar). But it has never caught on with the public even as much as, say, Debussy's ''Pelléas et Mélisande,'' another setting of a Maeterlinck play, and certainly not as much as Bartok's ''Bluebeard's Castle,'' another operatic version of the same folk tale. Now New York City Opera is giving at least some of the public a rare chance to hear the work (for those who weren't around for its Met performances in 1911 and 1912), in a new production. Many of those involved are new to the company, among them Paul-Émile Fourny, the director","excerpt":"Louis Désiré, the set and costume designer (see the design above); the soprano Renate Behle, replacing Carol Vaness, who had to withdraw for health reasons, as Ariane; and Leon Botstein, the conductor, president of Bard College, and a passionate defender of less-known music.

Under pressure by his distributor, New Line Cinema, he has just edited several seconds out of a scene in his new film, \\"Damage,\\" which will open on Wednesday. As a result, the movie's rating has been switched from a rare NC-17 -- meaning no one under 17 years of age is allowed -- to the far more common R rating. That means that anyone under 17 must be accompanied by an adult.   What disturbs this 60-year-old French director is not so much the change in the single scene, which essentially involves rearranging some steamy shots between Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche. It is what he calls the \\"esthetic myopia\\" of the Motion Picture Association of America's rating procedure, which gives R ratings to extremely -- perhaps gratuitously -- violent movies, like \\"Basic Instinct.\\" But the association, Mr. Malle said, has another set of standards for serious films dealing with sexual matters. - \\"This is weird to me,\\" the director said in a recent interview at his publicity agent's office. \\"Maybe I'm from a different culture. But it's difficult for me to understand this obsession that the ratings people have with nudity and this looseness about horrific violence. They have managed to cloak 'Damage' in an aura of pornography.\\"   The film is based on Josephine Hart's best seller about an English politician (played by Mr. Irons), who has a consuming affair with his son's fiancee (Miss Binoche).

What could an audience have made of this puerile plot in which Alexander the Great is haplessly torn between the rival affections of a slave girl and a princess?   As for the music, the opera is less a compelling musical drama than a series of beautifully set whines in operatic form: arias complaining about love, jealousy, indecision. By the time the second hour moved into the third and the third encroached upon a fourth, it seemed as if everything possible to say in a Baroque da capo aria, in which the singer repeats the beginning after an apparent ending, had already been said twice.

This idea is introduced in a farcical film known as \\"Home, James,\\" wherein all the characters succeed in turn in being foolish. Sometimes they take a frightful lot of trouble trying to be funny, when they might have succeeded with far less effort.Although \\"Home, James\\" belongs to the turbulent category of comedies, one feels as if the producers might have foregone the pleasure of picturing a sequence where Laura La Plante bobs about a department store on her knees. There is also a silhouette series of scenes that are only merry so long as one can conceive of an utterly senseless floor-walker taking any stock in them.The first attempt to stir up laughter is done in an old-fashioned and reliable manner. James Lacey Sr., proprietor of one of America's' greatest stores, steps into a pool of water. A minute later his collar, tie and physiognomy are decorated with mud. And the audience, as usual, was highly gratified.Mr. Lacey has much to endure with the sloth of his son, so perhaps it is quite natural that he should favor the idea of the young man marrying a girl who encourages the youth to display a fondness for work.Although most of the characters are arrested and put behind bars during the course of events in this production, one has a foggy notion that all will come out right in the end and that in the last scene the golden head of Laura La Plante will be reposing on the manly chest of Charles Delaney, who, of course, plays the part of the son of the owner of one of America's great stores.Miss La Plante is comely, but her part is literally too absurd for words, or, at least, more words. Mr. Delaney is an up-to-date type of leading man in motion pictures. Arthur Hoyt gives the best performance in this film. It is he who has to be the senseless floor-walker.

ITALY'S SCREEN SCENE","excerpt":"LOVE AND MARRIAGE IN A FRENCH COMEDY"},{"year":"1930","title":"Mady Christians, who gave a charming performance in the German audible film \\"Dich Hab' Ich Geliebt,\\" is the principal player in \\"The Burning Heart,\\" a muddled and poorly acted effusion which is now on view at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse. In this offering, which was produced by Ludwig Berger, director of \\"The Vagabond King,\\" in Berlin, there is no talking by the performers, but it has been inoculated with several songs, the tooting of automobile horns and various other sounds.It is a somewhat incoherent affair with odd ideas. There is a young musician named George Wittig, who falls in love with Dorothy Claudius, the winsome daughter of an impoverished musician. Dorothy has accepted employment as a singer in a cabaret. When she meets Wittig she does not wish him to know that she is performing in the place, which is referred to as the Odeon, chiefly because of the abbreviated garments she is called upon to wear. So she tells Wittig that she is employed at the postoffice. Wittig, however, visits the Odeon, and to his dismay encounters Dorothy in her stage costume. He is wild with rage because she has lied to him.Before that Wittig had composed a song for Dorothy to render in his symphony, \\"The Burning Heart,\\" but following his discovery of Dorothy's deceit, he decides to return to his first intention, that of having the melody \\"sung\\" through the medium of ether waves.Wittig behaves like a man bereft of his senses for several scenes, bemoaning the fact that he had quarreled with Dorothy. When the time comes for the conducting of his symphony, Wittig appears to be in a dream. He sends his bibulous mother out to see whether she can find Dorothy, but the aged woman turns up without any news of the girl. From what one beholds, the symphony is a dismal failure, until Dorothy arises in the audience and amazes Wittig by singing the melody he had composed for her.Although this film has an element of interest here and there, it is badly directed, disjointed and abrupt. Miss Christians's charm is undoubtedly an asset, but her performance lacks the distinction of her work in \\"Dich Hab' Ich Geliebt.\\" Gustav Froelich's impersonation of Wittig is far from sympathetic. He is too eager to impress upon the spectator the composer's moods, so much so that the young man seldom appears rational.

In \\"Sal of Singapore,\\" instead of ending up in prison or being killed, Mr. Hale walks away with the dizzy blonde, vowing allegiance to her for the rest of his life, and in \\"The Spieler,\\" the current part-talking attraction at the Roxy, he abandons the excitement of picking pockets and periodical terms in jail to enjoy Renée Adorée's favor.In both the silent and the dialogue scenes of this present offering Mr. Hale gives an eminently satisfactory account of himself as Flash, a barker with a flowing line of jabber calculated to impress gullible persons outside a carnival show. His predecessor had made a sudden exit from this life after incurring the anger of Red Moon and his cohorts.Flash and his companion, Luke, are eager to make a business connection, as they have just finished a term in jail. Cleo D'Alzelle (Miss Adorée), who runs the carnival show, discourages pickpockets and their ilk, but soon after Flash has impressed Cleo with his gift of the gab he is employed to do the honors from the platform, and Luke, whose fingers itch to get at fat wallets, agrees to appear in the capacity of tight-rope walker.Not long after Luke's first performance, he wanders among the crowd and plucks a watch from a pocket. Unfortunately he is detected and he flees to Flash, who takes the watch and as he returns it to the irate owner, the spieler impresses upon that individual vociferously that he dropped the time-piece. As if to show how easily a pocket book can be taken, Flash drops a dollar bill. Soon one of the worthy citizens of the little town puts his foot on it and he subsequently bends down and surreptitiously grabs the greenback. As he does so his pocket-book is extracted, but to give an idea of the honesty prevailing among the employes of Cleo's carnival. Flash returns the wallet.This is in many respects an intelligently produced film, one that has a certain subtlety in a few of its episodes. Tay Garnett, the director, however, is too fond of telling his story by close-ups and he also permits Red Moon (Fred Kohler) to do much grinning and laughing. The speaking passages are passable, out directors in this new scheme of things should beware of the way in which screen actors voice their surprise, especially when it is done with a single word. It is invariably so melodramatic that it is funny.There are two murders in the course of this adventure, and toward the close the murderer's neck is broken in a struggle with the indomitable Flash, who, by that time, is eager to prove his innocence of a robbery and be sure of continuing in Cleo's good graces.Miss Adorée is charming and her French accent when she is heard is quite captivating. Clyde Cook does exceedingly well as Luke.On the Movietone news reel there is an interesting series of scenes devoted to personalities in West Branch, Iowa, President-elect Hoover's birthplace. Newt Butler tells about Mr. Hoover at school and Mrs. Carran, Mr. Hoover's teacher, says a few words about the school life of the next President.\\"I was Herbert Hoover's teacher forty-four years ago,\\" declares Mrs. Carran. \\"Once the superintendent came to the school and some of the boys had been very naughty. He told the boys that they must do right 'For among you boys,' he said, 'there may be one who will be President of the United States.' Herbert Hoover was among the boys.\\"Mrs. Jennie Scellars, standing in the house in which Mr. Hoover was born, tells of the dimensions of the rooms and adds that the President-elect was born in the room which she now uses for a kitchen.Most of the speakers in West Branch are quite nervous, but this rather makes what they say all the more human.A most pleasing Movietone subject shows Young Stribling playing with his baby boy, who seems to know the difference between an uppercut and a haymaker, and is apparently aware that his paternal relative can take a lot of punishment.Still another interesting sound subject shows the fighting of forest fires. Here are heard the voices of the men, the crackling of the flaming trees and the roaring of a blazing farmhouse. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Love and Pickpockets. Spanish Days.

If you go on Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Sunday, you will see Godard's film, which is properly known as \\"1 + 1.\\" On other days, you will see a film popularly advertised as \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" which exactly resembles \\"1 + 1\\" except that in the latter part of the last reel a complete version of the song \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" which the Rolling Stones have been rehearsing and recording in cuts throughout the film, is played on the soundtrack. Several monochromatic stills of the film's last shot are added to fill out the song's time. The changes and additions are the work of the producer, Iain Quarrier.Why anyone, given the choice, would prefer a producer's version of a movie to a director's escapes me. The movie to see at the Murray Hill is \\"1 + 1.\\" Not only does the use of the song impose a sense of emotional fulfillment (and, I think, the wrong sense of fulfillment) upon a conclusion that does not ask for it, but also the use of the song's title for the movie suggests a meaning that is less interesting in context than, say, the proposition \\"1 + 1 equals 2.\\"For \\"1 + 1\\" is a heavily didactic, even instructional, film, like much recent Godard, and it builds upon repetition, or, if you will, addition. The Rolling Stones' repeated assays upon \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" in their recording studio, the rote repetitions of passages and slogans passed back and forth among black-power revolutionaries in their river-side automobile junkyard, the mere adding up of questions and answers in the interview sequences, juxtaposing words to make new combinations (such as \\"So-Viet Cong\\") and finding new words in old combinations (such as SDS in \\"Sight and Sound\\"","excerpt":"LOVE in \\"All About Eve\\")—all suggest a concern with ways of putting things together, to the film seems determined to be the prospective text of some ultimate, infinitely complex collectivism.Whatever its intentions, \\"1 + 1\\" contemplates rather than advocates revolution. It collects evidence and examines texts — including a by now famous pornographic political novel read on the sound track (\\"'You're my kind of girl, Pepita', said Pope Paul as he lay down on the grass . . .,\\" etc.)—records interviews (\\"The Occident is fighting communism because the Occident is Faustian?\\" \\"Yes.\\"), and observes the forces preparing the apocalypse.In \\"1 + 1\\" the camera comes alive on its cranes and tracks. As if lost in a precise meditation it moves deliberately among the persons and places of the Stones' recording studio or from wreck to wreck in the fantastic black power junk heap.The chief delight of the film lies in this precision and in these scenes. At the end, when it martyrs its one named character, Eve Democracy (Anne Wiazemski), it spreads her body across a mighty camera crane on a seashore. The crane lifts her in a great sweeping movement, red and black flags flying in the wind, across the sky. And at this moment, and not until this moment, it seems possible that the meaning of Godard's film depends not only upon a cause but also upon the camera's eye; not only in sympathy, but in objectivity as well.

In delineating the union of two  footloose lovers who bring plenty of quirky baggage to their relationship, it is the antithesis of that quintessentially swoony Gallic romance, \\"A Man and a Woman,\\" which captivated American audiences 30 years ago. But in its guarded, skeptical way, the superbly acted film is as much on the side of love as is its  glossier forerunners.         The two main characters, Alice (Sandrine Kiberlain) and Bruno (Arnaud Giovaninetti), are drifting malcontents with limited career opportunities and big dreams (she wants to be a singer, he is an aspiring soccer player) that they will probably never realize. Miss Masson's film tracks Alice's travels from Boulogne-sur-Mer to a seedy hotel in Lyons where she meets Bruno and fends him off until her defenses crumble, and she gives in to her attraction.

There have been assorted rumors as to why this British-made social drama, which arrived yesterday at the World Theatre, was not released here sooner. However, the most reasonable seems to be that few people would be interested in a picture about unemployment and poverty at a time when jobs were plentiful and wages high.Being a discourse on the depression years of the 1930's in England, \\"Love on the Dole\\" is critical of an economic system that does not produce jobs for people who want to work and fails to provide a decent wage for those who do have employment. The implication is that a strong Labor party could work out a system whereby the monied and the working interests could both benefit. Current events have provided \\"Love on the Dole\\" with curious sociological and political overtones. As a result it might be taken as a hindsight observation of conditions that brought the Labor party to power in England, or it might be taken as a warning of unhappy days to come in America unless labor and management find a way to pull together.Anyway you take it, \\"Love on the Dole\\" is an important picture. Like the play of 1936 it deals intelligently with the struggle for survival by a working-class Manchester family living in a slum neighborhood. The mother and father appear resigned to a life of drudgery even when the mills which sustain the town are going full blast. But their daughter and son are not content with just barely making a living. And it is through their frustrated attempts to find gainful employment that the story of growing restlessness among laborers is projected.\\"Love on the Dole\\" unfolds slowly and sometimes the speech is difficult to understand, but the principal roles are exceedingly well acted by Deborah Kerr, Clifford Evans, Mary Merrall and George Carney. And several minor characters are drawn to life, especially the four old crones played by Marie O'Neill, Iris Vandeleur, Marie Ault and Marjorie Rhodes. This picture is not intended for persons seeking a few hours idle entertainment. Rather it is a thoughtful and earnest attempt to throw some light on a problem that concerns us all in varying degree.

But the Columbus quincentennial has also focused attention on the contemporaneous expulsion, an event commemorated by a flourishing of Sephardic music concerts. Voice of the Turtle, an ensemble that has specialized in this repertory since 1978, presented a few dozen songs, leavened with a couple of folk tales, in a Hanukkah concert on Sunday afternoon at Symphony Space.   Actually, the program's connection with Hanukkah was tenuous: only the first and last groups of songs referred to the holiday. The greater part of the program was devoted to love songs, nostalgic reminiscences of Spain, allegorical Bible stories and songs about the concerns, both grand and trivial, of daily life.

It was just about then that Rappaport's nose began to twitch and his eyes to water. ''Something smells funny around here,'' he muttered. This was because his car windows were open and a terrible stench, trapped by the inversion, had left New Jersey and was then passing over large parts of New York City on its way to everywhere else.  Rappaport quickly rolled up the windows, but the gaseous stink - like vampire clouds - kept seeping through the car's seams anyway. He was still weeping three hours later when he finally reached home and ran into the house screaming at everybody to lock the windows and doors.  ''The whole thing stinks,'' he yelled at them as he ran to the bathroom. They thought he was having one of his regular fits against lawyers, politicians, rock bands called The Puke, auto repairmen and everything else that's wrong with the world, and though he had never asked them before to seal up the house against these threats, they shrugged and battened down all the windows and doors.

The loves and tribulations of the composer do not, as set forth here, make an interesting screen story, partly because of the sluggish performance of the cast in support of Fritz Kortner, who plays Beethoven. It is a heavy and labored drama in the old dolorous manner.Ludwig van Beethoven is first shown as the youth at Bonn, where his father predicts for him a career as one of the world's great composers. The film passes over several years to the occasion when the master, Haydn, \\"discovers\\" Beethoven, now a substitute organist, and urges him to come to Vienna. Beethoven goes to the city and, through the offices of Haydn, becomes the protégé of Prince Lichnovsky.His love affairs with the Countess Julia Guiccardi and her friend cause him to lose faith in his fellows and to seek a rendezvous solely with his work. When official recognition comes, he discovers that he is deaf and unable even to conduct an orchestra that is rehearsing one of his own pieces. Distraught and wearied with life and his own privations, he finally dies.In this day of synchronized pictures, it is a pity that this one could not have been set to a music score. Interesting as are some of the scenes showing the master composing \\"Fidelio,\\" they mean little in view of the fact that it is not inspiring to \\"watch\\" a man write notes on staffed paper.Kortner bears a marked resemblance to the portraits of Beethoven and depicts the eccentricities and moods of the genius with considerable faithfulness.Betty Amann in German Film.
