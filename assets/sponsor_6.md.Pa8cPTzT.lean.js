The later, a bracing version of ''The Revenger's Tragedy,'' originally booked for three weeks, begins an extended run tonight after being on hiatus for the holidays. Jesse Berger, the group's artistic director, conceded that it might be time to consider longer initial runs, ''now that we've proved to ourselves that we're not a flash in the pan.'' There is plenty of flash, though, in Mr. Berger's adaptation of ''The Revenger's Tragedy,'' a play of uncertain authorship from the early 17th century. There is also plenty of blood, and an electric performance by Matthew Rauch as a man bent on avenging the death of his love. Mr. Berger (above), 35, who is also directing the play, said he first became interested in staging it when he was working with the Washington Shakespeare Company, which mounted its own production in its 1999-2000 season. ''I didn't have enough capital or chutzpah to do it as my first project for Red Bull,'' he said -- that was ''Pericles,'' staged in 2003 -- but he knew he would someday. ''The more I worked on it, the more I realized it was sort of a diamond in the rough,'' he said. His adaptation cuts about 20 percent of the original, expands some characters and sets the tale at a fearlessly fast clip. One of Red Bull's missions, Mr. Berger said, is to explore the works of Shakespeare's contemporaries, which are sometimes overlooked, and the response so far gives him hope. ''It's been really wonderful to discover that there is an audience out there for these plays,'' he said.

Indeed, had Jessye Norman not withdrawn from her scheduled performance on Wednesday, Carnegie Hall audiences could have witnessed the American soprano taking her own life four times within 24 hours. Ms. Norman canceled the first event because of respiratory illness but returned, somewhat bravely, for the second on Thursday. The program, planned to run two nights in a row, was splendidly inventive, and included Britten's dramatic cantata \\"Phaedra\\" and Berlioz's lyric scene \\"La Mort de Cleopatre.\\"   No two pieces could be more different. Britten's, the work of a dying man, is an exercise in denial. The Berlioz is the extravagant outpouring of a 26-year-old. Both, however, are monologues: summings-up and final thoughts before death. The Britten has an extraordinary bleakness, like cold stone in winter sunlight. The instruments, mainly strings and percussion, are systematically drained of color, yet the final moments offer some of the most delicate orchestration ever written.
