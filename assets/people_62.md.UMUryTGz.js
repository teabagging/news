Sprung from the mind of Marie Antoinette after her death, this novel takes a soul's-eye view of the queen's life from her marriage at 14 to Louis XVI to her rendezvous with the guillotine. Unbounded by walls or flesh, she wanders the gardens and rooms of Versailles, listening to conversations at which she wasn't present and bearing witness. The book is ''rapturous, like an aria,'' Stacey D'Erasmo wrote here in 2002. The queen is ''very much alive here, and she's magnificent.'' The same publisher has reissued two of Davis's earlier novels. Hell ($13.95)is a m&#233","excerpt":"lange of meditations, voices, scenes, sermons and proverbs that cross-cuts between two households: that of a troubled family in 1950's Philadelphia, and the residence of a 19th-century expert on domestic management. In 1998 in these pages, Nancy Willard admired the tale's ''intelligence and verbal brio.'' The Girl Who Trod on a Loaf ($14.95) tells of the friendship between a Juilliard-trained waitress and an elderly Danish composer, who on her death leaves her friend an unfinished opera based on a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale. In 1993 our reviewer, Maggie Paley, found this philosophical novel ''heated, dramatic'' and ''grand in its ambition.''    THE FOUNDING FISH, by John McPhee. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $14.) The subject of the author's 26th book is the American shad, and once he homes his intensely curious beacon on that big herring the result is more than a simple fish story. Weaving together his own efforts to outwit shad with insights into its anatomy, behavior and migration, along with bits of history and geography, McPhee creates ''a mini-encyclopedia, a highly informative and entertaining amalgam of natural and personal history, a work in a class by itself,'' Robert H. Boyle wrote here in 2002.    TEACHER: The One Who Made the Difference, by Mark Edmundson. (Vintage, $13.) An English professor at the University of Virginia pays tribute to a remarkable teacher he encountered in 1969 during his senior year at Medford High, who showed him a rich and wild inner world far beyond his working-class Massachusetts city. ''Edmundson's message of the world-changing importance of good high school teaching is more than ever one we need to hear,'' Maria Russo said here last year. ''It's rarely delivered with such passion, good humor and sympathy.''    BLESSINGS, by Anna Quindlen. (Random House, $13.95.) In a novel as concerned with the evolution of its characters as the resolution of their story, a newborn girl is abandoned in a cardboard box on the estate of a wealthy widow. The discovery eventually leads to redemption and renewal for both the handyman who finds the foundling and his embittered employer. ''Quindlen's moving and gently humorous depiction of her characters' transformation is thoroughly persuasive,'' Hilma Wolitzer said here last year.    CARAMELO, by Sandra Cisneros. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.95.) The narrator of this happy, fizzy novel uses her Mexican-American family's annual pilgrimage by car from Chicago to Mexico City as a springboard for her personal coming-of-age story, a fond portrait of her crowded, clamorous clan and its colorful past, and a larger political tale of cultural mores and power. ''Soulful, sophisticated and skeptical, full of great one-liners,'' it is ''one of those novels that blithely leap across the border between literary and popular fiction,'' Valerie Sayers wrote here in 2002.    PAKISTAN: In the Shadow of Jihad and Afghanistan, by Mary Anne Weaver. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $14.) A correspondent for The New Yorker surveys modern Pakistan and the impact of militant Islam, exploring subjects like falconry and desert fortresses in addition to politics. She provides ''a descriptive, traveler's-eye view'' of a shaky but strategically vital nation, Robert D. Kaplan said here last year.    IF THE SPIRIT MOVES YOU: Life and Love After Death, by Justine Picardie. (Riverhead, $13.) Following the loss of her sister, Ruth, to cancer, the author, a British journalist, sought out an assortment of psychics, channelers, gurus and other paranormal types in a quest to contact Ruth and overcome her grief. Picardie displays ''a sensible skepticism and a wry irony,'' Lauren F. Winner wrote here in 2002. And she ''captures perfectly . . . the letting go that happens while the bereaved aren't looking.''

Often enough, their world looks as bleak as the \\"stained and pale\\" moon rising from the \\"ragged edge of black pines\\" at the lake where one character goes to escape his insomnia. Throughout this collection, people wrestle with their sense of estrangement from one another. In \\"Family Lore,\\" a daughter watches while her father is humiliated by his brothers, then thinks about the way we create distances \\"for ourselves in this small world.\\" Many of Mr. Bausch's characters, whether married or not, could identify wholeheartedly with the narrator's refrain in a story called \\"The Stag  Party\\": \\"I am completely alone.\\" Even when they try to shake off their inertia,  as Daniel Cochran does in \\"Vigilance\\" when he breaks into a house to teach his neighbors a lesson about the importance of forming a neighborhood watch, they cannot escape their fundamental sense of alienation: \\"Cochran . . . wanted to laugh with them and feel young and blameless.\\" But the problem with these stories isn't their grim outlook. Instead it's their execution: endings that sometimes dwindle off, without much resolution or insight","excerpt":"language that fails to engage. And yet Mr. Bausch is capable of better things.

In it the doc engages in every known therapeutic activity, from research in pneumonia prevention to psychoanalysis; yet you couldn't call him a general practitioner, either. About the only way you can describe him is to say that he is a specialist in everything, and he demonstrates his versatility this time by tactfully showing his young assistant how to clear up a case of psychoneurotic blindness while simultaneously prognosing into thin air a frightening cardiac condition in the young doctor's father.The tragic secret of Dr. Gillespie, though, is that he can heal every one but himself.

After 23 years as a toll supervisor for the state he wanted to be outdoors doing something that was enjoyable and that would generate a modest income. He found it in vast fields of trumpet-shaped day lilies.   Mr. Krupian, 76 years old, whom everyone calls Augie, breeds thousands of day lilies on quiet Bethmour Road in Bethany. \\"I loved roses but they were too much work,\\" said Mr. Krupian who has bred day lilies for 12 years. \\"Day lilies are easy to cross and transplant, and they hardly have any disease or bug problems.\\"    The Krupian family grew up on a 96-acre dairy farm. Today the farm is a manageable 20 acres although it takes Mr. Krupian seven and a half hours riding on a mower to cut all the lawns. He remembers his father buying one of the first trucks in Bethany. He and his three siblings attended a one-room schoolhouse in town. \\"There were 10 dairy farms in those days, but now Bethany is a bedroom community for New Haven,\\" he said. Farming for the Draft Dodger    During World War II the Farm Bureau inspected farms to assess how many men were needed to supply food and how many could be spared for the draft. \\"The rich used to buy farms for their sons to keep them out of the Army,\\" he recalled. \\"I enlisted. I wanted to get away from farming.\\" Mr. Krupian ran a post exchange in Japan but said he was too independent to make the military a career. He returned to Bethany and a country life.   The Krupians always had a huge vegetable garden. Over the last 12 years Mr. Krupian has gradually reduced the vegetables and allowed the day lilies to take over. Interspersed with the flowers are volunteer dill seedlings, rows of tomatoes and peppers, sweet potatoes and squash. He also raises apples and peaches, berries, peonies and cultivated varieties of wildflowers.   As he weeds and divides his plants he whistles his favorite chamber music. Often butterflies and mocking birds, orioles and robins join him. Sometimes ruby-throated hummingbirds come to the bright flowers for nectar.   His flower beds this summer were full of delicate lavender, soft pink and lemony yellow. He also raises vivid golds, earthy bronzes and assorted crimsons and scarlets. \\"When I started I liked vivid reds, like most men, but now I prefer softer colors like lavender, pale yellow and pink,\\" he said. Season Not Over Yet    Some of his clumps produce a new blossom each day for a month. Garden workhorses, day lilies bloom from mid-June to October.   Mr. Krupian was working in a nursery in the 1950's when he spied his first deep-red day lily and was fascinated by its beauty. When he was offered a cutting in the middle of a searing hot summer day he could not believe it would flourish. He soon discovered that day lilies were virtually carefree and could tolerate midsummer transplanting.    He inherited his gardening abilities from his mother. \\"She had a natural green thumb,\\" he recalled. \\"She didn't know anything technically but everything she planted succeeded.\\" The garden still holds many of her roses and trees.   Mr. Krupian and his brother share a house on the spot where the original Krupian homestead stood. It had been offered to the fire department by a previous owner to burn down for practice. When the brothers moved back onto the family property they built their present house.    Undemanding day lilies may be divided and planted any time of the year if the soil is workable and not frozen. Mr. Krupian buys stock to use for breeding and sells his original crosses and divisions. Most of his seedlings sell for $10 to $25, and the rarer varieties for $75. He prefers not to sell special plants to gardeners who do not know or do not care about their flowers. Recently he turned away a customer who needed flowers for her new rock garden. \\"Day lilies are much too large for a rock garden,\\" he explained. He did recommend miniature hostas as more suitable.  Abundance of Roadside Wildlings    Connecticut is lavishly blessed with fulva, the ubiquitous orange wildling found along roadsides in midsummer. But Mr. Krupian is not enthusiastic about the wild day lilies. \\"We find them garish,\\" he said. \\"No matter where they are planted they draw the eye and throw the rest of the garden out of kilter.\\"    His breeding goal is a sun-fast red. The darker reds, he explained, tend to fade in full sun while the brighter reds enjoy sunshine. He speculates about creating a blue day lily some day, but that will occur in a laboratory, he explained, with the blue color borrowed from another plant, perhaps a delphinium or even a wild chickory.   To propagate his flowers he divides clumps","excerpt":"large clumps can be divided into several new plants. Some plants produce natural \\"baby plants\\" called proliferations, which he just snips and plants. Creating New Varieties    To try new varieties Mr. Krupian chooses two attractive plants. He gathers the pollen from the anther of one plant and rubs it onto the pistil of another. If the hybrid is successful a seed pod forms. He allows it to ripen and then harvests the shiny black seeds, which he plants in trays of damp seed-starter and refrigerates for about six weeks. Since he has so many, his trays go to a greenhouse where he rents space but a sunny windowsill or fluorescent light tubes will also do. It takes patience. No flowers will appear for two years, he said, but then a new variety will be born with surprising results. Mr. Krupian said it was a simple process, one that he explains to his garden visitors several times each day. \\"They'll be pleased with the first blossom, then they become more discriminating,\\" he said.    His expert eye favors new varieties with clear color, a good bud count, vigorous branching, clean foliage and height in proportion to foliage, and no flowers on short stems hidden within their leaves.   The man who has bred thousands of new plants himself said simply: \\"Anyone can do this. I do it because I'm trying to get a good-looking flower.\\" And he encourages success in his clients' efforts. \\"If you come up with a great flower then more power to you.\\" Take Your Pick: Day Lilies Bred for Hue"},{"year":"1952","title":"Zoning Bd and Planning Comm to conf on procedures for 'designed area' plan","excerpt":"large co seeks site for home office STAMFORD TO WEIGH 'DESIGNED AREA' PLEA"},{"year":"1928","title":"Large deposits located by French engineers MOROCCO MAY GAIN INDUSTRIAL REPUTE","excerpt":"Large Coal Deposits Found by French Engineers Seen as Asset for Future.

But it lasts four hours. Length is part of its problem. A much greater problem is that the political message that is only one of the threads in the first part thickens into hawser dimensions, strangling the film and the audience along with it.Translated as \\"The Travelling Players,\\" Thiassos is a bloated, spoiled masterpiece. But it is, at the same time, the undoubted high point of the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors series, being shown at the museum today and Wednesday. So far, this year's series has given us a number of fairly dim talents, and sometimes considerably less than that.Theodor Angelopoulos, whose third film this is, possesses enormous talent","excerpt":"large enough to show clearly through his monstrous lack of restraint and, often, to overcome it. Since restraint is easier to acquire than genius, there is a basis for hoping that we are seeing the work of someone who is destined to become a truly great film maker.\\"Thiassos\\" attempts to tell the story of modern Greece through the wanderings of a band of actors, an unskilled provincial group that sings and dances in front of village theaters to lure audiences inside for a performance of a rough shepherd's play.The action begins in 1939, goes through World War II and the civil war and ends in 1952. Using flashbacks, flash-forwards and narrated recollections, it manages to suggest a broader time span from the 1920's up to the time of the colonels' coup.The film's structure is even more complex than its time frame. It is the story of political developments in Greece as they affect the villages visited by the troupe: the right-wing prewar Metaxas dictatorship, the national unity of right and left during the brief fight against the Axis, the civil war and—as the film sees it—the victory of reaction over popular forces.At the same time it is the story of the troupe itself; the decimation of the company under the stress of personal and political passion. Mr. Angelopoulos manages to blend both things—the jealousies and betrayals within the company and the political divisions of right and left—into a retelling of the Electra tragedy.There is no space to begin to enumerate the many marvelous things that are accomplished. Over such a sprawling arrangement for example, Mr. Angelopoulos manages a fair unity of mood by shooting virtually the whole film in the cold, milky overcast of Greek winter.He has some prodigious images. The wartime famine is declared in a tiny scene. A solitary chicken is shown on a snow-covered slope; the members of the troupe advance upon it in black, crablike profile. He has filmed hunger.Elektra, the young actress, is accosted by a black-shirted member of a pro-Metaxas gang. She takes him to her room and tells him to strip. He does, completely. He takes off his first garments in leering anticipation; then, beneath her contemptuous gaze his movements become less certain. Finally, his total nakedness coincides with total humiliation as she turns and walks out. It is a scene of merciless justness.There are many scenes of equal brilliance and force. The acting and camera work are flawless. Mr. Agelopoulos takes many risks. He holds camera or characters still for minutes on end; he has scenes that consist of one character addressing the camera at length. Usually these things work, in surprising ways.But the film begins to flag in the middle. In part, the deliberate pace becomes excessive. Many of the slow gestures begin to seem like affectations.Furthermore, the message begins to shed its complexity and become simply a tract praising the Communist forces who lost the civil war and attacking and caricaturing the conservative victors and their British and American allies.The execessive politicization in a work of normal dimensions and equal ???talent???t would simply be a flaw. Here it is immensely magnified. The discoveries of the first two hours turn into a relentless pounding during the last two.

Suddenly on July 14th, 1998 in Lenox, MA. Lifetime resident of New York City. Loving son of the late Leonard and Ruth Hess. Devoted brother of Katherine A. Hess. Special friend of Diane Dickinson. Beloved friend of so many others. Friends may call Thursday evening July 16th from 7-9 PM at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81 St with service Friday, 11:30 AM. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Stephen Hess Pediatric Social Enhancement Fund, c/o Lenox Hill Hospital, 100 East 77th St., NY NY 10021.    HESS-Stephen R. A very wealthy man has left us. If wealth can be measured by the number of people who loved Steve Hess, yes loved, he was indeed a rich man. We, his friends, acquaintances, and even those who thought they knew him are diminished by his passing. It isn't trite to write that Steve was one of this town's more unique, over-the-top, likeable, maddening & lovable personages. He was a large man. Large in physical stature, large in his appetite for life","excerpt":"large in his love for anything played with a ball; and in his love for and need of his friends the numbers of which are truly uncountable. The word ''fan'' derives from the word fanatic and Steve was the quintessential fan of all sports. Most of all he rose, but mostly fell, over the sporting achievements of his beloved University of Pennsylvania. But, a croquet team from outer space would have earned his attention. He loved the thrust and parry of good ideas & stimulating conversation on any topic. He could hold his own in small talk with anyone on the planet and the funny thing was that oft times the conversation or the jibes were all about him. You didn't mind. He was that type of a person. He made you smile and laugh and that's not a bad ability to have had. On the other hand, he was nobody's fool, either. To be joshed and insulted by him enrolled you into a fraternity of friends and one was not averse to wearing his remarks as a badge of achievement. His invariable good humor and outrageous wit disarmed all. You knew that no malice was involved. On the other hand, he spoke truth. If he had a problem on his mind about some person or thing, he never let his concerns fester but spoke up. You knew where you stood with Steve. He had friends all over the world, and as an inveterate traveler, he rarely needed a hotel as bed and board were available to him from Australia to Wales; from New Jersey to Colorado. Moreover, he had the remarkable knack of befriending the children of his friends. Not an easy trick these days. He accepted them, and they he, as equals. He was a good traveling companion and had eclectic interests. First of all, in traveling with Steve, you rarely had to participate in any conversations. You just listened. Aside from sports, Steve had a great interest in the American Civil War & World War II and he pursued these interests by being a museum rat and through trips as diverse as to England, France and Gettysburg just to check things out for himself. He thoroughly enjoyed playing thoroughly mediocre golf with his ''guys'' at Quaker Ridge. While the foursomes changed in composition, they never suffered from silence. And, there are many patients and visitors to patients at Lenox Hill Hospital who will remember his unique style in handling their switchboard as a longtime volunteer. Friends knew that under the layers of continuous talk and talk there was another, and a more real, Steve. A Steve that was introspective, vulnerable, thoughtful, caring and generous. Others may have thought they knew him by the persona he wore. These people, regrettably, never got to see, or know, the real Steve. There is a line from an old song lyric that seems appropriate to recall today, ''So easy to remember; but so hard to forget.'' That was Steve. We shall miss him-many will. That is not a bad legacy. Joyce and Bernard West Jane West and Stacy Clark    HESS-Stephen R. The Board of Directors and members of the Quaker Ridge Golf Club record with deep sorrow the passing of our esteemed member, Stephen R. Hess, whose many years of friendship and devotion to the Club will always be remembered. We extend our deepest sympathy to the family. Richard M. Feldman, President Edward J. Landau, Secretary    HESS-Stephen R. In loving memory. We will always miss him. The Weiss Family Ron, Ellen, Chris, Hilary and Billy Cooper, Carolyn and Chris Clayton    HESS-Stephen R. My dearest friend, thank you for your love, caring and devotion. You could always make me smile. I miss you so very, very much. Diane.    HESS-Stephen R. A wonderful friend and companion.

It was resonant with old-world geniality, its good-natured charm informed by long experience, its cheerfulness verging on wisdom. This concert, along with several \\"Ariadnes\\" in Philadelphia (the last is Saturday night), are Mr. Sawallisch's first full-scale opera performances in the United States, and given what he accomplished with 37 players of the Philadelphia Orchestra and a cast of accomplished singers, the delay has been our loss.
