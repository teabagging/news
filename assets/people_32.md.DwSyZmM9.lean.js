It's a way of keeping it all in the family: if the show succeeds, the profits from its initial run and its later syndication go to the same corporate parent. This year, the trend is stronger than ever","excerpt":"Paramount Network Television, for example, is producing shows only for CBS and UPN, which like Paramount are owned by Viacom. Is a show's corporate bloodline the best predictor of whether it makes it onto a network's schedule? Looking at the 10-year trend, Steve Sternberg, an analyst at Magna Global USA, said yes. And synergistic favors don't end there. ''An in-house program has a better chance of getting a good time period, and of being given more time if it's not working right away,'' he said. On the eve of upfront week, when networks announce which series they're picking up, here's a look at how many of the shows they were considering were produced by sister studios.    ABC: 15 of 27 pilots were produced or co-produced by another Disney unit, Touchstone Television. ABC's three big new hits, ''Lost,'' ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Grey's Anatomy,'' are Touchstone shows; repeating that success rate will be hard. But three of the pilots, ''Pros & Cons,'' ''What About Brian'' and ''The Catch,'' are from J.J. Abrams, who also produces ''Lost.''    CBS: 12 of 19 pilots produced or co-produced by Paramount Network Television, from ''Quantico'' (about F.B.I. profilers, starring Mandy Patinkin) to an untitled sitcom centered on Susie Essman, the foul-mouthed comedian from ''Curb Your Enthusiasm.''    FOX: 16 of 23 pilots produced or co-produced by 20th Century Fox Television or its Regency Television unit. ''Prison Break,'' from 20th Century Fox, has already been picked up.    NBC: 15 of 23 pilots produced or co-produced by NBC Universal. The post-''Friends'' NBC wants a hit sitcom: 11 of the 15 are half-hour comedies.    UPN: 6 of 10 pilots produced or co-produced by Paramount Network Television or Spelling Television, both owned by Viacom.    WB: 9 of 18 pilots produced or co-produced by Warner Brothers Television. Greg Berlanti, the WB favorite son behind ''Everwood'' and ''Jack and Bobby,'' has ''The Prince,'' a soap opera about a rich family in New York.

Without the indefatigable Hope and his entourage — Jane Russell, Les Brown's Orchestra and the dancers, Condos and Brandow—the Paramount wouldn't have anything to crow about. For \\"Captain China\\" is a very ordinary sea adventure story, which gets so muscular at times that it becomes unwittingly funny.The producers might just as well have called this one \\"Slow Boat to China\\" because there is very little pace to the picture despite the violence of the ocean and the passionate hatreds which lead to mayhem as the freighter Crosswinds plows through the South China Sea to Manila. The special effects cameraman has put a howling typhoon on the screen, but the script writers didn't contribute any obsorbing narrative in recounting the revenge of a captain who was cheated out of his command by an overzealous first mate.John Payne as Captain China literally punches his way through this picture in a running encounter with Red Lynch (Lon Chancy), who locked him in his cabin on the ill-fated freighter Honan, which foundered in a storm. Captain China's journey to Manila is to clear himself and regain his license. (The script writers mention that he was drunk at the time of the disaster, but never bothered to explain how China is going to talk himself out of that.) Aboard the Crosswinds he discovers that his old mate Brendensen (Jeffrey Lynn) is the skipper and that Lynch is a member of the crew.Being a man of action, Captain China decides to beat the truth out of Lynch. (It's remarkable how actors will suffer for their art.) A convenient typhoon which reveals the incompetence of Brendensen as a captain enables China to take command and demonstrate that a good first mate doesn't necessarily possess all the attributes required of a dependable ship's master. Gail Russell is the passenger who becomes the pivot of amorous contention between the rival skippers and Edgar Bergen and Ilka Gruning as an aged Dutch couple on the way home to Holland are made to act insipid.The Paramount can indeed say \\"Thanks For the Memory\\" to Bob Hope and company because \\"Captain China\\" is hardly the way to win friends and influence movie-going.

The novel, about a Midwestern girl's experiences at an elite East Coast boarding school, makes its first appearance this week at No. 11 on the hardcover fiction list. Sittenfeld, who is 29, says she wasn't prepared for the book's reception. ''I saw 'Prep' as an underdog book,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''There wasn't exactly a bidding war for it. My agent sent it to 15 publishers before Lee Boudreaux, an editor who was then at Random House, loved it and bought it.'' There are a lot of reasons ''Prep'' is resonating with readers, says Daniel Menaker, Random House's executive editor in chief -- he cites the book's eye-catching cover, and the fact that the novel addresses timely and complicated class and race issues. ''But most important,'' he says, ''the book happens to be terrific.'' After a first printing of 16,000 copies, there are now some 70,000 copies of ''Prep'' in print","excerpt":"Paramount recently bought the film rights. Sittenfeld's original title for her novel was ''Cipher,'' and she is now glad she was talked out of it. ''People thought it must be a murder mystery,'' she said. Before publication, she came up with a long list of other potential titles -- including ''Class Day'' and ''The Privilege Thief'' -- before settling on ''Prep.'' ''The title was Lee Boudreaux's idea,'' Sittenfeld said. ''It came to her as a kind of vision. Now I can't imagine it any other way.''

On this week's hardcover nonfiction list, Amber Frey's memoir, ''Witness,'' appears at No. 4 after five weeks on the chart. Ten years ago this week, in the Feb. 19, 1995, issue of the Book Review, a different tabloid murder case made its presence felt: the O. J. Simpson spectacle. Simpson, who had just gone on trial, had the No. 1 book on the hardcover list with ''I Want to Tell You,'' his response to the mail he'd received. The book at No. 2, Sheila Weller's ''Raging Heart,'' was a quickie account of O. J.'s marriage to Nicole Simpson. And at No. 9, Nicole's friend Faye Resnick roasted O. J. in her book, ''Nicole Brown Simpson.'' On the fiction side, the No. 1 book was James Redfield's turquoise-hued novel ''The Celestine Prophecy.'' At No. 2 was James Finn Garner's sly ''Politically Correct Bedtime Stories.''

Although the parallel is open to some question and seems affixed as a convenient afterthought to a previously completed picture, the film as a whole has mordant power.The latter is due entirely to the vivid pictorial quality of the captured and Signal Corps footage that is used to review the Italian campaign and also to the crispness of Paramount's editing. At least four-fifths of the picture is given over entirely to this review, together with pictorial re-enactments of the experiences of a Medal of Honor winner and an unsung hero of the campaign.The two heroes, whose war experiences are cleverly and tastefully restaged so that the episodes fit quite credibly into the factual frame, are former Sgt. James M. Logan of the Thirty-sixth Infantry Division and former Capt. David Ludlum, an Army Air Forces weather man.Sergeant Logan won the Medal of Honor for wiping out a German machine-gun nest and single-handedly capturing a German officer during the fighting at the Salerno beachhead.Captain Ludlum was the man who forecast the all-important weather break during the crucial siege of Cassino, on the strength of which the Allied attack was launched. Both men play themselves in the re-enactments included here.It is no discredit to the producers that the concluding phase of the film is dramatically anticlimactic and academic, in the main. There has been no battle footage from Korea, as yet, to match or even compare with that of the Italian fighting, so the editors obviously were reduced to drawing an arbitrary parallel in a commentary, which Quentin Reynolds speaks.And for all Mr. Reynolds' rugged features, his face talking at you does not display the similarities of the Korean terrain, nor the arduousness of the campaigning there. Also, the enemy in Korea was vastly different from that in Italy.\\"Cassino to Korea\\" is essentially a good review of the \\"forgotten war\\" in Italy.???mate. But our apothecary, a gent who is not to be trifled with, talks it out right smartly with both the conniving dame and his unwitting son. Faced with the damaging knowledge that the police are on to her little game and the fact that her lover is dropping her, our tarnished heroine commits suicide.The whole matter, it might be noted, is tied up as neatly as druggist Sutton wraps his packages with pink strings and sealing wax. He relaxes enough to allow his son to marry his true love and his daughter to pursue a singing career. The performances, however, are not nearly as neat nor is the dialogue better than an amalgam of vapid phrases and stilted speeches.Googie Withers is a handsome adventuress who seems to enjoy her ill-fated lot. Mervyn Johns is merely stiff as the apothecary, and Gordon Jackson, as his gullible son, and John Carol, as Miss Withers' curly-haired boy friend, are adequate in the other principal roles.

To determine whether the tale is true or, as the defense suggests, an elaborate concoction by a woman who consented to the sexual activity, a jury has been hearing testimony for nearly a month.    The steadily growing audience in State Supreme Court in Long Island City has heard the 22-year-old woman and other prosecution witnesses give sordid descriptions of sexual abuse. Included have been details of the oral sodomy that the woman says the men made her perform on them.

Paula Vogel, the author of \\"The Baltimore Waltz,\\" scrutinizes this provocative issue in \\"And Baby Makes Seven,\\" which opened last night at the Lucille Lortel Theater. In the play, a menage a trois awaits the imminent birth of a baby. The expectant mother (Cherry Jones) is a lesbian who wants to have a child, but without the complications of questions of paternity. The father (Peter Frechette) is gay, and the third character is the mother's lover (Mary Mara). The pregnancy begins as an act of pragmatism, but the relationships become more intricate as the three continue to live together. Their spacious New York City loft becomes a hothouse environment.   Deep within this discursive play is an untapped story of emotional alliances that transcend matters of sexual identity. Such thoughts and others are submerged in a Gothic nursery tale gone awry. Instead of exploring her characters, the playwright falls back on children's games. Together, the women have a flourishing fantasy life, in which they pretend to be children. In her fantasy, Ms. Jones becomes a proper English schoolboy, Cecil, and Ms. Mara doubles (or is it triples?) as the French youngster in the movie \\"The Red Balloon\\" and as a mischievous sprite named Orphan McDermott.

Braque was born in Argenteuil-sur-Seine on May 13, 1882, as the son of a house-painter and decorator and grew up to be one of the great French painters of all time.   He earned that title on two quite separate counts. Between the fall of 1909 and the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, he and Pablo Picasso jointly and in close association renewed the potential of art. As has been said a thousand times, theirs was one of the great all-time creative partnerships. Not only did they produce one masterpiece after another in idioms that had little or no precedent, but they pushed on door after door that had hitherto been blocked up and left them all open for others to walk through.   For his share in that partnership the name of Georges Braque could be written forever in marble in places where others would be lucky to have their names penciled on paper.

Having a means of nuclear deterrence not only gives the French the theoretical possibility of wiping out 30 Soviet cities. Every Government since Charles de Gaulle introduced the force de frappe in the 1960's has also understood that an independent French atomic arsenal means a French say, or at least the necessity to take France into account, when people talk about how the world is going to be run.\\n\\nThe Soviet argument that the French nuclear forces should be counted into the equation leading to an agreement on intermediaterange missiles in Europe - rejected both by the French and United States Governments - grows out of the fact that French force is pointed at Soviet targets. But the argument disregards the fact that while France remains a member of NATO and cooperates with its military wing in some areas, its nuclear force is, in the words of one expert, ''impeccably independent.''

And by the time these designs make it to the store racks in the United States, their costs will be formidable as well.   But these new Parisian styles should not be interpreted as examples of designers deliberately turning their backs on working-women's needs. When these clothes, with their strong shapes and overtly feminine flourishes, are modified -- as they will be by American manufacturers -- yet another direction for fashion will have been charted.
