Translated by E. A. Goodland.  169 pp. New York: Random House. $14.95.     THE Brazilian poet, essayist, musician and novelist Mario de Andrade (1893-1945) first published his verbal rhapsody called ''Macunaima'' in Sao Paulo in 1928. This first printing was of some 800 copies, done at his own expense. He wrote the work in six days flat, a burst of poetic furor without much parallel in the history of Latin American letters. Eventually, in later editions, he added some bits and trimmed others, but the book still stands pretty much as he originally wrote it.    The book did not have an overwhelmingly positive reception","excerpt":"most readers were, and still are, perplexed by it. ''Macunaima'' started as a secret, subversive artifact. Few readers could figure out what the author was up to and almost no one divined the structural unity behind the interwoven motifs. The work was just too much, too flamboyant, too obscene, too squalid, too indecorous - in the end, too foolish to be taken seriously. ''Macunaima'' owed nothing to any literary tradition inside or outside Brazil, except that the old, accepted rhetoric appeared in parodic or satiric form. It did owe much to de Andrade's skittish perusal of anthropology, ethnology and folklore, particularly Theodor Koch- Gr\\"unberg's ''Vom Roroima zum Orinoco,'' an exhaustive five-volume study of the legends of Venezuelan, Guyanese and Northern Brazilian Indians, published in Berlin just after World War I.

DAVID OGILVY was already a legend on Madison Avenue and the author of the newly published ''Confessions of an Advertising Man'' when Jane Maas took her first advertising job, as a junior copywriter at Ogilvy & Mather in the early 1960's. She had the opportunity to learn from a master, and some of those lessons are evident in this book - not least its title. Mr. Ogilvy has only a walk-on part in ''Adventures of an Advertising Woman'' but is easily its most fascinating character. Unfortunately, both Mr. Ogilvy's creative genius and his flair for language have eluded Mrs. Mass. Without them, the craft of advertising that Mr. Ogilvy exalted is made to seem a trivial business in her book.   In 1982 Mrs. Maas, a copywriter turned account ex-ecutive, became president of Muller Jordan Weiss, a medium-size advertising agency. She is something of a first","excerpt":"most women who are agency presidents founded the agencies themselves. She is evidently a woman of considerable managerial talent and energy, which becomes clear from page one, where she describes her typical day (''5:30 A.M. Up to do warmups prior to our jog'').

Martha (Martina Gedeck), a chef in an upscale Hamburg restaurant, is focused and good at her game. When her 8-year-old niece, Lina (Maxime Foerste), arrives at Martha's doorstep because her mother has been killed in a car accident, Martha doesn't know what to do.

Still, there was ample reason to celebrate on Tuesday evening, when Mostly Mozart opened its 25th season at Avery Fisher Hall. The observance of the bicentenary of the composer's death has captured the public imagination to a degree that could scarcely have been imagined at the bicentenary of his birth, in 1956.   The runaway success of Peter Shaffer's \\"Amadeus\\" -- the play and, even more, the film -- was undoubtedly a factor in the Mozart boom of recent years, and of course the machinery of media hype can create prodigies far beyond those of even a decade or two ago. But the Mostly Mozart phenomenon played no small role in preparing the ground for an interest in the composer that has far transcended classical music precincts.

Of course, finding both common ground and telling contrasts between composers whose lives and styles overlapped is not brain surgery. But perhaps Lincoln Center programmers figured that by missing the mark in all but the final program, they could create a sense of cathartic release with one that actually made sense.    The orchestral concert last Saturday evening, which was conducted ably by John Nelson, began with excerpts from the second act of Beethoven's \\"Creatures of Prometheus,\\" a work best known for having yielded a theme that was later used in the \\"Eroica\\" Symphony.

In fact, the finest performance overall came in a work of understated eloquence, Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4, despite a slightly shaky start by the Mostly Mozart Orchestra under Gerard Schwarz.   The veteran pianist Shura Cherkassky spun out a mellow, flexible interpretation with a technical aplomb that continues to belie his 80 years. He could have made more of certain events, as, for example, Claudio Arrau used to do with the low isolated eighth notes in the subsidiary theme of the finale, firmly planting the root for the episode to follow.

Beloved and devoted wife of Isidore Komanoff, a stock broker and philanthropist who died in 1985","excerpt":"mother of Frederica Miceli, Ruth Underwood and Charles Komanoff; grandmother of Andrew Miceli, Dorian Bandy, Amalia Bandy, Daniel Komanoff and Alexander Komanoff. After graduating from the New York University School of Commerce in 1931, she enjoyed a successful career in merchandising with Abraham & Strauss. In 1947 she and her family moved from Brooklyn to Long Beach, where she dedicated her life to the care of her family and friends and to the service of her community. As a Long Beach resident for 53 years, she was in the forefront of volunteer civic work and progressive political activities, serving as an elected member of the Board of Education from 1957 to 1973 and as the Supervisor of Long Beach on the Nassau County Board of Supervisors from 1974 to 1985. With her husband and on her own, she was a generous benefactor to many local institutions and national organizations. Her Supervisor's salary was donated to charity. The Hannah and Isidore Komanoff Center for Rehabilitative Medicine and Geriatric Care, part of the Long Beach Medical Center, has been in the vanguard of its field since its inception almost 30 years ago. Decent, fair and compassionate, her life was a testimoy to her belief in the dignity, equality and inherent goodness of all people. With intelligence, humility, charm and kindness, she always put the well-being of others before herself. She will be profoundly missed and lovingly remembered.    KOMANOFF-Hannah. The Board of Trustees of Long Beach Medical Center records with profound sorrow the passing of our colleague and magnificent benefactor Hannah Komanoff. As a member and officer of the Board since 1973, her wisdom, generosity and forward thinking helped the Medical Center to grow and prosper. She showered our hospital and the nursing home that bears her name with caring concern and compassion for all those less fortunate than herself. She was a friend to many and a champion to the underprivileged. Our deepest sympathy to her children and her extended family. We are all diminished by her loss. Alfred Osterland, Chairman, Board of Trustees Bernard Kennedy, President, Board of Trustees Martin F. Nester, Jr., Chief Executive Officer    KOMANOFF-Hannah. We mourn the loss of former Supervisor of the City of Long Beach for 12 years. Singlehandedly she rescued Long Beach in the mid 70's by restricting the flow of released mental patients from state psychiatric hospitals into our city and by her insistence that every state, county and city agency with oversight for adult homes enforce their regulations. Her efforts resulted in the creation of a model program offering mental health and personal skills services since duplicated throughout the state and country. Mrs. Komanoff's work sparked the renaissance of Long Beach that continues to this date. A great humanitarian and lady; a true friend and mentor. Mal Newman, Ellen Rosen and Estelle Sealine    KOMANOFF - Hon. Hannah. Temple Israel of Long Beach records with sorrow the passing of our Honorary Trustee and Sisterhood Life Member. Her contributions to this institution & the entire community will serve as a perpetual reminder of her dedication to her faith and humanity. Mark I. Samuels, Co-President Bruce A. Sklover, Co-President Jacob Chiger, Rabbi Karl S. Kritz, Cantor Marcia Kaskel, Sist. President    KOMANOFF-Hannah. The medical staff of Long Beach Medical Center is saddened by the passing of Hannah Komanoff. She helped propel the growth of our Medical Center and was a great friend to all of the members of the medical staff. We will greatly miss her gentleness and caring spirit.
