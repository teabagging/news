London newspapers are exchanging shots with Buckingham Palace following reports that some younger members of the royal family are cavorting while the rest of Britain goes to war.   Editorial writers and pundits in papers ranging from the street-corner tabloids to the staider Sunday Times have implored the Queen and her aides in recent days to make the more impetuous of the royal brood behave with agreater sense of decorum and restraint. \\"This country is at war,\\" The Sunday Times said in its main editorial, \\"though you would never believe it from the shenanigans of some members of Her Majesty's clan.\\"   The newspaper cited public accounts in recent weeks of the Duchess of York skiing, the Prince of Wales pheasant hunting, the Duke of York golfing and Lord Linley, the Queen's nephew, at a nightclub on a Caribbean island, wearing red lipstick and standing alongside other men dressed in drag.   In a rare counterattack, Buckingham Palace answered the volley late on Sunday. \\"Queen Fires a Patriot,\\"The Sun, a tabloid, said in a banner headline this morning, describing the palace's quick riposte.   \\"All members of the royal family are behind British forces every inch of the way,\\" said a statement attributed to the Queen, which included a long inventory of the visits and events attended in recent weeks by members of the royal family that were intended to lend support to service personnel and their families.    Moreover, there was a raft of announcements on the press wires today describing the visits of various members of the royal family to military installations. The Prince and Princess ofWales traveled to the Royal Navy base in Plymouth, Devon, the home port of many ships in the gulf","excerpt":"Princess Anne flew to Germany to meet the families of servicemen, and the Duchess of York is preparing to go to the Royal Naval Air station at Portland on Tuesday.   Andrew Morton, a historian and author of several books on the royal family, said the criticism by The Sunday Times \\"has obviously touched a raw nerve.\\"    He said the royal family had a strong military tradition. \\"Prince Philip served in the Second World War, George VI, the future King, fought at the Battle of Jutland, and Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, fought in Falklands,\\" he said. \\"As you remember, he flew a helicopter as a decoy for Exocet missiles, so I don't think there shouldbe any question about his willingness to serve.\\"   Prince Andrew is now a naval flight commander, but the ship on which he serves has not been sent to the gulf.    On the BBC television news tonight, in a discussion about the controversy, Lord St. John of Fawsley, a former Conservative minister, called the newspaper attacks \\"garbage.\\" Among other things, he noted that the picture of Lord Linley wearing lipstick was taken several months before the war broke out.    But Howard Brooks-Baker, an expert on the royalty and the publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said the war in the gulf had only served to crystallize what he described as building public resentment over the behavior of some members of the royal family.   \\"The Queen and Prince Charles remain immensely popular and beloved,\\" Mr. Brooks-Baker said. \\"But for several years now, there has been a growing perception that some younger members of the royal family have become a spectacle.\\"    In Today, a tabloid, the banner headline this morning read, \\"Queen in Crisis.\\"   \\"British men and women are facing death in the service of their country,\\" the paper wrote. \\"Yet the nearest a royal has got to front line action is grouse shooting.\\"   Appearing on a television program this week, Andrew Neil, the editor of The Sunday Times, said he wanted to apologize for an earlier remark in which he compared the royal family to a soap opera. He said he was sorry because the comparison was unfair to soap operas.

As the carved silhouettes tell their mystical story, the audience murmurs in the background, a Jakarta slum where noise itself is a constant murmur, fragmented and mysterious: bamboo creaks ominously, the night wind carries a snatch of laughter, the sound of weeping, a cry of alarm, the echo of a sigh.   Vivid and eerie, the opening scenes of ''The Year of Living Dangerously,'' opening Friday at Cinema I, set the mood for what is to come, which among other things is a portrait of a strange and exotic culture where Westerners realize suddenly that they have lost their bearings, that their experience has in no way prepared them to understand the complex and powerful forces that are now governing their lives as well as those of the starving, desperate millions around them.

It is a curious ending, for she is shown as the leading lady of a picture being taken at the Tiffany-Stahl Studios in Hollywood. The Tiffany-Stahl organization, needless to remark, is responsible for this production. Where the name came from, and why, is not explained.We see first of all a conference of the mighty at Hollywood, where Victor Trent, the star, is trying to find some play in which to fully express himself. He states suddenly that he has a good story—all that it lacks is the ending. After telling the mighty ones about it, they decide to go ahead. After all, an ending is unimportant.The story, as Mr. Trent relates it, deals with the death of the Russian royal family. It develops that he was there, and instead of shooting the Princess Anastasia he helps her to escape. Subsequently he gets to Hollywood and becomes an actor. But he still wonders what happened to the woman he aided in far-away Russia.As noted, the mighty decide to film the story and set about getting their cast. Almost at once Mr. Trent sees an extra girl standing on the lot — the Princess, none other. She is hired, despite the director's comment that she doesn't look royal, and the camera work begins. In the cellar some one has loaded Mr. Trent's pistol so this time he does shoot the Princess. She recovers at the end.The idea of the play within a play is excellent, but there is too much dispute about the Princess Anastasia at the present time to make the Tiffany solution anything but bathos. If the theme has been drawn from the imagination rather than from disputed history it would have been a good picture. As it is there are scenes which are above the average. The acting of Eve Southern and Walter Pidgeon is acceptable if taken apart from some of the situations they encounter.

While the plot is standard stuff (mismatched couples, a lost inheritance), the musical style is somewhat unexpected: Kern repeatedly stresses a wistful strain of yearning in his remarkably delicate score -- so subdued that its orchestra's rhythmic propulsion comes not from piano or drums, but from harp. John McGlinn and his expert orchestra and chorus bring its distinctive atmosphere persuasively to life. The talented and stylish cast (with especially outstanding work from Ms. O'Hara, Mr. Gaines and Mr. Graae) and ideal sound make this the most satisfying of New World's documentations of the American musical.
