This does not mean creating a new bureaucratic agency or merging the Commerce Department with the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Rather, the Government should unify certain trade and investment responsibilities now divided among the Office of the Trade Representative, the Commerce Department and several other executive branch agencies. Conceivably, the change might include the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.\\n\\nOther major industrial countries combine these various functions in a single, powerful trade ministry.

So while teen-agers suffering from suburban anomie flock to hard-core bands like Collapsing Lungs and Marilyn Manson, hip young Cubans have made the roots singer Albita Rodriguez, who arrived here less than a year ago, the toast of Spanish-speaking Miami. But Haitians gravitate to groups like Koleksyon Kazak, and black rap fans are still looking for the successors to 2 Live Crew.    Some of the most interesting new music in Miami, though, comes from performers who have a foot in more than one camp. The Cuban-American singer and songwriter Nil Lara, who has made the Stephen Talkhouse club in Miami Beach his home base, is a prime example: here is someone as familiar with Led Zeppelin as with Beny More, who artfully blends rock and Latin elements into music both muscular and intelligent. Mary Karlzen, whose first record on Atlantic will soon be released, is a more familiar hybrid, writing and singing elegant pop songs filtered through a strong country sensibility.

Don Strock had replaced Bob Griese at quarterback for Miami with Cleveland ahead, 17&#8208;10. Strock then threw touchdown passes of 2 yards to Bruce Hardy and 4 yards to Delvin Williams, the latter with 3:53 remaining in regulation time. But Brian Sipe, who gained 358 yards with 23 pass completions in 42 attempts, took the (8&#8208;4) Browns 72 yards to the tying touchdown, with Ozzie Newsome scoring on a 35&#8208;yard reception with 1:21 to play. The Browns needed less than two minutes of overtime to nail down the victory. They covered 74 yards in five plays, winning on a 39&#8208;yard pass from Sipe to Reggie Rucker. Griese completed 10 of 21 passes for 115 yards but was intercepted twice. Strock hit on six of 10 attempts for 89 yards.

Metro-North Commuter Railroad, which operates the building owned by the Penn Central Corporation, wants to change all that. As part of its effort to restore Grand Central, it wants to encourage commuters and tourists, as well as New Yorkers, to linger awhile: to eat dinner there, to buy takeout food or just to sip cappuccino and watch the parade of people.   After several years of preparatory work, the railroad, a division of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, will soon choose a restaurateur to take over the waiting room, a soaring space with marble floors, stone walls and gold chandeliers that could become one of the most stunning retail spots in the city.   Whoever is chosen will have an opportunity, in such a highly visible spot, to influence taste and trends. The person \\"is guaranteed to be a high-profile player with serious volume in one of the world's most famous buildings,\\" said Clark Wolf, a food consultant who is helping Metro-North evaluate its plans.   On the other hand, the winner could just lose big. It will cost at least $2 million, and perhaps twice that, to transform the empty space. And while the lunch potential in Grand Central seems lucrative, filling a big restaurant at night could be tough. It's not clear whether train and subway riders will delay their arrival home to stop for a drink or dinner. And creating a place that will draw hundreds of people at night to an area with little entertainment nearby is always difficult.   After some preliminary cuts, Metro-North has come up with a list of four finalists, all New York restaurateurs: Sheldon Fireman, owner of Trattoria Dell'Arte and Hosteria Fiorella","excerpt":"Michael (Buzzy) O'Keeffe, owner of the River Cafe and the Water Club; Andrew Silverman, an owner of Prix Fixe and Steak Frites, and Tony May, the owner of San Domenico, whose partner is Glen Rosengarten, who founded the Food Emporium supermarkets.   The restaurateurs submitted written plans, and then presented them personally to Metro-North officials last week. Jeanne Giordano, the director of the Grand Central Terminal Development Office, said it would be at least six weeks before a selection is made. The new complex may open by next fall.   The winner could help alter the way visitors first experience the city. The perception among some that New York is a dirty, dangerous place may come partly from dispiriting gateways, whether Penn Station, the Port Authority bus terminal or Grand Central. Changing the first impression might help set a different tone.   Several years ago, Metro-North announced a 10-year plan to renovate Grand Central. Slowly, it has stripped away structures added to the station over decades. The huge Kodak sign that hung over the main concourse was torn down, exposing a lovely, long marble balcony. A Merrill Lynch trading booth in the center of the room is gone, as is the 13-foot-high advertising clock.   Work began three years ago on the waiting room, which sits on both sides of a corridor from the entrance on 42d Street nearest Park Avenue. The room was vital to the station when it opened in 1913 as a center for long-distance travel. Gradually, though, it was abandoned by train riders, who had less need for it when long-distance trains were rerouted to Penn Station. By the end of the 1980's, the waiting room was a camp for hundreds of homeless people. They were evicted and the room was boarded up.   Now, that huge space, still hidden behind painted plywood barriers, has been cleaned up at a cost of $4.3 million. The tarnished chandeliers turned out to be gold plate, not brass. The once-dingy marble and stone walls are now cream colored. Despite 60-foot ceilings, the room manages to feel warm and inviting.   Although Metro-North officials knew they wanted a retail operation in the space, \\"it wasn't until the look of the place started to come back that it became clear what it should be,\\" Ms. Giordano said. \\"It was very European looking, like a food hall.\\"   For those who have become wary of the station, the idea of eating there might seem strange. But since its inception, food has been a part of Grand Central. The Oyster Bar, for instance, has flourished for much of the last 79 years.   There may be a market for more, although no one really knows how many of the people who rush through each day will slow down to eat or buy food. In one study, Metro-North found that one in five commuters said they would like to be able to buy freshly prepared foods at the terminal.   Generally, the four restaurateurs have proposed selling food at a variety of price levels, from white tablecloth dining to takeout sandwiches. Some have ambitious plans to create a fancy food store in addition to a restaurant.   Mr. Silverman, who has been a chef and restaurant owner since attending the Culinary Institute of America in the late 1970's, would call his space Centro. On one side of the hallway that divides the waiting room would be a 375-seat cafe designed in materials like steel, oak, alabaster, marble and slate, with tall Beaux Arts-style street lamps. Lunch in the cafe would cost about $12.   On the other side, Mr. Silverman would put a 50-foot circular coffee bar. Around the room would be counters selling fruit and vegetables, mints, chocolate, prepared foods and sandwiches, with areas where food could be eaten.   He would plan special events for the space, too, like cooking classes and wine seminars. \\"It's just a great opportunity,\\" he said. \\"It's probably the second-most-talked-about building in the nation, besides the White House.\\"   Mr. Fireman, a native New Yorker who is mostly known for his Italian restaurants, says he wants to create a distinctly American restaurant on one side of the space.   \\"We want a menu that gives you an opportunity to eat there every day,\\" he said. \\"Not designer-y food.\\" His menu would carry things like calf's liver, crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, lamb chops, shoestring potatoes and hot fudge sundaes.   The other side of the space would have an inexpensive Italian cafe with pastas, focaccia and the like, as well as a juice bar and a newsstand. Although Metro-North wants takeout food, he's resisting the idea. People \\"aren't going to schlep food home on a train,\\" he said.    The design for the American restaurant uses lots of wood and upholstered chairs. \\"I didn't want the East Side and flash,\\" Mr. Fireman said. \\"This is a universal place.\\"   Mr. O'Keeffe, who already owns a small restaurant called the Cafe at Grand Central, which overlooks the station from a balcony, prides himself on starting restaurants in difficult places and making them work. When he found the spot that is now the River Cafe, a sparkling haven on the Brooklyn waterfront, it was desolate. The Water Club on the East Side, he said, had been a rat-infested, crime-ridden parking lot.   On one side of the Grand Central space, Mr. O'Keeffe said he would have a big cafe that would be open early for breakfast. \\"You can come naked or in black tie,\\" he said. \\"This is New York. But no muscle shirts. It's too contrived.\\" There would be a communications center for faxing and such, and another restaurant with entrees as expensive as $27.   On the other side of the space would be a concierge, a range of takeout food, a chocolate factory, an ice-cream parlor, a newsstand, a charcuterie and a produce and flower shop, all in wrought-iron kiosks.   Mr. May imagines the space as a fancy-food emporium with both packaged and prepared items, like Harrods in London, and a cafe in the center. On one side would be a restaurant with \\"anything from hot bagels to caviar,\\" said Mr. May, who has owned several Italian restaurants and once managed the Rainbow Room.    On the other side would be a retail food center with baked goods, fruit and vegetables, charcuterie and pastries, around a central seating area. He'd like to make beignets, the holeless doughnuts from New Orleans, a breakfast staple -- a suggestion also made by Mr. Silverman. All kinds of service would be available. \\"You could order flowers for your wife's birthday and six steaks, and we'd deliver them on the trains,\\" he said.   Metro-North and M.T.A. officials will choose a winner with help from an advisory committee that includes Drew Nieporent, owner of Montrachet and an owner of the TriBeCa Grill; Tom Margittai, an owner of the Four Seasons; Stephen Fass, formerly associated with the Marketplace at Macy's Cellar; David Rockwell, an architect who has designed many restaurants; John Belle, the restoration architect for the building, and Mr. Wolf.   \\"What we're trying to discover is who has the capacity and the resources,\\" Mr. Wolf said. The details of the proposals are less important.  \\"There isn't a restaurant that opens that doesn't change,\\" he said. \\"This is the beginning, not the end.\\"   The project, though, is hardly without risks. Michael Weinstein, president of the Ark Restaurants Corporation, which owns large restaurants in Union Station in Washington, was originally interested in the Grand Central project but withdrew when he decided that it might be too expensive. Mr. Weinstein said he believed it might be too difficult to make the space both a retail food store and a restaurant.    \\"If you're going to be Zabar's, be Zabar's,\\" he said. \\"If you're going to be a restaurant, be a restaurant.\\"    Limited access to the loading docks for delivery during the day, he said, would have made the preparation of fresh food throughout the day especially difficult. And it isn't clear, he said, as it was in Washington, what will be going into the other retail spaces in Grand Central.   Ms. Giordano, who was hired three years ago to oversee the retail transformation of the terminal, said it originally had stylish stores, and she hopes to revive that. She has already persuaded designers like Donna Karan and Michael Kors to use it for fashion shows and parties.   Some changes are tiny but welcome, like the foreign exchange currency windows that just opened. A new bookstore, too, is on the way. Some parts of the project, though, await financing. The vast central ceiling, designed with the image of the zodiac, is a muddy green. Eventually, Ms. Giordano hopes it will be restored to the original robin's-egg blue.

At least it makes no pretense of being anything but a musical interlude dragged in by the scruff of its neck to illustrate the devastating effect upon the public of some anonymous young busybody's question about the workings of a three-valve sax horn. Like the \\"March of Time,\\" it preserves in film the stark record of a social phenomenon—in this case, the conversion of a song hit into a plague, like Japanese beetles or chain letters.For the rest, you should find it all in your memory book. \\"The Music Goes \\"Round\\" (which would have been called \\"Rollin' Along\\" if Farley and Riley had not been encouraged) retells the one about the musical comedy star who takes a vacation and finds a showboat troupe whose players are so bad that he lures them to Broadway to become, without their knowledge, the comedy hit of his new revue. So often before has this formula been used that it requires something more than a Harry Richman and a Rochelle Hudson to keep you from yawning in its face.There is some minor, but overly prolonged, comedy in the showboat company's scenery-biting performance, Mr. Richman sings a few moderately effective melodies better than moderately well, and we seem to recall one or two pleasantly staged dance routines. Beyond these meager words of praise we can offer little encouragement to the new film. It just went 'round and around and came out nowhere.

A15    Doubts Cast on Vietnam Data  The National Security Agency has kept secret since 2001 a finding by an agency historian that N.S.A. officers deliberately distorted critical intelligence during the Tonkin Gulf episode, which helped precipitate the Vietnam War, two people familiar with the historian's work said.   A1    Colleges Focused on Funds  College presidents are more preoccupied with financial issues than educational ones, according to a new survey by The Chronicle of Higher Education. The presidents said they believed they were judged slightly more on whether they had a balanced budget than for the quality of their educational programs.   A12    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Ferrer and Bloomberg Square Off in First Debate  Fernando Ferrer, the Democratic mayoral candidate in New York, tore into Mayor Bloomberg during their first debate, saying he has failed to address the dual crises of unaffordable housing and high dropout rates among high school students. Mr. Bloomberg argued that his record on public safety, the economy and education had earned him a second term.   A1    Housing Boom on Hudson  From Yonkers to Kingston, thousands of units of town houses and apartments to buy or rent are planned along the Hudson River, where manufacturing has long been in decline.   B1    SPORTSMONDAY   D1-12    ARTS   E1-10    Bleak Future for Downtown Art  Arts groups struggling with the void left by the 9/11 attacks are expressing frustration with the lack of progress in developing new cultural projects downtown. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the agency in charge of rebuilding in the area, has failed to deliver on promises to help area artists and institutions, the groups say.   E1    Online Rock Persona Unmasked  Paul Ford, a Brooklyn-based writer and Webmaster, has unmasked himself as the alter-ego of ''Gary Benchley,'' an online persona whose fictional exploits as a striving rock musician were documented in an online magazine for nearly two years.   E1    Soccer Star Reborn on TV  Diego Maradona, an Argentine soccer star who was once hailed as the greatest player of his generation, is emerging from a decade of drug abuse and tabloid antics to reinvent himself as a television showman. As host of ''Ten's Night,'' he combines elements of talk shows, game shows, and reality television.   E1    OBITUARIES   B7    Al Lopez  One of baseball's most prominent managers of the 1950's and the oldest member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, he was 97.   B7    BUSINESS DAY   C1-14    Hedge Funds Face Losses  Some of the year's best performing hedge funds are nursing big losses for October, stung by reversals in energy stocks, takeovers and investments overseas. Some large hedge fund managers may end up with losses of 5 to 10 percent for the month, according to people briefed on the results.   C1    Chocolate for Your Heart  Mars Inc. is introducing what it says is a healthy new sweet: CocoaVia, a line of chocolate bars and chocolate-covered almonds. One CocoaVia bar has half the calories and two-thirds of the saturated fat of a Snickers bar and, according to Mars Inc., it is good for your heart and arteries -- although some nutritionists are skeptical.   C1    Task of Rebuilding CBS News  In some ways, Sean McManus, the new leader of CBS News, must take on challenges similar to the ones he faced when he took over the sports division in 1996, although the stakes are much different.

''I had this lunch interview yesterday,'' he says, ''and the man told me, 'I hate Broadway plays.' And then he said, 'The only thing I hate more than Broadway plays is movies made from Broadway plays.' ''   ''Deathtrap'' is, of course, a movie made from a Broadway play.  (For a review, see page C8.) And Mr. Caine considers himself lucky to be in it. ''For years I never got a part that hadn't been turned down by somebody else. 'Alfie' was offered to every actor in England. And I knew about it because I wasn't famous, so nobody tried not to hurt my feelings. I've never turned down anything. But the films I'd like to have done are usually done by Albert Finney. I'd have loved to do 'Two For the Road,' and 'Shoot the Moon.' And the comedies Dudley Moore gets.''   Of the pictures he has starred in, Mr. Caine's favorites are ''Alfie'' (''I am by nature vulgar''), ''California Suite,'' ''Get Carter,'' ''The Ipcress File,'' ''The Wrong Box'' and ''The Man Who Would Be King.''

In 1952 at the age of 19, he stepped onto a stage in a small country town in Sussex, England, with his fly unbuttoned. The laughter in the audience that this provoked made him forget the single line he was supposed to speak, \\"Come along with me, sir.\\" He reports, \\"When one of the actors whispered it to me, his voice was so soft I did not hear what he said and I replied, 'What?' in a normal voice.\\" Though the play was not a comedy, the audience's laughter swelled.

Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.    Broadway    * 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' Madly enjoyable. Alan's Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HOT FEET'  A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    * 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke syntheziers, where kids can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice-versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ANNULLA' Eileen De Felitta is charming in Emily Mann's worthy one-woman play about a Jewish woman who passed for Aryan in Nazi Germany, but too much time is devoted to less intriguing aspects of the character's life (1:20). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka)    'BEAU BRUMMELL' Ian Kelly is funny, engaging and intensely sympathetic as the early-19th-century British fashion plate who spent his last years in exile (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)    *'BILLY CONNOLLY LIVE!'  This popular comedian will remind you of a Scottish George Carlin, with a bit of Eddie Izzard mixed in (2:00). 37 Arts, 450 West 37 Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)    'CAGE LOVE' The new thriller by Christopher Denham -- star of ''Red Light Winter'' -- is a compulsively watchable, sometimes ridiculous drama about a man who becomes increasingly suspicious of his wife-to-be (1:30). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman).    'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO'  The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts. (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell)    'COLUMBINUS' The grim ecosphere of the average American high school is analyzed with sympathy and precision in this new play by Stephen Karam and P J Paparelli, which aims to expose the cultural and personal pathologies that gave rise to the horrific events in Littleton, Colo., in 1999, when two students went on a murderous rampage at Columbine High School, killing a dozen students and a teacher before killing themselves. Well acted and stylishly directed, the play exudes earnestness, and a measure of self-importance, too (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAMLET' Theater by the Blind's modest, pared-down production offers an angry, sarcastic prince; an Ophelia who won't stop singing; and a Polonius who actually seems to know what he's saying (2:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'THE RACE' Impending fatherhood stuns a man almost speechless in this brisk trot through nine months of anxiety. Performed by the London-based troupe Gecko, ''The Race'' is a hybrid of theater and dance, and lasts just an hour. Occasionally the inventive imagery stalls, and the show seems to run out of imaginative breath, but it provides enough small-scale wizardry to please fans of physical theater (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SUCKER FISH MESSIAH' Ryan Michael Teller's drama about two brothers, one on the verge of a nervous breakdown, is just a disjointed collection of monologues and encounters, several of them misogynist. (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, ext. 16. (Gates)    'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger)    'I WILL COME LIKE A THIEF' The writer Trish Harnetiaux and the director Jude Domski have together created the potent outline of a parable about passive if still jittery Americans awash in government gobbledygook after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. But there is a staginess to their random characters that is hard to overcome, and ultimately the play, set in an American city being evacuated, does not live up to its promise (1:15). The 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Andrea Stevens)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'COWBOYS!' This melodrama spoof with gay men at the Straight Arrow Ranch makes up for what it lacks in professionalism with a good-natured goofiness (2:10). Wings Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 627-2961; closing tomorrow. (Gates)    'J.A.P. CHRONICLES: THE MUSICAL' Isabel Rose, an energetic overachiever, wrote and performs this one-woman show based on her own novel. To her credit, she was willing to hack apart her book to make a viable work of theater, and belts out tunes that are catchy (if uninspired), but the result feels superficial, trafficking in the kinds of obvious stereotypes her background leads you to believe she'd like to challenge (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Anne Midgette)    * 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY'  This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion (2:20). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'LESTAT'  A musical sleeping pill, adapted from Anne Rice's ''Vampire Chronicles'' and featuring songs by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, that could well give the makers of Ambien a run for their money. Dare to look upon this tale of the undead and keep your eyelids from growing heavier and heavier and heavier (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, near 47th Street, (212) 307-4100; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'THE NECKLACE' In eight parts, shown two at a time, this loony show -- set in a spooky house with a mysterious history -- helps revive an old and beloved form: the serial (2:15). The Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo; (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman).    'A SPALDING GRAY MATTER' This darkly comic solo show, written and performed by Michael Brandt, tells the story of the playwright's own tragic sickness and recovery. It proves that aping Spalding Gray is not easy (1:10). The New Group at Theater Row, Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)    * 'STUFF HAPPENS'  Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'YOUNG PLAYWRIGHTS FESTIVAL XXIV' An interesting evening of one-acts by three young women who were 18 when their plays were selected offers a glimpse -- at times humorous -- of what some teenage Americans are thinking about. The fact that the subjects are frequent headline topics, like alcoholism, incest, attempted suicide and the failure of science and organized religion to heal the world, should not surprise (2:00). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Stevens)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'AKEELAH AND THE BEE' (PG, 112 minutes) Eleven-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) objects to her daughter's obsession with what she considers a ''game.'' The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is, in essence, a formulaic picture into something more satisfying: an underdog tale that manages to inspire without being sappy. (Dana Stevens)    * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters operating during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing. (Manohla Dargis)    'ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL' (R, 102 minutes) A lump of misanthropy from Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes, who made the sublime ''Ghost World.'' This time they plod through a grouchy attack on -- and example of -- the pretense and hypocrisy of self-declared artists. John Malkovich's performance as a drawing instructor is sly and insightful, a glimpse at what the movie might have been. (A. O. Scott)    * 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Stephen Holden)    'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)    * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-Western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)    * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)    * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)    'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)    'POSEIDON' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Wolfgang Petersen's ''Poseidon'' is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. (Scott)    'THE PROMISE' (PG-13, 103 minutes, in Mandarin) A lavish spectacle -- somewhere between grand opera and cartoon -- from Chen Kaige, about a love triangle involving a general, a slave and a cursed princess. Sometimes breathtaking, sometimes out of breath. (Scott)    'REVOLOUTION' (No rating, 80 minutes) ''RevoLOUtion'' is the story of Lou Benedetti (Bret Carr), a washed-up Brooklyn palooka who overcomes a chronic stammer and serious anger issues in his quest to become a motivational speaker. But with his nonstop jabbering and Woody-Allen-on-helium voice, Lou is so annoying that not even a grumpy cameo by Burt Young and some lovely shots of the Brooklyn Bridge can save a movie as punch-drunk as its benighted protagonist. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden)    'SEE NO EVIL' (R, 84 minutes) In ''See No Evil,'' the professional wrestler Glen Jacobs (a k a Kane) plays a lumbering psychopath intent on butchering the juvenile delinquents on cleanup duty at the hotel where he's holed up. Propelled by an inebriated camera that careers off walls and, at one point, roots around in an empty eye socket, the movie soon devolves into a bloodily creative string of mutilations and impalings. (Catsoulis)    * 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Nathan Lee)    * 'THREE TIMES' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Mandarin and Taiwanese dialect) For this hypnotically beautiful cinematic trilogy, the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, one of the modern masters of the art, brings us love and loss in three different time periods. (Dargis)    * '12 AND HOLDING' (R, 94 minutes) This poignant, beautifully acted film, directed by Michael Cuesta (''L.I.E.''), flashes a laser beam on the moment between childhood and adolescence, when unguarded emotions and fantasies still rule, but adult experience beckons. (Holden)    'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)    'WAH-WAH' (R, 97 minutes) Scored to the death rattle of the British Empire in Africa, ''Wah-Wah'' observes the disintegration of the Compton family through the eyes of its young son. In his writing and directorial debut the actor Richard E. Grant probes the pungent details of his own childhood in Swaziland, vividly recreating a community steeped in boredom, booze and casual adultery. (Catsoulis)    * 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis)    Film Series    ROBERT ALTMAN (Through June 8) This weekend's films at the Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Mr. Altman's work include ''Gosford Park'' (2001), about snobbery and intrigue during an English country-house weekend; ''Health'' (1980) , a satire about physical fitness and presidential politics; and ''Short Cuts'' (1993), the director's interpretation of Raymond Carver stories about life in Los Angeles. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10.

BOUNCING SOULS (Thursday) The punk kings of New Jersey, Bouncing Souls have been going strong for nearly two decades, with no signs of slowing down; their new album, ''The Gold Record'' (Epitaph), is chock-full of adrenalized, ''Hey! Hey! Hey!'' shout-alongs. They begin a sold-out six-night run at the Knitting Factory. At 6:30 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. (Ben Sisario)    * T BONE BURNETT (Thursday) Best known as a producer who stylishly reimagines American roots music -- he made the soundtracks to ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' and ''Cold Mountain'' and has worked with Gillian Welch and Los Lobos, among others -- Mr. Burnett recently offered a reminder of his solo work: a new album, ''The True False Identity'' (Columbia), rooted in blues, reggae and wry political commentary. He plays a rare solo show at Town Hall. At 8 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 307-7171; $30 and $40. (Sisario)    FAB FAUX (Tuesday and Wednesday) There are Beatles tribute acts, and then there are Beatles tribute acts. This one, featuring the bassist Chris Lee (of the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' band) and the guitarist Jimmy Vivino (from ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien''), recreates even the most complex studio work of the later Beatles without breaking a sweat. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $30. (Sisario)    * HOWARD FISHMAN'S BASEMENT TAPES PROJECT (Tonight through Sunday night) Mr. Fishman has been rummaging through the attic of American song for years, finding witty insights in Dixieland, swing and bluegrass. This weekend he unveils a three-part tribute to Bob Dylan and the Band's ''Basement Tapes.'' Tonight's concert is devoted to the music's roots; tomorrow the focus is on unreleased songs from the sessions; and Sunday draws from the official 1975 album. At 7, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20 for one show, $35 for two, $45 for all three.

At 8 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036; $7. (Sisario)    HOWE GELB (Tomorrow) In Giant Sand and on his own, Howe Gelb creates hushed, still scenes with specks of countryish guitar and a 4 a.m. voice. The songs can be irritatingly shapeless, though, which is what makes Mr. Gelb's latest album, '' 'Sno Angel Like You'' (Thrill Jockey), such an unexpected pleasure: recorded with a Canadian gospel choir, the songs are tidy, concise and grand, yet lose none of Mr. Gelb's comforting informality. He appears with the full choir. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $16 in advance, $18 at the door.

(Sisario)    GRAVEYARDS, HAIR POLICE, PRURIENT AND CARLOS GIFFONI, HEATHEN SHAME (Wednesday) The fearsomely loud and intense Michigan band Wolf Eyes -- who once described themselves as ''the Lynyrd Skynyrd of noise'' -- hovers over this bill, an all-star lineup of sorts in the small, small world of noise rock. Graveyards features John Olson of Wolf Eyes, and Hair Police features Mike Connelly, a longtime friend who is a recent addition. Prurient, a k a Dominik Fernow, collaborates with Carlos Giffoni, a musician and scenemaker in New York, and Heathen Shame has members of Twisted Village and Major Stars. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; $10. (Sisario)    * NELLIE McKAY (Sunday) On nights off from ''The Threepenny Opera'' on Broadway, Ms. McKay, a songwriting sprite whom it is impossible to get tired of, is playing a series of late-night shows at Joe's Pub through June 18. These are rare chances to hear the songs from her excellent second album, ''Pretty Little Head,'' which has been in music purgatory since Ms. McKay was dropped by Columbia late last year. At 11:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sisario)    PEARL JAM (Thursday) Sounding limber and energized on its new, self-titled album -- oh why did it take Pearl Jam so long to find those thunderbolt AC/DC riffs? -- the alt-rock road warriors head out once again. With My Morning Jacket, a band from Louisville, Ky., with a calm and entrancing take on Southern rock. At 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario)    GRUFF RHYS (Thursday) In Super Furry Animals, Gruff Rhys plays wonderfully overwrought pop, cramming together Beach Boys melodies, zooming space-rock, noisy punk and some penitent country. On his own, he scales back the sound but not his ambitions. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; $12. (Sisario)    * RICKY SKAGGS AND KENTUCKY THUNDER (Thursday) Ricky Skaggs's fingers fly over just about anything with frets, especially the mandolin; he's no slouch on the fiddle, either, and he has the high tenor voice of a singer steeped in bluegrass. This concert, one of the first of the extensive River to River Festival, also features Andy Statman, Carrie Rodriguez and Citigrass. At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789. Free; tickets, two per person, are available at 5 p.m. (Jon Pareles)    SOUL POSITION (Tonight and tomorrow night) The rapper Blueprint and the D.J. and producer RJD2, allied as Soul Position, put the braggadocio in alternative rap.

(Pareles)    STAIND, THREE DAYS GRACE (Wednesday) With stock grunge riffs and lyrics like ''The truth is that I'm not so good at showing how I feel,'' Staind's music could be mistaken for the program of a very loud group-therapy session.

The members of Sunn O))) -- whose name is a tribute to a brand of amplifiers -- dress in long robes as they perform low feedback epics in glacial time. Boris, from Japan, has a wider palette, and an appetite for sonic violence.

(Pareles)    YELLOWMAN  (Tuesday) More proof that Jamaican music is stranger than fiction. Yellowman is a great dance-hall reggae vocalist who also happens to be an albino. He has built his career on tongue-in-cheek sexual boasts, and although his popularity peaked about 20 years ago, he still puts on a good show, mixing wicked wit with sentimental old favorites. With Dub Trio. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25 in advance, $27 at the door.

(Dunning)    * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) No new Diamond Project ballets this week, just repertory programs in which two of those premieres can be seen -- Peter Martins's tonight, Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux's tomorrow and Wednesday nights. There is also an amusing ''All Stravinsky'' program Sunday afternoon -- amusing because it seems to be going head to head with American Ballet Theater's ''All-Star Stravinsky'' run at the Metropolitan Opera House. The City Ballet season continues until June 25. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 8, tomorrow at 2 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or nycballet.com; $30 to $86; student rush tickets at $15. (Rockwell)    ELKE RINDFLEISCH (Tonight through Sunday night) Ms. Rindfleisch's new ''Damage,'' set to live music, begins with her six dancers struggling as if pushed and dragged by internal physical forces, and ends with dancers moving through a setting that includes a moveable staircase, a hallway to nowhere and a mysteriously illuminated corner. At 8:30, Wallabout Studio, 50 Taaffe Place, between Flushing and Park Avenues, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (917) 251-4561; $15. (Dunning)    PAZ TANJUAQUIO/TOPAZ ARTS (Thursday) A double bill from the Philippine-born Ms. Tanjuaquio and the composer Todd Richmond. It includes ''Thunder Against 1.2.3.,'' in which Ms. Tanjuaquio uses her mellifluous voice and clear movement style to evoke images of Southeast Asia and suggest larger political concerns. She also presents a preview of a new work, ''Soundless Music,'' inspired by a 1952 Yoko Ono text. Well, why not? (Through June 3.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; Thursday benefit gala, $50. (June 2 and 3, $20; $15 for students and 65+.) (Sulcas)    TAP DANCE DAY CELEBRATION (Sunday) This is the 17th gala performance celebrating National Tap Dance Day: Flo-Bert Life Achievement Awards will be handed out, and a number of well-known tappers -- including Mable Lee and Jimmy Clyde -- will perform to music by the Frank Owens Trio. These events tend to be long, but Ms. Lee's legs should make it all worthwhile. At 7 p.m., Fashion Institute of Technology Haft Auditorium, 227 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (718) 975-6867 or questions@nytap.org; $25 to $65. (Sulcas)    BILL YOUNG/COLLEEN THOMAS & DANCERS (Thursday) Mr. Young and Ms. Thomas have collaborated for years as dancers and choreographers. This latest program will include their new ''A Place in France,'' whose set has transparent distorting panels, magnifying lenses, tanks of water and live close-up video. (Through June 2.) At 7:30 p.m., Tisch School of the Arts, 111 Second Avenue, at Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 998-1982; $15; $12 for students and 65+.(Dunning)    ZVIDANCE (Tonight through Sunday) New works by Zvi Gotheiner include ''Les Noces,'' his version of Stravinsky's ballet about marriage, and ''12A,'' a commentary on superstitions about the number 13, to a commissioned score by Scott Killian. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25; $15 for students and 65+. (Anderson)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    * BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' through June 11. Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Grace Glueck)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,'  through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. And Church's oil sketches alone are worth the price of admission: exquisite, plainspoken Emersonian love poems to New York and New England. 2 East 91st Street, at Fifth Avenue, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)    * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. (An exhibition of her drawings is on view at the Drawing Center.) 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. A certain confusion, both intellectual and visual reigns, but there is more than enough to look at. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (See above.) (Glueck)    * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or themorgan.org. ( Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Holland Cotter)    Museum of Modern Art : 'AGAINST THE GRAIN: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM THE EDWARD R. BROIDA COLLECTION,' through Sept. 18. The latest collection assembled by the Museum of Modern Art bolsters its holdings of art world mavericks like Philip Guston, Jennifer Bartlett, Ken Price and Vija Celmins and includes first-timers like Robert Grosvenor, John Lees and Susana Solano. It also illuminates parts of the untold, or forgotten, stories of the art of the 1970's and 80's: the achievements of painters and sculptors who were not at the forefront of Post-Minimalism, photo appropriation or Neo-Expressionism. Some of their efforts may disappear into storage, but quite a few will shake up the Modern's conception of the complicated course of art since 1970. The Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400. (Smith)    New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 18. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. Concentrating on books, but also including prints and drawings, it retells the tale of the French avant-garde on a relatively egalitarian playing field. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith)    NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years, the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)    * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)    Galleries: Uptown    * Willem de Kooning, 'Paintings 1975-1978' Working with wide brushes, putty knives and other unidentifiable tools and methods, de Kooning improvised with abandon and to beautiful effect in these 13 paintings from the 70's. L & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, through June 3. (Ken Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    'EVA HESSE: DRAWING'  This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 15. (Glueck)    Galleries: Chelsea    MICHAEL BELL-SMITH This young American artist brings digital animation and painting into an unusually effective, visually ravishing alliance by a sparing use of motion, radiant colors and the suppression of narrative. Foxy Production, 617 West 27th Street, (212) 239-2758, through June 3. (Smith)    Julia Condon: 'Mandalas' Inspired by Tibetan tradition, Ms. Condon uses many thin glazes on square canvases to create entrancing, soft-focus mandalas in which diaphanous crystalline and floral patterns radiate from glowing centers. Dinter Fine Art, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 947-2818, through June 3. (Johnson)    Justin Craun: 'The Individual' Inspired partly by kitschy Christian record album cover images from the 1950's, this inventive young painter creates acidic, vividly abstracted and patterned portraits of people who look as if they've been possessed by evil aliens from outer space. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through June 10. (Johnson)    Willem de Kooning: 'Sketchbook' Twelve pages bearing spidery pencil drawings from a rare, intact sketchbook from the mid-1970's by this great Abstract Expressionist. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200, through June 17. (Johnson)    * Joe FiG With extraordinary skill and ingenuity, this young sculptor replicates in miniature the studios of well-known artists. The centerpiece of his exhibition recreates the adjoining Long Island studios of the painters and spouses Eric Fischl and April Gornik. Plus Ultra Gallery, 637 West 27th Street, (212) 643-3152, through June 3. (Johnson)    Ilya & Emilia Kabakov The painter, sculptor, storyteller and Conceptualist Mr. Kabakov and his partner, Emilia Kabakov, present a series of paintings they made recently, but that museum-style labels claim were made in the 1970's by Ilya Kabakov, who may or may not be the same person as the author of this exhibition. The paintings adroitly mix passages of Modernist abstraction and social realism, but the real interest is in the idea of the art history of an alternative universe. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through June 3. (Johnson)    'Never Mind the Bollocks: Here's Amanda Lear' Muse, film actress, professional Somebody, Amanda Lear is also a painter, as her oil portraits of Francis Bacon, Salvador Dalí and Leonardo da Vinci attest. But the point of the show is to pay homage to Ms. Lear herself, and some interesting artists: Scott Hug, Kanishka Raja, Ryan Steadman and James. J. Williams III, with paintings; Michelle Lopez and Anna Sew Hoy, with small sculptures; and -- best -- Christoph Broich with a large work of latex and lace titled ''The Girl Who Sold Her Soul to the Devil and Won.'' Envoy, 535 West 22nd Street, sixth floor, (212) 242-7524, through June 3. (Cotter)    * Rosalind Solomon, 'American Pictures from Chapalingas' This excellent exhibition of works from 1974 to 2000 surveys the career of a photographer with a keen eye for human individuality and a pitch-perfect sense of composition. Her art bears a family resemblance to that of Diane Arbus, but it is gentler and kinder. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through June 3. (Johnson)    Christoph Worringer In his large-scale allegories, this young German painter features multiple images of himself with pupil-less eyes in mysterious theatrical situations. Whatever they may mean, it is tantalizing to imagine where Mr. Worringer's blend of traditionalist figurative painting and Postmodernist surrealism might lead. Lucas Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3159, through June 10. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    Glen Fogel and Yoko Inoue Yoko Inoue, born in Japan, looks at what it is to be American in a solo show that includes a stack of woolen ''Old Glory'' sweaters made by weavers in South America, and a series of portraits of Ms. Inoue made by other artists. A new video by Glen Fogel, shot during the Billy Graham Crusade at Flushing Meadows, Queens, in 2005, focuses on the Christian rock bands that served as warm-up acts for Mr. Graham. The musicians look as if they could be from the 1960's, though the message they are delivering is very different. Or is it? Momenta, 72 Berry Street, near North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-8058, through June 12. (Cotter)    'Mystic River' The artist Noah Sheldon has assembled a lyrical group show not quite of this world. Dike Blair makes an unearthly thing of Las Vegas in a fine watercolor painting; the excellent Peter Coffin contributes a portrait in the form of a photographed aura; Martha Friedman offers a levitating rope; Ian Hundley displays a patch of aerial topography in the form of a crazy quilt; Roger White paints the sun. The spirit of Stephen Shore's 1970's photographs of the American landscape flows through it all. Southfirst, 60 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4884, through June 11. (Cotter)    Last Chance    'BREATHE DEEP NYC NO CHARGE'  Richard P. Rubenstein's short 1972 video of Gordon Matta-Clark's ''Clean Air Machine'' in action documents both an early instance of ecological Conceptualism and relationship aesthetics and a New York that seems very far away. Sara Tecchia Roma New York, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-2900; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    KADAR BROCK: PAINTING CAN YOU TAKE ME TO HEAVEN That question isn't answered by the canvases in this solo debut, but their visual rambunctiousness and slammed-together abstract styles and robust paint handling have definite promise. Buia Gallery, 541 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-9915; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    * Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE' Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000; closes on Sunday. (Smith)    NATHALIE DJURBERG This young Swedish artist's short, exquisitely colored, intensely barbed Claymation animations usually feature young women and girls engaged in various kind of vileness, conjuring up a darkness so over the top that it turns light. Almost. Zach Feuer, 530 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7700; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    CEAL FLOYER Using little more than a snippet of song, a blue balloon and fizz, the works in this exhibition offer proof that beauty is in the details hovering at the edges of perception. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1121; closes tomorrow. (Smith)    Judy Glantzman Her congested expressionistic paintings composed of scores of little human heads are like visions of hell by the Belgian Symbolist James Ensor. Also on view are scary and funny little doll-like figures made of a material called Super Sculpy. Betty Cuningham, 541 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-2772; closes today. (Johnson)    * International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography' If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000; closes on Sunday.(Cotter)    * Josephsohn A powerful exhibition of five crusty, semi-abstract, oversized heads cast in bronze by a Zurich-based sculptor who was born in East Prussia in 1920. Peter BLUM, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0441; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART'  That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700; closes on Monday. (Glueck)    Josephine Pryde: 'Maids & Magnetism' Obliquely conceptual, blurry, over-exposed and doubly exposed photographs that allude to spirit photography, Modernist experimentalism and consumerism. Reena Spaulings Fine Art, 371 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006; closes on Sunday. (Johnson)    Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT' This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org; closes on Sunday.

Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' Madly enjoyable. Alan's Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)    'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day-care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where kids can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'ANNULLA' Eileen De Felitta is charming in Emily Mann's worthy one-woman play about a Jewish woman who passed for Aryan in Nazi Germany, but too much time is devoted to less intriguing aspects of the character's life (1:20). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka)    * 'BILLY CONNOLLY LIVE!'  This popular comedian will remind you of a Scottish George Carlin, with a bit of Eddie Izzard mixed in (2:00). 37 Arts, 450 West 37 Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)    'CAGE LOVE' The new thriller by Christopher Denham -- star of ''Red Light Winter'' -- is a compulsively watchable, sometimes ridiculous drama about a man who becomes increasingly suspicious of his wife-to-be (1:30). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)    'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO'  The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell)    'COLUMBINUS' The grim ecosphere of the average American high school is analyzed with sympathy and precision in this new play by Stephen Karam and P J Paparelli, which aims to expose the cultural and personal pathologies that gave rise to the horrific events in Littleton, Colo., in 1999, when two students went on a murderous rampage at Columbine High School, killing a dozen students and a teacher before killing themselves. Well acted and stylishly directed, the play exudes earnestness, and a measure of self-importance, too (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DARK YELLOW' Elias Koteas and Tina Benko star in this compelling one-act psychological thriller about a one-night stand that involves one shocking revelation after another (1:35). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'HAMLET' Theater by the Blind's modest, pared-down production offers an angry, sarcastic prince; an Ophelia who won't stop singing; and a Polonius who actually seems to know what he's saying (2:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'MARATHON 2006' David Ives's haunting suspense tale ''The Other Woman'' highlights the first batch of short plays in the Ensemble Studio Theater's annual marathon of one-acts. A master of the comic short play, Mr. Ives channels his inner Rod Serling here, creating an eerie theatrical nocturne starring Ruthie Henshall and Scott Cohen, and directed with delicacy by Walter Bobbie. Two other fine two-handers, by Amy Fox and Anton Dudley, are also on the bill (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101.(Isherwood)    'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)    'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)    'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    * 'STUFF HAPPENS'  Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TROUT STANLEY' Claudia Dey's hysterically funny, deliciously lyrical piece of Canadian Gothic is about strange 30-year-old twin sisters and the mysterious man who arrives, D. H. Lawrence style, to upset the household's delicate balance (1:50). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)    'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'AIN'T SUPPOSED TO DIE A NATURAL DEATH' Melvin Van Peebles's 1971 Tony-nominated musical, ''Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death,'' isn't so much performed at the club T New York, as erupted, like some sort of streetwise lava flow. This early precursor to hip-hop, rap and poetry slams is a get-down, roiling depiction of ghetto life, and we're not talking urbane bling (1:30) T New York, 240 West 52nd Street, (212) 352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban)    'HAM LAKE' A gregarious 20-something man reveals more than he intends to in this 80-minute seriocomic barroom monologue by Sam Rosen and Nat Bennett. Mr. Rosen is a wry and skilled earbender. Huron Club at the SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Hunka)    'HERAKLES VIA PHAEDRA' Making her annual excursion into Greek myth and history, Ellen Stewart presents the labors of Herakles and the tragedies of Theseus with an exhilarating, rough-hewn mix of flamenco, wildly beautiful puppets, acrobatic combat between men and magical beasts and a classical South Indian dance performed with a live snake (1:30). La MaMa E.T.C. Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Miriam Horn)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway?

(Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'I WILL COME LIKE A THIEF' The writer Trish Harnetiaux and the director Jude Domski have together created the potent outline of a parable about passive if still jittery Americans awash in government gobbledygook after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. But there is a staginess to their random characters that is hard to overcome, and ultimately the play, set in an American city being evacuated, does not live up to its promise (1:15). The 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)    'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    'THE RACE' Impending fatherhood stuns a man almost speechless in this brisk trot through nine months of anxiety. Performed by the London-based troupe Gecko, ''The Race'' is a hybrid of theater and dance, and lasts just an hour. Occasionally the inventive imagery stalls, and the show seems to run out of imaginative breath, but it provides enough small-scale wizardry to please fans of physical theater (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'AKEELAH AND THE BEE' (PG, 112 minutes) Eleven-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) objects to her daughter's obsession with what she considers a ''game.'' The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is, in essence, a formulaic picture into something more satisfying: an underdog tale that manages to inspire without being sappy. (Dana Stevens)    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and essential movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)    * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters operating during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing. (Manohla Dargis)    'ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL' (R, 102 minutes) A lump of misanthropy from Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes, who made the sublime ''Ghost World.'' This time they plod through a grouchy attack on -- and example of -- the pretense and hypocrisy of self-declared artists. John Malkovich's performance as a drawing instructor is sly and insightful, a glimpse at what the movie might have been. (Scott)    * 'CAVITE' (No rating, 80 minutes, in English and Tagalog) Terrorism and cultural identity are only two of the themes wound into a tight knot of fear and bewilderment in ''Cavite,'' a gripping, no-budget political thriller shot on the fly with handheld cameras that scour the teeming streets and squatter shacks of Cavite, a city on the outskirts of Manila. (Stephen Holden)    * 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Holden)    'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)    * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-Western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)    * 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)    'THE KING' (R, 105 minutes) James Marsh employs both clichés and some lived-in emotions and atmosphere for his fitfully engaging, exasperating film about a young Mexican-American (Gael García Bernal) whose search for his patrimony leads him into the bosom of a deeply religious Texas family (headed by a very fine William Hurt). (Dargis)    * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)    * 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)    'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)    'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)    'POSEIDON' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Wolfgang Petersen's ''Poseidon'' is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. (Scott)    'THE PROMISE' (PG-13, 103 minutes, in Mandarin) A lavish spectacle -- somewhere between grand opera and cartoon -- from Chen Kaige, about a love triangle involving a general, a slave and a cursed princess. Sometimes breathtaking, sometimes out of breath. (Scott)    'SEE NO EVIL' (R, 84 minutes) In ''See No Evil'' the professional wrestler Glen Jacobs (a k a Kane) plays a lumbering psychopath intent on butchering the juvenile delinquents on cleanup duty at the hotel where he's holed up. Propelled by an inebriated camera that careers off walls and, at one point, roots around in an empty eye socket, the movie soon devolves into a bloodily creative string of mutilations and impalings. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    * 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Nathan Lee)    * 'THREE TIMES' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Mandarin and Taiwanese dialect) For this hypnotically beautiful cinematic trilogy, the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, one of the modern masters of the art, brings us love and loss in three different time periods. (Dargis)    * '12 AND HOLDING' (R, 94 minutes) This poignant, beautifully acted film, directed by Michael Cuesta (''L.I.E.''), flashes a laser beam on the moment between childhood and adolescence, when unguarded emotions and fantasies still rule, but adult experience beckons. (Holden)    'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)    * 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis)    'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)    Film Series    ROBERT ALTMAN (Through Thursday) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Mr. Altman's work concludes on Thursday with a screening of his newest ensemble comedy, ''A Prairie Home Companion,'' followed by a discussion with Mr. Altman.

(Gates)    TOMORROWLAND: CAL ARTS IN MOVING PICTURES (Through Aug. 13) The Museum of Modern Art is sponsoring a three-decade survey of films and videos by former students at the California Institute of the Arts.

Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)    THE VISION THAT CHANGED CINEMA: MICHELANGELO ANTONIONI (Through June 29) BAMcinématek's tribute to Antonioni begins on Wednesday with a weeklong run of his biggest commercial success, ''Blow-Up'' (1966). Vanessa Redgrave and David Hemmings star in the film, set squarely in swinging 60's London (the music! the fashions!), which tells the story of a fashion photographer who might have accidentally documented a murder. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    AVION TRAVEL (Tomorrow) The breezily romantic band Avion Travel is one of the jewels of the Italian music scene, playing a sophisticated mixture of French-Italian cabaret and Brazilian baião; the group stunned Italy six years ago by winning at Sanremo, a big pop festival not known for its sophisticated tastes. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $15. (Ben Sisario)    BARDO POND (Thursday) Bardo Pond, from Philadelphia, specializes in heavy, cyclical songs, letting big, dusty guitar riffs come round again and again.

(Kelefa Sanneh)    BOUNCING SOULS (Tonight through Tuesday) The punk kings of New Jersey, Bouncing Souls have been going strong for nearly two decades, with no signs of slowing down: their new album, ''The Gold Record'' (Epitaph), is chock-full of adrenalized ''Hey! Hey! Hey!'' shout-alongs. They finish up a sold-out run at the Knitting Factory with lots of guests: Blanks 77 (tonight), Paint It Black (tomorrow), Sticks and Stones (Sunday), the Slackers (Monday) and the Explosion (Tuesday). At 6:30 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. (Sisario)    JAMES BROWN (Thursday) He is the godfather of much more than soul: as the chief architect of funk, James Brown is one of the most influential figures in popular music since Louis Armstrong. He's a great dancer, too. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $80 in advance, $85 at the door. (Sisario)    ROY CARRIER AND THE NITE ROCKERS (Tomorrow) Mr. Carrier, an old-fashioned zydeco accordionist, takes a break from his club in Lawtell, La., to lead his band for a Southern Louisiana dance party in Times Square. At 8:30 p.m., with a free zydeco dance lesson at 7:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597; $22. (Sisario)    COCOROSIE (Tonight) As CocoRosie, the Casady sisters, Sierra and Bianca, make a swirling psychodrama out of girlish daydreams, hints of trip-hop, chirping crickets and cooed Billie Holiday-ish vocals. With Spleen and Nomi. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sisario)    DICK DALE (Sunday) Dick Dale, king of the surf guitar, provides no polite nostalgia trip to the mid-1960's. He's out to summon elemental forces with the stomping beat of his band and his heavily reverbed, brusquely attacked guitar lines, along with the dive-bombing, tremolo glissandos that literally melt his guitar picks from the heat of their friction on the strings. At 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Jon Pareles)    DAVID (HONEYBOY) EDWARDS, ROBERT LOCKWOOD JR. (Wednesday) These veteran Delta bluesmen, both born in 1915, boast close connections to the fabled Robert Johnson: Mr. Edwards played with him in the 1930's, and Mr. Lockwood learned some of his songs directly from the master. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $25. (Sisario)    THE FABULOUS SOUL SHAKERS (Tonight) Sort of an oldies Backstreet Boys, the Fabulous Soul Shakers are five talented young men -- each has won or been a finalist at Apollo Theater showcases -- assembled to perform letter-perfect renditions of doo-wop and soul from the 1950's and 60's. At 8:30, Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, between Henry and Hicks Streets, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069; $10. (Sisario)    * THE FALL (Tonight) Nearly 30 years ago, with jagged, jabby guitars and the tuneless slur of its leader and propagandist, Mark E. Smith, this British band laid out a reductionist ''three R's'' of pop: ''Repetition, repetition, repetition.'' Umpteen albums later, the Fall is a cornerstone of postpunk, and Mr. Smith still finds ways to make repetition sound new. With the Cairo Gang. At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; sold out. (Sisario)    * HOT 97 SUMMER JAM (Sunday) The annual mega-concerts presented by the radio station Hot 97 (WQHT-FM) are always among the biggest live hip-hop events in the country, a status derived as much from the long roster of stars as from the sparks that sometimes fly among them. This year features Mary J. Blige, Jamie Foxx, Busta Rhymes, Sean Paul, Three 6 Mafia, Chris Brown, T. I., Ne-Yo, Jermaine Dupri and Dem Franchize Boyz. At 7 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; $35 to $160. (Sisario)    MASON JENNINGS, TEDDY THOMPSON (Thursday) Heavy-lidded confessions by young men holding acoustic guitars can sometimes go the way of empty bromides, as they do in the songs of Mason Jennings (''Be here now/No other place to be''). Teddy Thompson fares better: the son of the great British folk-pop singers Richard and Linda Thompson, he absorbed some of his parents' pithy melancholy, an attitude that leaves room for some smirks: ''This is a party,'' Mr. Thompson groans, ''no frowns allowed.'' At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sisario)    JOAN JETT (Monday through Thursday) Joan Jett has been expertly playing the tough-chick-with-a-guitar role longer than many of her younger imitators have been alive. Promoting a new album, ''Sinner'' (Blackheart Records), she makes a sweep through the clubs of New York. Monday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20.

(Sisario)    LITTLE RICHARD (Tomorrow) He may always be most celebrated for bringing scat to rock (''A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop, a-lop-bam-boom!''), but Little Richard's delirious falsetto ''oooh!'' and androgynous showmanship have influenced everybody from Paul McCartney to Prince. At 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305 or (212) 307-7171; $47 and $57.

(Pareles)    * NELLIE McKAY (Sunday) On nights off from ''The Threepenny Opera'' on Broadway, Ms. McKay, a songwriting sprite whom it is impossible to get tired of, is playing a series of late-night shows at Joe's Pub. These are rare chances to hear the songs from her excellent second album, ''Pretty Little Head,'' which has been in music purgatory since Ms. McKay was dropped by Columbia late last year. At 11:30 p.m., the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sisario)    PEARL JAM (Tomorrow) Sounding limber and energized on its new, self-titled album -- oh why did it take Pearl Jam so long to find those thunderbolt AC/DC riffs? -- the alt-rock road warriors head out once again. With My Morning Jacket, a band from Louisville, Ky., with a calm and entrancing take on Southern rock. At 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario)    PEARLS AND BRASS (Wednesday) And on a certain beer-buzzed day (whose ordinal number is forgotten), Deep Purple, the James Gang and early Black Sabbath created fuzzy, head-nodding biker metal, and it was good. Many begats later, Pearls and Brass, from Nazareth, Pa., worships studiously at their altar. With Nudity and Endless Boogie. At 9 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 609-0484; $7. (Sisario)    LINDA RONSTADT (Tonight) Ms. Ronstadt's pleasurable, circuitous route through pop, having already covered everything from Queen's ''We Will Rock You'' to mariachi, next turns, on her coming album ''Adieu False Heart'' (Vanguard), to ''Walk Away Renee,'' the Left Banke's 1966 nugget of baroque psychedelia, as well as songs by Richard Thompson, Julie Miller and Bill Monroe. At 8, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $33.50 to $128.50. (Sisario)    SOUTHERN CULTURE ON THE SKIDS (Wednesday) This long-running three-piece from North Carolina knows just how much to poke fun at chicken-fried, backwoods rockabilly: a lot, but not too much to get in the way of some finger-licking twangy guitar. Don't let the band leave without playing its barnstorming ode to Santo, the vigilante Mexican wrestler. With the Demolition String Band. At 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $15. (Sisario)    THE STILLS (Tonight) On its debut album three years ago, this Montreal band took the sulking guitar minimalism of New York groups like Interpol and the Strokes and sublimated it into a shimmering, majestic gloom that recalled the glories of U2 and Echo and the Bunnymen. Its new album, ''Without Feathers'' (Vice), perplexingly slows things down to a bored crawl. With Rogue Wave. At 10 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406; sold out. (Sisario)    * SUPER FURRY ANIMALS (Tonight) The Welsh band Super Furry Animals plays wonderfully overwrought pop, cramming together Beach Boys' melodies, zooming space-rock, noisy punk and some penitent country. This show, with Dead Meadow as the opening act, begins the modest but essential summer series at the South Street Seaport, as part of the River to River Festival. At 7 p.m., Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free. (Sisario)    * TAPES 'N TAPES (Sunday and Tuesday) A few months ago this Minneapolis band, playing dry, indie-pop rhapsodies recalling Pavement and the early Pixies, was little known. Then came a big Internet buzz courtesy of bloggers and the tastemaking Web site Pitchfork. But the group also found success in a comfortingly old-fashioned way, by blowing everybody away at the South by Southwest festival in March; within a month the group had a deal with XL Recordings and a busy tour schedule, including these two sold-out dates. With Figurines and Cold War Kids. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. (Sisario)    MARY TIMONY (Tonight) Mary Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces. With Tralala, Human Television and Tiny Amps. At 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Pareles)    WOLFMOTHER (Tomorrow) The retro-rock wayback machine makes two stops in the music of this Australian band: to the screamy abandon of mid-1960's garage rock (the fingernails-on-blackboard yelp at the beginning of the band's debut album will bring a smile to any fan of the Sonics, who sang ''Psycho'' and other garage classics), and then forward just a few years to the amp-throbbing, proto-metal bacchanals of Blue Cheer and Black Sabbath. With Deadboy and the Elephantmen. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. At 2 p.m., the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $58, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden)    BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package.

In her new show of Sondheim songs her dramatic instincts match her singing in subtlety, taste and insight. At 8:45 and 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $75. (Holden)    ANDREA MARCOVICCI (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) Ms. Marcovicci's new show, ''Just Love  by Request'' is a kind of living room musicale that's one-half pre-set and one-half determined by audience suggestions. The singer's charm rules this unruly format. At 9 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $60 cover Tuesday through Thursday, $65 tonight and tomorrow; $60 prix fixe dinner required for 9 p.m. shows; otherwise, a $20 minimum.

(Chinen)    DOWNTOWN MUSIC GALLERY 15TH ANNIVERSARY SHOW (Tonight) As a retail hub, community outpost and ersatz performance space, Downtown Music Gallery has long been an anchor of the experimental jazz and improvised music scene. The ensembles participating in this anniversary show are appropriate: New Ghost, consisting of Elliott Levin on reeds and vocals, and Rick Iannacone on guitar; John Zorn, in a setting of his choosing; and Tisziji Munoz, a guitarist with a rather obscure lineage in the avant-garde.

Here they join another fine pianist, Mr. Copland, in a trio that promises to favor dark harmonic colors and rhythmic undulation. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    BOBBY PREVITE'S STRIKE (Tonight) Mr. Previte, an adventurous and often effervescent drummer, teams up with musicians similarly inclined to pair aggressive experimentation with a rock-hard sense of groove: the saxophonists Briggan Krauss and David Binney and the keyboardist Marco Benevento. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen)    KURT ROSENWINKEL GROUP (Through Sunday) Mr. Rosenwinkel's guitar has a luminous tone that offsets the cerebral tinge of his compositions, and his rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner borders on the telepathic. This ensemble, which also features the pianist Aaron Goldberg, the bassist Joe Martin and the drummer Eric Harland, imbues its performances with a blend of shadowy introspection and combustible interplay. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    DIANE SCHUUR AND SARA GAZAREK (Tuesday through June 11) Among jazz singers, Ms. Schuur is a survivor and a study in perseverance, if not exactly a musical role model. Ms. Gazarek, a fresh-faced newcomer, has already proven her ability to cast familiar songs in a new and well-considered light. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $40 at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    LOREN STILLMAN GROUP (Tomorrow) Mr. Stillman is a young alto saxophonist with an inquisitive relationship to jazz conventions, as he demonstrates on a pair of recent albums recorded at this time last year, and released on different European labels. His band mates here are Dave Ambrosio on bass and Take Toriyama on drums. At 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    MCCOY TYNER SEPTET (Monday) To help celebrate the arrival of Ashley Kahn's new book, ''The House That Trane Built: The Story of Impulse! Records'' (W. W. Norton), Mr. Tyner -- a pianist who helped build that house, so to speak -- leads an all-star band: David Liebman and Donald Harrison on saxophones, Wallace Roney on trumpet, Steve Turre on trombone, Charnett Moffett on bass and Eric Kamau Gravatt on drums. At 9:30 p.m., Blue Note 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $25 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)    JEREMY UDDEN SEXTET (Tuesday) Mr. Udden celebrates the release of his new album, ''Torchsongs'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), with this engagement, featuring his fellow saxophonist Nathan Blehar, the guitarist Ben Monder, the keyboardist Leo Genovese, the bassist Garth Stevenson and the drummer Ziv Ravitz. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    YELLOWJACKETS (Wednesday through June 11) This pace car of light-fusion bands recently observed its 25th anniversary with the release of a CD/DVD package that confirms the durability of its mildly funky formula, as well as of the considerable musicianship of its members: the saxophonist Bob Mintzer, the keyboardist Russell Ferrante, the bassist Jimmy Haslip and the drummer Marcus Baylor. At 8 and 10 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set next Friday and June 10, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $32.50, with a $10 minimum.

Opera    AMERICAN OPERA PROJECTS (Tonight and tomorrow night) This group's mandate is to help the development of new operas in a range of genres. Its ''First Glimpse'' series continues with readings of excerpts from works-in-progress by Tarik O'Regan, Stefania de Kenessey and Richard Wargo. At 8, South Oxford Space, 138 South Oxford Street, between Hanson Place and Atlantic Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 398-4024; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette)    'FAUST' (Tonight through Sunday) The diminutive Amato Opera winds up its season with a brand-new production of Gounod's chestnut, with its usual rotating casts and exuberant conducting from the company's founder, Tony Amato. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Midgette)    'MÉDÉE' (Tomorrow) Many opera connoisseurs consider Cherubini's ''Médée'' from 1797 an elegant masterpiece, especially in its original French version. Beethoven ranked his Italian-born contemporary Cherubini as the greatest living composer of dramatic music. Still, the score awkwardly blends Cherubini's operatic sensibility with long stretches of spoken dialogue. In a concert performance tomorrow night at Carnegie Hall, Peter Tiboris, the general and artistic director of MidAmerica Productions, will try to give the opera new life by exaggerating its stylistic dichotomy. The roles will be sung in French by a roster of singers, but the spoken dialogue will be delivered in an English translation by the members of the Aquila Theater Company. Irini Tsirakidou will sing the title role. Mr. Tiboris will conduct the Manhattan Philharmonic. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $35 to $89. (Anthony Tommasini)    'PAGLIACCI' (Wednesday and Thursday) Small opera companies are springing up at such a pace that it's getting difficult to tell them apart. The Chelsea Opera is doing its best to stand out by presenting Daniel Rodriguez, who burst onto the classical music and national-anthem scene in 2001 as ''the singing cop,'' in the title role of Leoncavallo's classic. At 8 p.m., St. Peter's Episcopal Church, 346 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111; $25 at the door; $20 for students and 65+; $5 discount when purchased in advance. (Midgette)    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This week and next at Bargemusic, the living-room-size converted coffee barge moored under the Brooklyn Bridge, the fare is drawn from the more intimate side of chamber music. Tonight, Dmitry Rachmanov, a fine pianist, plays an all-Schubert recital, with the ''Moments Musicaux'' (D. 780) and the Sonatas in A minor (D. 784) and D (D. 850). Tomorrow and Sunday Mr. Rachmanov will be joined by the violinist Mark Peskanov and the cellist Colin Carr for more Schubert, including the Sonatina for Violin and Piano (D. 384), the ''Arpeggione'' Sonata and the Piano Trio in B flat (D. 898). And on Thursday the cellist Adrian Daurov plays the first of two concerts devoted to all the Bach Cello Suites, this one including the first four of the six. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35; $20 for students. (Allan Kozinn)    * DA CAPO CHAMBER PLAYERS (Tuesday) Works written by Asian composers or influenced by Eastern philosophy are the subject of this concert. Included are ''Divergence'' by Huang Ruo, a particularly eloquent young Chinese composer, as well as Chinary Ung's ''Spiral VI''; Akemi Naito's ''Rain, Calling Autumn''; Evan Ziporyn's ''Tsmindao Ghmerto''; and Shirish Korde's ''Bandit Queen: Song Cycle on the Life of Phoolan Devi.'' The Korde work, a premiere, is the 100th score commissioned by the ensemble. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)    SUMI JO (Tonight) During the early years of this Korean soprano's career, she received some helpful public support from Joan Sutherland, who knows a thing or two about what it takes to be a coloratura soprano. Since making her Metropolitan Opera debut as Gilda in ''Rigoletto,'' Ms. Jo has sung nearly 50 times with the company. But her last appearance was in 2000, and her career has drifted to Europe. A tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of Ms. Jo's professional debut, rather mawkishly titled ''Beautiful Challenge,'' comes to Carnegie Hall tonight, giving New Yorkers a fresh chance to assess the current state of Ms. Jo's artistry in works by Donizetti, Offenbach, Duman Cho and others. Will Crutchfield conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's. At 8, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $90. (Tommasini)    MUSICA SACRA (Monday) The Romantic age is the focus of this well-known chorus's final concert of the season, and not all sacred, at that.

At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $15 to $45. (Holland)    'REWIND' (Thursday) In its New York premiere, ''Rewind'' is less a concert than a continuous visual and sonic experience. The program spans five centuries of music, from Renaissance works to commissioned scores and spontaneously created acoustic and electronic pieces. But the selections will meld into one another, and ambient noise (conversations, crinkling paper) will be digitally sampled and folded into the sound space. The performers will be stationed in various parts of the Orensanz Center for the Arts, adding to the spatial and visual atmosphere. Some fine musicians are taking part, including the violinists Anne Akiko Meyers and Colin Jacobson, along with the Knights, a chamber orchestra, and the conductor Paul Haas, who conceived ''Rewind.'' This may be one concert where coughing not only does not matter but will also become a part of the piece. At 8 p.m., 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (516) 319-9307; $20 in advance; $25 at the door. (Tommasini)    ST. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) New works often have a moment in the spotlight, at their premieres, and are then filed away. In its ''Second Helpings'' series, the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble takes another look at some of these. Among the pieces in the current installment are Michael Daugherty's ''High and Mighty'' and Joan Panetti's ''Instant Gathers.'' Tomorrow at 2 p.m., Chelsea Art Museum, 556 West 22nd Street. Sunday at 2 p.m., Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y.; (212) 594-6100; $15; $10 for students and members, and for 65+ on Sunday.

Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    * BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' through June 11. Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Grace Glueck)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,'  through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining.2 East 91st Street, at Fifth Avenue, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)    * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. (An exhibition of her drawings is on view at the Drawing Center.) 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * MET: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. History is full of shifty characters, antique visionaries, cusp figures and half-crazy oddball innovators, later overlooked because they're hard to pigeonhole. Their independent cast of mind is the truest expression of how civilization advances. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or themorgan.org. ( Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.)(Holland Cotter)    Museum of Modern Art : 'AGAINST THE GRAIN: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM THE EDWARD R. BROIDA COLLECTION,' through July 10. The latest collection assembled by the Museum of Modern Art bolsters its holdings of art world mavericks like Philip Guston, Jennifer Bartlett, Ken Price and Vija Celmins and includes first-timers like Robert Grosvenor, John Lees and Susana Solano. It also illuminates parts of the untold, or forgotten, stories of the art of the 1970's and 80's: the achievements of painters and sculptors who were not at the forefront of Post-Minimalism, photo appropriation or Neo-Expressionism. Some of their efforts may disappear into storage, but quite a few will shake up the Modern's conception of the complicated course of art since 1970. The Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400. (Smith)    Museum of the City of New York: Sherril Schell: 'Unknown Modernist,' through June 13. Though little known today, the photographer Sherril Schell (1877-1964) was critically recognized in the 1930's for his severely formalist photographs of New York architecture. This small exhibition presents 15 examples in which closely cropped views of the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge and other monuments of Manhattan emphasize compositional order, structure, pattern, light and shadow. Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672. (Ken Johnson)    New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 18. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith)    NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years, the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)    * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)    Galleries: 57th Street    'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN' Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. Museum of Arts & Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, through Sept. 3. (Smith)    Galleries: SoHo    EVA HESSE: 'DRAWING'  This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 15. (Glueck)    Galleries: Chelsea    * 'An Ongoing Low-Grade Mystery' Organized by the curator Bob Nickas, this excellent group show includes works in many different mediums and styles related in that they are all predominantly red. Donald Judd, Sherrie Levine, Jim Drain, Wolfgang Tillmans and Dan Walsh are among more than 30 artists included. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through June 23. (Johnson)    Willem de Kooning: 'Sketchbook' Twelve pages bearing spidery pencil drawings from a rare, intact sketchbook from the mid-1970's by this great Abstract Expressionist. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200, through June 17. (Johnson)    BASQUIAT and DUBUFFET: 'PERSONAL MEMORIES'  Nothing illuminates art like other art. And the pairing of two artists with similar appetites for drawing, collage, the grittiness of life and a bristling energy exudes a high-wattage electricity all its own. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000, through June 17. (Smith)    RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, through Aug. 11. (Smith)    Other Galleries    'The Drop' More than two dozen artists present multimedia conceptual creations about the global problem of water. In works ranging from densely informational to entertainingly visual, they address the pollution, increasing scarcity and private marketing of one of our planet's most necessary resources. Nancy Drew made 100 colorful paintings based on water bottle labels; Brandon Ballengée presents a pyramid of bottles containing preserved specimens of endangered marine life; and Christy Rupp's installation of five water coolers invites viewers to test the water of each of New York's five boroughs. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through June 10. (Johnson)    Last Chance    * Willem de Kooning: 'Paintings 1975-1978' Working with wide brushes, putty knives and other unidentifiable tools and methods, de Kooning improvised with abandon and to beautiful effect in these 13 paintings from the 70's. L & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)    * Joe FiG With extraordinary skill and ingenuity, this young sculptor replicates in miniature the studios of well-known artists. The centerpiece of his exhibition recreates the adjoining Long Island studios of the painters and spouses Eric Fischl and April Gornik. Plus Ultra Gallery, 637 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 643-3152; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)    * Rosalind Solomon: 'American Pictures from Chapalingas' This excellent exhibition of works from 1974 to 2000 surveys the career of a photographer with a keen eye for human individuality and a pitch-perfect sense of composition. Her art bears a family resemblance to that of Diane Arbus, but it is gentler and kinder. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 244-9081; closes tomorrow.

Before he entered a state insane asylum in 1907, Bolden brought New Orleans brass band traditions into contact with church music and the blues, by way of an outsize, swaggering style that influenced both Joe (King) Oliver and Louis Armstrong. He is also remembered, more dubiously, as a part-time barber and the publisher of a gossip broadside","excerpt":"Michael Ondaatje made those details an integral part of his portrayal of Bolden in the novel ''Coming Through Slaughter'' some 30 years ago. Popular perceptions of Bolden were shaped more than a little by Mr. Ondaatje's vivid fictionalization, which imagined life inside the humid atmosphere of E. J. Bellocq's Storyville photographs. A less fanciful depiction appeared in 1978 -- ''In Search of Buddy Bolden,'' by the historian Donald M. Marquis -- and it was this account that eventually captured the imagination of an aspiring trumpeter named Charles Porter, who traced Bolden's steps in New Orleans and heard the inkling of a theme. Nine years later, Mr. Porter is a Juilliard graduate, a Fulbright scholar and a former student of Wynton Marsalis, and his theme has blossomed into a six-part suite for seven musicians. The clear perils of this undertaking could be a selling point; by most accounts, Bolden was usually up for an adventure.

It represents the first American exposure to a new English outfit called Group 3, Ltd., which unsurprisingly receives financial endorsement from that Government. For the ingenious pleasantries of this undertaking are the most familiarly British to reach these shores in some time.Crisply performed by Kenneth More, James Donald and Jean Lodge and a carefully picaresque round-up of rustic and urban types and directed with droll resonance by John Eldridge, the film emerges as one designed for face value. As such, most of it is good fun.Miss Lodge and Mr. Donald play a pair of vacationing sweethearts cozily afloat in the Channel when they accidentally ram the keg-filled craft of a blithe young brandy smuggler, Mr. More, and sportingly cooperate in transporting his cargo to London.In winking at the law with their two magnanimous lovers—or so it seems to us—John Dighton and Walter Meade have turned a story by Geoffrey Household into a disarmingly brazen odyssey across the English countryside, with the trio and their cargo getting sympathetic boosts from a troop of Scouts, a circus, a farmer and random tradespeople along the way (including probably the most bizarre caravan ever to detour via the Old Roman Road).Miss Lodge and Mr. Donald make a personable pair of assistants and the aggressive Mr. More is most winning as their chosen responsibility. Pungent characterizations are contributed by Wilfred Caithness and Lionel Harris, as two suavely staid wine merchants","excerpt":"Michael Trubshawe, as the enterprising farmer; Frederick Piper, as a pursuing customs inspector, and particularly by Charles Hawtrey, as an anemic laundryman who joins the smugglers.But unfortunately a good deal of the dialogue undergoes a clipped mumbling and lands unintelligibly in the scenery. And Mr. Eldridge not only starts the picture at a leisurely crawl, but has blunted its good-natured tidiness with some rather arch overtones. This also applied to the writers, who, for instance, barely conjure up a lip-smacking parson as the climactic courtroom benefactor, for the sole purpose of rounding out the Kipling lyrics of the title.Everything considered, though, Group 3, Ltd., with \\"Brandy for the Parson,\\" has sent us a mild but tasty distillate.

Cabin and some battling hoods the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse.

As a matter of fact. There seems to be an endless procession of sinister-looking autos plying the rather nondescript Paris neighborhoods by now practically a trader mark in this kind of entry.The other trademarks are here, too—the jittery gang traitor, the close-mouthed tradespeople who seem to know what's what and a few good ones who obviously don't (like the old lady who plays the hero's mother). Add. certainly, the usual parade of svelte, hungry-eyed girls. (The veteran actor hero still knows how to pick 'em.)It is M. Gabin, of course, who sets the pace and tone, burbling about with deceptive, dead-pan casualness, like a relaxed aging cobra. Although M. Grangier's direction seems almost as impersonal, he hasn't missed much. In place of that wild, hair-raising car battle in \\"Grisbi,\\" for instance, we have another countryside slaughter, carried out in a fresh morning mist, to the mooing of cows. The climax, a bloody, staircase duel, is a pip.Taking their cues from M. Gabin, obviously, the other performers are first-rate, especially Paul Frankeur, as a hard-headed colleague; Marcel Bozzufi, as the emotional brother, and Annie Giradot, as the lad's manicurist mistress.

But except for ''Me Without You,'' a little-seen British film that came out two years later, Ms. Williams hasn't had much of a chance to show what a first-rate dramatic actress she is. Kudos to Ang Lee for casting her as Heath Ledger's wife, Alma, in ''Brokeback Mountain'' (Dec. 9), which features Mr. Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as, respectively, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, young cowboys who violate the macho codes of the American West by falling in love with each other.     Alma is young and probably not a whole lot more educated than her hard-working high-school-dropout husband. But as Ms. Williams makes clear, that doesn't mean she's clueless. Alma discovers the passion between Ennis and Jack in the most jarring way when, from her kitchen window, she sees them in a headlong, desperate kiss. But instead of registering her shock with wide-eyed gasps of horror, Ms. Williams does something subtler and more eloquent: she goes perfectly still, taking in the painful knowledge that, we realize, as her mouth crumples and her eyes fill with tears, was already there just below the surface of her conscious mind.
