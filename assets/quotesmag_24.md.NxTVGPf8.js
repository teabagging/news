He had to face the world champion, Gary Kasparov, in the United States-Russia match and struggled gamely before going down to a scintillating gambit.   But he did not let that destroy his competitive zeal and turned in a very respectable tally. In the 13th round, he threw a drop of poison into a positional battle against the Grandmaster Valery Loginov of Uzbekistan and scored a point that contributed to the United States's 2 1/2-1 1/2 victory.   In the last several years, 9 Nd2 has far surpassed 9 Ne1 in popularity in the Classical Variation of the King's Indian Defense. Its motif is that once White achieves the standard attacking formation on the queen's wing with b4 and c5, the knight can be powerfully posted at c4, from which it bears on the targeted d6 pawn.   A round-10 game between Rafael Vaganian of Armenia and Gary Kasparov of Russia went 13 Qc2 ab 14 ab Nf6 15 f3 g5 16 c5 Ng6 17 Nc4 Nf4 and ended in a hard-fought draw. Since Kamsky probably had thought up a new approach to this, Loginov switched to a blockade with 13 . . . c5.   After 14 bc Nc5 15 Nb3 b6 16 Nc5 bc 17 Qb3, Kamsky switched to the theme of penetrating the black position on the b file. The perspective of the game was thus radically altered: White can pursue his initiative with a timely Qb6, virtually forcing the exchange of queens, so it is useless for Black to try for a mating attack","excerpt":"passive defense becomes paramount.   But Loginov should not have exchanged with 17 . . . fe?! 18 fe because White's maneuvering room was increased. Loginov could not play 21 . . .

Nh6, Kamsky landed a powerful blow with 23 Qc6!, relying on the clever point that 23 . . . Ra6? drops a piece to 24 Rb7! Loginov desperately tried 23 . . . Ba6 (23 . . . Bd7 24 Rb7 is even worse) 24 Rb6 Bg5, but Kamsky foiled any chance for counterattack by 25 Be1.   Loginov could have saved his QB by 25 . . . Qc8, but the pawn-down end game after 26 Qc8 Bc8 27 Rd6 would have been lost. He flailed about for a few moves, realized after 30 Qe2 that Kamsky's position was impregnable and gave up.

But, bit by bit, things came out -- like the fact that he had been an officer in the East Gerfman security police and that in another post he had the power to evict critics of the Government from state housing. The breaking point came when newspapers published pictures of Mr. Duchac in pre-unification days dressed in a clown suit for the entertainment of an audience of secret police.

Its word-of-mouth popularity with a mature, affluent-looking crowd makes it tough to get either a table or a parking space, even on slower weeknights.\\n\\nAfter tasting more than two dozen dishes on recent visits -- a cross section of the Italian-American menu -- we found that for every terrific dish, there was one that was not up to par. And that is what keeps the rating for this convivial, family-operated restaurant below its potential.\\n\\nPasta and seafood dishes are winners, while a few entrees, particularly veal preparations, leave something to be desired. Veal ortolana, for one, could be renamed veal Gucci, with its red and green salad topping and leathery breaded scaloppine. Portions are large, though, and the plate presentation is above average. Also, prices are not high. A complete dinner runs about $24, not counting tax, tip or wine. \\n\\nThe snug dining area was recently expanded to 85 seats by taking over the former deli's space next door, but the tables are still jammed. Despite being on time for our reservation recently, our fivesome was kept waiting in the tiny foyer for 35 minutes. Better management of the front of the house would help.\\n\\nOnce people are seated, the personable, bantering waiters in black tie keep things moving. The specials, though, are described accurately only about half of the time and never with prices.\\n\\nAmong the specials, two excellent choices that appear frequently are the rock shrimp appetizer -- succulent morsels crusty with herbs and spices and reminiscent of \\"Cajun popcorn\\" -- and pasta with Manila clams. In the latter, a shower of the steamed baby deep-sea clams with green-tinged shells, at once sweet and briny, are tossed with al dente linguine in a garlicky broth.\\n\\nA nice mix of young greens (misnamed \\"Mesculine\\" on the menu) in a good vinaigrette with shards of Parmesan outshines the dull Caesar salad, and tenderly plump escargots with shiitake mushrooms and toast points is a more successful combination than the one-note acidic brown sauce on sliced portobello mushrooms, which would be better left whole. Other starters include a trio of succulent shrimp with a tumble of white beans, and tortellini in brodo, meat-filled pasta afloat in a full-flavored broth.\\n\\nIn pollo balsamico, lightly sauteed chunks of boneless chicken with mushrooms are bathed in a very intense balsamic vinegar sauce. Penne, the quill-shape macaroni, tossed with sauteed eggplant cubes in a tomato and basil sauce with melted fontina cheese, is appealing.\\n\\n\\nVegetables are included with most entrees, but a recommended side dish is the emerald-green spinach, only lightly sauteed, with a fragrant gloss of olive oil and cracklings of garlic.\\n\\nJoseph Meli, the chef who operates Primavera with his wife, Antonia, cooked at Il Tulipano in nearby Cedar Grove before going out on his own here three years ago.\\n\\nExcept for the de rigueur tiramisu, richly satisfying in a sundae dish, and the imported fruit sorbets in their natural shells, most of the desserts are brought in from a New York bakery. Although a cheesecake was leaden, a custardy profiterole cake drizzled with chocolate will suit the sweet tooth at the table. \\n\\nThe brief wine list contains a handful each of California, Italian and French bottles, like a Meridian chardonnay for $16 and a '91 Groth cabernet sauvignon for $26.
