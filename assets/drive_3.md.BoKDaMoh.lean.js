notes evidence gained from Apollo missions suggests that moon is largely made of 'refractory' minerals, substances which melt only at very high temperatures and which would be 1st to condense out of mixture of gaseous compounds similar to those that probably circled sun as planets began forming; says moon samples and data collection indicate moon may have been formed in orbit as close to sun as Mercury, or was formed at roughly same distance from sun as earth but in sharply elliptical orbit; maintains none of lunar material collected on Apollo flights has shown evidence of recent volcanic activity on moon, even though photographs from lunar orbit show many topographic features that resemble fresh lava flow, but that recent heavy meteorite bombardment has produced indications that moon's core is partially molten; says theory is further substantiated by detection of 'moonquakes' on lunar surface, which may be related to invasions of otherwise solid 'mantle' of lunar interior by hot fluids in its core; notes while seismic observations indicate a partially molten core, data obtained by magnetometers have led some scientists to deduce a relatively cool interior; cites recent NASA findings that indicate that internal lunar temperature varies between 1,600 and 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit; says from age determination of rocks from lunar 'seas' it has been established that most, if not all, were flooded with lava between 3.2- and 3.7-billion yrs ago, and that discovery of rocks 4.25- to 4.5-billion yrs old rules out possibility that moon may have been formed from material in orbit around evolving earth;
