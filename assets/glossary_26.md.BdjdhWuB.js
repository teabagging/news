No one would dare pester these Masters of the Universe with nerdy questions like, \\"Are you, O Great One, by any chance making up those numbers?\\" Apparently no one asked Toshihide Iguchi that question -- or at least looked very hard for an answer. For last week authorities charged that Mr. Iguchi, a bond trader at Daiwa Bank, had gone into an 11-year spiral of falsifying records in a desperate attempt to recoup trading losses -- and wound up a staggering $1.1 billion in the red.... So do bond traders tend to do things in a big way? It seems so. For while most baseball fans are content to grumble and munch if their boys let them down, on Thursday a Chicago bond trader ran onto the field and attacked a Cubs pitcher who'd just given up a home run. Ah, sports! INVESTIGATIONS Following Archer-Daniels Money The plot thickens at Archer-Daniels-Midland. Mark Whitacre -- you remember: the Archer executive who turned Government informant and raised cries of price-fixing -- has apparently admitted to crimes related to company money he received, and though no plea deal has been reached, he is cooperating with an inquiry. But what was this money? The company says it was embezzled, but some executives are offering another script entirely: that Archer paid millions -- illegally and off the books -- to a number of executives through foreign bank accounts. If that's true, the \\"embezzlement\\" becomes a scheme to let top executives indulge in that all-too-common pastime: evading income taxes. What's true? Stay tuned. EXECUTIVE PAY Ted Turner, Wage-Earner What made Ted Turner give up the power of running his own show? Surely it wasn't money. There's only so much one person can spend in this world. But at a certain level -- way, way up beyond paying the bills -- salary figures take on a life of their own. Mr. Turner's pay is clearly up in that never-never land -- especially for a No. 2 executive. With options and such corner-office goodies, he's said to be making more than $100 million over five years -- far more even than Gerald Levin, his boss at Time Warner. Then again, even that fantasy paycheck seems almost incidental, for Mr. Turner is getting $2.6 billion in Time Warner stock.  BUDGET CUTS  They're Saying the 'S' Words  No, that rumbling you heard last week was not an earthquake, or New Jersey being replaced by a golf course. It was -- brace yourself -- the budget-cutters saying the \\"S\\" words. Normally, politicians would kick babies before they'd cut Social Security, but these are not normal times -- austerity is such a passion that babies across the land are surely being named \\"Newt Smith\\" or \\"Budget Cut Jones.\\" So sure enough, senators from both parties suggested shaving cost-of-living increases -- a panel of economists just said, after all, that the Consumer Price Index overstates inflation. Pat Moynihan said $281 billion could be saved over seven years that way. \\"The money is sitting there,\\" he said, \\"asking to be picked up.\\" If they pick it up, though, will they be pummeled by retirees? DEBT COLLECTION Your Taxes or Your Kneecaps If Congressional Republicans have their way, it won't just be the I.R.S. knocking on your door wondering if, pretty please, you could pay your taxes. It could be practically anyone. The legislators want to turn over some dunning tasks to private bill collectors to see if they can do it better -- raising all sorts of nasty privacy issues. It's all, of course, part of the whole budget mess -- the Administration wanted to increase the I.R.S. budget nearly 10 percent","excerpt":"Republicans want to cut it. To Margaret Milner Richardson, the I.R.S. Commissioner, this budget-trimming is misguided, for it's accepted wisdom that tax enforcers bring in far more than their salaries. \\"No sound business person,\\" she said, \\"would not spend money to make money.\\"  TRANSPORTATION A Slippery Road There must be a better way, drivers mutter as they inch through exhaust-fouled air, past perpetual construction, to drop coins in a state toll basket. But are we ready for private highways? Well, ready or not, they're here, with a 14-mile road linking Dulles Airport and Leesburg, Va., opening this weekend -- the first privately financed toll road built this century. With the public sector \\"just tapped out,\\" as one executive put it, this may sometimes be the only way to build a road. But just think what today's maniacal marketers could do with this. There could be rival thruways, each bombarding drivers with ads for, say, wider lanes, smoother surfaces, better views, free meals, toll sales -- perhaps even drive-by movies, but that sounds risky. EDUCATION Cheaper Than a Luxury Car The bad news: college costs keep rising faster than inflation -- 6 percent last year, the College Board said last week. With total costs at top colleges nearing $30,000, and with Federal grants and loans tight, students face \\"a deeply mortgaged future,\\" said the head of the College Board. But there's good news too. \\"There are some tremendous bargains out there,\\" said an official of the American Council on Education. Two years ago, \\"61 percent of all American college students spent less than $3,000 in tuition and fees.\\" EXECUTIVES An 'Odd Meal' at I.B.M.? It takes a tough man to make a tender computer? No, that doesn't work. A PC in every pot? Oh, never mind. Let I.B.M. figure it out. Louis Gerstner certainly knew what he was doing last week when he picked J. Bruce Harreld, president of Boston Chicken, as chief strategist. Still, one analyst couldn't resist saying, \\"That's an odd meal -- cookies with chicken, sprinkled over silicon chips.\\" THE PAPAL VISIT The Priceless and the Profane You can't put a price on something like seeing the Pope, an experience presumably far beyond worldly matters. That's why most tickets to this week's Mass at Giants Stadium were given out by lottery at local churches. And yet, in this imperfect world, few things can escape: ads were spotted in New Jersey papers last week offering to swap those priceless tickets for coin of the profane realm.

under new Blue Cross reimbursement formula, community service factor would be eliminated and agency would start paying portion of hosps' losses in emergency treatment based on ratio of Blue Cross patients in hosps; Ingram estimates that this would increase plan reimbursements to $6-million from $3-million paid in 73; hosps score way plan uses Cost of Living Council guidelines, which says '74 hosp bills hsould not be allowed to rise more than 9%;
