You can live in Santa Monica or Beverly Hills your whole life and never see a black person unless he or she works for you.

Unlike those prudish panes on Madison Avenue, revealing only a handbag or two, SoHo windows offer views of the entire, liberated lofty interiors. Your eyes, even barricaded by glass, can scrutinize the back walls of the stores. SoHo, like Russia, is a place where shoppers often wait in line for rations. So sometimes window-shopping is a forced activity. At Zona, on Greene Street, which limits visitors on busy days, the rations are mementos of the good life as it exists almost anywhere but here: bark window boxes, tulip bulbs, a sign that reads \\"Yard Sale.\\" Where do you put a decorative yard sale sign in New York? Zona hangs it in the window, a reminder of a certain suburban summer day, when we sold, on the grass, all those unnecessary things in our lives.   The neighborhood canteen, Dean & DeLuca, has the same sorts of lines of customers, as if it were offering the last loaves of hazelnut bread before a hard winter.

This is strictly enforced.\\" I already knew that I wasn't likely to find personal dietary favorites like croissants and rare roast beef sandwiches on the spa's low-fat, natural foods menu, or much to fend off boredom besides exercise.

MIDDLESEX, by Jeffrey Eugenides. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $27.) A large, expansive, generous novel whose hero is its heroine as well, Cal (and Callie) Stephanides, a Greek-American hermaphrodite who tests the gap between male and female, destiny and free will, growing up as moral dialectic or chemical reaction.    THE WRITER AND THE WORLD, by V. S. Naipaul. (Knopf, $30.) A collection covering about three decades and divided into sections on India, Africa and America, by the Nobel Prize winner whose perpetual personal frame of reference and utter fearlessness about offending season his habitual gloom.    BLUE LATITUDES: Boldly Going Where Captain Cook Has Gone Before, by Tony Horwitz. (Holt, $26.) Horwitz cheerfully pursues James Cook's hugely successful 18th-century voyages of discovery in the Pacific and in doing so considers how becoming part of the ''known world'' changed the discoverees.    THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS, by Paul Auster. (Holt, $24.) Metaphysics and mystery run free in this novel so full of levels that A narrates B narrating C narrating his own story, which is in a movie; the plot concerns a missing silent film comedian who has gone unmissing and a movie scholar who pursues him.    THE LIVES OF THE MUSES: Nine Women and the Artists They Inspired, by Francine Prose. (HarperCollins, $25.95.) In her first nonfiction outing, Prose assesses women without whom the product of some male artists would have been different, from Alice Liddell (Lewis Carroll's Alice) to Suzanne Farrell (who cast a fertile spell on George Balanchine).    SLOAN-KETTERING: Poems, by Abba Kovner. (Schocken, $17.) A final collection, now translated into English, by the Israeli poet and partisan (1918-87) who organized and led the Vilna ghetto uprising in World War II; at the end of his life, he chronicles his losing battle with cancer in a cycle dedicated to the struggle for existence, naming the collection after the New York cancer center where he was treated.    THE GOOD REMAINS, by Nani Power. (Grove, $24.) A fictional elegy for Ashland, Va., where a large cast of characters, brimming with life and goofiness, approaches the Christmas holiday; the central character, a baby doctor who dreams of ham and of the good old days, fails at actually cooking a ham.    WHEN THE EMPEROR WAS DIVINE, by Julie Otsuka. (Knopf, $18.) This muted first novel seeks to find and articulate what life really felt like to a family of Japanese-Americans relocated during World War II, and to convey the mood of our country under stress from the viewpoint of some genuinely oppressed people.   And Bear In Mind"},{"year":"2003","title":"AFTER NATURE, by W. G. Sebald. (Modern Library, $11.95.) Written early in Sebald's career but published posthumously, this book-length poem is loosely based on the lives of three disparate figures: the medieval artist Matthias Gr&#252","excerpt":"newald, the naturalist Georg Steller and the author himself. The result is a meditation on the sources of the catastrophic imagination, the connections between human nature and nature, and the interweaving of desire and destruction. The language ''is almost classically lucid,'' Eva Hoffman said here last year. Sebald's ''ability to enter diverse inner landscapes, and evoke, with an impartial empathy, entire geographies of experience,'' gives his writing ''its gravitas and its somber beauty.''    THE ROAD TO VERDUN: World War I's Most Momentous Battle and the Folly of Nationalism, by Ian Ousby. (Anchor, $16.) The author recounts the carnage and chaos of the endless, shapeless German offensive in northeast France in 1916, depicting the horrors of trench warfare and poison gas attacks, and the charnel house landscape of shell holes and piled corpses. ''He writes so well, so readably, so engagingly'' that ''the murderous tragedy . . . proves absorbingly fascinating,'' Eugen Weber wrote here in 2002.    THE WEATHER IN BERLIN, by Ward Just. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) In this novel by an astute chronicler of American expatriate life, a burned-out movie director seeks artistic rebirth at the age of 64 in the capital of the new Germany, where his brooding preoccupation with the past turns him into a kind of spiritual and psychological German. Last year our reviewer, Rand Richards Cooper, said the book ''consistently shows the suppleness'' of Just's ''sympathies and the breadth of his observations -- himself a worthy traveler, a superb American abroad.''    THE MONK DOWNSTAIRS, by Tim Farrington. (HarperSanFrancisco, $14.95.) Modern romance doesn't get much more high-risk than in this tender novel about a former monk who, after spending 20 years in his order, rents an apartment from a struggling 38-year-old single mother in San Francisco. Somehow, with the sense of caution that comes with middle age, they connect. '' 'The Monk Downstairs' manages to be both a wry page turner and a thoughtful investigation of what Christ may have meant when he said, 'Love one another,' '' Karen Karbo wrote in these pages in 2002.    GHOSTS OF TSAVO: Stalking the Mystery Lions of East Africa, by Philip Caputo. (Adventure/National Geographic, $15.) Traveling both on safari and with a team of scientists, the author explores the harsh yet teeming landscape of Tsavo National Park in Kenya, home to strange maneless lions that may or may not be an unrecognized subspecies. ''Caputo's appreciation for mystery and the primeval surroundings affect him deeply,'' Tyler D. Johnson said here last year.    LONE PATRIOT: The Short Career of an American Militiaman, by Jane Kramer. (Vintage, $14.) The author tells of her experiences with a disgruntled crew called the Washington State Militia, made up mainly of tax protesters, convicted felons and mildly delusional far-rightists. Even though they were armed and potentially dangerous, in the end they proved to be a feckless and rather pathetic lot. In her ''well-drawn, superbly reported narrative,'' Timothy Egan wrote here in 2002, ''Kramer does a fine job of portraying a group of everyday lost souls looking for something larger to blame for all their troubles.''    ANNIE DUNNE, by Sebastian Barry. (Penguin, $14.) Set in rural Ireland in the late 1950's, this tale features a protagonist in her 60's who works a small farm with her cousin and lives a secluded, spartan life until disruption arrives in the form of her great-niece and great-nephew, not to mention a mysterious local laborer who starts appearing more and more frequently. The dialogue is ''clear and musical,'' Emily Gordon said here last year. ''But it's Annie's passionate observations and shifting moods . . . that fuel this fine novel.''    WHY I'M LIKE THIS: True Stories, by Cynthia Kaplan. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $12.95.) Though hers is an ordinary American life, filled with summer camps, headaches, cute babies and the like, the author plays her memoir for laughs and exaggeration, allowing her fantasies at times to dwarf her experiences. Last year our reviewer, Virginia Heffernan, found this a ''quick-witted, neatly written and unapologetically grandiose'' account highlighted by ''weird and rowdy scenarios.''

The fare, based on purchase yesterday afternoon of a round-trip ticket leaving New York Tuesday and returning Thursday, was listed on the Song Web site at $554.90. On the Delta Web site, the fare for a Delta flight -- using the same dates and itinerary and same purchase conditions -- was one penny more.    IT'S BACK -- Airport congestion, that is. During the first two weeks of June, flight arrival delays were up sharply at many hub airports, according to the inspector general's office of the Transportation Department. Based on the percentage of delays, the average length of delays (just over one hour) and the projected growth in passenger traffic, the agency listed the following as the top six ''airports to watch'' for potential major disruptions -- and possible federal intervention -- this summer: Atlanta (34.8 percent of flights delayed June 1-15)","excerpt":"Newark (33.4 percent); Philadelphia (32.6 percent); Fort Lauderdale (31.6 percent); Washington-Dulles (30.1 percent); and La Guardia (28.2 percent). At Chicago's O'Hare, usually a major center for summer delays, the government has already reached agreement with airlines to limit flights through the fall.    BERLIN EXPRESS -- Continental Airlines started daily nonstop service last week between Liberty International Airport in Newark and Tegel Airport in Berlin. That follows a move by Delta Air Lines last May to resume nonstop service between Kennedy International Airport and Tegel. Before May, there had been no nonstop service between the United States and the German capital since Lufthansa dropped a Washington to Berlin route shortly after the 2001 terrorist attacks. In 1998, Delta dropped a previous route between New York and Berlin, citing low passenger traffic. Continental said its new service was the latest in an aggressive international route expansion.    TRAVEL TO CUBA -- Virgin Atlantic is to begin twice-weekly nonstop service Thursday between London and Havana. The airline said the new flights were in response to a surge in British tourism and business travel to Cuba. Last year, more than 160,000 British travelers visited Cuba, up from 46,000 in 1997, Virgin said. Meanwhile, American travelers continue to be barred from visiting Cuba. In Congress last week, the House voted to retain a trade embargo imposed in 1960 that bans most travel between the United States and Cuba.    MANHATTAN TRANSFER -- There is a new corporate flag flying at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan. Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces last week assumed management of the Pierre, the fashionable Fifth Avenue hotel, from Four Seasons Hotels. With its high land prices and dearth of space for new development, New York has long posed a challenge for foreign five-star hotel companies seeking to establish their brand, and acquiring existing hotels is seen as the most efficient way in. ''Taj Hotels has been searching for such a property for some time,'' said Raymond Bickson, the managing director of Indian Hotels, which operates the Taj hotels. Taj plans a $35 million renovation at the Pierre, which opened in 1930.   JOE SHARKEY   A Penny Saved"},{"year":"1932","title":"Death BEN E. CHAPIN.","excerpt":"Newark (N. J.)
