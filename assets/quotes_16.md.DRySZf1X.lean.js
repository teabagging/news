The price is expected to be $22.98, which would make the film the latest addition to a grab bag of titles priced low this fall.   Last year, two films, \\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\\" dominated the season. This fall, with consumers buying more tapes than ever, the supply has exploded in all directions.   Titles to be released include \\"Batman Forever,\\" \\"Casper,\\" \\"The Santa Clause\\" and \\"Free Willy 2.\\" But this is also a year of old titles in new packages.   This week, for example, a set of the three \\"Star Wars\\" movies, priced at $49.98, is the No. 1 best seller. And next month, high demand is expected for the James Bond series, which is to be re-released after a period out of distribution.   Then there are several prime rental titles that have undergone quick price reductions in time to sell during the holidays. These films include \\"Little Women,\\" \\"Legends of the Fall,\\" \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" and \\"Stargate,\\" all of which cost close to $100 retail for anybody who just has to own them before the prices drop to below $20 each.   Even this season's Disney title, \\"Cinderella,\\" to be released on Oct. 4 at a price of $22.98, has already been on home video. In 1988, when people didn't buy so many cassettes, the film sold about seven million copies before it was withdrawn, as is Disney's practice with all its major animated titles. This time around, Disney expects to sell more than 15 million cassettes. Help for the High-Minded    Meanwhile, a long way from \\"Dumb and Dumber,\\" a dozen independent film and video makers have received fresh support for projects that eventually could find their way into video stores but most likely will be available as part of institutional and library collections.   Fellowships recently awarded by the Rockefeller Foundation are aiding film makers like Susan Meiselas, who is making a CD-ROM about the Kurds","excerpt":"Salem Mekuria, at work on a video about the revolutionary conflict in Ethiopia, and Meena Nanj, who is developing an experimental video about the century-long migration of his Gujarati Ismali family from India to Kenya to Los Angeles.   The grants, which are for $35,000 each, are awarded annually. Past winners include Charles Burnett, who received a fellowship for his critically acclaimed film \\"To Sleep With Anger,\\" which is available on home video, and Julie Dash, who won a grant for \\"Daughters of the Dust,\\" her highly regarded film about her Gullah roots.   A panel of 40 film makers nominates more than 100 projects a year. \\"We look for new voices or old voices used in a new way,\\" says Tania Blanich of National Video Resources, a New York nonprofit group that makes the final selections and administers the grants.   This weekend, one of the winners, \\"High Horses\\" by Randy Redroad, is on view at the Native American Film and Video Festival at the National Museum of the American Indian in Manhattan. NEW VIDEO RELEASES The Madness of King George  1994. Hallmark. $98.23. 110 minutes. Closed captioned. R.   There's rarely a regal moment, at least of the decorous variety, in Nicholas Hytner's often riotous tragicomedy about George III. Portraying a monarch given to wild flights of aberrant behavior (ascribed to a metabolic imbalance called porphyria), Nigel Hawthorne is splendidly wily and unpredictable as he rushes about his domain shocking the court with refreshing, if unsettling, proclamations and fending off scheming rivals. As the strong and long-suffering Queen Charlotte, Helen Mirren is also memorable in, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, \\"a deft, mischievous, beautifully acted historical drama with exceptionally broad appeal.\\"  Don Juan DeMarco  1995. New Line. $98.31. 92 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Tuesday.   A young man (Johnny Depp) declaring that he is Don Juan is talked down from a high ledge by the psychiatrist Jack Mickler (Marlon Brando), who then takes on his case. Mickler, a portly suburbanite with a wife (Faye Dunaway) equally as estranged from passion, comes to accept his patient's contention that a little romance is always possible. If that sounds a bit silly, the premise is saved by the ardent Mr. Depp and a playful Mr. Brando, who cruises through the film with an engaging manner. \\"The movie is cheesy, but its stars certainly are not\\" (Maslin).  Once Were Warriors  1995. New Line. $95.92. 102 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Tuesday.   Frustrations erupt into extreme domestic violence in Lee Tamahori's film about Maori New Zealanders who, having lost contact with their heritage, find themselves disconnected in an urban world. Decked out in black leather, the brawny Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison) acts the way he looks, especially when drunk and pounding his wife, Beth (Rena Owen). But then she is as tough as he is, accepting his brutality with gritty resignation. Left to witness this behavior and be forever affected by it are the couple's five children, who must also absorb the punishment in a visceral film that \\"offers social realism with a savage kick\\" (Maslin).  The Basketball Diaries  1995. Polygram. $94.95. Laser disk, $34.95. 102 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Tuesday.   The writings of the neo-Beat poet and musician Jim Carroll lose much of their vibrancy in a film long on stylized misery and showiness but wanting in substance. The one strength is a raw, scary performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as the young Carroll, who stokes a heroin addiction and tries to break his mother's door down looking for drug money. On the page the story is a precocious tale. As directed with a hollow flashiness by Scott Kalvert, it \\"has no special voice or style\\" (Maslin).  FROM YEARS PAST One Actress, Four Roles    Helen Mirren, perhaps best-known as the detective Jane Tennison in the BBC production \\"Prime Suspect,\\" has given many edgy, intelligent performances, most recently as the resilient Queen Charlotte in \\"The Madness of King George,\\" released on Tuesday. Here are some of her films on tape.  EXCALIBUR. Ms. Mirren is the King's splendidly wicked half-sister in John Boorman's solemn but grand telling of the Arthurian legend. 1981. Warner. $19.98. 141 minutes. PG. THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY. Bob Hoskins is a crime boss and Ms. Mirren his mistress in John Mackenzie's gangster film. 1981. Not in distribution but rental copies available. 109 minutes. R. CAL. The Protestant widow (Ms. Mirren) of a policeman slain by the I.R.A. has an affair with an I.R.A. member (John Lynch) who helped kill her husband. 1984. Warner. $19.98. 102 minutes. R. THE MOSQUITO COAST. In Peter Weir's film, an inventor (Harrison Ford) disgruntled with life in the United States moves his wife (Ms. Mirren) and children to the Honduran jungle, where he tries to set up a model community. 1986. Warner. $19.98. 117 minutes. PG.
