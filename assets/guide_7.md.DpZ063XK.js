Therefore it is not surprising that the painting that dominates Miss Roosevelt's gallery, in terms of size and bright color, is a primitive-looking icon, an undated crucifixion by Frederick J. Brown.

Most museums closed at 6 P.M. sharp, with major ones holding evening hours to one day a week (usually Tuesday or Thursday). But in the last few years, the museum world has discovered that later is better -- more convenient to a more diverse audience -- and a quiet revolution in art-viewing hours has begun. Now not an evening passes when you can't look at art in some Manhattan museum, large or small, from 6 to 8 P.M.    These hours between day and night are among the best for esthetic enjoyment. They enable the visitor to avoid the weekend crush so prevalent at major museums, or to fit in visits to less prominent institutions when they find themselves in the neighborhood. Twilight art viewing need compete neither with workday or evening obligations nor with leisurely weekend pursuits, like spending Saturday in the park or Sunday on the couch. And it seems that the very brevity of these dusk hours encourages a special kind of concentration and enjoyment, something like the museological equivalent of wine tasting.

Here is a sampling.    1932  The Mummy     Boris Karloff has the title role, playing Im-Ho-Tep, an Egyptian priest whose eternal slumber is interrupted by pesky archaeologists. He escapes, turning up years later disguised as Ardath Bey, a (very) elderly Egyptologist. Karloff's character steers his younger colleagues to the tomb of his former lover, Princess Anck-es-en-Amon (Zita Johann) and they transport her mummified body and belongings to the Cairo Museum. He tries to revive her after hours, but is foiled by - who else? - a museum guard. In the climactic scene, the mummy returns to the museum; this leads to human sacrifice, sacred scrolls and a guest appearance by the goddess Isis, who turns Karloff's character to dust.    1933  Mystery of the Wax Museum     The first S. & M. horror film set in a museum features Lionel Atwill as Ivan Igor, an embittered wax sculptor who opens a museum featuring a Joan of Arc that look suspiciously like a young socialite whose body disappeared from the morgue. After a female detective does some sleuthing - and another ingenue (Fay Wray) falls into the sculptor's hands - the police close in on Igor, who is feverishly trying to drip molten wax onto the naked body of his live captive. The police overpower Igor, and he falls to his death into a vat of hot wax.    1938  Bringing Up Baby     In Howard Hawks's screwball comedy, a paleontologist (Cary Grant) is on the verge of completing his reconstruction of a brontosaurus skeleton at the ''Stuyvesant Museum of Natural History'' in New York. Plot twists involve a leopard (Baby), a spirited heiress (Katharine Hepburn), museum fund-raising an a missing bone (the ''intercostal clavicle'').    1946  Funny Face     In Stanley Donen's romantic comedy, Audrey Hepburn plays a Greenwich Village bookseller transformed by an Avedonesque fashion photographer (Fred Astaire) into a world-class model on the runways of Paris. Lots of singing and dancing, and a great scene of Hepburn in the Louvre with the Venus de Milo playing second fiddle.    1964  Topkapi     Melina Mercouri, Peter Ustinov and Maximilian Schell turn in memorable performances in Jules Dassin's classic museum heist comedy. A gang member is lowered into the museum on a rope, was recreated by Tom Cruise in ''Mission Impossible.'' The gang is later captured, but the movie ends with them in prison, where they are hatching an even more daring plan to steal Russia's crown jewels from the Kremlin.    1966  How to Steal a Million     Audrey Hepburn, Peter O'Toole and Hugh Griffith star in William Wyler's deliciously preposterous romantic comedy about a forger (Mr. Griffith) whose handiwork is exhibited in a Paris museum as the real thing. His daughter (Ms. Hepburn) enlists a person whom she mistakenly believes to be a ''society burglar'' (Mr. O'Toole) to steal the fake, so that she can sell it to a private collector, who will keep it from the public and prying eyes.    1973  From the Mixed-up Files Of Mrs. Basil E. Franweiler     This movie, based on an award-winning book, recounts the exploits of a runaway brother (Johnny Doran) and sister (Sally Prager) who hole up in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and become amateur art historians, solving the riddle of a mysterious statue. (Ingrid Bergman makes a brief appearance.)    1976  Rocky     The film that propelled Sylvestor Stallone's career (he starred in the movie and wrote the script) is set in grimy 1970's Philadelphia. While most of the action occurs in the ring, one memorable scene has the underdog Rocky Balboa hammering himself into shape by running up the stairs to the classical temple that is the Philadelphia Museum of Art. He reaches the top and raises his arms in victory - a gesture that, a quarter-century later, is re-enacted every day by tourists, to the chagrin of the museum's curators.    1980  Dressed to Kill     Brian De Palma's splatterfest, with Michael Caine and Nancy Allen (right), has a memorable scene in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A bored Manhattan housewife (Angie Dickinson) is pursued through the galleries by a stranger in a scene that is funny, erotic and menacing.     She survives this encounter, but later on her luck runs out, and she strikes up an acquaintance with a razor-wielding transvestite.    1986  Ferris Bueller's Day Off     The star is Matthew Broderick, but the Art Institute of Chicago makes a cameo appearance as the destination of Ferris and his friends the day they skip school. Ferris's friend Cameron is especially fascinated with Seurat's ''Sunday on la Grande Jatte - 1884.''    1989  When Harry Met Sally     Like ''The Mummy,'' Rob Reiner's romantic comedy about friends and lovers features a scene with an Egyptian backdrop. This time, the couple have better luck, as Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) engage in a flirtatious discussion on dating etiquette in front of the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.    1989  Ghostbusters II     The exterminators of supernatural things reunite. The plot involves an elderly art conservator at a museum that looks suspicously like the Met. He is possessed by the spirit of Vigo, a long-dead Carpathian tyrant depicted in a painting. The spirit demands Sigourney Weaver's first-born child. Bill Murray and friends step in and set things right, but the museum incurs serious damage.    1989  Batman     Tim Burton's first installment in the long-running series features Jack Nicholson as the Joker. A bit of a philistine, the Joker runs wild in Gotham's art museum, slashing paintings, slaying patrons and otherwise causing headaches for Bruce Wayne and company. His best line: ''I'm the world's first fully functional homicidal artist.''    1991  The Silence of the Lambs     Most of the action in Jonathan Demme's thriller occurs outside museums, but Jodie Foster breaks the case open, thanks to Anthony Hopkins (as Hannibal Lecter) and a couple of nerdy entomologists at the Smithsoian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. She bring them a mysterious cocoon found down the throat of a serial killer's latest victim - a clue to the killer's identity.    1992  A League of Their Own     Tom Hanks is Jimmy Dugan, an over-the-hill manager, and Geena Davis is Dottie Hinson, who plays with the Rockford Peaches of the All American Girls Professional Baseball League, which was formed during World War II. This comedy turns on Dottie's visit to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., and her memories, seen in flashbacks, of her season with the Peaches.    1997  The Relic     The original script was set at the American Museum of Natural History. The subject, however - a ferocious lizard that decapitates museumgoers and eats their braines - may have precluded the filmmakers from receiving permission to make the movie on site. Instead, the movie (with Penelope Ann Miller and TomSizemore) is set at a fictional natural history museum in Chicago, where in imperious director mounts an exhibition of grotesque tribal artifacts that incurs the wrath of Kothoga, an evil spirit from the jungles of Brazil. The cranium-crunching beast decimates the canape trays at the show's opening, not to mention some visitors and guards.    1999  The Thomas Crown Affair     The remake of the 60's classic has the master thief Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) breaking and entering into the Met. The museum entryway is unauthentic: Met officials, wary of condoning the theft of artworks, forced the filmmakers to go elsewhere - in this case, the New York Public Library.

Mr. Blitzstein, who died in 1964, was an admirer of Kurt Weill. ''Regina,'' which draws from both opera and Broadway for its musical idiom, was based on Lillian Hellman's play ''The Little Foxes.''

Players Theater 115 Macdougal Street Manhattan Book, lyrics and direction by Joel Paley","excerpt":"music and musical direction by Marvin Laird; scenery by James Noone; costumes by Gail Cooper-Hecht; lighting by Kenneth Posner; sound by Tom Sorce; production stage manager, Pamela Edington. The Musical Theater Works, Anthony J. Stimac, artistic director, presented by Kim Lang Lenny, Wolfgang Bocksch and Jim Lenny. WITH: Joanne Baum, Laura Bundy, Donna English, Denise Lor, Susan Mansur and Joel Vig.    One of several running gags in \\"Ruthless,\\" a campy musical farce that will do almost anything for a laugh, concerns the reason that Sylvia St. Croix, a woman who specializes in grooming talented children to become stars, has changed her name.    \\"My real name is Sylvia St. Sydney; need I say more?\\" she huffs, referring to the veteran movie star Sylvia Sidney. Like most of the show's jokes, the humor is less in the words than in their ferocious delivery. As portrayed by Joel Vig, a stocky actor whose bright red dress matches his lipstick, Sylvia suggests an overweight Rosalind Russell playing a voracious talent agent.    Sylvia has descended on the suburban home of Judy Denmark (Donna English), a chirpy housewife, and her 8-year-old daughter, Tina (Laura Bundy), whom she is hellbent on turning into a child star. Tina, a cuddly little monster whose every move has the calculated cutesiness of a Shirley Temple routine, is only too eager for fame. The girl's ambition drives her to arrange the strangulation by jump rope of her victorious rival for the lead role in the school play, a moronic little musical called \\"Pippi in Tahiti.\\"    \\"Ruthless,\\" at the Players Theater, belongs to a theatrical genre exemplified by the comedies of Charles Busch, in which almost everything has a show-business reference. Shirley Temple movies, \\"Gypsy,\\" \\"Mildred Pierce\\" and \\"All About Eve\\" are among the most obvious touchstones for a spoof that has enough absurd plot twists and multiple identities to fill several old movies.    Such shows stand or fall on their humor. And until it nearly runs amok late in the second act, \\"Ruthless,\\" which has music by Marvin Laird and a book and lyrics by Joel Paley, who also directed, delivers a fairly steady quotient of laughs. The songs, which are mostly generic show-business anthems of the brassier sort, are uneven. The one attempt at a comic show stopper, \\"I Hate Musicals,\\" falls apart on such too-obvious lines as \\"I hate musicals, but not as much as I hate the words to this song!\\"    Most of the fun comes from the sheer brazenness of the caricatures. They include Tina's loopy third-grade teacher (Susan Mansur), a pretentious drama critic named Lita Encore (Denise Lor), a monstrous Broadway prima donna (Ms. English) and her scheming, sycophantic assistant, Eave (Ms. Baum). The performance that holds things together is Ms. Bundy's Tina. Through her parody of a psychopathic latter-day Shirley Temple, the golden-locked young actress with a big piping voice projects an engaging sweetness.    The look of \\"Ruthless\\" matches its tone. James Noone's candy-striped sets and Gail Cooper-Hecht's fluorescent costumes create a stylized world in which all values have been reduced to the breathless childhood intoxication of show-business glory as experienced in a grade-school pageant.

Earlier in the show, he had performed one of his finest early songs, the wistful and fatalistic \\"Funny, How Time Slips Away,\\" with the same mixture of fervency and offhandedness. That mixture goes to the heart of Mr. Nelson's mystique. He exudes a knowledge that has been so thoroughly assimilated that to philosophize in anything but an understated tone would be hysterical.    From the mid-1970's through the mid-80's, Mr. Nelson was close to being the king of country music, although his sound has always stood starkly apart from the Nashville mainstream. For nearly two decades, he and his band, the Family, have had a relation to the country-music mainstream that is similar to the Grateful Dead's to corporate rock. They are a band of musical gypsies who do what they do, oblivious of pop fashion.

In this thin but amiable little German-language romp, some pleasant young musicians drive along the Italian Riviera, basking in the sunshine, visiting various resorts and fishing villages and indulging in romance and, for good measure, the music of Mantovani.The scenery is simply delightful and so are the melodies, with the orchestra leader himself looking in now and then, as his string ensemble saws away in sweet, summer serenity. The color, Eastman, is as pretty as a rainbow. Altogether, with the weather hitting above 80 yesterday, the Seventy - second Street Playhouse, and this Sam Baker release, turned out to be a pretty good, cooling refuge.The catch is a tiresome, tedious plot that almost halts the carefree odyssey and, worse still, barely avoids cluttering the view. Elma Karlowa, a honey of a brunette, has to recruit a substitute singer for Maestro Mantovani to escape the clutches of his tour manager. Her smitten quarry is a tenor, Vico Torriani, touring the coast with some jazzy vagabonds in a terrible old flivver. And the incidents get about as tangled as the purple bougainvillaea that trails them all the way up to Santa Margherita.The music, which flows for a good two-thirds of the ride, is a joy, and excellently arranged. (It's one viewer's humble opinion that the Mantovani syrup needs some hot brass.) Director Werner Jacobs has nicely integrated the settings with the songs,and the five new numbers new to us, anyway) are sparkling compositions, neatly tossed off by Mr. Torriani. \\"La Signora Musica\\" (a bouncy specialty), \\"Cuculino, Cuculo\\" a children's polka)and \\"You and You Alone\\" (a waltz) are exactly what a good Riviera doctor might prescribe. Our favorites, if anybody cares, were \\"A Girl Like You\\" (a Kern-type of serenade) and \\"A Thousand Mandolins\\" (a velvety tango).This minor entertainment is sunny, simple-minded and most certainly ear-filling. But with no real froth or even mischief afoot, it's a glass of iced tea, not a cocktail, cozily stirred by those sweet, sweet Mantovani strings.

Dressed in rustic garb and with her unkempt gray hair tied up in a black handkerchief, she clomps about the stage dragging a cart filled with possessions and tells the story of her life in a burst of emotion that lasts nearly two hours, including an intermission.   That story begins with a parable of two mice who fell into a pail of milk. One of them screamed for help and drowned, while the other began treading. In the morning the mouse that treaded \\"found she was on top of butter,\\" recalls Anna, who naturally identifies with the survivor.

THE CAREFUL SHOPPER"},{"year":"1992","title":"Before Ingrid Caven made her entrance, her voice made its entrance. From behind a closed door on the floor of the nightclub Laura Belle on West 43d Street in Manhattan, where a party was being held to celebrate a new German perfume, Joop (pronounced yewp), came a sound that was simultaneously timid and feminine, yet husky and insistent. The voice phrased its German words with steely precision, yet allowed the glottal syllables to rise and fall with an unmetered romanticism. There was authority in its delicacy. It temporarily silenced the din of executives, advertisers and the social elite.    This voice had never been heard in America. Miss Caven is a cult star on the European cabaret scene, and her performance at the party was a warm-up for her United States debut at the Ballroom. The engagement opened on Tuesday night and will conclude on June 13. When, slowly, the door next to Laura Belle's stage inched open and Miss Caven emerged into the spotlight, her figure embodied the complexities already demonstrated in her voice. Red hair cascaded onto her shoulders. A witch-black Yves Saint Laurent gown, with billows of fabric across its front and a deep open V-cut in the back, was hiked up to reveal a slender black-stockinged leg. As she sang, Miss Caven threw her arm into the air with a melodramatic flourish. She had arrived.

We found out about it quite by accident -- eavesdropping in a restaurant. My husband, Wil, and I go to Ireland every couple of years, and the combination of music, architecture and gardens struck us as an opportunity to indulge our interest in all three. Aside from these attractions, there is the Irish countryside. Getting from A to B (never as the crow flies and occasionally stopped dead by a cattle fair in the middle of the village) is half the fun. The festival takes place over a period of two weeks, and consists of a series of concerts in grand houses and historic buildings. The venues vary from year to year -- a couple of the concerts are always in Dublin,  the rest scattered about the country. \\n\\n     We started proceedings in March with a phone call to the Irish Tourist Board, which produced a list of the concerts and venues \\"subject to amendment.\\" There were 11 in all, 3 of them repeats (both musicians and programs), and 3 in places that we'd already seen.

From Latin America      The Parrish Art Museum turns its attention to Latin America with two exhibitions: ''Images of the Spirit: Photographs by Graciela Iturbide,'' who is one of the most acclaimed photographers working in Latin America today, and ''Mexican Folk Masks From the Permanent Collection of El Museo del Barrio, New York.'' Running through Jan. 7 at the Parrish on Job's Lane in Southampton, the exhibitions are accompanied by a film series, this week at 7 p.m. on Friday featuring ''El Norte,'' Gregory Nava's Oscar-nominated drama about Guatemalans in search of a better life in the United States, and a ''Bilingual Family Fiesta Day,'' at 2 p.m. next Sunday. (631) 283-2118.    Jazz Guitar      At the age of 6, John Pizzarelli went into the family business. He began playing the guitar just like his father, the jazz guitarist Bucky Pizzarelli. Forming the John Pizzarelli Trio with Ray Kennedy on piano, and his brother, Martin Pizzarelli, on bass,  the younger musician has made a name for himself as a master of cool jazz with his guitar playing and, in 1999, the ''Jazz Vocalist of the Year'' in Swing Journal's readers poll.

Also today there is an ''Arts and Crafts Holiday Spectacular'' from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Huntington Hilton in Melville (516) 724-5966.

Indeed, when liturgies and music are especially beautiful, they can subvert as well as inspire. We float on the ancient language of the Book of Common Prayer, roll with its cadences, divorce our sensibilities from hard meanings therein. It is no surprise that modern churchmen have devised plainer, uglier words for their services and substituted guitars for organs. Lovely music at one point may have brought God closer. Now it seems almost in the way.   Take for example the distant beauty of Orlandus Lassus, which comes to us in a new recording of the \\"St. Matthew Passion\\" (Harmonia Mundi). For the disembodied purity of its sentiments and the amazing grace of its polyphonic writing, we wonder at this music. Yet precisely four centuries have passed since Lassus's death, and in that time so deeply have our listening habits changed, and indeed our thoughts about what music is and does, that something is lost to us, perhaps irrevocably.

Salsa, which relies on musicianship rather than spectacle for its excitement, is still a genre that is best appreciated in concert.    But mainstream pop, either in English or Spanish, is pressuring salsa, and its influence could be heard in the set of Mr. Alberto, who headlined the show.

Under Tomas Koutnik, conductor, their performances of works for strings by Handel, Carl Stamitz, Mozart, Wolf, Martinu and Suk tended to confirm the claim of virtuosity, even if, in a few of the accounts, the playing failed to demonstrate a sure sense of period style or a convincing expressive involvement in the music.   The group's stylistic perplexity was most evident in its playing of a concerto grosso by Handel, which opened the program, and to a lesser extent in Stamitz's Orchestral Quartet in F (Op. 4, No. 4) and Mozart's Divertimento in D (K. 136). Along with the appropriate 18thcentury bowings and a generally accurate treatment of ornaments and dynamics, the group employed a fierce vibrato quite outside the style, and the violins let fly with a number of open A and E strings whose harshness would have set Handelian ears ringing. In Wolf's ''Italian Serenade,'' the approach proved more idiomatic, but one wished the players could have made the whole thing a bit more unbuttoned. By Theodore W.

The choral festival has programmed evenings of Haydn, early music and orchestral works.     Compiled by Kathryn Shattuck   CLASSICAL MUSIC"},{"year":"1991","title":"Over two decades, Richard Westenburg's Musica Sacra has given many distinguished performances, generally avoiding a sense of uninvolved routine even in its most familiar repertory. But the Carnegie Hall concert on Wednesday evening that opened the group's 21st season, comprising Haydn's \\"Nelson\\" and Mozart's \\"Coronation\\" Masses, seemed a tired affair in both planning and execution.   What easier, more mindless way to build a blockbuster program than to couple two grand Masses similar in style? The presentation of even one Mass in concert is problematic, since the individual movements are conceived as parts of a larger liturgical service, not as an unmodulated sequence. Some early-music groups have devised imaginative solutions, filling out the intervals with related or tellingly contrasted repertory. Here, Mr. Westenburg simply offered the two scores neat, unapologetically repeating the same texts, as if they carried no meaning beyond the musical.

At least the application of the Hollywood formula for period musicals to the production of \\"Champagne Charlie,\\" which opened yesterday at the Park Avenue Theatre, has resulted in a thoroughly tedious movie.Michael Balcom produced the film at the Baling studio in London in 1945, but its importation into the United States has been delayed until now for obvious reasons. The picture consists of a cavalcade of London Music Hall entertainment of the last century, and like its Hollywood counterparts, it depends on nostalgia for what charm it has. The nostalgia is attenuated by its transatlantic quality, but such songs as \\"The Man on the Flying Trapeze,\\" \\"Strolling in the Park\\" and the title ditty are sufficiently familiar to American audiences to provide a modicum of amusement.As a document on the music hall era, \\"Champagne Charlie\\" is probably authentic enough in physical detail, but its story is as foolish and threadbare as the worst of our own cinematic contrivances. The plot involves a romantic second-generation union between a girl of the music halls and a sprig of the British nobility, her mother and father having renounced each other twenty years previously because of social pressure.Woven into this fabric is an unlikely account of how George Leybourne and other music hall headliners whose names are unfamiliar to Americans fought to keep their houses open in the face of public disapproval.\\"Champagne Charlie\\" may be summed up as a long, slow variety act which seeks to wring entertainment out of some thoroughly dessicated materials.

Sometimes the black natives are washed in pink and at other times a healthy girl suddenly pales, not because of the advances of the villain or the cumbrous dialogue, but because of the fickle color lenses.This musical offering is an adaptation of the Hammerstein-Harbach operetta which was presented here in 1927 and only seems to prove that a tuneful piece of this type, while it is acceptable in a flesh and blood portrayal, is less effective on the screen, being a hybrid of pasteboard realism and a romantic musical background that do not seem to dovetail.The story concerns the British section of Africa which has been captured by the Germans. The natives are threatening an uprising and both the British prisoners and their captors unite to keep them down. A young Englishman falls in love with a native girl, Dawn, who is later proved white, and the villain, a cross between an ape and a nightmare, tries to keep them apart. The British recapture the territory and the hero takes the girl after several fights.Vivienne Segal as Dawn sings well and looks well as does Walter Woolf as Allan, the Englishman. Noah Beery, who chants in a deep bass voice and frightens the children into rapid retirement by simply putting in an appearance, speaks his lines with a Southern darkey accent, probably utterly foreign to East Africa. The direction of his part is crude and slipshod and in a close-up of his ignoble self singing a song about his trusty whip the spectator is allowed to see where the brown paint, that otherwise makes him a native, has rubbed off and left his white skin exposed.There is a musical accompaniment for nearly all of the speeches which grows tiresome after a bit. And an enormous chorus of dusky belles dance like a Rasch ensemble before the moon god. \\"GOLDEN DAWN\\" IN COLORS.","excerpt":"Musical Talkie at Strand Features Vivienne Segal and East Africa."},{"year":"1981","title":"HUNTINGTON STATION ISN'T it odd that so many musicals winding up as big-time Broadway productions have nondescript scores?
