One can start the day with everything from an omelet of smoked salmon, chives and sour cream at La Cite, to jambalaya at Joe Allen, to fried quail eggs with lentils and garlic sausage at the Rainbow Room. Here are some of the other dishes being offered. La Cite     120 West 51st Street, (212) 956-7100 -- This grand, multilevel brasserie has two main dining areas and a cozier grill room. The main rooms evoke all the festive garishness of grand European brasseries: Art Deco molding, immense cylindrical chandeliers, tall mirrors, red velvet banquettes and waiters in spiffy black jackets and long white aprons.    On Sundays several brunch specials are offered in addition to the regular menu. For starters there are a green salad with chicken confit and sun-dried cherries","excerpt":"sausage and potato tart; a charcuterie platter combining rabbit terrine, chicken-liver terrine, fresh ham, prosciutto, garlic sausage and assorted condiments, and a curly endive salad with bacon and baked pear topped with goat cheese.   Among the entrees are a smoked salmon, chive and sour-cream omelet with roasted red bliss potatoes; steak and eggs; eggs Benedict, and a fish and a meat of the day. Today's fish is swordfish with a warm gazpacho sauce; the meat dish is roasted leg of lamb complemented by ratatouille. Desserts include profiteroles; creme brulee, and fresh fruit plate.    Appetizers range from $4.50 to $8.50 and main courses $9.75 to $19.50; desserts are $5.75 each. Sunday brunch is served from 11:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. (Review, Feb. 2, 1990.) Joe Allen     326 West 46th Street, (212) 581-6464 -- This brick-walled tavern-restaurant in the Broadway theater district has always been known for its animated scene and simple American fare. The long bar is decorated with framed Broadway posters and other theater memorabilia. The dining area, separated from the bar by brick arches, is done in a similar theme, with an open kitchen and a skylight at one end.    For brunch on Sunday, one can start with smoked salmon and corn-leek pancakes; asparagus with Gorgonzola cheese and tomato; a salad of watercress and endive with Roquefort and walnuts, and a gutsy black-bean soup. Entrees include grilled steak with eggs; frittata of vegetables and three cheeses; jambalaya made with chicken, Cajun sausage and shrimp, and grilled salmon with vegetables. For desserts there are tollhouse cookies with vanilla ice cream; hot-fudge pudding cake, and a fresh fruit plate.    Appetizers range from $3.75 to $6, and main courses $10 to $16; desserts are $4.75 each. Sunday hours are from noon to midnight. (Review, Aug. 19, 1988; article, Jan. 11, 1991.) The Rainbow Room     30 Rockefeller Plaza, 65th floor, (212) 632-5000 -- Set in a beautiful Art Moderne ballroom, this gracefully terraced room wonderfully evokes another era in New York: wraparound views of the city and beyond, aubergine silk walls, cast-glass balusters, a tiered bandstand, period outfits on the staff and a giant crystal chandelier poised over the revolving dance floor. Despite its renovation a few years ago, the Rainbow Room does not feel like a new or, heaven forbid, trendy place. It's as if ghosts of the prewar years have been jitterbugging up there all along -- and they just recently invited us to join in.   On Sundays, the Rainbow Room offers a prix-fixe brunch. Among appetizers are pepper-cured gravlax on pickled cucumber with a mustard dill sauce; steak tartare with caviar; oysters Rockefeller, and cake of wild mushrooms with a watercress sauce. Other dishes include smoked salmon and red onion omelet with a sour cream and red caviar sauce; fried quail eggs with lentils and garlic sausage; angel-hair pasta and sea scallops tossed in a basil cream sauce, and roast loin of veal with wild mushrooms and cranberries. For dessert, there are frozen hazelnut souffle with a hot chocolate sauce, and baked Alaska.    Brunch is $34.50. Sunday hours are 11:30 A.M to 2 P.M. (Review, March 25, 1988.)

Local chefs have such an enviable head start that one would think they couldn't miss. Well, some do, mostly by gilding the lilies with incongruous sauces and other embellishments.   But when a chef hits the mark here, the results can be sublime. Below is a roundup of some Seattle area restaurants well worth visiting. All exude passionate dedication to regional ingredients like salmon, ling cod, Dungeness crab, spot prawns, Olympia oysters, venison and local mushrooms. Oriental influences are increasingly common, and rarely does one encounter cream-and-butter sauces in this health-conscious corner of the nation.  Dahlia Lounge   On fog-dampened week nights in autumn, downtown Seattle is not exactly a Mardi gras, yet the scene is always spirited at this stylish four-year-old establishment that serves bold (and occasionally bizarre) new American cuisine.   The setting is provocative: soaring ceilings, vermilion walls, vintage neon, illuminated papier-mache fish and flower-patterned banquettes. For all the action in the dining room, it never gets distractingly loud.    Dahlia Lounge is a husband-wife effort, with Tom Douglas running the kitchen and Jackie Cross tending to the guests. Mr. Douglas seems to be an inveterate experimenter.  And just as many of Thomas Edison's early light bulbs probably shattered in his face, so do some of the chef's concoctions.   Why, for example, would anyone take a classic pasta puttanesca, with garlic, olives and tomatoes, and lay over it big slices of rare-seared tuna? It's like adding wings to a Mercedes. A supposedly crisp-skinned garlic duck was not crispy, but rather covered with acrid burned garlic. Green bean risotto seemed like a fine idea, but it wasn't when the beans were served untrimmed and raw.   Those exceptions aside, one can have a perfectly satisfying evening at Dahlia Lounge by cruising in the middle of the road with dishes like butternut squash soup","excerpt":"sauteed Alaskan spot prawns with Provencal herbs; grilled Alaska king salmon with ginger-sake butter, and grilled rosemary lamb chops with smoked-tomato ratatouille.  Kaspar's   In Seattle, the options for waterfront dining are diverse. One of the more imaginative spots is Kaspar's, a semicasual restaurant atop an office building overlooking the shipyards of Elliott Bay.   Kaspar Donier, the chef-owner, is Swiss-born, but he wears his zeal for Northwest products on his sleeve. Nancy Donier, his wife, is a welcoming and earnest hostess. Mr. Donier offers two menus: one featuring his signature dishes, another with nightly specials. On a recent evening one special was exceptionally light ravioli filled with sweet rock prawns and spinach, all in a refreshingly light lemon sauce. His shellfish and wild rice chowder, from the regular menu, was creamy and delightfully briny, overflowing with mussels, scallops and clams. Firm, fresh gnocchi was the richest appetizer, as the dumplings were paired with artichoke hearts and napped in a rich, tasty Gruyere-flavored sauce. Only the Dungeness crab hash went unfinished for lack of seasoning.   Three signature main courses are good bets: rare-cooked king salmon under a latticework of crunchy fried potatoes, braised lamb shank with garlic and rosemary sauce, and bouillabaisse built on a sturdy fish stock with the addition of lentils.    Kaspar's has a good selection of Northwest wines at average prices. As for desserts, let the chef put together an assortment -- plum tart with cardamom-and-rum ice cream; pecan-and-sweet-potato pie with Grand Marnier cream, and ripe-fruit sorbets are among the choices. Wild Ginger   If you want to know what East-meets-West cooking is all about, Wild Ginger is the place to find out. The creation of the young, soft-spoken owner, Rick Yoder, who spent several years in Southeast Asia filling his cognitive shopping cart with ideas, this is perhaps the most provocative, and fun, restaurant in Seattle.   The big open dining room with cream-tinted walls, dramatic lighting and high-backed wooden booths is both casual and formal. A mahogany satay bar is a wonderful spot for a quick snack or multicourse tasting.  All three satays sampled were arresting: pork basted with coconut milk and served with a complex hot sauce; large prawns in an Indonesian-style marinade of garlic, galangal (a type of ginger), chili and coconut, and a simple but delicious plate of grilled, garlic-infused Chinese eggplant.   Choosing wines to match these exotic flavors is a challenge. High acid sauvignon blancs and chenin blancs work well, as do some beers.   Main courses to try include sweet-hot black-pepper scallops with a soy and rice-wine dipping sauce; roasted duck seasoned with cinnamon and star anise and served with steamed buns that are used to make little sandwiches, and any of the noodle dishes. The steamed Chilean sea bass with shallot sauce, recommended by the waiter, lacked pizazz compared with the other dishes. Wild Ginger offers impressive daily vegetarian specials, something that is much in demand in this part of the country.  Szmania's   This smart-looking, friendly spot in the residential village of Magnolia, about 15 minutes from downtown Seattle, typifies the trend for top chefs to move from the city to outlying areas. The dining room is cheerful and bright, with lots of blond wood, colorful local art and a horseshoe-shaped dining bar.   The strapping German-born chef and owner, Ludger Szmania (SMAHN-yah), was previously chef at the highly regarded Four Seasons Olympic Hotel. His menu defies description -- a little Pacific Northwest, a little Oriental, some German and Mexican thrown in for good measure.  Yet his mastery of blending flavors is immediately evident.   At lunch you can start with nicely browned Dungeness crab cakes with a roasted-pepper aioli, grilled Oriental chicken salad with a sprightly ginger-sesame dressing or a tortilla salad with spicy seafood and roasted peppers. Main courses include tasty smoked mozzarella ravioli in a simple but pleasing fresh tomato sauce or perfectly roasted monkfish under a lid of homemade potato chips with a light chanterelle cream sauce.   The signature dessert is Magnolia dream cake, a stratified indulgence of peanut butter cream, chocolate cake and chocolate mousse. The Herbfarm   What began as a backyard herb garden selling at a roadside stand in this gloriously rustic area about 30 minutes east of Seattle has evolved into a leafy wonderland and one of the best restaurants in the Pacific Northwest. It is also highly sought after, with an extremely restrictive reservations policy (see listing on page 6). The Herbfarm is open Friday, Saturday and Sunday only.    A visit to The Herbfarm can be much more than an extraordinary meal. It also includes a tour of the magnificent, meticulously cultivated theme gardens -- 17 in all, covering 6 acres -- and kitchen garden. In addition, guests are given talks on the food's provenance and preparation by the owners and the chef during the nine-course tasting meal (there is only one menu, which changes weekly), and samplings of greenery that you never suspected were suitable for two-legged species.   A recent dinner in the enchanting cottage that houses the restaurant, which seats only 32, started with a glass of dry 1988 Argyle Oregon Brut topped with sprigs of lemon verbena.    \\"You will notice that the herb gives the sparkling wine a wonderful aroma, but it does not affect the flavor at all,\\" explained Ron Zimmerman, who owns the restaurant along with his wife, Carrie Van Dyck. The table was set with name cards atop mini-pumpkins, elegant silver and stemware and an arrangement of wildflowers and herbs.   Each course is prepared in an open kitchen by the chef, Jerry Traunfeld, with detailed explanations of each ingredient. \\"During the evening you will be served many strange and different flowers,\\" he said. \\"And all are edible unless we say otherwise.\\"   The first course was an aromatic tart of wild boletus mushrooms from southern Alaska, onions and marjoram, along with nasturtiums stuffed with nasturtium capers, and tiny Olympia oysters. From there it got exotic: a briny combination of Dungeness crab-and-fennel dumplings, Whidbey Island mussels, Pacific spot prawns and wild cauliflower mushrooms; little pumpkins containing pumpkin gnocchi with chanterelles and sage under shavings of a local sheep's-milk cheese, and herb-smoked wild king salmon (\\"Line caught,\\" Mr. Traunfeld assured us) with beet and arugula sauces.   The show went on at a blissfully slow pace -- more than three hours -- as we reveled in herb-encrusted local lamb with a ginger and coriander sauce, a magnificent salad of wild greens and flowers, a splendid apple souffle and apple-caramel ice cream.Five Pacific Northwest wines accompanied the meal, which concluded with a vibrant 1927 Madeira.   All of this luxury comes at a price: dinner came to $115 a person with wine; the six-course lunch is $50. page 6, sub head only  SAMPLING A SPIRITED DINING SCENE    Prices given below, with the exception of The Herbfarm, include a glass of house wine.

It could be worse. The publisher is bringing out \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" under the title \\"I Was an Adulteress.\\" \\"The cover will  be a picture of Hester Prynne with a cigarette hanging out of her mouth,\\" the hero later confides. \\"She'll be in a real tight, low-cut dress.

The lesson that the Administration seems to have forgotten is that of the Cuban missile crisis: When your adversary gives mixed signals, respond to the conciliatory signals and ignore the bellicose noises.   The public seems to be way ahead of President Bush in understanding the need of Saddam Hussein to save face if diplomacy is to succeed over war. What we, the American public, need to do is allow Mr. Bush to save face so that he can back down without losing his political future.   He can do that by encouraging full debate in Congress on what direction United States foreign policy in the Middle East ought to take. If, as now appears likely, the conclusion is that we should give sanctions more time, the President can bow gracefully to this decision, declare our mission of stopping an invasion of Saudi Arabia successful and bring home most of our troops.

So should the City Council Land Use Committee, when it takes up the issue today.    The city's private asphalt vendors have been lobbying hard to maintain their profitable hegemony over the city's asphalt supply. The proposed plant would supply city paving crews in Queens and upper Manhattan, reducing reliance on private vendors by up to 350,000 tons a year. A similar plant in Brooklyn produces asphalt for about $23 per ton, compared with the average $30 per ton charged by private vendors. When recycled asphalt and glass are mixed in, the savings are even greater. Lucius Riccio, the city's Transportation Commissioner, presents persuasive numbers showing that the new plant would also be a sound investment -- even with relatively high building costs.    The proposal and the economic slump have recently driven private asphalt prices to a more reasonable $25 a ton. A vote to approve the Queens site wouldn't commit the city to spend scarce capital to build the new plant if competitive long-term agreements with the private vendors can be reached.

Then a friend pointed out the cost difference.    Assuming your newborn uses 70 diapers a week -- our local diaper service charges $12.50 a week, against $20 for disposables. These days an extra $30 a month can have a significant impact on the budget, and now that our landfill has started charging a fee per bag, the cost difference becomes even greater!   After three months of using the diaper service, I can say I'm glad I went for cotton. The service is convenient (weekly pickups, deodorized diaper pails, Velcro diaper wraps, I don't have to lug heavy boxes home from the grocery) and better for the baby (not one rash yet).

In the record shops, some of metal's biggest names are clearing out the vaults. On Tuesday, the acrobatic Iowa noise-metal band SLIPKNOT is issuing a live album, ''9.0 Live'' (Roadrunner), and the German machine-metal band RAMMSTEIN is issuing a compilation of unreleased songs, ''Rosenrot'' (Republic/Universal). Most curious of all is OZZY OSBOURNE, the genre's unsteady figurehead, who promises -- or perhaps threatens -- to release ''Under Cover'' (Epic), which will give his fans perhaps the one thing they fear most: a chance to hear him warbling ''All the Young Dudes,'' among other songs.    JOHN DARNIELLE, the keen indie-rock singer-songwriter who records as the MOUNTAIN GOATS, has long charted his metal obsession in song, and more recently in blog.

The tall, graying German musician is scheduled to become the Philadelphia's next music director, succeeding Riccardo Muti in 1993. Judging by the alert and energetic playing that this tradition-rich ensemble delivered, Mr. Sawallisch must be a popular choice in the ranks.   Since he first appeared in this country 27 years ago at the head of the Vienna Symphony, the Munich-born conductor has built an enviable reputation for impeccable musicianship and artistic integrity. In recent visits, he has also shown an unexpected flair for drama in his symphonic interpretations, possibly an outgrowth of his extensive opera work in Munich, Bayreuth and elsewhere. In this Carnegie program, that flair did much to enliven Dvorak's seldom-performed Symphonic Variations (Op. 78), a work of bustling vigor and elan that is always threatening to coalesce into something memorable but never quite does. Mr. Sawallisch was able to build his reading on sharp contrasts of fast and slow, loud and soft, confident that at any volume or any speed the Philadelphians would produce nothing but a musical sound.

Absolutely unpretentious -- Mr. Davis, a 24-year-old alto saxophonist, played a series of standards -- the show was bursting with ideas and a raucous energy that threatened to spill out into the street.    The club, which is blessed with an icy clear sound and red velvet curtain that looks like a photo director's prop for an imagined jazz club, wasn't exactly full -- this was its second week -- but Mr. Davis and his group blew on through anyway. Backed by Jacky Terrasson on piano, Tyler Mitchell on bass and Eric McPherson on drums, and joined by Antoine Roney on tenor saxophone, Mr. Davis revealed a slippery and knotted set of improvisations. Mr. Davis comes out of the Charlie Parker-Cannonball Adderley academy, and he clearly loves rhythmic and melodic complexity, taking his lines and cramming them with whiplash phrases until they create dense, puzzlelike figures. And while Mr. Davis is an old-style burner, for whom an audience exists to be excited, he also has a clever melodic sense, breaking up his improvisations with startlingly self-contained, orginal melodies.      Mr. Roney (who is the trumpeter Wallace Roney's brother) is a real find as well, a tenor saxophonist who matched Mr. Davis's slippery lines with his own snakelike improvisations. Looking like late 1950's Sonny Rollins, but sounding like an original amalgam of all the great tenor saxophonists of the 1960's, Mr. Roney turned \\"Softly as in the Morning Sunrise\\" into a tangle of unfamiliar harmony that charged the tune with an almost malevolent quality, removing any sort of lyricism or pleasantry. The band, whether backing Mr. Roney or Mr. Davis, never stopped its insistent popping and snapping, a form of cooperative antagonism that pushed the soloists into territory they might not have got to on their own.

He sat down, giving way to the saxophonist Joe Lovano, who, using Mr. Stubblefield's last few notes to open his solo, improvised with the piece's simple church harmonies, moving further and further away from the chords with sophisticated lines, avoiding the implications of the tune. The tension between the two approaches, between the jazz sophistication and an almost rural sensibility -- which was implict in many of the compositions -- made for a distinct type of conflict that kept the music fascinating.

He is, in the popular imagination, more than just a cavalry leader; he is all the boldness of the Old South, casting his heedless glamour on that ghastly combination of 18th-century field surgery and 20th-century firepower that was our Civil War. Emory Thomas has chosen to call his excellent study ''Bold Dragoon'' because that is just what Stuart said he wanted to be back when he was a cadet at West Point.
