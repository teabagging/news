Thirty-five years after his death, the fruits - and blossoms - of Mr. Coe's labors are on display daily at the Planting Fields Arboretum, a well-tended state park of gardens, greenhouses, meadows and woods on his old estate. Coe Hall, the family's stunning 65-room Tudor-style mansion, is also open to the public.   You do not have to be a botany buff to appreciate the arboretum, although it clearly helps, because hardly a tree, shrub or plant stands unidentified. It is possible to spend hours strolling through the park just reading the signs posted under each tree or bush. Even a trip to the restroom can be esthetically pleasing, and educational: you'll learn that the unusual purple-blue flowers near the outdoor restroom entrances are known as Glory-of-the-Snow.   Flowers are displayed in every conceivable habitat. If you like a neatly laid out European-style garden, it's here. So is a terraced garden reminiscent of those in Japan. If you want flowers arranged in alphabetical order (by botanical name), you've come to the right place. And two expansive greenhouses feature some of the most impressive collections of flowers in the country.   The Main Greenhouse, which is attached to a small visitors' center near the parking lot, has two large rooms with a smaller wing on each side. One wing houses 300 begonias and dozens of orchids, each flowering with pink, purple or white petals. The other has hundreds of ferns.   The largest room is wide and bright. Sparrows fly through an open window, singing cheerfully. At the far end, almost lost among the bamboo and orange trees, are topiary sculptures of dwarf creeping fig, depicting an elephant and a rhinoceros - life size. The Main Greenhouse is open from 10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.   The second greenhouse, the Camellia House, has the largest collection of camellias in the United States. While the shrubs, which are evergreen, tend to bloom in winter, several are still colorful. This greenhouse, open from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., also has several desert plants, including an eight-foot Giant Saguaro.

That conflict started as a quarrel among imperial families. It ended with the meaningless deaths of 10 million, most of them young men in the trenches of Western Europe, under the shameful slogan of \\"the war to end all wars.\\"    The conflict that is looming today in the Middle East is just as senseless: a struggle to protect \\"our\\" oil, which happens to be under another country's land. To gain support for this inane policy, President Bush has miraculously become an advocate for the United Nations.   The Reagan-Bush team spent the last 10 years disparaging the United Nations at every opportunity. This includes refusing to pay our country's assessed dues and the Administration's thumbing its nose at the United Nations International Court of Justice in ruling against United States mining of harbors in Nicaragua, intimating that United States policy is no business of the United Nations.   Now, however, by the offer of loans, military aid or whatever, member states of the Security Council are persuaded to sanction the Administration's militant policy.

Yet 26 years after Mr. Clinton took to the streets to assail Mr. Johnson's war, he now finds himself, eerily, starring in its revival on the small stage: the principled President, drawn ever deeper into an unpopular battle by his own policies and a fear that retreat equals humiliation.    So it was that a superpower threat to invade one of the world's weakest nations ballooned last week into a do-or-die test of the President's political manhood and diplomatic respect. It is not that Mr. Clinton lacks for intelligent arguments that his course, morally and historically, is right. But even many of those Democrats who believe Mr. Clinton is right to threaten military action suspect that he has arrived at that choice not by design, but by default.

The questions were read by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.      Effort to Talk to Lewinsky      Q.This question is directed to the House managers from Senator Reid of Nevada:    Would you please tell us whether you provided notice to counsel for the President or to any official of the United States Senate of the managers' discussion with the Office of Independent Counsel regarding an informal interview of Ms. Lewinsky and the intention of the Office of Independent Counsel to file a motion in court to compel Ms. Lewinsky to meet with the managers. If you provided no such notice to counsel for the President or the Senate, please tell us why not.    ED BRYANT This has -- no, the answer to your question, I'm not aware of any such notice that was provided as described in the question. I would like to make some clarification on this in terms of the witness, Monica Lewinsky, the potential witness.     As we have been in an evolving discussion over the last few weeks in terms of, if we are allowed to call witnesses by the Senate, who those witnesses might be, what our list might look like, obviously the name of Monica Lewinsky comes up as a potentially very important witness to these proceedings. As many of us in this chamber have had experience in the law, we very much would like to talk to some of these witnesses.    The core group that we have considered, however, are in essence in the White House control. They either are employed by the White House or are close friends and associates of the White House. And I'm sure the White House, through the attorneys, would be very willing to cooperate with us in making those people available.    However, Ms. Lewinsky presents a very unique situation in that she is geographically some other place. I'm not sure where she is. Maybe Los Angeles, maybe New York, maybe Washington. But she has attorneys that we have to deal with. And it would be very critical, as any attorney in this body knows, that before you actually talk to a witness, and a witness of that importance to this proceeding, that you -- before you produce her for that testimony -- that you talk to her. And it was intended to be a conversation to discuss it with her.    We understand -- I have personally not seen the immunity agreement that she has, but we understand there is a cooperation proceeding and that that agreement is between her, her attorneys and the independent counsel, the O.I.C.","excerpt":"not Congress, not the managers, not the Senate. So we have no duty -- no legal standing, as I understand it -- to go in and enforce that agreement were she not to want to meet with us and cooperate pursuant to the terms of those agreements -- to the agreement.     We did contact the O.I.C. to arrange that meeting. And once we understood that the attorneys did not want to cooperate and furnish their counsel -- their client -- to meet with us, then we asked the O.I.C. to pursue further the effort to have Ms. Lewinsky come in and meet with us on an informal basis, as, again, anyone would do in preparation for calling a witness at a trial.    Intervention by Starr      Q.This question is from Senator Leahy to the House managers:    Did any of the managers consult with any member of the Senate before seeking aid from Kenneth Starr to speak with Ms. Lewinsky? Did you discuss whether this violated the Senate's 100-0 vote on trial procedure?    BILL McCOLLUM The question is certainly a valid question to ask. We did not consult with any senators about this. We don't think that what we wanted to do, to talk to Ms. Lewinsky, had anything to do with the rules that you've passed. We do not want to violate those rules, and we don't think that we have.    As anybody who knows, if you have a witness that you're going to produce, you have a right to prepare that witness. It's as plain and simple as that. I have practiced a lot of trial law before I came to Congress. A number of you have. If you're going to have a deposition given, it's going to be your witness, you're going to go down and try to talk to that witness and prepare that witness. You have the right to do that and the obligation to do that. It has nothing to do with the formal proceeding of taking the deposition, which is covered by the rules that you've passed as to how and when depositions will be taken. It has nothing to do with the issue of her testimony actually here, where the opposing counsel would have a right to be present.    It has everything to do with the right of anyone to prepare their witness, to get to know their witness, to shake hands, to say hello, to put a face on that. It is normal practice to do this, and we see in no way how that abrogates this rule, or in any way violates what you set forth. As a matter of fact, we think we would have been incompetent and derelict as presenters of the witnesses, if we get a chance to present them, if we hadn't talked to her. We tried to do this some time ago. We suggested to her attorneys that it would be appropriate to quietly have this discussion, to meet her as you normally would. I think they were apprehensive. They wanted the court order, I guess, to force this to occur, and that's why we have eventually gone to do that.    The Issue of Witnesses       Q.A question from Senators Lott and Thurmond to the House managers:    Please give specific examples of conflicting testimony or an incomplete record where the calling of witnesses would prove beneficial to the Senate.    ASA HUTCHINSON I want to echo what my colleagues have said, that we are trying to be prepared, we're trying to move through this process expeditiously, but we do believe that we need to call witnesses and, secondly, that we should be prepared and without any delay to proceed forward in the event we are granted that opportunity.    And one of the reasons that the calling of witnesses is important is because there exists conflict in the testimony. The White House counselors, the President of the United States has denied each and every allegation under the two articles that have been submitted to this body.     I have focused on the obstruction of justice, and each of the seven elements of the obstruction of justice has been denied by the President. This puts it all in issue. For example, let's start with the issue of the lying to the aides.    The President of the United States said he was truthful with his aides, to Mr. John Podesta and Mr. Sidney Blumenthal. And yet, if you look at the testimony of Mr. John Podesta, where he says the President came in and denied having any sex of any kind with Ms. Lewinsky, and goes into the details of that, that is in direct conflict with the testimony of the President of the United States. And the same thing is true with the testimony of Mr. Blumenthal versus the testimony of the President of the United States.     If you go to another conflict in the testimonies, between the President and Monica Lewinsky, in a number of different areas,  first of all, in regard to the gifts, the President said, ''And I told her that if they asked for gifts, she had to give them.'' That's the President's testimony.    And yet Ms. Lewinsky says that in that conversation the President said, when asked about the gifts, giving them to Betty, he says, ''I don't know'' or ''Let me think about it.'' Again, direct conflict between Monica Lewinsky and the President.    In regard to Monica Lewinsky and coaching her testimony, or suggesting to her that maybe you can sign an affidavit, you can always say you were coming to see Betty or that you were bringing me letters, this is the testimony of Monica Lewinsky. What does the President say in regard to that? He said that he never talked to her about a cover story in a legal context. In other words, it's a denial of obstruction, of witness tampering, in contrast to the testimony of Monica Lewinsky.     Obviously there's a conflict in the details of the relationship. There's a conflict between the testimony of Monica Lewinsky and Vernon Jordan in three different areas. Ms. Lewinsky said that she shared with Mr. Jordan some details of the relationship. Mr. Jordan says that was not accurate.    Ms. Lewinsky says, in a particular meeting, that Mr. Jordan, or where they discussed about notes that she had been keeping, and Mr. Jordan said go home and make sure that they are not there. Mr. Jordan denies that.    In another area on the affidavit, Ms. Lewinsky says that she brought to Mr. Jordan the affidavit and he assisted in making some corrections. Mr. Jordan does not recall that. So there's conflicts between Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan.    There's conflicts between Ms. Currie and the President in regards to the coaching incident. Ms. Currie said the statements were made and taken in the sense that the President wished me to agree with the statement. The President says, I was trying to get as much information as quickly as I could.    And obviously, Betty Currie testified before the grand jury, before the President did and there was never any follow-up questions. I would want to ask her, What did you say in response? Did you provide any information that the President was soliciting at that particular moment, according to the defense that he has asserted? And so, there's a conflict there.    There is a conflict between the President and a witness that we would offer from the deposition. The President denies that he focused on what attorney Bennett was stating in reference to the false affidavit.    I believe that we can offer a witness -- it could be in the form of an affidavit or a deposition -- that would testify that he was focusing, he was paying attention. And so, there's clear conflicts in the record that can only be established through the presenting of additional questions or additional witnesses.     The need for witnesses is so basic and fundamental to our truth-seeking system of justice in this country that words fail me in making the case that we should call witnesses and that you should permit it in this proceeding. We are sympathetic totally with the time frames and the time constraints of the United States Senate, and for that reason, we will pare our witness list.    We will accommodate a quick session.  The White House counselors say this is going to drag on for months. Well, if it drags on for months, it is because they want it to drag on for months. We will do all that we can to end this in a timely fashion, and the American people and the United States Senate needs to understand that.     Why are the White House counselors so concerned about witnesses? Many of these witnesses are friendly to them. We're in a truth-seeking endeavor, and I would respectfully submit that the calling of witnesses would help resolve the conflicts that I have recited.    Fairness and Due Process      Q.This is a question from Senator Dodd to the counsel for the President:    Do you believe that a fundamental question of fairness and due process has been raised by the failure of the House managers to notify you of the proposed Lewinsky interview or by your exclusion from that interview? And do you wish also to respond to Mr. Hutchinson's comments?     CHARLES F. C. RUFF I am not going to seek here this morning to vindicate the interests of this body. That is for others. But I do think it useful to speak for a bit about the interests of the accused, the President of the United States.    It's odd as, I think, we listen to the managers explain what they were seeking to do, to put that in the context of what we know was actually happening here.    It was suggested that they wanted to just have a conversation like any lawyer getting ready for a trial would want to have a conversation with a witness before he or she put the witness into a deposition or on trial. That it was sort of normal for a trial lawyer to do this. I think one of the managers suggested they just wanted to say hello, put a face on it. And they even suggested that counsel for Ms. Lewinsky wanted a court order to force their client to testify.    Well, as we'll all see once the record is made available to everyone, that last point is sheer nonsense.    But I suggest the earlier suggestions that just a friendly little chat was all they were looking for is belied by the notion that what we have here is the managers using their ''institutional role'' to get the independent counsel to join with them and use the authority that he has under the immunity agreement to threaten Ms. Lewinsky with jail, to threaten her with violation of her immunity agreement and opening up the prospect of prosecution if they do not meet in a friendly little conversation ''just say hello, just like to meet you'' gathering for the managers.    Can you imagine what that little conversation's going to look like, held in the independent counsel's office, with the people there who have the capacity to put Ms. Lewinsky in jail, while there is this friendly little conversation, ''just say hello,'' normal, everyday discussion between a trial lawyer and the witness he'd like to get to know?    From the perspective of my client, for the moment putting aside the rules which you all agreed on as to how we ought to proceed, can we really say that it's just normal, just O.K., to have one side using the might and majesty of the independent counsel's office threatening a witness with violation of an immunity agreement if she doesn't agree to fly across the country and meet for this friendly little chat? I think not.    I don't know whether I've got a minute or two left, but on the issue of conflicts, this is, of course, something that has been the subject of much discourse over the last few days, but let me just take a couple of examples put to you by Manager Hutchinson: the issue of the statements made by the President to Mr. Podesta and Mr. Blumenthal.    There's no conflict in testimony here. The President indeed said that he was trying to keep his aides from becoming witnesses. He even said that he didn't even remember his conversation with Mr. Podesta, but he took as true -- this is what he said in the grand jury -- that he accepted as true if Mr. Blumenthal said this is what that conversation sounded like, Mr. Podesta said that's what the conversation was.    There was no conflict.    The President, indeed, adopted in the grand jury what those people would say. And of course he didn't put them into the grand jury in order to repeat some or to mislead the grand jury as to their knowledge. They testified truthfully in the grand jury when they recited their conversations with the President.    But I want to move just a second to something you've never heard before in the entire days that we've been sitting here. We heard little hints about how Vernon Jordan might be a liar because of what he said about Dec. 11, and all of a sudden, just five minutes ago, this body heard for the first time he's not only maybe a liar about the job search, but he's maybe a liar about destroying evidence. Words fail me.    Lewinsky's Testimony      Q.This is a question from Senator Abraham to the President's counsel:    Is it your position that Ms. Lewinsky was lying in her grand jury testimony, her grand jury deposition, and her F.B.I. interviews when she said that the President engaged in conduct with her that constituted sexual relations even under his narrow interpretation of the term in the Jones deposition? Is it your position that she was also lying when she gave essentially the same account contemporaneously with the occurrence of the events to her friends and counselors?    GREGORY B. CRAIG Senator, our position is not that she's lying. Our position is that there are two different versions of what happened and that there's a discrepancy.    Now, in my presentation to the Senate, I acknowledged that there was a disparity between what the President had recounted and what Ms. Lewinsky said happened when it comes to recalling and reporting these specific rather graphic and intimate details concerning their activity.    I pointed out that with respect to other central elements of the relationship, there was no disagreement, that they acknowledged that there was a relationship, that they tried to conceal it. But I also suggested, and I suggest to you today, that not every disagreement, not every discrepancy is the food or the stuff or the subject of a perjury charge. . . .    White House Role in Debriefing      Q.This is a question from Senator Daschle addressed to counsel for the President:    Do you believe that it is a requirement of due process and fairness that you be allowed to participate in the Lewinsky witness debriefing sought by the managers? And do you believe that the House would have asked for the same right if the White House had attempted to interview Ms. Lewinsky?    MR. RUFF That question raises an interesting mix of issues because I think, in one respect, the House managers are correct that once the Senate determines that it's prepared to go forward -- I trust it will not -- but if it does determine that it's prepared to go forward in some way with respect to the depositions of witnesses, at that point, with the Senate having made that decision, it would be appropriate for both sides to seek voluntary, consensual, typical opportunity to meet with any witness in a setting that doesn't involve having the prosecutor with life-or-death authority over that witness doing the debriefing or being present while you talk to the witness.    Thus, although I will take the opportunity if offered to sit in on any meeting between the managers and the independent counsel and any witness, because I would certainly like to know what the mood and the atmosphere and the nature of that process really sounds like.    The issue here, I think, is not so much whether it would be nice to sit in on that meeting, but whether there can be any hope for due process, fairness and opportunity for both sides or certainly my side, I won't speak for the managers, to have an opportunity for reasonable, fair, and open discussion voluntarily with any witness who will talk with us, not -- not to be too rhetorical about this -- with the looming presence of the prosecutors sitting in the room with us.    As everyone who practices in this district knows, indeed it is a matter of law that a prosecutor may never interfere with the access of any witness to defense counsel. I can't think of much more interference than being required to sit in the room with the prosecutor and with another prosecutor while that kind of discussion goes on.    So, the answer is: fairness, no. If it's my only opportunity to meet with Ms. Lewinsky, I'll take it, but I trust that as a matter of due process it will not be. . . .    Conviction and Removal      Q.This question is from Senators Kohl and Edwards to the House managers:    Throughout this trial, both sides have spoken in absolutes. That is, if the President engaged in this conduct, prosecutors claim that he must be convicted and removed from office, while the President's lawyers argue that such conduct does not in any way rise to an impeachable offense. It strikes many of us as a closer call. So let me ask you this: Even if the President engaged in the alleged conduct, can reasonable people disagree with the conclusion, that as a matter of law, he must be convicted and removed from office? Yes or no?    LINDSEY GRAHAM Absolutely. And this is a hard case in a couple of areas, and I think it's an easy case in many areas. The Constitution reads that upon conviction, the person shall be removed. And you've got to put it in context of the judge cases, because that's where it gets to be hard for this body, because the precedents of the body, when you apply the same legal standard for high crimes and misdemeanors to the fact that a judge who is convicted of perjury was removed by the body and you conclude in your mind that this President committed perjury, you've got a dynamic you have to work through.    Mr. Bumpers says, there's perjury, then there's perjury. I would suggest to you that the allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice in this case are not trivial. It's not about a speeding ticket or a trivial matter. It's about the activity of the President, when he was defended in a lawsuit, in a sexual harassment lawsuit, when he was told by the Supreme Court, you got to play and you got to play fairly.    If you determine that he committed the crime of perjury and you determine that he committed the crime of obstruction of justice, based on the precedent of the Senate, I think you'd have a hard time saying, under the situation of this case, that that's not a high crime.    But I would be the first to admit that the Constitution is silent on this question about whether or not every high crime has to result in removal. And if I was sitting where you're at, I would probably get down on my knees before I made that decision, because the impact on society is going to be real either way.    And if you find the President guilty in your mind from the facts, that he's a perjurer and he obstructed justice, you've got to somehow reconcile continued service in light of that event. And I think it's important for this body to not have a disposition plan that doesn't take in consideration the good of this nation.     I have argued to you that when you found that a judge was a perjurer, you couldn't in good conscience send him back in a courtroom because everybody that came in that courtroom thereafter would have a real serious doubt. I will argue to you that when you find this President guilty of perjury, if you do, that he has violated his oath and that by a consequence of that, some public trust has been lost.    And I would show to you the body of evidence from this question: Do you trust William Jefferson Clinton? The American people will tell you three out of four say no.  But the American people will also tell you that ''I understand what happened here.''  And some want him removed and some don't, and you've got to consider what's best for this nation.    I will yield to Mr. Buyer in a second, but the point is that I'm trying to make as articulately as I can is that I know how hard that decision is. It has always been hard for me. It's never been hard to find out whether Bill Clinton committed perjury or whether he obstructed justice. That ain't a hard one for me. But when you take the good of this nation, the upside and the downside, reasonable people can disagree on what we should do.    STEVE BUYER I'd just like to remind all of you that the impeachment process is intended to cleanse the executive or the judicial office when it's plagued with such a cancer as perjury or obstruction of justice, which violates the oath required to hold those high offices.    Now, what may be turning in the gut of some of you are the precedents of the Senate, when, in fact, you have turned out of office, you have exercised your judgments of proportionality. When these judges violated their oaths and had perjury, you said they shall be removed from office.    Now, there are some that are going, ''Well, I'm uneasy, in this case, with the President.'' That's what may create a little problem here. I would suggest to you that you actually have findings of fact, that the Senate has findings of fact that the President, in fact, he lied or he did not lie, or he committed an obstruction. That you actually have findings of fact and then you can move beyond to the questions of application of the law.    But when the Senate has performed such a cleansing and removed Judges Nixon, Claiborne and Hastings, all three of them impeached for perjury in some form, and in Judge Hastings's case, even though he had been acquitted of the criminal case, the Congress, in particular, the Senate, you have a duty to preserve the integrity of public office. And that is what impeachment was precisely designed to do.    Impeachable Offenses      Q.This question is from Senators DeWine, Santorum, and Fitzgerald to the President's counsel:    If we are to assume that the various allegations as to obstruction of justice are, in fact, true, is it your contention that if the President tampered with witnesses, encouraged the hiding of evidence and corruptly influenced the filing of a false affidavit by a witness that these acts do not rise to the level of an impeachable offense?    MR. RUFF Mr. Chief Justice, this is something I won't have an opportunity to say very often, but I believe that Mr. Manager Graham has, in fact, stated for you the essential of the role that this body must play. We will probably differ as to what the right answer to the question is, but as to the process and as to the question that must be asked, I think he stated it well.    I believe that the facts do not support the conclusions that are embodied in the question. But not only can reasonable people differ on the facts, but reasonable people may differ on the outcome. And if, indeed, reasonable people can differ, doesn't that mean by the very statement of that proposition, that this body cannot meet its constitutional heavy mandate, which is to determine whether or not, whatever conduct you believe the President committed as outlined by these managers over the last many days, can you legitimately determine that he ought to be removed from office? . . .    Views of the People    Q.This is a question from Senator Wellstone to counsel for the President:    To what extent should the views of the American people be taken into account in considering whether a President should be removed from office?    MR. RUFF Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the answer to that question is not the polls that you read in the newspapers or that you see on your evening news. Whatever those numbers may be, that's only one clue as to what the American people are thinking. And each of you knows the people in your jurisdiction far better than any poll taker does and than certainly I do.    But surely one way to test the ultimate question that I just described in response to the last inquiry from the Republican side of the House is to ask yourself, on the basis of experience over the last year, on the basis of your experience in the political, and in that I mean political in the very best constitutional sense of the term as used by Alexander Hamilton, has your sense of the political structure of this country and what the people are saying to you and what your sense of their needs are, do they need the kind of cleansing that Manager Buyer spoke about?    And I think the answer to that, if you look  within the body of people who you are most familiar with, must be no. This isn't to say that it's a popularity contest, that we ought to out and have a referendum or another poll before you all decide on this. But surely the sense of the people, the will of the people, the belief of the people in this President's ability to govern must educate each of you, not mandate a result, but surely guide the result that you reach in this proceeding.    Constituents and Conscience      Q.This is a question from Senator Lott to the House managers:    Do you have any comment on the answer given by the President's counsel with regard to the views of the American people?    HENRY J. HYDE This is a fascinating question. Edmund Burke was asked that once, and he said that a member of Parliament owes the highest degree of fidelity to his constituents, but he doesn't owe his conscience to anybody.    We have, or we have not, a representative democracy. We're not delegates who are sent here to weigh our mail every day and then to vote accordingly. Our work here is not an ongoing plebiscite. We are elected to bring our judgment, our experience and our consciences with us here. I have always believed, and I believe more firmly than ever, and this experience confirms me in that belief: there are issues of transcendent importance that you have to be willing to lose your office over.     I can think of several that I'm willing to lose my office over. Abortion is one. National defense is another. Strengthening, not emasculating, the concept of equal justice under law. My life is devoted as a lawyer. I've been on the Judiciary Committee, this is my 25th year. And equal justice under the law is what moves me and animates me and consumes me, and I'm willing to lose my seat any day in the week rather than sell out on those issues. Despite all the polls and all the hostile editorials, America is hungry for people who believe in something. You may disagree with us, but we believe in something. . . .    Transcript of Debriefing      Q.This is from Senator Daschle to the House managers:    Will you agree to arrange to have prepared a verbatim, unedited transcript of any debriefing which may occur with Ms. Lewinsky for immediate distribution to the Senate? And will you agree also to provide for the inclusion in any such debriefing of representatives of the Senate, one selected by the majority and one by the minority?    MR. McCOLLUM It is not our intent to be doing a deposition, a formal presentation, a preparation for the Senate. If we talk to Ms. Lewinsky, it is our intent to do what any good attorney would do in preparing to go to trial or -- presuming, we don't know that you're going to allow us to have witnesses, but presuming we're going to be able to depose and have witnesses -- and that is to meet with the witness, talk with the witness and prepare the witness. And any good attorney does that if it's going to be his or her witness, in their own confidences, in their own quiet respite. We discover things that way.    We're not prepared, no. The answer to your question is: No, we're not prepared to say we're going to give you our work product, which is what that would be. Work product is a technical term of law, but for anybody who's out in the public, it's what lawyers do all the time and they work on their case and they prepare what they're going to do and then they present it, and that's the system we have. . . .    MR. GRAHAM I'd like to echo the work product analogy. But let me just say this as directly as I know how to say it. That if this body as a whole believes that we're going to do anything improper, then whatever rule you need to fashion to make sure we don't, you do it. Because nobody should ever doubt whether a witness comes into this body, in this case and gave anything other than testimony that was truthful.    And if you want to go down the road of the atmosphere that people were approached and how they were treated about being witnesses, let's go down that road together. Let's bring in people in this body and let's see how they were approached when they were asked to participate in this trial, what the atmosphere and the mood was when it came their time to be identified as witnesses.    So I would just say, as strongly as I know how, that if you've got any doubt about us and what we're up to, you fashion rules so we do not create an unfairness in this body. But please, when we ask for witnesses, and we raise doubts about how people may have been treated, that you give us the same opportunity to explore the mood and atmosphere of those witnesses.    Sexual Harassment Law      Q. This is a question from Senators Hutchison of Texas, Snowe, Allard, Collins and Hatch to the House managers:    The counsel for the President have said that the heart of this case is private consensual sex. A tenet of sexual harassment law, however, is that the implied power relationship between a supervisor, in this case the President, and a subordinate, in this case an intern, is enough to constitute sexual harassment. This is well settled in military law and is developing along this line in the civilian sector. In your view, how might acquittal in this case affect laws regarding sexual harassment?    JAMES E. ROGAN The law of sexual harassment is a relatively new genre. If somebody wanted to make a case before the Congress had stepped in and improved upon the law, it essentially reduced a woman in the workplace, for instance, who had been harassed, into what has been referred to as a ''he said, she said'' type of argument. And so the law has improved upon that because the law recognizes today that sometimes there can be evidence of a pattern of conduct, and that conduct is relevant to prove how somebody may have behaved.    Consider what would happen if victims of the workplace get a message from the Congress of the United States that what the President did with Paula Jones or allegedly did with Paula Jones is of no constitutional significance here. It would send a message to every woman in the workplace that if they have a complaint against an employer who is attempting to use a position of power and authority to pursue improper advancements, the message would be that you might as well just keep quiet about it because the person can lie in court and suffer no recrimination.     First, they'll probably never be discovered, because most of the time DNA evidence doesn't suddenly appear. But even if DNA evidence does appear to corroborate the victim, the message is that as long as he is appropriately apologetic and the lie was after all only about sex, it's of no import with respect to removing them from their job or having them suffer any legal consequences. I think that would be a horrible message. . . .    Federal Judge's Ruling      Q. This is a question from Senator Hatch:    Isn't it true that Chief Federal District Judge Johnson ruled today, in an order that she authorized to be released to the public, that Ms. Lewinsky's immunity agreement, which requires her to make herself available for any interviews upon reasonable request, compels her to submit to an interview with the House? What light does this shed on the earlier debate on this matter?     MR. BRYANT I think certainly, having come from an experience of practicing law and learned so much over the years in trying cases and putting together cases in an ethical and appropriate fashion, to come into a political proceeding and as we have dealt with this -- and I think that the lawyers to my left have had to deal with the same type of situation -- in a political realm, not just in the Senate, but months and weeks before we came into here, is very difficult.    And what we've seen this morning is a completely innocent standard practice of sitting down with a potential witness before you have to list your witnesses Monday and deciding whether or not you want to use her. And they've talked about lawyers committing malpractice by not taking depositions.    I submit it would be close to that if you don't talk to a witness before you call that witness. And certainly, while the O.I.C. has had communication with her over some time, we have not. We have not had contact with any of these witnesses. And I alluded earlier to the White House and the other witnesses that work for the White House that we might be looking at calling.    I must presume by this conversation in this area of questioning that they have not had any contact about this case with Ms. Currie and Mr. Podesta and Mr. Blumenthal, and even a friend of the White House, Mr. Vernon Jordan. We're not asking that we be privy to every time they say hello in the hallway to these people or may sit down and talk with them.    We understand the realities of life. We simply wanted that crazy idea of maybe we ought to talk to a witness before we decide whether or not we want to listen to that witness. And I think today, to answer the question, and I'll sit down, is that Judge Johnson clearly vindicated this right to do that, to accomplish that through the immunity agreement.    I apologize if we've offended the senators. We certainly didn't intend to do that. We certainly didn't intend to break any rules about this, and we don't think we did. And certainly if we're going to go down that road, and if you see it's appropriate that we have a rule that you can agree on, we would be happy to abide by that.    Settlement in Jones Case      Q. This question is from Senators Thurmond and Bunning to the counsel for the President:    If there was no case and the White House accepted the results of the justice system, why then did the President pay nearly $1 million to Paula Jones?    MR. RUFF I say this with all due respect, truly:    As I think everyone knows in this chamber and outside this chamber who has practiced law, litigated difficult cases, the judgment of a defendant to settle a case, to pay whatever sum may be required to settle it, is, in all candor, I think, for all of us, not reflective of any belief that he was wrong, that the other side was right.    It reflects in this case, very candidly, a judgment by the President, which he has stated publicly, that in the midst of the many matters that he is responsible for, including, I must say, this matter, as well as all those matters of state on which he spends his time and to which he devotes his energies, he could no longer spend any of that time and any of that energy on the Jones case.    I am so hesitant to say this, but I really believe -- and please take it in the spirit that it's meant -- that to ask whether the settlement of this case reflects substantively on the merits of Ms. Jones's claim is not fair. The merits of Ms. Jones's claim were decided by Judge Wright. She concluded that there were none. And I really do believe that to ask whether the President's decision to settle is somehow a reflection on the merits contrary to those reached by Judge Wright is simply not the case...

You begin by speaking of race-specific scholarships \\"to recruit minority members who might not otherwise apply\\" and end by criticizing the Department of Education's attempt to discourage such scholarships because it sends a \\"devastating signal\\" to \\"minority students struggling to advance themselves.\\" Which is it?   Minority students who are truly struggling to advance themselves should apply to college regardless of whether a race-based scholarship is available. The Department of Education has not suggested eliminating need-based financial aid or consideration of race in college admissions.   But if race-based scholarships exist only to recruit minority members who might not otherwise apply, it defies logic to conclude that the students who apply only because of such scholarships are \\"struggling to advance themselves.\\" More likely, minority students who apply to college on that basis pursue higher education only because race-based scholarships have been set aside for them.   Thus, the elimination of race-based scholarships will eliminate \\"opportunity\\" only for minority students whose commitment to higher education is marginal at best. That is not devastation.

This British-made adaptation of the Frederick Lonsdale comedy, which came to the Republic Theatre on Saturday, treats lightly of mores and marriage while never quite wholly shaking off the shackles of a static plot. When, on occasion, Mr. Lonsdale's better quips and epigrams break through the general monotony of this conversation piece, \\"On Approval\\" sparkles. And when, on those rarer occasions, Miss Lillie is permitted to be herself, the film reaches its intended goal of humorous irreverence. On the whole, however, this comedy of errors, which might have been delightfully gay, is disappointingly dull.Clive Brook, who has not been seen on American screens for some time, not only produced, directed and co-starred in the picture but also fashioned the script, which has not deviated appreciably from the story of the original Lonsdale play. The yarn still concerns itself with the peculiar psychism which attracts unsuited people to each other. In this case it is the impoverished and selfish Duke of Bristol to the unselfish and lovely American heiress, Helen Hale, and the impoverished and timid Richard Halton to the shrewish, wealthy and middle-aged widow, Maria Wislack. When the latter pair decide to take a month's holiday together in Scotland in order to test their fitness for one another, the Duke and Helen tag along. That the two couples eventually discover their shortcomings is a foregone conclusion, and if the dénouement is not altogether surprising, it is, at least, charmingly executed.Miss Lillie, as the widow Wislack, is arch and cunning when delivering random lines about matrimony, but otherwise is bereft of funny situations or material. Googie Withers and Roland Culver are excellent as Helen and Richard, while Clive Brook's Duke is, for the most part, an affected poseur. \\"On Approval,\\" in short, could have used more Bea Lillie and less badinage.

While it is true that the art world is international today in a way that it was not in the 40's, when New York was becoming the center, no one can say that the ''next big thing'' won't come from New York. Certainly, the city is full of young artists and people interested in the work those artists are doing.

Whether or not this is so, Frankel Nathanson, scarcely two months old, seems already to have put down a root in Maplewood, at 9 Highland Place -- and without recourse to either crafts or frame making.    That the dealer, Marjorie Nathanson, brings with her a whiff of Manhattan may be because she was an assistant curator at the Museum of Modern Art and a consultant at Sotheby Parke Bernet. Wisely, though, she is still testing the New Jersey waters -- with prints, mostly by well-known contemporaries.   Jim Dine leads the way with a 1976 etching of the Eiffel Tower exploding like an oil well above the words, \\"Paris Smiles\\" in sans-serif lettering. He is accompanied by Frank Stella in his \\"lyrical\\" Minimalist mode with a 1973 lithograph of two striped squares, one black and white, the other in color.   With the appearance of William Brice's small etchings, monochrome and colored, emerges a hint of the dealer's preference -- for small shapes drawn in fine lines and suspended against smudgy backgrounds. Grace Markham, an artist new to this observer, achieves a similar effect in \\"Foxtrot,\\" a rectangle in which shapes -- a house, vegetation and possibly clouds -- hang like doodles touched here and there with color.    Then come the political comedians, Komar and Melamid. These Russian-born artists contribute a 1983 silk screen of a red banner reading \\"Thank You Comrade Stalin for Our Happy Childhood.\\" They are also responsible for a black and white silk screen of a repaired Venus de Milo, armed with a hammer and sickle.   Tom Marioni's color woodblock of the pi symbol, printed in blood red on white silk, looks as Oriental as \\"Flying Yen\\" in the same medium. But neither symbol offers clues to the artist's past as the enfant terrible of Bay Area Conceptualism.   In his book on San Francisco art, Thomas Albright tells how Mr. Marioni, given $500 to produce an installation for a Jesuit university, spent $350 of it on an old Fiat and the rest on invitations to the show, which he titled \\"My First Car.\\" Having driven the vehicle up the gallery steps, Mr. Marioni parked, contending that the church should support artists as it had during the Renaissance. The show lasted one day.   A British sculptor known for his shapes compiled of plastic junk, Tony Cragg is here represented by \\"Suburbs I, III and V,\\" all of them pale color etchings of rubber stamps congregating as if they were figures by de Chirico.   The most recent works in the selection are Joel Shapiro's 1992 aquatints of colored slabs that are formally related to his sculptures but do not evoke them. Yvonne Jacquette's aerial view of Skowhegan in black and white is a bit humdrum, but her \\"Clouds Obscuring San Diego,\\" which looks like a pastel but is billed as a color etching, is an enticing mass of purplish-brown laced with necklaces of colored dots for lights.   The show runs through Feb. 17. The gallery is open from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Wednesday through Saturday and until 8 P.M. Thursday. A New Gallery, a Display of Prints and a Touch of Manhattan'Vital Trees,'    A Princeton Show    The University League of Princeton University has its own gallery and a full schedule of shows but, a venerable institution of some 75 years, it does not aggressively seek publicity. Previous exhibitors have included artists on the order of Marguerite Doernbach, but the present incumbent, William Knight, is a lesser-known, albeit with many appearances in group shows to his credit.   To the degree that he seizes upon trees as living organisms, Mr. Knight evokes Charles Burchfield -- but fleetingly so, for there is no anthropomorphism here. The dark trunks of junipers rise against a lemon yellow sky. Coniferous growth in colors ranging from dark green to yellow and silver gray seems to shudder as it casts long, dark shadows","excerpt":"not for nothing does the artist call his subjects \\"Vital Trees.\\"    Although Mr. Knight has yet to achieve consistency of surface and the brushstroke that \\"speaks,\\" it is plain that there lurks in him an Expressionist awaiting release.

A good deal of what's being said is that it's awful, yes, but unavoidable.   The situation -- the many, many breakdowns every single week at every single track -- can most certainly be dramatically improved. The answer is obvious: race young horses a year or even two years later than they are now raced.   Horses are not fully grown until they are at least 5 years old (not until then do they have a full set of adult teeth). While their bodies are large and appear to be mature, the danger to a racing 2-year-old or even 3-year-old horse is at its greatest, because the full weight and size are supported by young, not fully strong bones, ligaments, tendons, muscles. The added stress of racing is often enough to tip the balance too far, and another horse dies on the race track. For the many so-called 2-year-olds are even younger than their official ages.   During college summers and for several years thereafter, I was an exercise girl at four major race tracks, getting on 10 to 12 horses every morning. A lot of people on the track voiced the point I am making.   Why don't the owners, who have the ultimate say, decide that the rules of racing must, out of a humane consideration for all race horses, be changed from 2-year-old racing to 3-year-old racing or even 4-year-old racing?

Pushkin, hated at the court because of his poems ridiculing Nicholas I, fell victim to the intrigues and cabals of the old régime. That's what the film says. The deeper reason, i. e., the unfaithfulness of Pushkin's wife, Natalie, who unscrupuously deceived him with Lieutenant Dantes, is entwined with the plottings of the Czar, who recognized that Natalie's vain heart was the surest weapon against the poet. Under the skillful hands of the Soviet director, however, one sees not Natalie but Nicholas I as the chief guilty party. And so they have made a propaganda film against Czarism.\\"And they have done it well. Director Gordin understands how to put events into a film, to bring them to a head and to bring them together with a snap at the climaxes. And he also understands, which is perhaps even more important, how to obtain pauses and to allow stored-up emotions to ebb by means of deftly sketched episodes. This film has power, great continuity and bright, snappy clarity. The Russians are a people of the plains, where every being and every object stands out sharply against the horizon. And so do their films. They are not painted with a broad brush, but sketched with a very fine engraving tool.\\"Hate is shrewder than love. When a Czarist cavalier, a courtier, a parade, a garden party in the Summer residence of Peterhof is photographed wonderful work is done in elevating an incident to a symbol of an epoch as a matter of course. Gordin understands how to direct a mass of figures, to push them now to the front, now to the background, so that the leading characters are not crowded out by the mass, but are lifted above it.\\"Tchverviakof, who wrote the manuscript, acts the part of Pushkin. One takes him for a creative person. He makes good even in the difficult scene in which he is seen at a writing desk at his poetic labors. The others are very carefully chosen types who carry the Czarist milieu to the edge of caricature","excerpt":"not grossly, but with a sort of ceremonial grace.\\" GERMANS ACCLAIM RUSSIAN PICTURE"},{"year":"1993","title":"EXTRA INNINGS A Memoir.

Zionism declares that there is going to be a Jewish state with a majority of Jews, come what may.   \\"Democracy says 'No, if the Arabs are the majority, then they have the right to decide their own fate.' . . . I say clearly I stand with Zionism.\\"    The undisputed father of Zionism, Theodor Herzl, based his book \\"The Jewish State\\" on the 19th-century liberal democratic notion that Jews should be allowed to buy, not seize, land in Palestine. He believed that if they became a clear majority, they should be able to create their own state, but with equal rights under the law for the lingering Arab minority.    To Herzl, Jews had no more of a 2,000-year-old, genetically transmitted right to Palestine than to Patagonia, his alternative (though perhaps tongue in cheek) proposed site for the Jewish state.   Rabbi Kahane's early Jewish Defense League career to protect New York Jews from gang attacks evoked great sympathy. However, his later campaign to expel the Arabs from Israel and the occupied West Bank derived not from Herzl's Zionism, but from the 1930's Nazi program of \\"Juden 'raus\\" (\\"out with the Jews\\"), with just a few changes.   Although, as Rabbi Meir Kahane often reminded us, there are many racist Zionists, Herzl made it abundantly clear that Zionism is not racist per se. J.

But now, weeks before the first lightly guarded convoy is to leave France, countries along its possible routes -- South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore, Chile -- are telling Japan to steer clear of their waters.

An answer two weeks ago established the Philadelphia Phillies as the major league team that lost the most post-season games in a row, 11. But the Phillies ended that streak in 1977. Which team currently has the longest losing streak in post-season play?    A. The Braves, of Atlanta and Milwaukee, have not left the field a winner in post-season games the last 11 times they've appeared in them, and based on the dreadful finishes of the franchise in recent years, don't expect them to surpass the Phillies' streak for quite awhile. The Braves' run of post-season futility goes back 32 years, to the fourth game of the 1958 World Series. When Warren Spahn walked off the mound at Yankee Stadium with a two-hit, 3-0 victory over Whitey Ford in that Oct. 5 game, he accepted the congratulations of his Milwaukee teammates for lifting the defending champion Braves into what seemed an insurmountable 3-games-to-1 lead in the Series. But the Braves never won again in the post-season: not in the remaining three games of that Series with the Yankees","excerpt":"not in the two-game National League playoff with the Los Angeles Dodgers a year later; not in the three-game league championship series with the Mets in 1969, by which time the franchise had moved to Atlanta; and not in the three-game league series with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1982.    There are three consolations for the Braves. One is that each team they lost to during the post-seasons went on to win the World Series that year. The other two sources of solace are that among current teams, the Braves have not been totally shut out of victories in their post-season history, nor have they gone the longest time without a victory in post-season play.   Two expansion franchises -- the Texas Rangers (born in 1961 as the second Washington Senators team) and the Seattle Mariners (created in 1977) -- have never played a post-season game, and one long-time major league franchise, the Cleveland Indians, has not won a game beyond the regular season in 42 years, since capturing Game 6 to clinch the 1948 World Series. That last team to be beaten by Cleveland was the Boston Braves, who have since relocated to Milwaukee and Atlanta and fallen under a dry spell of their own. 4 for 4 for Reggie     Q. Is it true that Reggie Jackson of the Yankees hit four home runs on four consecutive swings in the 1977 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers?    A. It's true, all right, but he didn't do it in the same game or on the same date or even in the same city. No player, in fact, ever has hit home runs more than three times in one Series game, with Babe Ruth (twice) and Jackson the only ones to belt that many. What Mr. October did in October of 1977, though, was one of a kind. On his last time at bat in Game 5 in Los Angeles, Jackson hit a home run off Don Sutton in the ninth inning. It was the final run in a 10-4 Dodger victory that sent the Series back to New York with the Yankees ahead in games, 3-2.    Two days later, in Game 6 at Yankee Stadium, Jackson walked on four pitches his first time up, against Burt Hooton in the second inning. So when he batted against Hooton again in the fourth inning, Jackson still had not swung at a pitch since his homer in Los Angeles. He hit a home run on Hooton's first pitch. Two innings later against Elias Sosa, Jackson hit a homer on the first pitch again. Leading off the Yankee eighth, it was one pitch and another home run, this time off Charlie Hough. The Yankees won the game, 8-4, and the Series, 4-2, but Jackson won most of the applause with a record-tying three homers in one Series game and a record-breaking five for one World Series. The 1941 Giants     Q. Much has been made of the football Giants' 7-0 start this season being the best since 1941. How did that Giant team of 49 years ago fare and who were some of its star players?    A. Giants' fans should be heartened by the fact that this year's team already has bettered the start of its 1941 ancestor (5-0) because if the 1990 Giants surpass the finish of the 1941 team as well, then it would mean at least a National Conference title and a Super Bowl appearance.    The Giants of Coach Steve Owen finished with an 8-3 record in 1941 to win the five-team Eastern Division title by one game over the Brooklyn Dodgers. They did it, of course, with defense, yielding only 114 points, the fewest in the league. Ward Cuff led the team in receiving, with 19 catches for 317 yards, and in scoring, with 46 points on 2 touchdowns, 5 field goals and 19 extra points. Tuffy Leemans not only was the team's top rusher (averaging 3.3 yards a carry for 332 total yards), but also its top passer (31 completions in 66 attempts for 475 yards and 4 touchdowns). The rest of the team was peopled by such players as Mel Hein, a future Hall of Famer; Jim Lee Howell, a future Giants' head coach, and Hank Soar, a future major league umpire.   Only Brooklyn (a 16-13 victor to end the 5-0 start and a 21-7 winner in the regular-season finale) and the Chicago Cardinals (a 10-7 winner) beat the Giants that season. Until the title game. That showdown matched the Giants with the defending champion Chicago Bears, 73-0 winners over Washington the year before in the title game and 33-14 winners over Green Bay the week before in a Western Division playoff.    With Sid Luckman at quarterback, the Bears of Coach George Halas had lost just once in 12 games and averaged almost 36 points a game. They kept at it in the title game, scoring in every quarter against the Giants and romping, 37-9, before a crowd of 13,341 at Wrigley Field.

Their tales typically interwove current events, neighborhood gossip and fantasy into surreal little scenarios, infused with sex and high adventure, in which the line between real and imagined events often blurred.    In \\"Aventis,\\" the Spanish film maker has pieced together some of those stories to create a complex and haunting portrait of his country's psyche during the harsh early years of the Franco regime. Although the film is set mostly in 1940, it jumps forward to 1970 when two of the characters turn up in a mortuary. It has a final scene, set in the present, that suggests how events of 50 years earlier can still cast long, if pale, shadows.

Allow this to dry hard, then paint with two coats of enamel. Q. The cedar shingles on our house, which was built in 1947, will not hold paint, at least on one side which faces the bay that is nearby.

You can take it off yourself with a water-wash, semipaste chemical paint remover, but it will be a great deal of work and you will need many gallons of remover. You would be better off hiring a professional contractor who has one of those high-pressure washers used with a chemical remover to get the old paint off.

Young musicians, looking for direction, took up idols old enough to be parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. But none of the odd juxtapositions of age and class beat Barbara Dennerlein's. Miss Dennerlein, a 24-year-old German organist from Munich, plays deep in the organ tradition, funk included.

Within the niche she has chosen, she has become an adept of Larry Young, the most harmonically adventurous of all the organists, who died in 1978. Miss Dennerlein is an absolutely effortless musician -- she has been playing the organ since she was 12 -- and at her show at Sweet Basil's on Friday night, as part of a week of musicians recording for the Enja record label, she mixed complex and linear be-bop lines with grunting blues exclamations and pushy chordal passages that ruptured harmony.    Miss Dennerlein, backed by Mitch Watkins on guitar, Bud Revels on tenor saxophone and Tony Reedus on drums, set fire to a handful of standards and originals that moved from blues compositions to pieces that floated on funk patterns. Paying careful attention to dynamics, she brought the band down to a quiet moan at moments, only to let them rip the next; her compositions, made with a pop attention to melody, regularly included written interludes between soloists. And with her constant rhythmic invention, spurred on by an insistent, argumentative Mr. Reedus, Miss Dennerlein made it clear that she understood exactly what should be done.

Being such a vital, energetic, humane and charming person, he belongs to that rare breed of individual that others refuse to acknowledge as mortal. On behalf of my accounting firm, H.J. Behrman and Company, LLP, as well as personally, my sincerest condolences are expressed to Ed Chwatt's wife, Sara; his children, Mitchell, Eric, Jill and Samantha; his brother, Richard; his grandchildren and the entire Chwatt family as well his extended business family and the staff at Chwatt Associates. From a business standpoint, Ed was fair, honorable and appreciative, a stand-up Brooklyn guy. His loss, however, is personally felt beyond a business relationship. After the initial disbelief, my feelings were automatically transformed to tears. My body was instinctively saying without words how I felt about Ed Chwatt. Once Ed suggested I consider what he had done by explaining to my elderly, infirm parents how much I loved them and appreciated what they had done for me. I told him my parents already intuitively understood how grateful I am. Ed responded, of course they do, but tell them anyway. They'll be glad you did and so will you. In that regard, I hope Ed intuitively understood that he was a respected friend of mine. Goodbye, friend. Neal Klinger     CHWATT--Edward A. On May 1, 2004. A powerful, loving, supportive and stable force in our lives was transformed by the sudden passing of our beloved husband, father, stepfather, brother, grandpa, uncle and friend. He was an adoring husband to Sara, whom he cherished. He was a fiercely devoted father to Mitchell, Sara, Jill, Eric, Nancy, Samantha and Jimm. Eddie was a loving brother and best friend to Robyn and Richard, with whom he shared an extraordinary and unbreakable bond. He delighted in spending time with his grandchildren Sammie, Justin, Corey, Nikki, Dana, Lauren, Kayla and Sierra, all of whom he adored. He loved his nieces and nephews Glenn, Lori, Suzy, Craig, Jaime and Evan. He prized his many friends with whom he shared priceless memories and strong ties. His love, energy, charisma, sense of humor and generosity touched many and as a result he enriched the world. He will continue to guide us, fill us with love and be an ongoing light in our lives. Services will be held at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, NYC, Wednesday, May 5, 2:30 p.m. Donations in his memory may be made to Congregation Schomre Israel, 18 Park Avenue, Poughkeepsie, NY 12603.

Unlike many of the female characters in her dozens of breezy novels, Weldon comes off as a no-nonsense, pragmatic, resilient heroine in her own life story. Born in England and raised in New Zealand, she was thrust into a troubled, troubling family, whose pursuits included the occult and sexual shenanigans of varying stripes","excerpt":"not only that, but everyone, including her father, mother, uncle and grandfather, churned out novels, stories, memoirs and film scripts. ''Her portrait of London in the 1950's and 60's is intricately evocative,'' Janet Burroway wrote here in 2003. Although she ''ends her book just at the point when her career is about to take hold, her story of a lost girl on her way to finding herself winds up having heft as well as lift.''    THE DOGS OF BABEL, by Carolyn Parkhurst. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.95.) After his artist wife dies in a mysterious fall from an apple tree, a linguist resolves to pry the truth from the only witness -- their dog, Lorelei -- by teaching her to talk. This ''inventive first novel'' has lots to say about love and grief, M. G. Lord said here last year, and it often transports the reader ''to an unexpected and strangely powerful place.''    OUR OWN DEVICES: How Technology Remakes Humanity, by Edward Tenner. (Vintage, $14.95.) Tenner, an expert on innovation and the author of ''Why Things Bite Back,'' offers a collection of loosely connected essays on what he calls body technologies, like sneakers, chairs, helmets and eyeglasses, and examines how these contraptions have modified our bodies and behavior, usually for the worse. The result is ''an intellectual thrill ride'' and ''a memorable mosaic . . . that illustrates how human progress is half a matter of striding and half of stumbling,'' David Pogue said here last year.    BLACK DAHLIA AVENGER: A Genius for Murder, by Steve Hodel. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $14.95.) With striking detachment, a retired Los Angeles police officer builds a case that his father -- a doctor, a dabbler in art and a worldly man who hung out with Man Ray and John Huston -- was also the Black Dahlia killer, who terrorized Los Angeles in the 1940's. It's a creepy tale set in ''the age of film noir,'' David Thomson wrote here in 2003, and ''George Hodel . . . is fit company for some of noir's most civilized villains -- like Waldo Lydecker in 'Laura,' Harry Lime in 'The Third Man' or even Noah Cross in 'Chinatown.' ''    THE QUALITY OF LIFE REPORT, by Meghan Daum. (Penguin, $14.) This first novel's heroine, who covers the lifestyle beat for a New York morning station, moves to a Midwestern town, where she is wowed by the hospitality, the setting and the cheap rent. Her televised reports on her new life include, of course, encounters with colorful locals and an ill-fated affair with a sexy man who has fathered three children by three different women. Using her ''enormous comic gift,'' Daum ''manages the near impossible: to make fun of people without judging them,'' Karen Karbo said here last year.    SAMARITAN, by Richard Price. (Vintage, $14.) Revisiting his customary leitmotifs of drugs, violence and racial strife, Price tells of a successful TV writer who returns to his housing project in northern New Jersey, where he teaches writing to ghetto kids who barely read and tries to make a difference. After he is beaten and refuses to name his attackers, a detective who is an old friend tries to solve the riddle of his reticence. The novel features ''a sprawling cast of highly cinematic characters, an air of pungent menace, a full-to-bursting package held together by a strong, suspenseful plot,'' Mark Costello wrote in the Book Review in 2003.    OFFICE OF INNOCENCE, by Thomas Keneally. (Anchor, $15.) Part melodrama, part theological treatise, this Australian novel chronicles the sentimental education of an earnest young priest whose indiscretions bring scandal to the church and a psychopathic killer to his confessional. ''Keneally is an expert storyteller,'' Paul Baumann said here last year. ''With its dizzying moral ironies, smart pace and deft set pieces, his novel evokes Graham Greene.''    THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR, by Donald Kagan. (Penguin, $15.) Drawing on his four scholarly volumes on Thucydides' history of the Peloponnesian War (431-404 B.C.), which pitted the Spartan alliance against Athens, the celebrated historian presents what Bernard Knox, writing in these pages in 2003, called ''a fresh, clear and fast-moving account . . . for general readers.''

Houston seemed almost certain to turn boring, even if it did continue to get bigger.   But the latest crop of large buildings proves that economic troubles have done nothing to rob Houston of its brazen architectural energy. The office towers continue to rise, even where they lack the long lines of corporate tenants eager for space that brokers were once accustomed to, and they are as striking as ever.   Nothing proves the point better than the latest skyscrapers in Houston by the New York architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee, neither of which looks like anything else anywhere in the United States. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Burgee have been dropping rather startling forms into the skylines of several major American cities for the last few years, but their architectural act reaches a new level of flamboyance in Houston.

After the book came the play, in which E. H. Sothern and others acted far and wide. Then William Fox produced a silent picture of it, with William Far???um as François Villon contributing one of his outstanding film performances. Eventually it formed the basic idea for Rudolf Friml's operetta, know as \\"The Vagabond King,\\" which the other day was presented at the Criterion in audible Technicolor form. It is a beautiful production with alternately forceful and appealing music, but as its scenes pass on the screen one can't help wishing that more of the original author's work had remained in this production.It is directed for the most part with imagination and often with marked effect. One could not hope for any more buoyant scenes than those that accompany Friml's stirring march, \\"Song of the Vagabonds.\\" This part alone makes the picture worth seeing, for it is pulsating with action, streaked with fine color effects and splendidly timed. It is so good that what follows seems but a tame, gorgeously tinted and well-designed pictorial argument concerning Villon's ultimate fate.And after leaving the theatre the sequence of the vengeful mob and the throbbing notes of its song, \\"Onward, Onward,\\" cling to one's mind. No motion picture chapter in color can equal this memorable combination of music, hues and cinematic scenes. In it are Villon's rascals, thieves and beggars, marching on Burgundy's men, with fire in their eyes, gleaming teeth and glistening knives, spears and anything else that may serve as a weapon. Gradually they are seen with torn garments, faces and bodies streaked with blood—just flashes of them here and there that come as if the spectator were flying through the fighting area.In contrast to this there is an adroitly filmed sequence which curiously enough is almost Barriesque. It shows the hitherto ragged and unkempt Villon awakening after a drugged sleep to find himself lying on a bed in the king's palace, shaved and bathed and clad in the silks and satins of a nobleman. The tinted shades here are light and gay and Dennis King, the singing Villon of this picture, after being first astonished at his raiment, goes to a mirror, where he hardly recognizes himself.It is ??? this passage that Villon, designated the Count of Montcorbier, site in judgment over his comrades of the underworld. It is quite charming when they fail to recognize in him the François Villon whom they know so well. He whispers in a girl's ear some of her secrets and she is amazed. He tells a scoundrel ??? his last crime and generally startles the tatterdemalion throng with his knowledge of their doings. The royal barber arranges so that Villon has a special entourage of servitors, a group such as this knight of the razor believes would be imagined by a vagabond like Villon.It is a pity that with all the competent and really artistic work that has gone into this production, from Ludwig Berger, as director, and from most of the players, particularly O. P. Heggie, who plays Louis XI, that it was found necessary to insert uninspired lines instead of the poem, \\"If I Were King.\\"Villon recites in the film these words:\\"What France needsIs a King with a spine,Not a weak, snorting swine,Like Louie.\\"A verse from \\"If I Were King\\" ???t corresponds to this runs:\\"The figure on the throne you seeIs nothing but a puppet, plannedTo wear the regal braveryOf silken coat and gilded wand","excerpt":"Not so we Frenchmen understand,The Lord of lion's heart and glance,And such a one would take commandIf Villon were the King of France!\\"It is said that the reason the poem \\"If I Were King\\" was not included in the film was because Mr. Friml had not written the music for the verses when it was presented on the stage and that the picture was to be billed as an operetta with music by Friml. The answer to this is that the verses could have been recited and they would have made a fine scene for the one that now sets one's nerves on edge. On taking one's seat in the Criterion one hopes especially to hear that verse from \\"If I Were King\\" which runs:His counselors are rogues, Perdie!While men of honest mind are bannedTo creak upon the Gallows Tree,Or squeal in prisons overmanned;We want a chief to bear the brandAnd bid the damned Burgundians dance.God! where the Oriflamme should standIf Villon were the King of France!\\"The \\"Ballad of Dead Ladies\\" is reduced to one scant line, which, if memory serves, is \\"Where Are the Dreams of Yesterday?\\"Mr. Heggie gives an extraordinarily fine performance as Louis. It is suited to the spirit of the musical play and acted with genuine appreciation for this romantic conception of the King's nature. It is never too far from reality to become annoying. Mr. King is his own conception of Villon, which naturally has to be very different from even Mr. McCarthy's colorful portrait of that rhyming vagabond. Mr. King played it on the stage so long that his performance before the camera and the microphone had to be what he was accustomed to. It permitted possibly of little direction. While Mr King's voice is frequently strident, it is effective, and when he sings the duet \\"Only a Rose,\\" with Jeanette MacDonald, the result is most appealing.Miss MacDonald, as Katherine, is at her best when she sings. Her spoken lines are none too well written and her enunciation of them is decidedly disappointing. Whatever atmosphere of \\"If I Were King\\" there is in this picture, Miss MacDonald quickly brings one back to Manhattan and 1930 by the tones of her speech.A nice comedy portrayal is contributed by Arthur Stone as the barber. Lillian Roth gives a commendable performance as Huguette, and Thibault is smoothly impersonated by that experienced player of screen villains, Warner Oland.Murder and Fun.AT the Paramount last week there was a specially written screen melodrama called \\"Roadhouse Nights.\\" It comes from Ben Hecht's pen, and while it has its decidedly extravagant moments, it is dramatic and intelligently acted, the principals being Fred Kohler, Helen Morgan and Charles Ruggles, with some good low comedy by the popular Jimmy Durante.And while referring to the capable work done by these persons it should by no means be forgotten that Hobart Henley's direction is admirable. This is really a talking motion picture, not one with scene after scene in the same place, and although Mr. Hecht's imaginative incidents are highly improbable, and on at least one occasion an otherwise quickwitted man appears to be attacked with temporary deafness, the action leaps along with the spasmodic introduction of clever humor.It is Charles Ruggles who furnishes the humor. He impersonates a reporter who is sent out to follow up a story of bootleggers. The city editor of the Chicago newspaper for which he works believes that the first man sent out has tackled too much rum himself, and therefore is hardly fitted to report on the actions of rum-runners. As a matter of record this first reporter, James Hanson, is shot and killed by Sam Horner, the bootlegger, just when he (the newspaper man) is telephoning in his story. He falls with a bullet through his heart just before he utters Horner's name.Mr. Ruggles here enjoys the name of Willie Bindbugel, a happy-go-lucky but wonderfully persistent scribe, who hasn't any real suspicion of the danger he is in when hunting up the activities of Horner and his crew. This Horner runs a roadhouse, where Lola Fagan (Helen Morgan) sings and fawns upon the boss. She becomes tired of doing both and would like to decamp, but Horner has a will of iron, who permits no desertions nor dallying while he's around.Horner's establishment is peopled with types from the underworld. He believes in being ready for an attack. His waiters are murderers and thugs. Even the chef is counted upon to wield a carving knife in an emergency. Besides these useful underlings he has his regular guard who saunter about prepared to snuff out a rebellious or a too inquisitive life.Miss Morgan sings agreeably and acts impressively. Mr. Ruggles turns from fun to melodrama with pleasing facility. Fred Kohler has just the right measure of his part. He is excellent. And none shall say that Mr. Durante is not amusing, with his display of timidity and singing under decidedly adverse conditions, for in character he is the target for anything the rowdy customers in Horner's place choose to throw at him, and in the dressing room he never knows when a bullet may have his name inscribed on it.A Well-Told Drama.WILLIAM SLAVENS McNUTT, a short-story writer, and Grover Jones, a veteran film producer, worked together in making a suspenseful picture out of incidents in Joseph Conrad's novel \\"Victory.\\" This film shows the result of a happy combination between a writer and a man who is thoroughly conversant with the picture-making business. The dialogue is far more intelligent than in most of the good talking films, and, when the time comes for peppering a scoundrel with bullets, there is none of that hesitancy that is perceived all too frequently.This talking pictorial offering comes to the screen under the title of \\"Dangerous Paradise,\\" which does not lead one to anticipate its real value as a story.The chronicle begins in a South Seas port, with Alma, played by Nancy Carroll, impersonating a violinist in a woman's orchestra. Alma, being attractive, finds herself pursued by both Zangiacomo, who manages the orchestra, and Schomberg, the owner of the hotel. Schomberg is so eager to leave his wife and make Alma his mistress that he decides to occupy the room next door to Alma's. One evening Alma chats with Heyst, a young man who is taking life easily on a small island not far away. Except for a Japanese servant, he lives alone, making occasional excursions to the island where Schomberg runs his hotel.Alma, knowing that Heyst is returning to his insular abode on his launch, decides to hide away on the craft. Heyst believes that Alma is a wanton and when he finds her aboard his boat his welcome is none too cheery.The story then returns to Schomberg's hostelry. Three strange persons arrive. One is a tall, peculiar individual. His name is Jones. A second, a sinister fellow with a black mustache, is named Ricardo. The third is known as Pedro. He is an addle-brained strong man, who stands threateningly in a corner showing his enormous biceps. It is soon realized that when Jones and Ricardo do not get what they want, Pedro is asked to tackle the victim. Jones and Ricardo are apt to inform their prey that Pedro can crush the life out of a very strong man, so what hope have they!This swindling, murdering trio do not take a fancy to Schomberg, with the consequence that the hotel proprietor one evening gives up the ghost after being hugged by the forbidding Pedro. This snuffing out of a worthless life, which is left largely to the imagination, precedes a visit the three strangers make to Heyst's island, where they expect to find a barrel or two of gold.The suspense before they reach there is keen enough and as one is cognizant of their intentions it becomes heightened. Heyst and Alma seem to have precious little chance for their lives, until one realizes that the well-fed Japanese servant believes in being forearmed. His motto is not to hesitate in an emergency and it is chiefly through this yellow man that Jones, Ricardo and Pedro find that they would have been far better off if they had not visited the island.

News of the Rialto"},{"year":"1991","title":"To the Editor:   As a travel agent for 15 years and a frequent flier for 30 years I was not really surprised at what occurred in Los Angeles on Feb. 1. I am not referring to the plane crash but to the problem with people exiting from the plane (front page, Feb. 7).   The Federal Aviation Administration has ruled that people should not be seated in emergency-row seats unless they are physically able to assist people to exit and are able to read (in English) the instructions about opening the doors.    Most travel agencies are computerized and can pick up the seat maps of the plane and assign seats to their passengers. There is only one airline that requires the agent to call the airline to assign those particular seats. At the time of calling, the agent is asked if the passenger is aware of the responsibility that he or she has if there is a problem.   The next rule states that the flight attendant must further advise the passenger of his or her responsibility and also see that the proper passenger is seated in these seats.   Of course, when a plane is full and the flight attendants are busy stowing carry-on luggage and handing out pillows and blankets, they are not always aware of which passenger is or is not seated correctly. After takeoff passengers are able to change seats. Emergency-row seats that would be left empty are thus filled by just anyone, even the handicapped or young children.   As a passenger, I have found that emergency-row seats on the new planes do not have as much leg room as the older planes had, so now there is the other problem of squeezing through this narrow aisle to leave the plane. Then, of course, there are the passengers notorious for ignoring the emergency instructions that are given by the flight attendant at the time of takeoff.

It seemed a bit unreal to Ms. Kowroski, who became seriously ill with mononucleosis in the fall and had not performed at the New York State Theater since last spring. ''Part of me felt like I had never been gone, and part of me was like, 'Where am I? What am I doing?' '' she said of her return. As Titania, she was elegant and pliant, perhaps more fragile than ethereal","excerpt":"not surprising, considering there were weeks last winter when she couldn't even leave her bed. Battling both fatigue and depression and unable to work on the physical aspect of dancing, she forced herself to dig into ballet's psychological side, listening to scores and imagining stories behind her nonnarrative roles. Calling it a ''forced reawakening,'' Ms. Kowroski also spent a lot of time trying to rediscover herself, to not be so critical and focus more on using her personal growth to become a stronger performer. ''I think I had expected myself to come back, and it would all just come together last night,'' she said the morning after her return. ''And I can't expect that to happen. It has to evolve.'' City Ballet audiences will have the good fortune to watch Ms. Kowroski's evolving reawakening. She is particularly looking forward to dancing Mauro Bigonzetti's Diamond Project offering, ''In Vento,'' and revisiting Balanchine classics like ''Symphony in C.'' She can next be seen on Sunday, in Eliot Feld's ''Unanswered Question.'' (The season continues through June 25 at Lincoln Center.

Mr. Beery may be thunder afloat; at least, as the enraged tugboat skipper floundering through navy discipline in quest of his sub, he more than displaces his weight in slapstick, but exploding depth charges speak with greater authority. They're the picture's real thunder.Some of the action shots of the splinter fleet are great, and there is one grand sequence (no matter if it was made in a studio tank) of a navy mystery schooner being blown out of the water by pointblank shell fire from a U-boat's deck guns.

(Broadway, $14.95.) Jennifer, formerly James, Boylan felt out of place in a man's body and chose to become a woman. Before surgery, she took both estrogen and a drug to lower her testosterone level: ''One pill makes you want to talk about relationships and eat salad. The other pill makes you dislike the Three Stooges.'' Boylan, an English professor, writes ''with disarming humor and a sharp eye for some of the absurdities of her situation,'' Janet Maslin said in The Times in 2003.    HERMIT IN PARIS: Autobiographical Writings, by Italo Calvino. (Vintage International, $13.) This collection of bits and pieces -- interviews, endnotes, replies to questionnaires -- includes a journal Calvino, who died in 1985, kept during his travels in the United States in 1959-60, and the title piece, a homage to his adopted city. The collection is uneven, our reviewer, Richard Eder, wrote in the Book Review last year, but it offers ''some excellent things.''    FOUR TRIALS, by John Edwards with John Auchard. (Simon & Schuster, $13.) In this book the Democratic candidate for vice president describes four of the cases -- involving accidents and alleged medical malpractice -- he argued and won during his career as a trial lawyer. ''Four Trials'' ''is both an attempt to position Edwards as the little fellow's champion . . . and a between-the-lines argument against tort reform,'' Michael Tomasky said in these pages earlier this year.    GREAT NECK, by Jay Cantor. (Vintage Contemporaries, $15.) This novel follows the lives of six teenagers from suburban Long Island during the 1960's and 70's. The brother of one of the girls is killed by the Klan while registering black voters in Mississippi, yet he apparently continues to send letters to another girl in the group. Dedicated to fighting for justice in his memory, the friends create a wildly popular comic-book series in which they're transformed into superheroes. As they move from nonviolent protest through the Black Panthers and the Weathermen, Cantor provides ''an impressively economical panorama of two decades in the life of America'' in a novel ''rich in character and incident,'' Adam Begley wrote in the Book Review in 2003.    TERROR IN THE NAME OF GOD: Why Religious Militants Kill, by Jessica Stern. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $15.95.) Stern, who lectures on terrorism at Harvard, spent four years talking to Christian, Jewish and Muslim extremists, and found that they had much in common. Leaders of the groups enjoyed the trappings of power, while those who served as cannon fodder were young and poorly educated. Stern's ''knowledge of the background'' of these groups ''adds perspective to her interviews,'' Isabel Hilton wrote in these pages last year, and while Stern offers no solutions, ''this is a serious and provocative beginning.''    FAMILY HISTORY, by Dani Shapiro. (Anchor, $13.) Rachel Jensen's lovely 13-year-old daughter, Kate, returns from camp with a pierced navel and a bad attitude. Is it ordinary teenage anger, or something worse? One night Kate causes an accident that shatters her family. The reader sees the effect, but not the cause","excerpt":"not until the novel's end is the whole picture revealed. ''Shapiro is a gifted writer,'' Emily White wrote in the Book Review last year, ''and 'Family History' is a bona fide page turner.''    CALIFORNIA DISH: What I Saw (and Cooked) at the American Culinary Revolution, by Jeremiah Tower. (Free Press, $14.) Tower, a former partner in Berkeley's legendary Chez Panisse, chronicles his role in California cuisine's coming-of-age in the 1970's and 80's in this memoir. Tower turned away from French cooking and relied on fresh seasonal ingredients, classically prepared. Describing experiences with drugs and encounters with celebrities, Tower, who now lives in New York, ''still knows how to dish,'' Judy D'Mello said in these pages last year.    INDELIBLE ACTS: Stories, by A. L. Kennedy. (Vintage Contemporaries, $12.) This Scottish writer's third collection of stories describes people's emotional errors in their search for love.

Rossano Brazzi plays the hero, a young villager turned hillbilly Robin Hood, who finally brings death to his mortal enemy, a priest, and his sweetheart, paying the piper after a ridiculous chase up hill and down dale.Without banking noticeably on a matinee idol profile or the shoddy material, Signor Brazzi has come through with a neat, restrained piece of acting, Carlo Ninchi, as the hard-bitten priest, is just as incisive.

That is eight times the amount of their own money that Presidential candidates are normally allowed to use. But, since Mr. Perot is not accepting Federal campaign funds, he is not covered by the $50,000 personal contribution limit that applies to candidates who do accept Federal funds. Other Reports Compared    Mr. Perot, whose fortune is estimated at $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, has said he is prepared to spend $100 million or more if he decides to run. The Democratic and Republican nominees in the general election will be limited to slightly more than $30 million each, all of it public money.   What Mr. Perot submitted today was the monthly accounting of his campaign receipts and expenses for March, the first month for which he has filed. The documents showed that he raised $457,633.42 last month and spent $394,803.11.   President Bush's March report showed receipts of $4.7 million and expenditures of $6.9 million. Gov. Bill Clinton's report showed receipts of $4.9 million and spending in March of $5.4 million. The report of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, Mr. Clinton's major remaining rival for the Democratic nomination, was not available tonight.   Of the money Mr. Perot raised, $409,823.77 came out of his own pocket. Most of the rest, according to a statement by the Perot campaign, came from $5 contributions from more than 5,000 people. Under the law, donations of less than $200 do not have to be itemized, and the donors' names do not have to be made public.    Mr. Perot has said he would not seek contributions of more than $5. But his campaign said some volunteers had spent more than that of their own money in various goods and services that were listed as \\"in kind\\" contributions.   Even though he is not accepting Federal money for his campaign, Mr. Perot is still bound by the law that allows Presidential candidates to receive no more than $1,000 from any individual in the general election campaign and no more than $5,000 from any political action committee.   The Perot campaign's statement said the expenditures were used for petition drives to get Mr. Perot's name on the ballot in all 50 states. That drive did not begin to catch fire until late last month, so much more is likely to be spent in April.

Schools are sometimes so concentrated that deep trollers can feel their six-pound downrigger balls bouncing off the backs of the bass below, and boaters are advised to go slow because their props can chop up spawners thrashing about  on the surface.

But \\"Cool Runnings\\" boils down to just three words: Jamaican bobsled team. Since nothing about that phrase says \\"stroke of genius,\\" there's reason to wonder what kind of film can have been spun out of it. The answer: a cute, buoyant sports fantasy, jolted along by a reggae soundtrack and playfully acted by an appealing cast. This new Disney comedy is slick, funny and warmhearted, very much in the old-fashioned Disney mode.   Though this film's vision of Jamaica is about as authentically Caribbean as Sebastian the crab, it is picturesque and bright. In sunny Jamaica, a champion sprinter named Derice Bannock (Leon) joins forces with the comical Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug) and two other friends to form an unlikely Olympic team. Derice, the bald-headed Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba) and Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) have all crossed paths, quite literally, in the Olympic trials for Jamaican runners. And they have lost their chance to qualify as runners.

This was, after all, the year of passing fancies: \\"Twin Peaks\\" peaked, Milli Vanilli melted, and the lambada proved to be an NC-17 version of the Hula-Hoop. Jesse Helms took on Robert Mapplethorpe, Florida went after the 2 Live Crew, and Broadway wondered whether \\"Miss Saigon\\" would be bygone.  What follows is a highly selective calendar of the year's most memorable moments -- and a few best forgotten. JANUARY  Jan. 8  All About Deb: Jane Pauley is replaced by the younger, blonder, bubblier Deborah Norville on NBC's \\"Today\\" show, and America begins to tune out in droves.  There Is No Net: California Superior Court orders Paramount to pay Art Buchwald for an idea that became the Eddie Murphy film \\"Coming to America.\\" Showing more originality in bookkeeping than in screenwriting, Paramount claimed a net loss of $18 million for a film that grossed over $275 million, and concluded that it owed Buchwald nothing.  Jan. 9  Un Bel Helicopter: Cameron Mackintosh says he can't find a theater in New York big enough for his new musical \\"Miss Saigon,\\" a retelling of the Madame Butterfly story set in Vietnam, in which a chopper lands on the stage. Jan. 10  The Bloom Is Off: Alan Bond, the Australian entrepreneur who had bought van Gogh's \\"Irises\\" for a record $53.9 million in 1987, puts the painting back on the market. The Getty got it.  Jan. 14  Pas de Misha: American Ballet Theater celebrates its 50th year with a gala at the Metropolitan Opera House","excerpt":"notably absent is the former artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov, who had resigned in a dispute with the company's board.  Jan. 15  No Tomorrow: The $7 million production of \\"Annie 2: Miss Hannigan's Revenge\\" flops on the road. Producers plan instead to revive the original \\"Annie\\" on Broadway, but Miss Hannigan's had it: Dorothy Loudon, who created the role, pulls out.  Jan. 21  You Say Lambada, I Say Lumbago: Kaoma, the group that has sold four million copies of its single, \\"The Lambada,\\" tours the country, setting off the most hyped -- and least danceable -- disco craze since Da Butt.  FEBRUARY Feb. 2  Not Even a Contender: The Philadelphia Museum of Art insists that an 800-pound, 8 1/2-foot bronze sculpture of Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa be removed from its plaza after the filming of \\"Rocky V\\" winds up. Feb. 8  A Few Minutes Without . . . : Andy Rooney is suspended from CBS's \\"60 Minutes\\" for three months after suggesting that blacks were less intelligent because they \\"watered down their genes.\\" Previously he had offended homosexuals by commenting that gay sex led to premature deaths.  But ratings slid, and he returned after only one month.  Feb. 10  He Learned It in Kindergarten : The best-selling pop homilist Robert (\\"Everything He Needs to Know\\") Fulghum leads the Minneapolis Chamber Symphony in Beethoven's Ninth, even though he can't read music.  Feb. 16  Less Is More: The Guggenheim Museum acquires a collection of more than 300 mostly Minimalist works from the 60's and 70's, some of them no more than plans on paper, for a price believed to be around $30 million. To foot the bill, it sold major paintings by Modigliani, Kandinsky and Chagall.  Feb. 25  Die, Yuppie Scum: A new bad guy emerges in such films as \\"Blue Steel,\\" \\"Bad Influence\\" and what would be the year's biggest hit, \\"Ghost\\": Yuppa, the young, urban professional assassin. MARCH  March 2  Maestro Dearest: The conductor Zubin Mehta upbraids the audience at a New York Philharmonic concert for coughing and generally making too much noise. March 4  Get Thee Behind Me, Ozzy Osbourne: John Cardinal O'Connor, preaching the Gospel about Satan's tempting Jesus in the desert, cites reports of growing Satanic cult activity among youth and the impact of satanic imagery in rock.  March 5  He Knew It When He Saw It: Congressional hearings begin on whether to keep the National Endowment for the Arts in business. Senator Jesse Helms, reacting to an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit photographs, seeks tough controls on Federally financed art.  March 16  Meanwhile, Back at the Lambada: Two movies about the exotic dance are released: \\"Lambada!\\" (math teacher by day, dancer by night) and \\"The Forbidden Dance\\" (an Amazon Indian princess goes to Los Angeles to save the rain forest and becomes a lambadan).  March 18  The Bad News: Twelve works assessed at more than $200 million are stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston by thieves dressed as police officers. March 19  The Worse News: They weren't insured.  March 21  Purple Haze: Kathleen Turner takes on Maggie in the Broadway production of \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,\\" performing the first act in a lavender slip (lined) instead of the de rigueur white.  March 25  But There May Be a Part in the Movie 'Cats': New York's party set, including Nan Kempner, Glenn Bernbaum and Jerry Zipkin, show up for Brian De Palma's auditions to play social X-tras in the film \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities.\\" Many are called back, few are chosen.  APRIL  April 7  Sin-cinnati: The infamous Mapplethorpe exhibition opens in Cincinnati: protesters on both sides rally, and thousands line up for tickets. The Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie, are later indicted on obscenity charges. April 8  A Damn Big Piece of the Pie: \\"Twin Peaks\\" has its premiere and scores record ratings for ABC when the series moves to its regular Thursday night time slot. \\"Peaks\\" fever begins.

April 15  Alone, at Last: Garbo dies. April 25  And the Wall Came Tumbling Up: Part of the Berlin Wall is reconstructed for Roger Waters's performance of the Pink Floyd rock opera \\"The Wall.\\" April 26  But She Got to Keep Her Ears: Darlene Gillespie, an original Mouseketeer, sues Disney, charging that she was cheated out of royalties from \\"The Mickey Mouse Club.\\"  A Much Smaller Piece of the Pie: \\"Twin Peaks\\" producers say Laura Palmer's killer won't be revealed this season. By now the series has lost 30 percent of its original audience. April 28  The Zing Cycle: A few moments before the end of \\"Gotterdammerung\\" at the Metropolitan Opera House, a beam from the scenery strikes Hildegard Behrens on the head and knocks her flat, and out of the remaining performances.  April 30  The Video Thing: Barbara Bush says \\"America's Funniest Home Videos\\" is the First Couple's favorite TV show.  MAY  May 7  No Dice: Nora Dunn of \\"Saturday Night Live\\" refuses to participate in this week's show, claiming that the comedy act of the guest host, Andrew Dice Clay, is degrading and repulsive. Sinead O'Connor, the scheduled musical guest, bows out too. May 10  No Kidding: Andrew Dice Clay describes himself as \\"the most vulgar, vicious comic ever to walk the face of the earth.\\"  May 11  Long Time Coming: \\"Longtime Companion,\\" the first mainstream movie about AIDS, is released.

May 15  A Yen for Art: Van Gogh's \\"Portrait of Dr. Gachet\\" is bought by the Japanese industrialist Ryoei Saito for a record $82.5 million. Two days later, Mr. Saito buys Renoir's \\"At the Moulin de la Galette\\" for $78.1 million.  May 20  Rude at Heart: David Lynch's twisted road movie \\"Wild at Heart\\" wins the Golden Palm at Cannes. French audiences boo.  Send in the Paddles: Madonna's album \\"I'm Breathless\\" from the movie \\"Dick Tracy\\" is released; it includes three songs by Stephen Sondheim and one (by Madonna) about the joys of being spanked.  May 21  Agent Cooper Gets Reassigned: ABC announces that it will move \\"Twin Peaks\\" to Saturday night at 10, the least-watched prime-time hour of the week. Mark Frost says he and his co-creator David Lynch withheld the identity of Laura Palmer's murderer to keep the show alive. May 30  Watch It, Dude: Fox reveals plans to pit Bart (\\"Underachiever and Proud of It, Man\\") Simpson, America's favorite animated antihero, against NBC's mighty Bill Cosby on Thursday nights. JUNE June 7  Mourning Glory: The Metropolitan Museum drapes paintings in black in response to Congressional efforts to restrict National Endowment-sponsored artists.  Too Live Crude: Federal Judge Jose Gonzalez finds the 2 Live Crew's album \\"Nasty as They Wanna Be\\" obscene; record stores across south Florida withdraw the album, and Sheriff Nick Navarro threatens to arrest anyone selling it.

Beauty to Beast: Nyah-Nyah: The slip worn by Kathleen Turner in \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\" goes for $1,200 at a charity auction; the mask worn by Michael Crawford in \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" fetches only $375. June 29  Just Rope 'em, Tie 'em, Brand 'em: KRVN, a Nebraska radio station in the middle of cattle country, bans records by the country singer K. D. Lang because she appeared in an anti-carnivore commercial with a cow and announced, \\"Meat stinks.\\" JULY  July 4  Merci for the Clarification: France's society of composers rules that the song \\"Lambada\\" is Bolivian, not Brazilian, as was originally thought.

July 21  In the Movie, He'll Be Played by Don Knotts: Sheriff Navarro says the 2 Live Crew situation is a nuisance that has kept him from other important matters. July 22  Lady Godiva: Karen Finley, the performance artist who was denied an arts endowment grant, receives a standing ovation at Lincoln Center for \\"We Keep Our Victims Ready,\\" in which she strips and smears chocolate on her body.  July 25  The Fat Lady Sings: Roseanne Barr screeches through the national anthem, spits and scratches herself at a San Diego Padres game. America cries foul. July 31  Tseirp Saduj: In court over a lawsuit filed by the parents of two teenagers who shot themselves after listening to heavy-metal music, Judas Priest's lead singer, Ron Halford, testifies that he once recorded a phrase backward.

AUGUST  Aug. 8  The Pryce Is Wrong: Actors' Equity forbids the English actor Jonathan Pryce from appearing on Broadway in the role of the Eurasian he created in London in \\"Miss Saigon\\" and urges that an Asian be cast. Cameron Mackintosh cancels the Broadway run despite a record advance sale of $25 million. Aug. 16  David Lynch Is Different From You and Me: (He Makes More Money.) David Lynch directs a batch of commercials for Calvin Klein's Obsession perfume based on snippets of stories by, among others, Hemingway and Fitzgerald.

Aug. 18  Satisfaction: The Rolling Stones play Prague because President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia wants to meet Mick Jagger. Aug. 21  Play Misty for Me: The payola trial of the record promoter Joseph Isgro begins; he had been indicted on 57 counts of illicit and illegal payments to radio stations for playing certain records. (A judge later dismissed the charges.)

Aug. 22  Couch Potato Chips: A study by the University of Minnesota School of Public Health found that food was referred to an average of five times every half hour during prime time -- not including commercials -- in 1988; more than 60 percent of references were for nutrition-free foods, and 72 percent of all food eaten on the shows was consumed between meals.

Nov. 26  No Sex Please, We're Skittish: MTV decides that Madonna's video \\"Justify My Love\\" is too racy to broadcast.

By late in the day, prices of long- term Treasury and tax-exempt bonds were lower by about 3/4 point. Over the last two days, Treasury issues have fallen about 1 1/2 points, and are more than 2 1/2 points below the peak prices set early last week.    Amid falling bond prices, traders and investors are spending less time discussing the chances that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy and foster lower interest rates. Increasingly, they are concerned about the size of Treasury borrowings needed to finance Federal budget deficits. Those borrowings were readily absorbed during the summer and autumn, because the Federal Reserve was easing monetary policy, and promoting lower short-term interest rates. But without further Fed easing, they warned that long-term bond yields are unlikely to continue falling in the near future.

Treasury bill rates ended the day with slight increases, while note and bond yields fell slightly as prices rose as much as 1/4 point. A day earlier, Treasury bill rates rose as much as a quarter percentage point and bond prices fell about two points as a large drop in the dollar led to heavy selling by traders and speculators. CREDIT MARKETS","excerpt":"Note and Bond Prices Gain"},{"year":"1985","title":"Treasury note and bond prices fluctuated widely yesterday before closing with slightly higher prices for bond issues due in 20 years or more, but slightly lower prices for issues due in 10 years or less.     Specialists in the Government securities market offered varying assesments of the day's activity, with some firms reporting good demand from investors who were willing to buy bonds and extend the maturity of their holdings, while other firms said most of the buying was by traders and other speculators.    The rapid drop in prices during the last two hours of trading seemed to reinforce the view that much of the recent improvement was due to purchases of traders who are quick to sell their holdings when they can earn a profit. By late in the day, the 11 1/4 percent Treasury issue due in 2015 was offered at 97 1/2, up about 3/8 point, to yield 11.54 percent.

By late in the day, the 11 3/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2014 were offered at 103 21/32, up 10/32, to yield 11.31 percent.

In addition to assuring credit market participants that the Federal Reserve had decided not to significantly tighten monetary policy in the last month, Mr. Volcker's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee painted a rosy picture of the economic future with continued low inflation and economic growth at a slower, more sustainable pace.    Although many investors continue to expect rates to move upward later this year, the immediate reaction of traders to Mr. Volcker's comments was to raise prices and lower yields for notes and bonds. Government securities dealers said the sharp price gains were largely the result of speculative buying, with only modest buying yesterday by investor accounts.
