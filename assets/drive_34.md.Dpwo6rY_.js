He would be miserable at \\"That's Entertainment!,\\" a tour of M-G-M musicals from 1929 to 1958‚Äîbut those who don't share his phobia will hugely enjoy this movie. Written, produced and directed by Jack Haley Jr., it opened yesterday at the Ziegfeld.The pleasures are abundant: Gene Kelly squelching sublimely through puddles in \\"Singin' in the Rain\\"; Judy Garland singing \\"Get Happy\\" over a series of clips of her faces at all ages‚Äîthe result is a joyful obituary; Donald O'Connor dancing on his knees; Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell in a breath-stopping duet from \\"Broadway Melody of 1940.\\" Glimpses of Mr. Kelly, springing about on the scaffolding of a half-constructed building, and Mr. Astaire, dancing with a hat rack, distill the contrasting styles of both great hoofers.Mr. Kelly's acrobatic talents make you aware of the exertion as much as the dexterity: what he does is triumphantly difficult, and we know that almost no one else could leap so smartly from one spot to another. But, as many have noted, Mr. Astaire makes every step look easy: as he soars and swoops and glides, infinite spectators feel that they could do exactly the same.Some of the musicals of the early thirties were creaky because dramatic actors were suddenly pushed into a medium that didn't suit them. In \\"Idiot's Delight,\\" Clark Gable dances and sings abominably, and Joan Crawford‚Äîone rigid finger laid against her cheek ‚Äî prances like a lumberjack. The movie's funniest moment may be the apotheosis of Esther Williams in the early fifties: climactic scenes of that brawny Venus sinking into or rising from the water appear to mock the imagery of the Aquarian age.

Meanwhile, most of the numbers‚Äîfrom Jimmy Durante coaching the young Frank Sinatra in \\"It Happened in Brooklyn\\" to Leslie Caron drifting in and out of Mr. Kelly's grasp ‚Äî run long enough so that you can re-experience the original.

Except for a few property kangaroos and ostriches \\"Captain Fury\\" is an amusingly old-fashioned Western melodrama, with the crooks and our side alternately getting the drop on each other, and with all the good-hearted outlaws finally being either married off or paternally pardoned by the territorial Governor.Most charming of the outlaws, of course is Brian Aherne, who is snatched from the very noose into the arms of probably the happiest ending in the history of the Australian Commonwealth, including, as it does, the soft smiles of Miss Lang, our favorite Pioneer Woman. In those days of muzzle-loading pistols, it seems, convicts from the British Isles were subjected to the barbarous practice of being farmed out as slaves of the big sheep-raisers, such men as the infamous George Zucco, with his whipping posts, his barred cells and his bread and water diets. Zucco considered himself the law around those parts and he just about was till Mr. Aherne, an Irish political prisoner, showed up in one of the convict shipments. Then, pardner, the fur began to fly.Brian's first achievement is to win the respect of Victor McLaglen, the prison camp bully, by standing up to him in a fight","excerpt":"his second, to escape when threatened with the whip; his third, to engineer the release of a few picked men to function as a vigilante band, to protect the poor settlers of the range country against Zucco's gangsters. The rest seems to be a matter of curious resemblances: Mr. Zucco's haunting resemblance to Douglas Dumbrille, his foreman; Mr. McLaglen's and Miss Lang's on the whole delightful resemblance to themselves; the picture's remarkable resemblance to any and all other picaresque screen melodramas since the dawn of the cinema. No resemblance whatever to life, of course.

Now in his 70's, Trevor chisels yet another fiction that blends national and private heartache. This novel, spanning the history of Irish independence, tells of a tragic misunderstanding that dooms a 9-year-old girl to a life of solitary vigil after her parents, believing her dead, flee County Cork. ''There is no quieter narrative voice than Trevor's impersonal but irreducible one, and none that so demands a reader's strict attention,'' Thomas Mallon said here in 2002.    THE DEMON IN THE FREEZER: A True Story, by Richard Preston. (Ballantine, $7.99.) The author of ''The Hot Zone,'' the 1994 best-selling account of a barely averted disaster involving imported Ebola virus, considers another possible microbial nightmare: a bioterrorist attack with the smallpox virus. By mixing ''terror, technology and trivia, he has probably done more than any other writer to establish a nationwide imperative to think about infectious agents as global threats and potential weapons,'' Harold Varmus wrote here in 2002.    JULY, JULY, by Tim O'Brien. (Penguin, $14.) The 30th anniversary reunion of a Minnesota college's class of 1969 provides a stage for this novel's large cast of baby boomers to hold forth on busted dreams, lost chances and their long, strange trip from the glory days of the 1960's. Last year our reviewer, David Gates, was generally unimpressed but said, ''O'Brien comes as close to any American fiction writer to having a lock on this decade and its survivors.''    OFF TO THE SIDE: A Memoir, by Jim Harrison. (Grove, $14.) An accomplished writer celebrates a lifetime of living large, whether it's fishing, hunting, drinking or feasting for five hours with Orson Welles. He also finds room to discuss his creative ups and downs, including his 20-year dalliance with Hollywood. The result is ''a sprawling, impressionistic memoir as roundabout as one of the author's famous road trips,'' Bruce Barcott wrote in these pages in 2002.    NOBODY'S PERFECT: Writings From The New Yorker, by Anthony Lane. (Vintage, $16.95.) Good lines and clever wit abound in this collection of critical essays on movies, books and other topics as varied as Lego and the art of the obituary. Last year our reviewer, Laura Miller, said, ''Lane writes prose the way Fred Astaire danced","excerpt":"his sentences and paragraphs are a sublime, rhythmic concoction of glide and snap, lightness and sting.''    I HATE TO SEE THAT EVENING SUN GO DOWN: Collected Stories, by William Gay. (Free Press, $13.) Set amid the rough-hewn inhabitants of rural Tennessee, these tales often turn on acts of violence, committed casually but with an Old Testament rationale. ''Gay is richly gifted: a seemingly effortless storyteller, a writer of prose that's fiercely wrought, pungent in detail, yet poetic in the most welcome sense,'' Daniel Woodrell said here in 2002.    THE CAVE, by Jos&#233; Saramago. (Harvest/ Harcourt, $14.) This allegorical novel takes its title from Plato's cave, where shadows constitute reality for those imprisoned within. Saramago sets his story in an immense office building, shopping mall and condominium called the Center, where his characters sacrifice their values and humanity to the caprices of market economics. ''His target is not simply the apparent aim of global capitalism to shape communities into homogenized . . . units,'' Jonathan Keates wrote here in 2002. ''The book turns its heat equally on our willingness to collude with this reductive tyranny.''    REMARKABLE TREES OF THE WORLD. Text and photographs by Thomas Pakenham. (Norton, $27.95.) A British historian showcases 60 of the world's most ancient, bizarre and otherwise celebrated trees, from El Arbol, a massive Montezuma cypress in Mexico, to the ancient Bo tree in Sri Lanka, revered by Buddhists since the second century B.C. ''The sense of these trees' tenacity and adaptability is the lingering gift of this astonishing collection,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The Times in 2002.    HOLD THE ENLIGHTENMENT, by Tim Cahill. (Vintage Departures, $14.) Among the life-threatening situations in this collection of travel essays is the author's trip to southeastern Turkey, where his search for the Caspian tiger is complicated by fears of being caught in the crossfire of the region's Kurdish insurrection. ''Cahill captures these and other dramas with . . . self-deprecating humor and insight,'' John D. Thomas wrote here earlier this year.

But a viewer sometimes feels a disturbingly simple soapopera effect despite the film's evident serious intentions.The author summarized his case history on the first page of his book by indicating that it dealt with a rich, respectable esthete who abandons his wife and family for an unloving, grasping mistress and whose life ends in disaster.That skeleton was fleshed out carefully, of course, in the novel. Tony Richardson, director of the movie, his scenarist, and a largely capable cast succeed only fitfully in delving into their principals' characters to solve the mysteries of love, sexuality and the perversity of behavior.But perhaps time and setting are to blame. The author's tormented hero and his circle were Germans of the nineteen-twenties, when the shocks of such goings-on might have been more dramatic than they are today. Richardson's current English and French protagonists are not ordinary supermarket citizens, either. As high-born and low-born society and swinger types they may be unusual, but one is not often convinced that their behavior is movingly real.One can understand that Nicol Williamson, as the wealthy London art dealer leading a boringly placid life with his cool, haughty wife, their young daughter, his country-squire brother-in-law and the effete art crowd, suddenly would be drawn to the enticements of Anna Karina, a luscious movie usherette, with her promise of amour.But, despite his blurted admission that this is his first love, it becomes increasingly difficult to appreciate his meek acceptance of her systematic conniving and her destruction of his life and fortune, an acceptance that continues even after he is made aware of her simultaneous tawdry affair with a designing, handsome. French lover (played unctuously and brutally by Jean-Claude Drouot). Perhaps there is some somber symbolism in our haples hero's being blinded in an auto accident after he first learns of the affair.But even in the desiccation of character one responds to the rising nobility of the hapless man as he senses his mistress's infidelity and proceeds to deal with her and her lover in his own, if blinded way.Mr. Williamson's sensitive delineation is largely restrained, but he matches that reserve with bursts of passion and despair that makes him a touchingly pitiable human being whose frailties are clearly projected.Miss Karina, beautifully seductive in explicit scenes in and out of several beds, makes a striking schemer whose lusts for money and her lover are properly rudimentary. And she makes it hard to understand why Mr. Williamson cannot fathom what is obvious to a moviegoer.Sian Phillips (Mrs. Peter O'Toole) is glacially patrician as Mr. Williamson's wife and mother of Amelia, played by Kate O'Toole, her actual daughter.

Almost overnight he would become the most celebrated black author in history","excerpt":"his slender volume supplanted a book of verses by the 18th-century slave poet Phillis Wheatley as the abolitionists' favorite emblem of black eloquence and intelligence. By the time Douglass died, 100 years ago this past February, he had long been accustomed to being the most famous Negro in the world. Years before, he had been dubbed \\"the representative colored man of the United States\\" -- a title that surely implied a confinement as well as a coronation, but that he wore proudly. The former slave, in so many ways the least representative of men, had become a great orator, abolitionist and -- in a phrase much in favor these days -- the first black \\"public intellectual.\\"\\n\\nLionized in the 19th century, Douglass has been canonized in the 20th. The bibliography of the Modern Language Association bulges with critical treatises on his prose, and the centenary of his death has been marked by conferences and symposiums in his honor. Almost every aspect of his life has been laboriously interpreted and reinterpreted. We have been reintroduced to Douglass the slave, who painstakingly \\"stole\\" the secrets of literacy and who daringly made his escape in 1838 on the eastern shore of Maryland, by train and boat, disguised as a sailor; Douglass the statesman -- he was appointed marshal for the District of Columbia by Rutherford B. Hayes in 1877, and minister and consul general to Haiti by Benjamin Harrison in 1889; Douglass the newspaper publisher -- he founded the newspaper North Star in Rochester in 1847, and remained in some measure a newspaperman until 1874.

Playbill Incorporated mourns the loss of Russell Cannizzaro, our beloved Secretary and Treasurer who died on Wednesday at the South Nassau Community Hospital after a short battle with cancer. He was 73 and lived in Baldwin, L.I. with his wife Trudy. Mr. Cannizzaro joined Playbill in June 1944 as an assistant bookkeeper, and enjoyed explaining that when he began his career, the accountants were still wearing garters on their sleeves and making their ledger entries with feathered pens. At the time of his death, he was still an integral part of the Playbill family and was as adept at using modern computer programs as those half his age. Mr. Cannizzaro worked with various Playbill publishers throughout his career, and in 1973 he helped form Playbill Incorporated, which became the leading theatrical publication in the country. Arthur Birsh, Chairman of Playbill, friend and co-worker with Mr. Cannizzaro for more than 40 years, said, ''I have lost a dear friend. Russ was truly a great man. His impact on the Playbill we know today was profound, and he will be missed not only for his unending conscientiousness and devotion to Playbill, but also for his great spirit and joy he brought to everyone who knew him.'' Mr. Cannizzaro's accounting staff refer to him as a ''true gentleman,'' ''an unfailing rock of support,'' ''a devoted husband, father and son'' and note his ''kindness'' and ''affection for his family and friends.'' An avid gardener, Mr. Cannizzaro often brought in bags of cherry tomatoes and zucchini to share with his co-workers.

Just be sure you have my tie right.\\" The comment is emblematic of Joyce. JOYCE IMAGES (Norton, $39.95), a book of photographs and drawings edited by Greg Vitello, whose previous books include \\"Twenty Years of Masterpiece Theater,\\" reaffirms the face of the family man who was one incarnation of James Joyce (1882-1941) -- but the heart of the radical artist who saw life so intensely eludes this collection. Despite an excellent essay by Anthony Burgess on Joyce's life and work, completed shortly before Burgess's death in 1993, \\"Joyce Images\\" oddly reaffirms the limitations of the visual record. Five photographs of Joyce by Josef Breitenbach, published for the first time, take their place beside well-known portraits by Man Ray, Berenice Abbott, Gisele Freund and Augustus John. One wishes for more text. The famous photograph of four generations of Joyces -- James","excerpt":"his son, Giorgio; and his grandson, Stephen, seated beneath Tuohy's portrait of Joyce's own father -- has a deeper significance if we know that Joyce considered a father \\"a necessary evil.\\" Photographs of Joyce's daughter, Lucia, show an enigmatic, and lovely, young woman. She was ultimately lost to schizophrenia and confinement in mental hospitals, and Joyce believed it was she who had inherited his genius. Her brilliantly rendered drawing of her father is especially poignant because it demonstrates such fine control. The family record is brought more happily up to date with a photograph of the writer's only living descendant, Stephen Joyce. He is pictured with his wife, Solange Raytchine Joyce, who wears the \\"Love is unhappy when love is away\\" necklace that Joyce had made for Nora Barnacle in 1909. Recent drawings by Robert Motherwell and David Levine attest to the continuing fascination with Joyce. The admiration and reverence of other writers is documented by F. Scott Fitzgerald's whimsical cartoon of Joyce at a dinner party in 1928 and by one of the book's closing photographs, of Ezra Pound's visit to Joyce's grave site in Zurich shortly before Pound's own death in 1972. The homage paid by one great writer to another is a fitting image with which to end a book about a man who is ultimately accessible only through his own words.\\nJOELLE ZOIS IN SHORT: NONFICTION;\\nPortraits of the Artist"},{"year":"1972","title":"article by Rev R J Pontier on water fast, begun Aug 6 by 11 prisoners in Danbury, Conn, Fed Correctional Institution to protest US mil action in Vietnam","excerpt":"his son, Glenn, one of the fasters, was jailed for refusal to cooperate with war or draft; Pontier tells of feelings about his son's protest; hopes action of fasters will spur action by others to hasten end of war; cartoon A Fast Continues"},{"year":"2000","title":"LITTLE-Wm.

The Trustees, staff, and Fellows of The New York Academy of Medicine record with deep sorrow the death of Dr. Martin Cherkasky, a long time Fellow of the Academy and former Chairman of the Board of Trustees. Elected to Fellowship in 1952, Dr. Cherkasky's active interest in the affairs of the Academy led him to a central role in its reorganization and revivification. The vision driving that commitment was the same vision that underlay his remarkable stewardship of Montefiore Hospital. He believed passionately that medicine and its institutions have profound social responsibilities. And that these should be expressed prominently in their programs and in their future planning. A tireless champion of a single class of health care, he urged both the public and private sectors to join in moving the health care system toward that objective.

He cared deeply for the underprivileged and strongly advocated-through both words and deeds-for a health care system that provides equal access to high quality health care services for all New Yorkers. Insightful, charismatic, and keenly intelligent, he was greatly admired by his colleagues, and received many awards, including the 1994 GNYHA Lifetime Achievement Award.

The transformation took a year and a half, and now, one morning each week, he sits in a room of similar cases. The windowless room is plain, with a blue industrial carpet, a circle of brown cushioned office chairs, a blackboard, a pair of unused conference tables pushed to the rear wall and a faint hum from the air ducts. To reach it from the waiting area -- on the second floor of a probation building in Connecticut -- Roy and the other men walk down a series of corridors and around a series of turns that feel like a path through a maze. The room is wedged in a back corner. ''No one,'' a probation officer said, ''likes to think about what's back there.''    Roy wonders constantly how he wound up in this place, in the circle of 10 or 12 chairs, a circle of child molesters. His story begins on the beach and ends on the Internet. It seems to him that he was, only recently, a normal man, about 40, running a crew of technicians, repairing elaborate, computerized telecommunications equipment for Wall Street trading firms and in his off hours leading a wedding band, singing Frank Sinatra and Barry White at the Plaza. For a hobby, he flew kites -- kites bigger than most living rooms, brilliantly striped, with rippling streamers and ''space socks'' trailing more than a hundred feet behind, kites that could perform ballets when he held the lines. He recalls no history of longing for young girls. He had no criminal record of any kind. But then one summer, on vacation, his second wife pointed out her 11-year-old daughter's body.

In other words, he is precisely what one would expect of the soon-to-be chairman and chief executive of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. The hugely profitable New York-based company is on a steady course and hardly in need of a high-flyer at the controls. It is also the epitome of financial conservatism, which is perhaps appropriate, given that the 143- year-old company made its name - and still makes much of its money - by judging the financial health of some six million other companies.   The ascension of ''Charlie'' Moritz (accent on the first syllable) to Dun & Bradstreet's top spot is set for Jan. 1, when Harrington ''Duke'' Drake, 65, retires.

What a change in the bankers' image: from heartless oppressors, vilified in American literature and film, to bumbling spendthrifts and lenders to hopeless causes. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady presented a plan on Tuesday for the first overhaul of the banking system since the Depression. While the laws have remained fixed, the banking world has changed. Foreign banks, once cowed by their American rivals, now account for 29 of the 30 largest in the world. Markets as small as a city or state, once dependable, now are too limited and volatile for consistent profits. Restrictions on underwriting securities and a ban on bank ownership by other industries, once essential limits on banks' influence and risk, now are accelerating their decline. Congressional opposition to several features of the plan is inevitable. Many lawmakers come from states that have restricted the ability of banks to branch out even across county lines. But as Federal officials scramble to bail out the bank insurance fund and loosen bank credit, they recognize that the financing of the nation's businesses and consumers is at stake. Stripping the F.D.I.C. of Power  If you can't hit the soldier, shoot at his horse: the Administration's proposed banking laws would strip L. William Seidman's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of its regulatory powers. The plan would split the F.D.I.C.'s authority over banks between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, leaving Mr. Seidman to meekly watch over his dwindling bank insurance fund. Fast as a House Budget Committee microphone could be switched on, he was ready to denounce the plan as \\"an invitation to regulatory civil war.\\" In a skirmish last year, the Bush Administration tried to topple Mr. Seidman from his post","excerpt":"his term runs until October.   An Optimistic Budget  The din of war and the plaints of recession echo only faintly through the 1992 Bush budget. The $1.45 billion budget he submitted to Congress on Monday counts on an end to the recession by mid-year and allied aid so generous that the Persian Gulf war will cost the nation only $12.8 billion. Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the Administration will probably have to ask for more war money in a few months.  The President, painted by the Democrats as the protector of the undeserving rich, hopes to maneuver them into defending some breaks for the wealthy. He wants to limit subsidies to the rich for agriculture, Medicare, school lunches and student aid -- programs dear to many Democratic politicians.  Productivity Gains - at a Cost  If American factories have truly become more efficient, why all the dismal, shuttered Youngstowns and Flints? The Commerce Department said last week that manufacturing productivity climbed at a record 3.6 percent annual rate in the 1980's, matching trading partners' gains. A service economy it may be, but as productivity among white-collar workers stagnates, manufacturing accounts for an increasing, 23.3 percent share of the nation's output. But the decade's improvements in plant efficiency have come with the loss of two million jobs. Industries like textiles have reversed their fortunes by automating, but far lower employment is the result. Nobody would comfort a small, failing farmer by saying that the success of the vast, mechanized spread next-door was all for the good. Manufacturing productivity likewise comes at a cost.  California Runs Dry  You farm where there's no rain from April through November, build cities hundreds of miles from the needed water supplies, and sooner or later you're going to run dry. After five years of drought, California's state water project has cut off supplies to Central Valley farmers. Rationing is already the rule in southern California. Several economists estimate that losses to the state's farmers, food processors and factories that depend on inexpensive water will reach $3 billion. This in the nation's most populous and agriculturally productive state.  A Whole New Computer Game  A powerful group of companies aims to redesign the personal computer from the chip up. Microsoft, Compaq and Digital are nearing an agreement to produce computers and software based on chips designed by MIPS Computer Systems. The group's main targets appear to be International Business Machines and Apple, which have their own personal computer standards, and Sun Microsystems, which makes competing chips.   COMPANIES    Bitter Medicine at G.M.  While stock market investors rejoiced at the anticipated return of flush times, General Motors prepared for a long recession. The company announced reductions in capital spending and white-collar staffing last week, and cut its dividend almost in half, the first cut in more than a decade. Scott F. Merlis, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, blessed the actions as \\"creative destruction,\\" explaining, \\"Excesses will be purged. You're going to end up with a much more efficient industry.\\" Next to cut their dividends, say many analysts, are Chrysler and Ford. The day after G.M. imposed new economies, sales figures demonstrated that consumers are economizing, too. Sales of vehicles made in America dropped 31.5 percent during Jan. 21 to 31 from the same period last year.  Chrysler's Accounting Gain  Chrysler managed to recover in the accounting offices what it lost in the factories and showrooms. The company eked out a $31 million profit in the fourth quarter on a bookkeeping change, as expected losses for plant closings and layoffs were reduced. But borrowing will not be among the costs that auto makers like Chrysler can easily cut. Standard & Poor's reduced the credit ratings of all of auto's Big Three, tossing Chrysler into a category reserved for \\"junk bonds.\\"  An Energy (Production) Policy  The White House wants to rely on increased production more than reduced consumption to slake the nation's thirst for imported fuels. A draft of its new energy policy includes tax breaks and deregulation to increase production of coal, oil and natural gas. Many obstacles that have halted construction of nuclear power plants would be removed.  Sony Wants Orion Pictures  Orion needs a sugar daddy, and Sony stands ready to fill the role.  Sony, which already owns the Columbia studio, wants to buy Orion Pictures as well. For perhaps $500 million, Sony could acquire the rights to Woody Allen's neuroses and probably Kevin Costner's sensitive machismo. Several elaborately produced flops (anyone see \\"Valmont\\"?) have left Orion with low earnings and high debts. John Werner Kluge's 70 percent stake in Orion is only a sliver of his multi-billion-dollar investment portfolio. When Orion ran short of money to complete \\"Mermaids,\\" starring Cher, last fall, Mr. Kluge kicked in $23 million. Now, he seems willing to let someone else provide the sugar.  McCabe Looks to Fill His Ark  The first product any advertising professional must promote is himself. In this sense, Ed (It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken) McCabe is off to a grand start. Comparing his opening of a new agency last week to the Second Coming would have been too obvious. Instead, in full-page newspaper ads, he settled for posing as Noah, at an agency deluged with job-seekers, vendors and potential clients all trying to clamber aboard his ark. Only two accounts are on board so far.    INTERNATIONAL    Japan's Designer Scouts  More than 300,000 Japanese beaver scouts, cub scouts, boy scouts, senior scouts and troop leaders can confidently dress in gentrified, all-natural fibers, courtesy of Ralph Lauren. At the urging of Akio Morita, the former chief executive of Sony, Mr. Lauren designed new uniforms for everyone.  \\"Just a gesture of goodwill,\\" with no profits to the designer, said Peter Strom, vice chairman of the Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation. The colorations include an earthy khaki with forest green trim, olive with red and royal blue with gold. Plenty of pleats, plackets and pockets to set a rugged but refined tone; no pony insignia, though. American styles are far more popular in Japan than American cars. In an agreement with the Seibu chain, Ralph Lauren sells his other fashions at 11 free-standing shops and the nation's major retailers, with revenues of $700 million a year. Uniform sales have been strong since his designs came out late last year.Next, the scouts will want Philip Johnson to design their tents.   Outfoxing the Supply Lines  Just as some Soviets are trying to learn American ways of business, Americans are learning the Soviet ways. An undersand economy has flourished among the troops in Saudi Arabia. Same problem as in Russia: plenty of goods, but a clogged distribution system. Written requisitions, the currency of military supply, have plummeted in value as piles of unfilled orders accumulate. The best-stocked units boast supply officers who are the most conniving. They think nothing of stockpiling camouflage fatigues to swap for some help from forklift operators, or jumping into empty trucks and simply driving them away. \\"Most people go to prison for this,\\" said one sergeant. \\"I get promoted.\\"   BUSINESS DIARY/February 3-8"},{"year":"1937","title":"Comment on N Y Stock and Curb Exch specialist rules issued as part of broker-dealer segregation program SEC MAY REQUEST LANDIS TO TARRY","excerpt":"His Term Will Expire on June 6, but Many Problems Call for Expert Decisions; NO WORD ON SUCCESSOR; Quick Action by White House, However, Expected--Legisla- tive Moves Also Looked For"},{"year":"1933","title":"Means and Whitaker get 2 yrs each MEANS GETS 2 YEARS FOR M'LEAN PLOT","excerpt":"His Term Will Probably Ran Concurrently With His Previous Sentence."},{"year":"1929","title":"Officials meet Vance's demand for $25,000 $25,000 FOR VANCE","excerpt":"HIS TERMS ARE MET; Robins' Directors Surrender to Hurling Ace's Demand--He Is Ordered to Report.

Commissioned as a colonel in the Air Force, he was decorated with a Distinguished Service Medal and was made a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his wartime service. After the war, Mr. Dyson worked for several national corporations before beginning his own company in 1954. That year he bought his first company with $10,000 of his own money and $5 million borrowed from a bank. Mr. Dyson became known as a pioneer in the field of leveraged buyouts. The Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corporation's manufacturing and industrial businesses currently generate annual sales of close to $600 million. In addition to Charles Dyson's many accomplishments in the business world, he was a noted philanthropist and community leader. He served as chairman of several boards of directors, including Pace Univeristy and the American Ballet Theater. The liberal arts school at Pace University is known as the Dyson College of Arts and Sciences, in recognition of Mr. Dyson's leadership and contributions to that institution. He lent his support and leadership to a long list of voluntary organizations and served as a trustee for many including Rockefeller University Council, Hospital for Special Surgery, White Plains Hospital, Common Cause, Center for Defense Information, Westchester County Medical Center, Greer Children's Services, New York Law School, and the Metropolitan Opera Association. Charles Dyson's commitment to philanthropy and the importance of the voluntary sector was lifelong. In addition to his personal philanthropy and that of his whole family, he and his late wife Margaret founded The Dyson Foundation in 1957. He later created The Dyson Charitable Fund as another adjunct to his family's charitable work. In recent years, major gifts were made by Mr. Dyson, and by the Dyson Foundation to many important institutions, including Pace University, Cornell University, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical College, Marist College, the American Ballet Theater, and the Metropolitan Opera. Charles H. Dyson was the widower of Margaret Macgregor Dyson to whom he was married in 1941. Margaret Dyson passed away in 1990.

It is called \\"While the Sun Shines\\" and, as a play, had a brief run on Broadway back in 1944. Terence Rattigan is the author, and he is a man who can write some very funny dialogue when the spirit moves him. Unfortunately his pen was only spasmodically inspired in composing this treatise on romantic misunderstandings.The principal characters in \\"While the Sun Shines\\" are a young Earl who is just a plain jack-tar in His Majesty's Navy","excerpt":"his titled fianc√©e, who has been demoted from sergeant to corporal in the W. A. A. F for having misplaced some important document; a breezy American entertainer; a meddlesome, romantic French youth; a worldly litle blonde and an impoverished duke.

The Earl takes the bad news quite casually‚Äîhe still has the blonde oh the string, you see‚Äîand Mr. Rattigan skillfully maneuvers the relationship of all concerned from that point through a series of complications aimed for both visual and oral amusement. The fun may not be consistent enough to add up to more than halting divertissement, but the author does come up with some cute tricks, including a scene where the three men in Lady Elisabeth's tangled love life shoot a game of craps to decide who will be first to propose to her.Ronald Howard is very likable as the Earl, Bonar Colleano Jr. is aggressive as the American, Brenda Bruce is bouncy as the blonde, Barbara White is attractive as Lady Elisabeth, Ronald Squire is dryly amusing as her perplexed father and Michael Allan is effusive as the Frenchman. Anatole de Grunwald joined Mr. Rattigan in writing the screenplay of \\"While the Sun Shines,\\" but he apparently was not able to help out very much when Mr. Rattigan, who was the sole author of the play, ran out of bright dialogue.

Outdoor clothes made for angling, deerstalking or bird watching -- pick your sport -- have become newly fashionable by virtue of . . . their virtue. What better antidote to the slick urbanity of men's wear in the 1980's than the earnest, undisguisedly functional sportswear of L. L. Bean or Willis & Geiger? As Kilton Andrew, a spokesman for L. L. Bean, suggests, the field-and-stream look may be rooted in a 90's need to \\"come back to the outdoorsy kind of hearty, rustic, active well for refreshment.\\"   Not for the first time, of course. The hale outdoorsman has been a masculine ideal since Allan Quartermain, H. Rider Haggard's fictional adventurer, first set out on safari in the late 19th century. The doughty, aristocratic Quartermain style, captured by Teddy Roosevelt, among others, has often been translated into red-hot fashion.   Ralph Lauren, who has been instrumental in this process, has adapted the style as leisure wear. In the view of this canny interpreter of the Zeitgeist, clothes are a statement of personal credo -- a credo that seems implicit in a recent Ralph Lauren ad campaign for his fall \\"Sportsman\\" line. In it, clear-eyed, square-jawed men and boys squint into the sunlight, wearing fishing vests and woodsman plaids that, like the men's expressions, seem to say \\"trust me.\\"   Credibility is the key here, says Burt Simm Avedon, president of Willis & Geiger, the one-time outfitter to Cornelius Vanderbilt and Ernest Hemingway. Staples like the poplin bush jacket and the 16-pocket fishing vest sell despite three- and four-digit price tags because they impress people who want \\"the real thing,\\" says Avedon. It is authenticity that many of the company's competitors have missed. \\"People who try to knock us off don't always understand us,\\" Avedon says. Which may be why they make silly mistakes like putting a leather patch on the elbow of a hunting jacket, instead of in the crook of the arm, where it might usefully cradle a rifle.   What Avedon doesn't say is that for most outdoor wear, such meticulous detail may be quite beside the point. It is made, after all, for the kind of man who will stalk wild game, pitch a tent or ride the rapids -- but only in his dreams.

She delves into the religious yearnings of a group of travelers, bound together by faith and family, who flee the pogroms and poverty of 19th-century Poland. Here the inner adventure is as striking as the landscape they navigate. Yitzhak, a gentle rabbi with mystical leanings and large visions, heads the group of migrants, which includes his wife, Chana, a woman of quiet piety whose practical bent balances her husband's loftiness","excerpt":"his twin sister, who is able to see his dreams; her husband, whose religious conviction is tested many times over; and a fiddler whose tunes take on American rhythms as they travel.

After a sojourn in St. Louis with some wealthy Jewish merchants whose ownership of slaves surprises them, they set out for Oregon, hoping for freedom and a better future in the western wilderness. Veltfort, who is the granddaughter of the psychoanalyst Otto Rank, tells this story in chapters from Chana's and Yitzhak's alternating perspectives.

He found love with the beautiful Jane Frederick and they spent more than 50 years together until her death in 2002. They enjoyed summer vacations in Mingo Springs, Maine and later traveled throughout the world learning about the cultures and histories of the places they visited, always making new friends wherever they went. Jules also found fulfillment in his passion for the law. His working class Brooklyn dream of being a mid-west country lawyer was interrupted by his mothers death. He returned home, transferring from the University of Missouri to Columbia University (obtaining scholarships at both). Upon graduation in 1936, he faced quotas, anti-Semitism and hard economic times. With the help of the renowned legal scholar Milton Handler, he found a job as an associate of Abe Pomerantz, a progressive-minded, Brooklyn-born trial lawyer. Jules and Abe were partners and friends until Abe's death in 1982. Together with Bill Haudek, Abe and Jules pioneered stockholder derivative, class action lawsuits and developed a renowned law practice at Pomerantz, Levy, Haudek & Block. Jules argued before the U.S. Supreme Court twice and treasured a note of apology from Justice Frankfurter. In addition to his law practice, Jules was proud of his 50 years of work on the Board of the University Settlement House on the Lower East Side. The Settlement honored him with its Distinguished Service Award in 1990. For recreation, Jules' lean, tall figure was often seen on tennis courts from mid - town Manhattan to Bronxville out to Great Neck and up to Maine. He also grew to take great pleasure in fine wine, good cheese, art and classical music. Jules will be remembered for his warmth, intellectual curiosity and reasoned approach to problems big and small, personal and political. His counsel was valued by clients, colleagues and friends.

In this Pulitzer Prize-winning study, a Washington Post columnist maintains that the Soviet concentration-camp system was equal to the Nazi killing machine, and supports Solzhenitsyn's assertion that the gulag was not a Stalinist aberration but an integral part of Lenin's Socialist dream. Drawing on memoirs and long-closed Soviet archives, she has produced an ''excellent, tautly written and very damning history,'' Steven Merritt Miner wrote in the Book Review in 2003.    ABANDON: A Romance, by Pico Iyer. (Vintage Contemporaries, $14.) John Macmillan, a student of Islamic mystical poetry, escapes England to embark on a spiritual journey that takes him to California, where he becomes involved with an elusive young woman, and then to Syria, Iran and other centers of the old Islamic world in search of a rare Sufi manuscript. The result is a ''wise and graceful novel,'' Pankaj Mishra said here last year.    LYRICS OF SUNSHINE AND SHADOW: The Courtship and Marriage of Paul Laurence Dunbar and Alice Ruth Moore, by Eleanor Alexander. (Plume, $15.) Dunbar, America's first major black poet, and Moore, a successful writer herself, corresponded for nearly two years before meeting. This account of their marriage in 1898 and its sad course (Dunbar was afflicted by alcoholism, bipolar disorder and the pressures of fame) offers ''much to think about in the moving story of two educated, sensitive, talented people, trying to find their way into the world and each other's lives,'' Paula J. Giddings wrote here in 2002.    PUBLIC PLACES: My Life in the Theater, With Peter O'Toole and Beyond, by Sian Phillips. (Faber & Faber, $15.) Refusing to dwell on regrets or paint herself as a victim, the versatile actress and wife of the charming but self-destructive actor best remembered for his role as Lawrence of Arabia recalls their tumultuous relationship and her encounters with Richard Burton and Samuel Beckett, among others. Her ''sparklingly cleareyed memoir'' is ''bracing, full-bodied and exceptionally incisive,'' Ben Brantley said here last year.    THE SONGS OF THE KINGS, by Barry Unsworth. (Norton, $13.95.) This modern retelling of Euripides' play ''Iphigenia in Aulis'' excels in its portrayal of the bivouacked Greek Army as it prepares to invade Troy, and features a scheming Odysseus. Though our reviewer, Neil Gordon, found the novel ''more admirable for its ideas than its emotional range,'' he praised Unsworth's ''almost magical capacity for literary time travel.''    STOLEN FIGS: And Other Adventures in Calabria, by Mark Rotella. (North Point, $14.) In writing about the dirt-poor, notoriously violent region in the southern foot of Italy where his family lived before coming to America, the author reflects on the difference between being Italian and being Italian-American. Last year in these pages, Michael Pye called this ''the product of persistent, gentle curiosity and persistently open eyes.''    BEST FRIENDS, by Thomas Berger. (Simon & Schuster, $12.) This novel by the author of ''Little Big Man'' revolves sinuously around a nasty triangle of love and betrayal whose participants include a rich, well-fed man","excerpt":"his ultrarich childhood buddy, committed to vintage cars and womanizing; and the former's wife, who fuels the mounting resentment between the men. Last year our reviewer, Richard Eder, called this ''a tautly drawn tragicomedy taking one more mythical swipe at contemporary life.''    BEAUTIFUL SHADOW: A Life of Patricia Highsmith, by Andrew Wilson. (Bloomsbury, $18.95.) Charting Highsmith's rapid literary rise and slow, grim decline, this biography reveals a secretive, unusual novelist of psychic conflict who preferred women sexually but men in all other ways. ''Wilson achieves the detachment required to document Highsmith's bizarre personal habits . . . while still appreciating the intellectual and emotional insights she had to give,'' Elise Harris said here last year.    THE MARRIAGE OF THE SEA, by Jane Allison. (Picador, $13.) The connections among love, illusion and fidelity are at the heart of this novel about eight disparate souls bouncing off one another in two highly romantic and romanticized cities: New Orleans and Venice. The result is an ''intricate, elegant'' tale, Margot Livesey wrote in these pages in 2003.

Right from the moment when Paolo (Giancarlo Giannini), then the barely adolescent scion of a Sicilian noble family, begins fooling around with the maid, his life becomes a hectic one. There are a tempestuous blonde, a rich Roman brunette with a lot of modern furniture, and a stern lady Communust who, rather inexplicably, wears black lace garters.There are the fresh-faced girl at the chemist's and the countess with the yelowish teeth. There is the pretty nurse at whom Paolo, always at the ready, makes a pass, even though the nurse is busy ministering to his dying father. There is even, very nearly, Paolo's unusually nubile Mama.The only problem is that \\"The Sensual Man\\" isn't a comedy, at least not intentionally. Instead, this is meant to be the long, sad story of Paolo's congenital inability to control his carnal passions (by way of an explanation, it seems it'sh ereditary","excerpt":"his uncle and grandfather were ladykillers, too). The tale culminates in Paolo's failure to stay married to the only woman he truly loves, a sweet young thing 20 years his junior, a creature so untainted that the very notion of sex makes her burst out crying.There isn't much of a lesson to be learned from \\"The Sensual Man,\\" and there isn't much to watch here, either. Marco Vicario's direction is stultifyingly banal; he favors dark rooms overdecorated with antique furniture, romantic strolls through the autumn leaves and swelling strings each time the billing and cooing begin.Giancarlo Giannini has played characters like Paolo too often to attack the role with much energy, even though he is this time confronted with an unusual difficulty. Even in 1974, when \\"The Sensual Man\\" was made in Italy, Mr. Giannini looked substantially older than the rapscalllion of 25 he is supposed, at least during the middle of the film, to be. As if that weren't bad enough, he also looks older than the actress who plays his mother.

He uses his Large Band, including horns, strings and backup singers, to add small touches of down-home Americana like gospel harmonies or a Western-swing fiddle solo; it's a virtuosic group that always defers to its leader. While Mr. Lovett always comes across as sympathetic and convincing, his songs leave it up to listeners to decide what's really going on. Sometimes his narrators are genuinely affectionate or heartbroken; sometimes they're the weirdos who appear in \\"Creeps Like Me.\\"    At Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday night, in the first of two shows, Mr. Lovett played a generous, leisurely concert, 2 hours and 40 minutes long. For its first part, he lavished attention on songs that weren't always worth it: material from his latest, and least, album, \\"I Love Everybody\\" (Curb/MCA). Mr. Lovett is at the highest plateau of his career so far, after building a dedicated following and then extending his name recognition by marrying the actress Julia Roberts. But to make \\"I Love Everybody,\\" he dipped into his archive of early songs, and many of them are juvenalia: clever and trivial, built on one-liners (\\"Penguins are so sensitive to my needs\\") or easy ironies. \\"Fat Babies,\\" Mr. Lovett explained, was written to embarrass anyone who sang along; the audience enthusiastically joined in.

As such, the nearly two-hour feature, which has good literal English subtitles, is a strange, quaint, artistic and wryly humorous period piece that may be a curio but still is a tribute to the artistry of the men who fashioned it and the professionals who performed in it.There is little need to remind the New Yorkers who have been flocking to the off-Broadway revival for more than five years that \\"The Threepenny Opera\\" stems from John Gay's early eighteenth-century \\"Beggar's Opera\\" and, in this case, is set in a world of cutthroats, thieves, beggars and prostitutes of the Soho of mid-Victorian London. It is more important to indicate that the cynical saga of the dashing Mack the Knife","excerpt":"his uninhibited band of robbers; Peachum, the beggar king; Polly, his daughter, who loses her heart to Mack, and Jenny, the strumpet who loves him, is satire that may be missed.Despite the fact that the film's foreword states that its \\"theme of ironic disenchantment and wry optimism was universal,\\" a viewer must bring an intimate knowledge of the disenchantment that existed in Germany in the Nineteen Twenties to this \\"opera\\" to understand and appreciate the scenarists' and Brecht's oblique digs through the film's dialogue and lyrics.There are not too many songs, oddly enough, although audiences, conditioned by the current long-run stage revival, may expect a great many more. The popular \\"Mack the Knife\\" (\\"Moritat\\") begins and ends the film as it is done in fine style by Ernst Busch. A youthful and sad Lotte Lenya (Weill's widow), who created the role of Jenny on the German stage in 1928, and repeated the role on stage here, is properly bitter and slightly lachrymose in \\"Pirate Jenny.\\" The thieves pitch in with a chorus or two, and there are a couple of other numbers. A brassy, jazzy musical background, while not in keeping with the era, is, nevertheless, in tune with the kind of singing and singers involved.Since this production came only some two years after the advent of sound, the unevenness of the sound track is not surprising. It is, considering the vagaries of reconstructing a pioneer job, a stint worth commendation. Director G. W. Pabst, who with the aid of Andrei Andreiev's stylized settings, has turned out a flavorsome, albeit sometimes murky and jerky production that fades in and out with rapidly and, on occasion, surprising cuts. And, he has handled his crowds, such as those legions of beggars, who swarm in madly on a coronation parade, and his principals with a true feeling for visual effects.By today's standards, the performance of Rudolph Forster as Mack the Knife, is vigorous but odd. In gray bowler, mustache, loud suit, white gloves and white shoes, he is a dapper, proud gang chief, who seems a caricature but, nevertheless, emerges as a forceful gent. Carola Neher, as his brunette Polly, is handsome and winsome; Reinhold Schuenzel is properly scatter-brained and terrified as Mack's police chief buddy; Fritz Rasp is, again by present yardsticks, a larger than life conniver, as are the comics who serve as Mack's henchmen.In \\"The Threepenny Opera,\\" they not only restore a page of the talking film's colorful early history but prove that even the quaint and archaic can be entertaining.

Clemmons, real estate developer and sometime theatrical agent, is a solitary in his private life, someone whose anger has led him to ''swipe a clear radius around himself,'' who feels a ''sense of communion in empty houses.'' We are given to understand that his problem is womankind. Estranged from his wife, Clemmons lives and works in Boston Corners, a town made famous by the brutal prizefight held there in the last century. As the novel opens, Clemmons is surprised to learn that his daughter Milly intends to get married in the very spot on the field where the boxers spilled each other's blood. The field thus becomes the central metaphor of this well-told chronicle, a way of summarizing Clemmons's struggle with the females in his life - women ''who took a part of him into themselves . . . so that gradually the original disappeared into them.'' The protagonist does not seem to recognize this white-hot misogyny for what it is","excerpt":"his vision is continually blurred by sentimentality (his toothsome daughter Daisy, for him, has eyes like ''Christmas mornings''), and the true shape of his rage is often reduced to a childish or hysterical notion of responsibility. When he contracts a social disease, he imagines that it has been produced by ''every woman he has ever known''; climbing a dangerous ladder, he tries not to listen to his mother and daughter - because their warnings, in the past, have supposedly caused him to fall. It seems that the institution of family will always make Clemmons uncomfortable, no matter how often he wanders back into its ambiguous warmth; the pleasures he lives easily with, by contrast, are the embers of an eternal adolescence, sly promises of fire in the ash pits of the everyday.

The comparison is apt enough, though Scottoline's jokey and brittle entertainments make Grisham's books, with their laconic detachment, read like Graham Greene. Scottoline -- ''rhymes with fettuccine,'' she has said -- has published 12 novels, beginning with ''Everywhere That Mary Went'' (1994). Until now, they have mostly been about the often imperiled employees at an all-female law firm called Rosato & Associates. Her new novel, ''Devil's Corner,'' is a departure of sorts. The book, which enters the hardcover fiction list this week at No. 9, introduces a frisky new heroine -- a prosecutor named Vicki Allegretti. Commercially speaking, it was probably time to give Rosato & Associates a rest. While each of Scottoline's previous five novels made the Times list in hardcover, her last one, ''Killer Smile,'' was her poorest showing in years -- the book entered the list at No. 14 and vanished two weeks later. A former litigator, Scottoline goes to extreme lengths to make sure she gets the details right. According to her Web site, she has, alarmingly, ''driven up the front steps of the Art Museum in Philadelphia (the famous Rocky stairs) just to make sure it could be done.'' Some writers of thrillers like to cultivate a certain air of bristling aloofness. Not Scottoline. ''She wants to meet her readers one on one,'' a note on her Web site says, and ''give them all great big bear hugs.''    FATHER KNOWS BEST: Philip Van Munching's slim new primer, ''Boys Will Put You on a Pedestal (So They Can Look Up Your Skirt),'' moves onto the paperback advice list at No. 2. Subtitled ''A Dad's Advice for Daughters,'' the book was driven onto the list by pre-Father's Day sales, a cheerful blurb from Dr. Phil and an appearance on the ''Today'' show. (Katie Couric, whose daughter went to school with one of Van Munching's daughters, wrote the foreword.) Van Munching's first two books -- ''How to Remember Jokes'' and ''Beer Blast,'' an analysis of the beer industry -- had John Belushi-ish overtones. In his new book, he's settled down","excerpt":"his voice is sitcom-friendly. There's not a lot here you'd want to quarrel with, but the ratio of clich√©s per paragraph is, I'd guess, as high as that of any book that's made the list in a while. (''Daughters are dreams come true''; ''it takes courage to believe in things.'') Van Munching may come off as a wet noodle, but he does arrive at his concern for his daughters honestly. As he told Al Roker on ''Today'': ''Being a father is God's revenge on us for all those naughty thoughts we had when we were 13-year-old boys.''

The Local News According to Bob Harris"},{"year":"1923","title":"A Hindu Beau Brummell.In the coolness of the comfortable Sam H. Harris Theatre the picturized version of \\"The Green Goddess,\\" with George Arliss as the Rajah of Kukh, was presented last night before an audience composed of many well-known men and Women of the stage and moving picture spheres. This production is one that will give a cachet to photoplays more then any other that has been seen recently, for it is not only beautifully staged, but the acting is excellent and the direction faultless. It is not often that one can ascend to such panygerics about a film, but in this instance it is undoubtedly the wonderful work of a most conscientious actor coupled with that of a skilled and an altrustic director. It is the best film that Mr. Arliss has ever made, and this is saying a great deal, as his \\"Man Who Played God\\" was welcomed as something to remember and his \\"Disraeli\\" before that scored a marked success.There are sets in this picture that bring one to Kipling, and one can almost fancy the first flush of an Indian dawn casting a feeble glow on the Indian temples in which the fanatics worship.The suspense of this production is carried out with exceptional skill, and there were many in the audience who were breathless before the denouement was reached. The sub-titles of the film are on a par with the acting, and they are particularly effective toward the end, where the Rajah of Rukh preserves his undisturbed equanimity, even when the young officer of the Royal Air Force renders his ultimatum.From the opening sequences showing the lethargic Hindus slowly pulling on a primitive fan with a rope between their toes, to the last words of the Rajah, where he asks Mrs. Crespin to give his love to the children, there is intense interest in the story, one which, of course, lends itself splendidly to a moving picture. Nevertheless it might have happened that a director would have been tempted to take liberties even with such a narrative, but in this instance whatever has been done it is to the advantage of the picture.Mr. Arliss, posing as the Hindu Rajah, an old Oxonian, speaks through the titles with such preciseness that one leaves the theatre talking in the same perfect fashion. When the Rajah utters a word on the screen one gathers what he is saying. He is an Indian Beau Brummel, tasteful and careful in his attire, what with his monocle, his Hindu robes, his combination suits and his gorgeous turban. He moves his hands, and his fingers, even, to suit the action of the series of scenes, and he always has the white trio at a disadvantage, except possibly where he sets the trap for them with the wireless. Then Harry T. Morey, as Major Crespin, is quick to perceive that the message is a scheme to ascertain whether he knows anything about wireless, and the audience showed their relief when he gave the message to his valet which meant that they were ignorant of the code and the apparatus. The lazy eyelids of the Rajah rose and fell, when he talked, without looking at the oily-appearing Watkins, whose splendid screen acting is one of the features of the film.Watkins elicits some sympathy in the beginning, as in the play, because he happens to be the only white man in the little kingdom, but afterward when it is known that it is for money he is faithful to his Hindu master, there comes a detestation for the traitor to his own race.Watkins's hair is plastered over his low forehead, and his mouth is made so shapeless that it is more oblong than anything else. He wears his morning coat and is meticulous in his attention to the slightest sign or wish of the Rajah, who has learned at Oxford how to command in that quiet way respected by the English menial. One can't help thinking of the poor chap alone among all the dusky natives without a single public house to go to to air his aitchless complaints. In one of the titles he tells Major Crespin and Dr. Basil Traherne (David Powell) that he \\"'olds their lives in the ???ollow of ???is and.\\" When he eventually betrays the Major, Mrs. Crespin and Trahern√©, and is gagged and dropped out of the lofty window of the palace, there was a dramatic effect upon the audience, and even the orchestra drummer dropped his sticks.He, our good friend Watkins, is seen first trying on some new Jermyn Street hats, which the Rajah has just received. He looks almost consumptive with his hollow chest and bent back, and most uncomfortable when he places on his head a new, glossy silk hat, which goes uncommonly well with his morning coat and striped trousers. The Rajah merely wishes to get an idea of how he, himself, will look in the new head-gear.The scene where the airplane bearing the Major","excerpt":"his wife and Traherne, crashes within the domains of the Rajah, is pictured with remarkable fidelity, even to the height of the seat from which Mrs. Crespin has to climb to the ground. Confronted by the satinrobed Rajah, who has learned that his brothers are to be executed. Alice Joyce, as Mrs. Crespin, betrays a loathing in her emotions suited to the occasion. She is also very effective in the scene in which she is to watch Traherne being tortured or become the lady of the Rajah's land. She plucks from the Hindu chieftain's belt a small dagger, and is ready to slay herself, which fact is soon discovered by the man who misses so little among his white friends.Jetta Goudal is fascinating as the servant in the Hindu palace. She is to care for the white woman's wants. Always the Rajah is prepared and has in his dwelling just such clothes as any woman stranded in an airplane would need. Clad in one of the delightful creations, Mrs. Crespin appeals even more to the lustful Hindu. Nevertheless, he tells the men that in barbarous countries the women's quarters are safe.There are some worthy scenes and settings showing the beggars and birds without the palace walls, and when the dying Major's message brings the squadron of flying machines, the Rajah, between puffs on his fat, long cigarettes, remarks that: \\"The good Major lied like a gentleman.\\" For the Major in his dying breath had vehemently denied that he had been able to get his message through.Every player in the cast, and this includes even those who served as extras, have done their bit to make this the best photoplay of its kind that has ever been produced. Perhaps David Powell was a bit stiff, and as usual resorted too much to acting with his hands. But Morey was capital in every sequence, and he ably supported the artistic and careful Mr. Arliss. Here is a photoplay that shows the dawn of a new era in the motion picture world.

His sons weren't turning out as he had hoped","excerpt":"his wife, Edna Best, was too busy being a social success; a soldier called Napoleon was threatening Europe with war. All that explains why Mr. Wyss's Swiss took ship for the colonies, only to be marooned on a fully equipped desert island where the struggle for existence was of far less import than Father Robinson's struggle to bring the family into a harmonious unit again.If the play's the thing, as Towne, Baker and Shakespeare agree, this one doesn't seem too much of a good thing; not, at least, in its domestic-problem phases. It does strike us as a bit far-fetched that even a spoiled and completely unpleasant wife (as Miss Best obviously is not) would take one look at an island paradise, sniff contemptuously and immediately order the other survivors to build signal fires so that they could be rescued at the earliest possible moment. It doesn't seem likely, either, that a passel of half-grown boys, surrounded by ostriches, wild boar, deer, an untouched fishing ground and birds of curious feather, would fret unduly over lost schooldays and plague their patient sire to build a schooner to take them home. Old Wyss knew more about shipwreck victims, even though his knowledge of flora and fauna was more complete than correct.When it stays with the book, which was adventure plus instruction, the film is considerably better. The storm sequences‚Äîthere are three of them‚Äîare properly noisy, drenching and spectacular. The salvage trips to the reef-bound brig, the lessons in candlemaking and ostrich-taking, the recipe for Mrs. Robinson's fish stew, some of the family's minor naturalistic adventures are amusingly, and often excitingly, depicted. They and the uniformly competent performance of the cast make it a moderately entertaining, if rather somnolently paced, story-book film. Besides Mr. Mitchell and Miss Best, of whom Mr. Mitchell is the better here, the Robinsons include Terry Kilburn as Ernest, Tim Holt as Fritz, Freddie Bartholomew as Jack and Bobby Quillan as the unselfconsciously cute 2-year-old Francis.

This composition owed a debt to Messiaen, and made much of extended passages in unison.

Many of the items were donated to historical societies and museums, and they have been gathered together for this display by Lance Mayer and Gay Myers, Lyman Allyn's conservators.    The family portraits in the exhibition were the first important commission for a 20-year-old painter named Winthrop Chandler. Among them is one of Ebenezer's father, a minister and member of the state legislature.    The family had a distinguished history. Ebenezer's sister married Samuel Huntington, who became Governor of Connecticut. Ebenezer himself was a member of the Sons of Liberty. He made his fortune as a merchant, trading in rum, molasses, sugar, and food for the American Army during the Revolutionary War.    The exhibition contains his ledgers, which detail his sales and purchases. The personal posssessions -- including beds, desks, chairs, tables, silver, clothing and portraits -- indicate the family's high status in the community. Letters exchanged among Enenezer's children as they went off to pursue careers and marriages provide intimate glimpses into their relationships.    \\"The Devotion Family: The Lives and Possessions of Three Generations in 18th-Century Connecticut\\" may be seen without charge Tuesday through Saturday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M., Sunday from 1 to 5 P.M., and Wednesday evenings until 9 P.M.

'HEADACHE ART'     Art as therapy for many kinds of disorders is commonly accepted these days, and the latest application is called \\"headache art.\\" An exhibition of works done by people who suffer from severe and frequent headaches, both amateur and professional artists, runs from Thursday through April 30 at Greenwich Hospital. It is called \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" and its images vividly transmit the artists' pain and disorientation.    The paintings, photographs, sculptures and prints were done at the request of doctors seeking a new means of understanding headaches. More than 200 participants were solicited.    Headaches are usually dismissed as a temporary, nonthreatening condition that one puts up with. But after the exhibition began traveling around the country in June 1989, medical centers that treat headaches from Boston to Los Angeles noticed a sharp increase in patients requesting information and treatment.   The exhibition, which is in the hospital auditorium on Perryridge Road, is open daily except Thursday and Sunday from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., without charge. A related lecture series sponsored by the hospital and the New England Headache Treatment Program, in Greenwich, is also free. Among the topics to covered are myths surrounding headaches, why women are more susceptible, the diagnostic process and the effect of drugs as treatment. The talks are scheduled on April 10, 19, 23, 29 and 30 at 8 P.M. in the auditorium. For more information, call 863-3543.

Thanks for the integral part you played in our success. For 38 years you were always there to guide us. Without you, who knows where we would have been. Gould Investors LP    MENDELSON-Herbert L. On March 23, 1998 of streptococcus A infection. Treasured husband of Joan, cherished father of Susan and Barry Stein, Billy and Carole and Clifford and Tammy, proud grandfather of Benjamin and Noa, Sophie and Michael and Amanda and Annie, devoted son of Ralph (and Edna), adored brother of Myra Waldman and brother-inlaw of Arthur and Susan Resnick, caring uncle of Steven and Bobby (and Amy) Scher and Ben Resnick, and beloved cousin of Marilyn Marber. Herb was a senior partner of Herrick, Feinstein LLP where he practiced law for fortythree years. Herb assisted many organizations with his time, abilities and resources. He served as a member of the board of directors of ALYN Hospital for Handicapped Children in Israel, as Chairman of the Greater New York Campaign Cabinet of UJA/Federation, as Chairman of the North Shore Long Island UJA/Federation Campaign Cabinet, and as Head of the UJA Long Island Country Club Mission Program. Herb was also a board member of The Daniel Heumann Fund for Spinal Cord Research, was Chairman of the Glen Oaks Country Club Charity Committee and a board member of the Sigma Alpha Mu Fraternity. At Syracuse University, Herb was selected as the MVP of its lacrosse team and as All American goalie in soccer. The funeral service will be on Wednesday, March 25, 1998, 10:00 AM at Riverside, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Contributions in Herb's memory may be made to ALYN Hospital for Handicapped Children in Israel, 19 West 44th Street, New York, NY 10036.    MENDELSON-Herbert L. The Herrick, Feinstein Family is suffering and grieving deeply over the most untimely loss of our ''golden boy,'' our ''go to guy,'' our senior partner. Herb's boyish good looks and athletic prowess, his brilliant and incisive intellect, his lifelong practice of menschlichkeit and devotion to charitable activities on behalf of so many worthy causes will be sorely missed by us, his law firm, by each of the members of the ''one for all, all for one'' Mendelson/Scher Family of which he was the kindly patriarch and by the hundreds of people who consider Herb and his love partner for life, darling Joan, as good friends. Herb taught others about living by the golden rule, about ethics and honesty, about the importance of family and friendship and other values all good people cherish, not by talking, but by his actions and the manner in which he conducted his personal and professional affairs day in and day out. The minions of lawyers and clients he worked with over the last 43 years, not only those in our law firm but also the men and women who sat on the other side of the table, could see in Herb a lawyer who immediately could digest and understand the highly complex issues and quickly devise creative and practical solutions. Herb's talents were prodigious-a resourceful and fertile brain, deep expertise in his specialty, a masterful negotiator, scrupulously honest and fair, all blended in with such a winning personality. After graduating as an All American goalie on the Syracuse University soccer team, Herb became an editor of the Syracuse Law Review. That dynamic combination of mind and body combined with his goodness, sweetness and great sense of humor explains Herb's star quality. We will adore and respect Herb's memory always.

One is, therefore, relieved when Joseph Plunkett's surrounding program is on the stage, in spite of such capable players as Lewis Stone, Anna Q. Nilsson, Ian Keith, Tully Marshall, Barbara Bedford and Shirley Mason.The characters arc a weird group. They include Harry Lennox, a well-dressed nonentity","excerpt":"his wife, Kate, who preaches what she can't understand; Ruth Lennox, Harry's sister, a susceptible weakling; Ned Hollister, a despicable scoundrel; Lonnie Whinston, a thick-headed bumpkin; Barbara Farley, a callous little flirt, and Henry Fells, an old gander, who staggers around after a thimblefull of whisky.Kate is the \\"talker,\\" who pens articles on \\"freedom\\" for women. She insists that women should have three husbands, one to support them, one to manage their households and a third to entertain them. Harry comes home and is annoyed because dinner is not ready. He looks to be quite a successful business man, as he wears well-tailored suits and expensive neckties. While giving some attention to the meat in the oven Kate asks her husband whether he had \\"got his raise.\\" He replies in the affirmative and says that he has paid off the last instalment due on their house.After that Fells is introduced. He is told by his plump wife to go and buy some things at the grocery. As he has spent all the money he had with him that day he goes to see his friend Lennox, from whom he borrows $2, with which he is able, through some mysterious means, to purchase a pint of whisky. He is later seen staggering up the stairs of his home.Then one sees Ruth receiving Lonnie, and a little later Ned Hollister arrives at the house in his big touring car. Ruth appears to be more partial to Ned, with the result that Ned says to Lonnie:\\"Can't you take 'no' for an answer, you boob?\\"Kate and Ruth both decide to go out is out with old Fells, leaving Harry, who is out with old Fells, to look after himself. They go to a cabaret, where they find a handsome young man who is willing to join them at dinner. Kate dances with him and after the first round of the floor, this young man embraces her. She at first resents, but smiles soon afterward, which prompts this engaging customer to try and kiss Kate again. As she rebuffs him, she is told that she is nothing but a talker skating on thin ice.Ned progresses famously with Ruth, and there ensues one of those fright-fully violent moving picture kisses. They agree to elope, and Ruth consents, but soon is remorseful. She runs away alone and hides. When Harry discovers Ned, the latter tells the brother that Ruth may be in the lake for all he knows.One could go on like this for an interminable time without finding any rhyme or reason for this picture.Toward the gladsome finish there is a scene in which Kate goes to her husband's office and realizes through a single rose in a glass vase that he is infatuated with the stenographer or some other woman. Being clever she knows that it must be the captivating Barbara.Mr. Stone, Mr. Marshall, Miss Nilsson and Mr. Keith appear to have found the acting in this photoplay as puzzling as the narrative is to the viewer. They do their best but that does not make a story. Miss Bedford is attractive as the stenographer. Mr. Stone is too immaculate for his r√¥le. He looks like a carefully dressed millionaire impersonating a bank clerk.

Unfortunately it's not too rousing a gimmick, in view of all the explicit fare that's been exhibited hereabouts in the recent past.In essence, all the angst in \\"The Seducers\\" is generated by Maud de Belleroche, playing a Medusa-like, oil-rich matron with exotic sexual appetites, who has brought Maurizio Bonuglia, a hip, blond oprator","excerpt":"his wife, Rosalba Neri, and their equally free-swinging girl friend, Edwige Fenech, aboard her yacht to arouse the manly instincts of her 20-year-old son, Ruggero Miti, who still plays with his toy trains.Despite all the pairing off, there are complications, naturally, when a simple peasant girl, Ewa Aulin (she played the title role in \\"Candy,\\" it may be recalled) is enticed aboard from her island home to have a go at the son, who seems to admire her. And there's her loutish fisherman-husband, who fouls things up when he turns up seeking his missing wife and ends up being seduced and knocked off.Those plot convolutions are unimportant actually. The ladies, to be specific, as well as the men, may be uncomfortable with the rudimentary dialogue and the melodramatic problems, but they're photogenic and seem at ease with their sex simulations.

The mini-series, from the executive producers Neil Meron and Craig Zadan (''ANNIE,'' ''THE REAGANS''), will run on Tuesday nights through July 26.

As it stands, it is a prodigal jumble of incidents, the tedium of which is only relieved by the able work of some of the players. But even the excellent members of the cast cannot cope with a few of the sequences, for the dialogue is frequently comically melodramatic.Wilson Mizner's fertile imagination is evident in not a few of the episodes, which might be expected, for he and Robert T. Shannon are responsible for the tale. It seems, however, as though Mr. Mizner's interesting brain-waves had been tampered with before the script reached the camera. As for the director, Ralph Murphy, he cannot be accused of squandering any great genius on this production. But he may have been quite confused after reading the story, for in the course of its meandering one hears about an escaped convict, who hopes to elude the minions of the law through the change wrought on his countenance by a plastic surgeon","excerpt":"his wife, who has a shady past; a tenacious crook and a female of the species; a criminal who is pardoned, eventually; his young daughter, who has not set eyes on her father since she was a babe; a supposedly wealthy widow, who, although she does not wish it to be thought that she is rich, wears enough jewels for half a dozen women; the inevitable good reporter; an ubiquitous sleuth and a domineering police captain, and a few others.Soapy Gibson, as the escaped convict is known, and his wife, Annie, run the Lonely Hearts Club, trusting that they will be able soon to retire and make a living from a fox farm. They have no intention of committing any further crimes. Eventually the crook, Magruder, appears and threatens Gibson with exposure unless the latter consents to his having a hand in the club affairs.Mrs. Castleman, the jewel-bedecked widow, is a member of the Lonely Hearts Club, incidentally a place where friendless persons are welcome. She, being naturally stupid, becomes enamored of Magruder, who, when he learns that Mrs. Castleman is not wealthy, is so furious at having wasted his precious time in telling the woman of his love that he strangles her. Eventually Magruder is shot, but it is not certain which one of three persons eager to kill him is responsible for his demise.Miss Rambeau does valiant work with the r√¥le of Mrs. Gibson, and Mr. Ellis gives a really effective portrayal as Gibson. Louis Calhern sees to it that there is not an iota of sympathy for Magruder. Dorothy Jordan is the attractive girl of the film, and Olive Tell impersonates the unfortunate widow.On the Stage.Ben Bernie and his band, Walter Winchell and Lyda Roberti are among those who take part in the stage program, which is titled \\"Battle of the Century.\\"Mr. Bernie and Mr. Winchell amused the audience with their verbal tilts, complimentary and otherwise.
