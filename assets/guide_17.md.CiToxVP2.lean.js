Also satisfyingly chewy, perciatelli filetto di pomodoro arrived with a simple but superb sauce of tomatoes, onion, garlic and hunks of pancetta. Both dishes were hard acts to follow and stole some of the thunder from, under other circumstances, a more than adequate capellini primavera, topped with lovely vegetables, and fettuccine Alfredo, a triumph, the creamy cheese sauce merely gilding, not drowning, the flat noodles.

Yet these are exactly the issues with which the dance historian Selma Jeanne Cohen wrestles so provocatively in her new book, ''Next Week, Swan Lake: Reflections on Dance and Dances'' (Wesleyan University Press.  $17.95).

THE REAL AMERICAN DREAM: A Meditation on Hope, by Andrew Delbanco. (Harvard University, $19.95.)

THE DOUBLE BOND. Primo Levi: A Biography, by Carole Angier. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $40.) This life of the author, chemist and Auschwitz survivor sprang from two equally necessary processes of creation: inductive, which illuminates the radiant work, and deductive (Levi's family declined to talk), which conjures up the intensely private man in all his resilient melancholy.    BIG IF, by Mark Costello. (Norton, $24.95.) A novel offers an anthropological look at the occupational rituals and argot of a group of Secret Service agents, who are in fact simply stressed-out working stiffs just like us, with the small difference that they are also charged with the continued well-being of the vice president.    A SIMPLE HABANA MELODY: (From When the World Was Good), by Oscar Hijuelos. (HarperCollins, $24.95.) The protagonist of Hijuelos's sixth novel is a Cuban composer so decorous his cross is an inability to act on, or even articulate, his deepest passions, accumulating a lifetime of repression and regret.    THIS COLD COUNTRY, by Annabel Davis-Goff. (Harcourt, $25.) As a young war bride packed off to the country, this novel's heroine faces her own battle on the home front: her new in-laws, members of the Anglo-Irish bourgeoisie whose insularity and creaking conventionalism portend genteel self-destruction.    THE LAYING ON OF HANDS: Stories, by Alan Bennett. (Picador USA, $15.) Formerly known as 25 percent of the British comedy group Beyond the Fringe, Bennett serves up a volume of just three stories, all tender, caustic gems about lonely people, most in professions at once earnest and comic (podiatrists, masseurs, vicars).    THE IDEA OF PERFECTION, by Kate Grenville. (Viking, $24.95.) Two forlorn, wearied souls -- a shy engineer who fears heights and a rough, gruff textile artist and curator with three husbands behind her -- are exposed to each other in a small town in Australia, a burg so countrified they have only themselves to relate to.    THREE JUNES, by Julia Glass. (Pantheon, $25.) Braiding together three summers (1989, '95 and '99), this debut novel explores the idea of emotional isolation as it moves, fittingly, across a series of islands -- off Scotland, Greece and the coast of New Jersey -- to chronicle a scattered, multigenerational Scottish family.

If that is conceit, and we're afraid it is, at least it is thoroughly likeable. So is the film.Without bothering to offer more than passing introductions to its characters and to hint at a triangular love affair, \\"Torpedoed\\" is the simply-told yarn of a British cruiser's handling of a messy job in the Caribbean. There has been a revolution in one of the more implausible republics. Its President has been sheltered in the British consulate—for purely humanitarian reasons, nothing political or economic of course. The rebel warship has threatened to open fire unless he is surrendered. In its path, 6-inch guns against the enemy's 16 and strict orders not to take the offensive, even though the enemy's first broadside may blow it out of the water, rides the British cruiser. Who wins, matey? Didn't we mention that the cruiser was the Audacious?Herbert Wilcox, who directed it, has worked in some exciting shots of action on the battle wagons, of a cruiser slipping through a smoke screen, of men leaping from a stricken ship. Nothing the cast can do can touch these for melodrama and, frankly, the cast hasn't bothered to try. The performances, except those of Richard Cromwell and Noah Beery from Hollywood, are in the British tradition: stiff upper lip including the forehead. Mr. Beery's caricature of the republic's presidents is as bad as his Spanish, and Mr. Cromwell's gayety rings like a cracked chime amid the generally dour thespic proceedings. But the film as a whole is sound, mannish entertainment.At the CameoA compilation of Soviet shorts, extolling the industrial, domestic and military virtues of a nation on the march, is currently being shown at the Cameo under the collective title of \\"In Soviet Russia Today.\\" The subjects range from education in the U.S.S.R. to the Red Army at work and play, with passing glances at the meat packing, fishing and fur-breeding industries, life in a collective village and a somewhat extraneous tour of the famous Hermitage museum in Leningrad. None of the subjects have any direct or informative bearing on the Soviet Russia most people are wondering about today.As with most such films made by devoted advocates, those at the Cameo give a glowing and generally charming picture of Soviet activity. The school children have a wonderful time, the meat packers all take showers before going to work, the fishermen have a veritable club-boat following their fleet around and the peasants turn out with garlands whenever a smiling troop of cavalry rides by. There is not a discordant note in this unmitigated flow of enthusiastic self-appreciation.

Shocked that Cettina also desires other men, including her own husband, he marries his rich pretty young cousin—an act of pique that is both a cynical acquiesence in the world's preference for money lust over all other kinds of lust, and also a way of leaving Cettina in the lurch with only her husband and her lovers for consolation.There you have the beginning and the middle and the end of Mauro Bolognini's \\"That Splendid November,\\" a movie that you may not want to see, now that I've spoiled the suspense.Actually, \\"That Splendid November\\" displays a certain quota of déjà vu without any help from me.

She brings to her role a kind of infinitely monotonous vivacity that suggests neither seductiveness nor doom—which, I take it, is what her part should be all about.But it is difficult to discuss performance when everybody has been dubbed into a language resembling English but in fact only spoken in Dubbing Land, where the phonetic laws demand that the sounds never match the lip movements and the speech rhythms never achieve expressiveness.This language fills \\"That Splendid November\\" with phrases like \\"Well, well!

Next week Clean Feed will present a minifestival, not in Portugal but in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where many of the artists on its roster reside. Each night at Barbès will feature three bands in roughly hourlong sets. Tuesday's program begins with Transit, a quartet led by the drummer Jeff Arnal, and goes on to feature groups led by the bassist Ken Filiano, with Tony Malaby and Michaël Attias on saxophones; and the saxophonist Steve Lehman, with John Hebert on bass and Gerald Cleaver on drums. On Wednesday Mr. Attias, who often books Clean Feed artists in a weekly series at Barbès, will perform with a sextet before ceding the spotlight to the trombonist Joe Fiedler and the trumpeter Dennis Gonzáles. Thursday appears to be the most lyrical evening of the run, with chamberlike ensembles led by the accordionist Will Holshouser; the saxophonist Rodrigo Amado, on loan from Lisbon; and the guitarist Joe Morris (above).

Smaller circuses, such as King Brothers, Cole Brothers and the Clyde Beatty Circus, featuring the animal trainer, also visited the state often.

In a concert performance by the Cleveland Orchestra, conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi, this tale of a hapless, disturbed soldier beaten down by poverty, sleeping in sordid barracks, earning pennies by subjecting himself to perverse medical experiments and by submissively shaving the beard of a pompous military officer -- this tale of the archetypal modern victim -- actually became hauntingly lovely.

Susan Sontag once remarked that, for escape, ''I love to    read    the way people love to watch television.'' With ''To Live and Die In L.A.,'' reading is just like watching television","excerpt":"its characters and plot are straight out of an amiable, time-killing made-for-TV movie. Ace counterfeiter Rick Masters rules Southern California, but two treasury agents (among many others) are determined to put him behind bars. Richard Chance is a kamikaze cop who owes more than a little of his personality to Hicks in Robert Stone's ''Dog Soldiers.'' He's not above stealing money as well as classified evidence in order to assure that Masters gets his comeuppance. Also on the case is Jim Hart, a diligent, burned-out treasury officer who plugs away despite remorse over his wife's death. What    does    distinguish the story from a television melodrama is its liberal dose of sexual activity, some of it kinky. ''To Live and Die In L.A.'' is very much a male-dominated narrative. Men reflect on the mean streets they walk down; at one point a doomed crook muses, ''If there was anything he'd learned, it was that one simply could not be too cautious when dealing with the scum-of-the-earth.'' The bottom line here is that in Lotusland the good guys and the bad guys get all mixed up in the scum, and this world view makes Gerald Petievich's final resolution decidedly ambivalent.

Recently the company has made lost French policiers something of a specialty, introducing American audiences to neglected masterworks like Henri-Georges Clouzot's ''Quai des Orfevres'' and Jean-Pierre Melville's ''Cercle Rouge,'' two films that never had a proper theatrical opening in the United States.    Earlier this year Rialto released another Melville gem, ''ARMY OF SHADOWS,'' a dark, suspenseful World War II drama from 1969. Using some of the conventions of film noir to create an atmosphere of anxiety and menace, Melville probes the logistical and moral predicaments of a small group of resistance operatives, who work in secret and in constant fear of betrayal. Unlike most other postwar reconstructions of the fight against the Nazis, ''Army of Shadows'' offers no inkling of eventual triumph","excerpt":"its characters pursue a just cause that for all they know is also doomed to fail.    Melville's style is deliberate and absorbing; his images seem to have not only depth but weight as well.

Probably not, in most cases. But even on a tropical island blessed with beaches, Brobdignagian flora and a usually dormant volcano, the houses tell graphic and often delightful stories.   The styles of France and Africa, the constant threat of hurricanes and earthquakes, the economies of plantation life, attitudes about death, trading links with New Orleans - all these and more are in Guadeloupe's buildings for the reading. Not sermons in stone, but certainly anecdotes in wood, paint and that most beloved of Caribbean roofing materials, corrugated iron.   Architecture writers (including the authors of \\"Caribbean Style,\\" published by Clarkson N. Potter) trace the humblest of Guadeloupe's buildings, the case (popular house), to African slaves imported to work the coffee and sugar cane plantations in the 17th century. These unprepossessing structures, whose dark interiors are typical of houses of the poor in hot climates, are everywhere on Guadeloupe, from the hilly villages of Basse-Terre (the western island) to the towns and countryside of Grande-Terre, the more populated eastern island.   In essence a wooden cube whose sides can be as small as three to five yards, the case exists in some form on all the Caribbean islands. On Guadeloupe, the traditional house contains from one to three rooms","excerpt":"its corrugated iron roof may be flat or gently pitched. In either case, the roof is always nailed to the frame in a deliberately gingerly fashion, so that very powerful winds can shear it off neatly without damaging the house itself. (And it works, judging by the number of new roofs on old houses seen on a post-Hurricane Hugo visit last February.) The Guadeloupean case is often set on stone blocks, partly to minimize contact with termites and centipedes, and partly to make house moving easier. Guadeloupeans own the houses but rarely the land. When the lease on the land is up (or, as often happened in former times, the owner of the case was needed to work a distant field), the little house is simply put on a wagon or truck and transported to its next destination.   One can dismiss the case as dilapidated and primitive; indeed, the British writer Patrick Leigh Fermor, wandered around the outskirts of Guadeloupe's biggest town, Point-a-Pitre in the late 1940's, and the size and shape of the houses reminded him of \\"derelict confessional boxes,\\" he said in his book \\"The Traveler's Tree.\\" While Guadeloupeans enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean, many continue to live in cases, perhaps because most island living is done out of doors.   The case can afford unexpected pleasure to sympathetic eyes. When something is stripped to its essentials, the subtle variations - the scalloped edge on a veranda, the pitch of a roof, the regular rhythm of shuttered French doors - take on a powerful charm.   What strikes most visitors first on a walk through a village such as Ste.-Anne or St.-Francois or driving through the outlying sections of Point-a-Pitre is the Guadeloupeans' canny use of color. Some cases are still unpainted and their weather-beaten boards have their own silvery beauty, but when house paint became widely available in the Caribbean between the two world wars, the islanders discovered a most congenial medium.   There are regional differences: Haitians favor frenetic shades like orange and turquoise and the English islanders prefer primary colors, while the French islanders on Martinique and Guadeloupe admire what they call tendres couleurs.   The tender (or, less romantically, pastel) colors of Guadeloupean cases include melting ice cream tones of peppermint pink, lemon, creme de menthe and cafe au lait. The trim on shutters, frames and doors is often brighter and unexpected - eggplant for a pale blue house, a knowing combination of aquamarine, sky blue and black for a white house.   Another inexpensive way to beautify these tiny boxes came by way of a 19th-century American invention, the jigsaw. Whenever possible, a case has a veranda, and the jigsaw brought forth the veranda's trim on the posts - the cutout suns, moons and flowers that encourage breezes while filtering sunlight. When cutout trim is too expensive, something of the same airy, perforated effect is achieved with decorative concrete blocks.   Guadeloupeans are sternly protective of the privacy of their case and may look up threateningly at a tourist who so much as glances in the open French doors. It's possible to get some sense of the proportions and dimness of a case, albeit a converted one, on the outskirts of Point-a-Pitre on the main road from Ste.-Anne. On the left as you approach the city, in the middle of a long row of workers' houses, the sign outside a beige house says \\"Bibliotheque Municipal\\" (Municipal Library).

The first fully computer-animated movie produced by Walt Disney, it grossed $32 million, a second-weekend slip of just 20 percent","excerpt":"its cumulative take so far is $80.7 million, according to studio estimates. ''This is what we would consider a very minimal drop,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, a box-office tracking company in Los Angeles. ''It says that word of mouth is great, and that obviously families are enjoying the movie. Disney's foray into their own homegrown computer-animated film is obviously highly successful. There's no question now that they can do this.'' Three new films in wide release trailed far behind. ''Zathura'' (Sony), a space adventure directed by Jon Favreau, opened at No. 2 with $14 million. ''Derailed'' (Weinstein Company), starring Ms. Aniston and Clive Owen, was third with $12.8 million. And ''Get Rich or Die Tryin' '' (Paramount), the semifictional 50 Cent biopic directed by Jim Sheridan, took in $12.5 million over the weekend; in the five days since it opened on Wednesday, it has grossed $18.2 million. The Desert Storm war drama ''Jarhead'' (Universal) rounded out the Top 5 with $12.3 million in its second week of release. But the most successful film of the weekend, by one measure, was ''Pride & Prejudice'' (Focus Features), the new adaptation of the Jane Austen novel starring Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland. It made $2.8 million in a limited release at 215 theaters, but its per-screen average of $13,000 was the highest of this week's Top 12 movies.

While others applied the principles of modernism to the craft of precious stones -- streamlining the shapes, creating \\"abstract\\" settings -- Schlumberger resolutely pursued his own course, a serendipitous parade of flora, fauna and everyday objects. Surprisingly, it is the sleek art-deco necklace from Cartier that now looks dated and conventional and Schlumberger's brooch of a giant ruby pierced by gold arrows that has proved to be not only timeless but subversive.         He was an unlikely revolutionary. Born in 1907, in Alsace, to a well-to-do family of textile manufacturers, he defied his mother's warning that by becoming a jewelry designer, he would forfeit the right to dance with his clients.

But what really makes ''Congotronics'' (Crammed Discs), the debut album by the African band Konono No.1, one of the most startling of recent world-music releases -- and drawn comparisons to the German electronic-music pioneers Kraftwerk and the reggae producer Lee Perry -- is the amplification system the band has used for the last 30 years.    Konono No.1, a 12-piece group led by the septuagenarian Mawangu Mingiedi, performs in outdoor cafes in Kinshasa, Congo. To make its traditional trance music heard above the roar of the traffic-choked streets, it amplifies its toylike likembés, or thumb pianos, using pick-up microphones made from the magnets in car alternators and loudspeakers left behind by Belgian colonists in 1960. The squalling feedback this lo-fi system produces is worked into the polyrhythmic drumming and call-and-response chanting to create a brutal, neotraditional genre Kinshasa's musicians call tradi-moderne.    ''When I encountered it, I thought it was the equivalent of punk music in Africa,'' said Vincent Kenis, a Paris-based producer who first heard Konono No.1 on a French radio station in 1980. ''From then it took me 10 years to go to Kinshasa and look for them and another 10 years to find them.'' He finally tracked down the band in 2002 and discovered it sounded just as it had 20 years before: no equipment had been replaced.    ''Congotronics'' was recorded outdoors using an Apple laptop and a handful of microphones, and was mixed in Mr. Kenis's hotel room with members of the band. It has sold 15,000 copies worldwide, a respectable number for such an esoteric record, and will be released in the United States on June 28; the band has embarked on its first tour of Europe, with the United States to follow in November. Electronic-music devotees have raved about ''Congotronics'' on the Internet, while some world-music fans remain suspicious. ''They say this is rock and not traditional African music,'' Mr. Kenis said. ''They don't believe it. But the public that doesn't care about African music immediately catches on to this music. African music is not only pretty voices made in Europe and America. It can also be very violent and very special and very inventive.''

This is understandable.

Weber, who has moonlighted as a designer, publisher and filmmaker, will open a short-term retail space in Tokyo on Sept. 16 called the Original True Store and Gallery (above). Until it closes on Oct. 30, it will offer clothes, books, music and dog toys, as well as Paul Smith-designed accessories. A dog run and an Airstream cafe will round out the space. Stateside, the next installment of Weber's series of books, ''All-American,'' is due out later this year from Little Bear Press. For T, Weber captured the creative force behind Balenciaga on Page 260. His latest exhibition opens at the Fahey/Klein in Los Angeles in October.    Marie-Amélie Sauvé  When you live in Paris, there is really only one magazine to work for: Paris Vogue. So says the stylist Marie-Amélie Sauvé (near right), who arrived there as an intern and wound up a fashion editor. Though she credits the magazine for teaching her about photography, she was eager to learn more, so in order to better understand fashion, she worked with designers and learned how to make clothes. These days, she works with Balenciaga (center right","excerpt":"its designer, Nicolas Ghesquière, is her best friend). She also styles for many foreign editions of Vogue and worked on the 2005 Pirelli calendar. To capture the right new-wave vibe for the portfolio ''Curiouser and Curiouser'' on Page 266, she drew upon Siouxsie and the Banshees and 1950's pop culture.    Banks Violette  Most artists are drawn to the myth of New York City; Banks Violette (center left) liked the proximity. After dropping out of high school, moving to Hawaii and doodling as a tattoo artist, he wound up in his hometown, Ithaca, N.Y. The city was ''the nearest escape hatch,'' he says. ''If Boston had been 30 minutes closer, I'd be there.'' He studied at the School of Visual Arts and at Columbia University, and his inclusion in the 2004 Whitney Biennial was his ''tipping point.'' The media in Violette's dark artwork varies from salt to plastics. His graphite ''T'' appears on Page 211. He has solo shows planned for the Team Gallery in New York and Maureen Paley in London in 2006.    Paolo Roversi  One of Paolo Roversi's first assignments was covering the funeral of Ezra Pound for The Associated Press. He quickly moved on to happier territory, leaving Italy for France (and fashion) in 1971. ''I went to Paris to visit because of the girls, the food and everything -- and then I stayed there,'' he says. Roversi (near right) established himself shooting for Elle and Marie Claire, and in the ensuing years he has contributed to publications like Harper's Bazaar, Interview, W and British, French and Italian Vogue. Roversi's 1999 book, ''Nudi'' (center right), is made up entirely of nudes against a white background. His newest book, ''Studio,'' to be released in January by Steidl/Dangin, alternates workspace images with portraits. His tribute to 1960's-looking clothes appears on Page 252.    Josh Patner  When the designer turned writer Josh Patner graduated from Oberlin with an English degree (''though what I really studied was 'All My Children'''), he went to work for Donna Karan. He was fired twice: once for making an editor cry, and once ''because I liked feathers too much.'' In 1998, he founded Tuleh (center left) with Bryan Bradley. Patner left in 2003, and though he consults for Ungaro, he concentrates on writing, contributing to Elle and The New York Times from Rome. He moved there after reading Joan Didion's essay ''Goodbye to All That'' (in ''Slouching Towards Bethlehem,'' near left). ''I thought, She's absolutely right.'' He profiles Diane Pernet on Page 140.    Daphne Merkin  ''This is what dooms me: I write to read,'' Daphne Merkin (near right) says. In researching ''The Great Divide'' (Page 194), she read ''Inventing Beauty,'' ''Costume and Fashion'' and ''Cleavage: Essays on Sex, Stars and Aesthetics.'' Merkin had less time to read at her first job, as a typist at The New Yorker, in 1975. Soon she was typing for herself, writing her first book, ''Enchantment.'' (Her second was ''Dreaming of Hitler''; both are at far right.) '''Enchantment' was originally meant to be about sexual obsession, but it ended up being about my mother.'' No word on whether this obsession plays a role in her relationship with the Virginia Woolf doll at center right, a gift from her mother. Merkin is working on a memoir, as well as a novel on sexual obsession, about which she jokes, ''It'll be about my mother again.''    Chandler Burr  Chandler Burr's beat is fragrance. Formerly an English teacher in Japan, Burr (center left) began freelancing for The Christian Science Monitor in Manila. ''I started reporting on the battle of the Philippine congress over land reform, a coup d'état, deforestation and corruption in the Catholic Church.'' In 1998, Burr caught a whiff of his future in a Parisian train station, when he fell into a conversation with Luca Turin, a biophysicist who theorized that smell is deciphered by the vibrations and not the shape of molecules. The result: ''The Emperor of Scent'' (pictured at near left, with his first book, ''A Separate Creation''). On Page 188, Burr explains why fragrance should be memorable, not familiar. (His favorite, B*Men, is at far left.)    YELENA YEMCHUK  The Kiev-born photographer Yelena Yemchuk (near right) got her start shooting bands. She enjoyed, in particular, a long working relationship with the Smashing Pumpkins, for whom she directed two videos (images from ''Thirty-Three'' are at center right). One of her paintings appears on the cover of the lead singer Billy Corgan's 2004 book of poetry, ''Blinking With Fists'' (at far right). While Yemchuk still occasionally photographs musicians, for the last three and a half years she has concentrated on fashion, using a style that she describes as ''documentary plus the-circus-came-to-town.'' This assessment accurately describes ''The East Village'' (Page 232), with its glorious juxtaposition of nature with folkloric-inspired finery.

Such young writers of the 50's as Kingsley Amis, John Braine and Malcolm Bradbury embraced the approach, the subject matter and, to some degree, the style purveyed by Mr. Cooper (actually the pseudonym of a writer named H. S. Hoff); and the fact that many British novelists - in contrast to their French and American colleagues - continue to share this literary attitude further underlines the historical importance of ''Provincial Life.'' No Headline"},{"year":"1979","title":"THE documentary films that constitute the Film Forum's program are deceptively plain. These five shorts are the work of Appalshop Films, a nonprofit cooperative based in Whitesburg, Ky., and Appalshop's reputation as one of the nation's best regional film making concerns is well-earned.The value of its work doesn't lie in jazzy editing, or shrewd camerawork","excerpt":"its direction is generally matter-of-fact. This simple approach is applied to local people whose very presence on film is remarkable, and whose evident ease is a tribute to the film makers' talents. Appalshop's catalogue lists nearly 30 films, all part of the collective's efforts to assemble a living chronicle of its region. On the evidence of the Film Forum's installments, the cumulative effect of several such films is perhaps greater than the individual impact of any one. But even in small groups, these shorts make it clear that Appalshop is performing a valuable service and performing it well.The obvious standout on the Film Forum's \\"Appalshop: Films From Appalachia\\" program is \\"Nimrod Workman: To Fit My Own Category.\\" The reason is Mr. Workman himself, a retired coal miner who has suffered black lung, shrunk down to 121 pounds, and somehow retained his vivacity and humor. Mr. Workman, apparently in his 70's when the film was released in 1975, likes to sing, and will make up a verse for any occasion. (\\"Any kinda beans is good beans . . ,\\" begins one ditty.) He is seen singing and chatting and performing chores with the various members of his large family, and to each of these activities he brings a special spark. Chores, by the way, figure prominently in many of these films. So do samplers bearing homilies that the impoverished scenery seems to belie.Mr. Workman, in one memorable sequence, tries to repair his ramshackle house with a board that keeps falling down, while the soundtrack plays a song about mansions in the sky. There is considerable emphasis, here and in the other films, upon an unwavering optimism that life doesn't often seem to justify. One of the seamstresses who appears in \\"The Millstone Sewing Center\\" remarks that \\"everything we've ever needed has always been right here at our fingertips.\\" Later, a closing title explains that Federal funding for the center was cut back in 1972, just after the film was made. The juxtaposition might seem ironic, were it not for the quiet tenacity with which that woman insists that God will surely provide.\\"Waterground,\\" the most recent of the Appalshop films (it was made in 1977) and the only one in color, visits a small, old-fashioned grist mill and Walter Winebarger, whose family has operated it for generations. It also visits a General Foods mill nearby, fully automated, and a place about which Mr. Winebarger has no curiosity at all. He contents himself with grinding natural flour, and with running something that, through no effort of his own, has become a tourist attraction. \\"People come from everywhere, really, to look at this old mill, to draw it and to take pictures,\\" he says, sounding slightly baffled. \\"People just go wild over it. It needs painting, but people say just let it stand like it is, cause it's old . . . and that's what people are lookin' to go back to.\\"\\"Judge Wooten and Coon-on-a-Log\\" is about a local contest for dogs. Each dog swims out to a log and is expected to dislodge an angry raccoon in record time. A man, who has been casually explaining the goings-on, says something about the region's peace and happiness at the end of the film, and the camera suddenly zeroes in on two animals snapping at each other. This is as close to direct commentary as the Appalshop films choose to come.

By William Herrick. (New Directions, $18.95.) In many ways, William Herrick's 10th novel conforms to the Pop Fiction Code. Stephen Bradovich, a craggy, widowed football player turned sculptor, lives in a city that purports to be New York but feels, with its cozy neighborliness and broad boulevards, like a dream. Here the hero is pursued by a supernaturally effective enemy called \\"The Authority.\\" But instead of being the homage to Franz Kafka that the author clearly intended, the novel equally suggests Judith Krantz, featuring the sort of writing in which meals are described to the last crumb, yet logic evaporates at will. (Thwarted when he tries to book his escape at a travel agency or by phone, our hero never thinks simply to get in a bus, train or taxi, to rent a car or take himself directly to an airport.) Although it's a suspense novel, \\"Bradovich\\" is not intended to be commercial fiction","excerpt":"its dropped names are not those of brands beloved by Best-Selling Authors but those adored in our universities. And Mr. Herrick's pages are peppered with philosophizing about Life's Meaning and paeans to Great Art. So the really scary thing about this book is not the depredations capriciously wreaked by \\"The Authority,\\" not the whipping, incest, bestiality, rape, mutilation and kinky sex that keep popping up, not death and its injustice, but rather the fact that New Directions, a house renowned for publishing writers like Jorge Luis Borges, Delmore Schwartz, Kay Boyle, Tennessee Williams and Jean Cocteau, is now offering thinking readers novels as meretricious as this one.
