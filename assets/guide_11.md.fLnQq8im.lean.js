Now that the economy has officially tanked, you’d think that designers were as bad as greedy investment bankers, or those women who try to disguise their expensive purchases in plain brown shopping bags. A recent Times article by Michael Cannell hailed the downturn as a corrective for the overpriced, under-functional design that proliferated during the boom, and hoped that it might steer design into a new age “in which beauty and austerity go together.” This drew a predictably sharp rebuke from the design guru Murray Moss on the Design Observer blog, where he scolded Cannell for his “tone of comeuppance” and his implication that function should rule over poetry when times are tough. Score one for designers. But then, in an interview in the Guardian, Philippe Starck opined that nowadays, “to speak about the beauty of a chair or a lamp … seems a bit obscene. … We must try to stop design for design’s sake.” Starck has been saying things like that for years, and still his designs, many of them looking suspiciously unnecessary to mankind’s survival, keep on coming. A more sensible analysis was provided in the same interview by another great design guru, Terence Conran, who said simply, “I think we’ve had enough of frivolity for a while.” We have indeed. When people are choosing between eating and paying the rent, the excesses of a design art whatchamacallit with a six-figure price tag, or a diamond-encrusted chandelier, make you cringe. But that’s because so many of these items were ill-conceived to begin with, aimed at wannabe collectors with more money than sense. Let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater. The design art movement has produced some inspired objects of great beauty. And while mass-market retailers have enabled people of modest means to buy well-designed products, they have also fueled people’s lust for disposability, producing a lot of shoddy stuff that’s straining our already groaning landfills. Yes, we need designers to come up with innovative, functional goods at reasonable prices","excerpt":"no, we do not need to sentence ourselves to living with hair-shirt design. Just because something is beautiful and expensive doesn’t make it frivolous and evil. Which is why I’m showing you a dinner plate that costs $900. Wait — let me explain. When I learned that the Danish company Royal Copenhagen was reissuing the Ruby Red version of its classic 1888 Blue Fluted Full Lace dinnerware, my heart soared at its beauty even as it sank at the price. Even if my retirement savings weren’t shriveling along with everyone else’s, I could never afford even one of these plates, with their hand-cut openwork borders. But does that mean Royal Copenhagen should stop making them? Please. They’ve been selling for generations. The company produces a much more affordable, and just as lovely, version of the design — Full Lace’s relative, the 18th-century Blue Fluted Plain dinner plate, a relative steal at $160. But there’s something enchanting about the full-on luxury version, even if it’s out of most people’s reach. For those of you who can actually afford it, mazel tov. Design | Don’t Hate Them Because They’re Beautiful"},{"year":"1939","title":"That infantile ornament of the Victorian age, Mistress Shirley Temple, enjoys what is undoubtedly her greatest role to date (since Mr. Zanuck himself has admitted as much in signed advertisements) as Sara Crewe in \\"The Little Princess,\\" at the Roxy. The late Mrs. Siddons might well envy her these scenes of tears and heartbreak, of riches and squalor, of oversentimental tenderness and melodramatic abuse—all the classic antitheses. The atmosphere meanwhile, which can only he classified as late Zanuck Victorian (in Technicolor), is otherwise redolent of a Frances Hodgson Burnett novel, and Mrs. Burnett, as you possibly recall, was a lady who had coronets on the brain.At this point a long sigh might normally be in order. But it isn't as simple as that","excerpt":"no, we have to reckon here, not only with Mrs. Burnett's archaic and ladylike preoccupations, but with a formidable artist, a baby Bernhardt, from whom tears run as from a tap, upon whose carefully made up visage sincere and beautiful smiles light up as though at the pressure of a switch. With any other child on earth, it is amazing to reflect, \\"The Little Princess\\" would stand out as one of the most glaring exhibits of pure hokum in screen history; with Mistress Temple, it may very well be, as Mr. Zanuck unflinchingly proclaims, the greatest picture with which Mr. Zanuck has ever been associated. And that would be greatness indeed.It is odd, too, for the picture is really nothing more than a series of historionic études, of practically pure displays of virtuosity, with the adults—even the treacherous Arthur Treacher, who would steal a scene from a babe in arms—existing as mere animate scenery, and darn lucky to be at work. Queen Victoria, too, might have had a queer notion of posterity if she had had any inkling that some day she would be a supernumerary to a child star. (Until you see that dramatic sequence in which Shirley meets Queen Victoria, her best friends, Richard Greene and Anita Louise, her ex-music-hall pal, Mr. Treacher, and her long-lost father, Ian Hunter, all in the space of a few minutes prowling about a hospital corridor, you haven't really lived, in the cinematic sense).It isn't Mr. Zanuck's custom to follow stories, and whether he follows the original Burnett pattern in this case, we cannot say. It's about Shirley being established in the best room at a Miss Minchin's fashionable school and being demoted to the scullery and an attio bed when her father, a captain in the Boer campaign, is reported dead at Mafeking and a bankrupt. But Shirley has a strange premonition that her father isn't dead (and so have we), and she makes the best of her reduced circumstances, even doing a tap-dance with Mr. Treacher to amuse the wounded vets in the hospital. And of course everybody sees how the plot is going to turnout almost from the very beginning. Could that be Mrs. Burnett? (Not the tap-dancing, of course.)

Buchanan of George Mason University will help break down the intellectual walls between economics and political science, and quite possibly the other social sciences as well. The result is likely to be greater institutional and psychological realism for economics and a more useful, logical structure for political and social science. And, beyond the realm of academia, the ultimate outcome could be better public policy.   On the surface, there may seem to be nothing new about Professor Buchanan's view that politicians or bureaucrats who transact the public's business are commonly in pursuit of their personal interests. In the 16th century, Machiavelli's ''The Prince'' set forth rules of statecraft based on the seemingly cynical assumption that what a ruler really needed to know was how to preserve and extend power, whether or not it served the public interest or abstract principles of morality.

By 1939 there were no Jews left in Rhina, and there are none there today.   Harald Luders and Pavel Schnabel, who produced and directed this film for West German television, begin by visiting Rhina, now in West Germany, south of Bad Hersfeld near the border with East Germany.

Of this work she once wrote: \\"They are blurred and variable, but some are gorgeous. FINALLY WHAT I've been searching for.\\" These images are gorgeous, if gorgeous can be defined as both unsettling and ecstatic. Arbus's daughter Doon Arbus (who edited the book with Yolanda Cuomo, a designer) explains in an afterword: \\"She believed there were things nobody else would see unless she photographed them. . . . She wasn't talking about who or what she saw, but about the experience of seeing it and the power of her photographs to make the experience visible.\\" Every image is a variation on that theme -- whether it's a pouty little boy sticking his thumb in his eye or a line of dumpy masked women looking as if they're waiting to get past the gates of hell.

Two questions usually follow this realization: But is it art? And how does he do it? In DUANE HANSON (Abrams, Cloth, $37.50, Paper, $16.95), Kirk Varnedoe, an associate professor of art history at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts, tries to answer both questions. An interview with the sculptor, in which he explains his artistic goals, and Mr. Varnedoe's thoughtful introduction, linking Mr. Hanson's work to the traditions of realist art, persuasively recommend the sculptor for more serious critical consideration than he has thus far received.  There is also an illustrated step-by-step guide in which Mr. Hanson explains his method of working. After taking plaster casts from a human model and filling the casts with a polyester resin mixture, he solders together the body parts, retouches the whole and paints it a flesh tone. He then injects hair in clumps into the figure's ''skin,'' paints in features and dresses the sculpture with the appropriate accessories.  Some 60 color illustrations of Mr. Hanson's work - most in private collections and museums - from the last two decades demonstrate his developing mastery of this technique, as well as a steady shift in focus. From overtly political subjects in the late 1960's and early 70's - a war scene, a race riot - he has turned to more subtle commentary on the quality of lower-middle-class American life.

But, working at 5 cents a word and with the deadline looming, the translator does not search his memory for adequate phrases in English. He types, ''Sam has divulged our secret, and now we are in a difficult situation.'' Then he rushes on. Eventually he meets his deadline and comes up with a translation that contains no mistakes, for he is a conscientious worker.

He asks the cashier to push a tray of  lemon squares to the front of the display case (easier for the customers to see) and points out that the pastries are end to end in one part of the case, sparse  in another. A few words with the manager, and then, snatching a croissant on the way out, he walks next door to TriBeCa Grill, his highest-volume restaurant, where he picks up a sheet of telephone messages. Although he is the head of a restaurant empire that does nearly $30 million a year in business, Nieporent has yet to hire a secretary. He checks calls (most are from friends or friends of friends, hoping for a table at one of his restaurants), then studies the reservations list. Celebrities, friends, regular customers, food professionals:  all will require some acknowledgment -- a little schmooze from the owner himself, a little something from the kitchen or both.         At night the small skylight room at the back of TriBeCa Grill accommodates diners, but during the less busy lunch period it serves as Nieporent's makeshift office. From here he can develop strategies for his expanding restaurant empire. Five of the six restaurants that he co-owns are within a five-minute walk of TriBeCa Grill.

BANKHEAD MAY DO CITY CENTER PLAY","excerpt":"Noel Coward's 'Private Lives' Possibility for Limited Run, Starting in June"},{"year":"1931","title":"IT may be assumed that Noel Coward little thought when he finished writing his play, \\"Private Lives,\\" that some day a film producer would spend $650,000 on transferring it to the screen. The principals in this excellent picture are Norma Shearer and Robert Montgomery, two of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most popular players, and the director was Sidney Franklin, who can usually be relied upon to make an intelligent and interesting production.The story is decidedly light, but through the author's bright lines, most of which are to be heard in the shadow version, it kept audiences at the Capitol in a constant state of merriment. Mr. Franklin has been alert enough to take advantage of the camera's scope in many scenes, and he also reveals that he has a keen sense of humor.To give audiences an extra good laugh, Mr. Franklin shows Amanda Prynne (Miss Shearer) and Elyot Chase (Mr. Montgomery) doing a little mountain climbing. It is true that at moments this particular sequence is a trifle too farcical, particularly when Amanda leans over what looks to be a mountain ledge to give her former husband a kiss. However, this comes under the formula of entertainment, which could readily be appreciated from the effect it had upon the audience.\\"In a Swiss Chalet.\\"But the outstanding episodes are those in a Swiss chalet, which in the play took place in Amanda's apartment in Paris. This slight change of locale is of small importance and the scenes are so well done that it is quite helpful to the picture. The alternating tempests and cooing between Amanda and Elyot are accomplished very much after the manner of the play, a few lines of which have been eliminated because they might cause censorial frowns.This is another example of the improvement which speech has wrought in the screen for it is safe to assert, that without Mr. Coward's dialogue the film story would not have amounted to very much, as only occasional fragments of the lines could have been used through the medium of titles.One might also hazard again that talking pictures are improving the popular taste, for it invariably happens that when a producer nowadays underestimates the intelligence of his audiences the film is a financial failure. This is decidedly heartening and the time may come when the love scenes are more restrained than they are even in this current study. But the few violent embraces here are to be excused because of the style of this rollicking affair.Their Elopement.It may be recalled that Amanda and Elyot, who have been divorced five years, encounter each other on the Riviera in adjacent apartments, she with a new husband and he with a new wife. In spite of their being on a second honeymoon, Amanda and Elyot soon decide that they will elope, leaving the second Mrs. Chase—the sobbing Sybil—and the emphatic Victor Prynne to sympathize with each other.After that there is a subtitle, in this sophisticated froth, none other than \\"Came the Dawn,\\" and Amanda and her ex-spouse are beheld somewhere in the Alps, one moment speaking glowing words of love and admiration for each other and the next having a regular cat-and-dog fight. Prior to leaving the Riviera they arrange that \\"Solomon Isaac,\\" spoken by either of them during a spat, shall mean a truce, or two minutes of silence. This exclamation is finally shortened to \\"Sollocks,\\" which happens to be the name of the nearest railroad station to their abode in the Alps.The ejaculation of this word has the desired effect on all occasions except one, which is when Amenda is so infuriated with Elyot that she smashes a phonograph record over his head. This causes Elyot to slap Amanda's face, but it is not long before they conclude, after the arrival of Victor and Sibyl in Switzerland, that they are at least more compatible than they would be with their more recent partners.The closing scene in a railroad coach is nicely done. Another outburst between Amanda and Elyot has started when the conductor announces, \\"Sollocks—two minutes.\\" It is enough to bring about a period of peace, but for how long one knows not.In one hectic scene it seems as though the powers of the microphone were taxed either by the speed of the utterances or through the loud tones.Miss Shearer has charm and vivacity and she speaks her lines with capital control. Mr. Montgomery is at his best after the Swiss sequence is reached. Una Merkel does her share in furnishing amusement. This Sibyl is moved to tears when she discovers that her Elyot has left her, and Reginald Denny as Victor looks to be in a daze as he realizes that he is in the same boat as Sibyl. Mr. Denny does well by his rôle. Jean Hersholt is beheld in the minor part of an Alpine guide.It is a handsomely staged production, with several impressive outdoor glimpses. Every detail has received punctilious attention, even to a right hand drive on a foreign car. The train scene looks as though it might be in Europe, and, while there is a great deal of trick camera work, it is cleverly done.The Prima Donna's Mistake.MISS SWANSON chose an amusing if utterly implausible story when she picked the Hungarian play \\"Tonight or Never.\\" The picture, which is now at the Rialto, has been cast carefully, five of the players acting the same rôles they had in the play. Although Miss Swanson's portrayal does not equal that of Helen Gahagan before the footlights, she, in spite of a monotone quality in her diction, succeeds in helping along the general amusement.Melvyn Douglas plays the part of the Unknown Gentleman, who is supposed by Nella Vago (Miss Swanson) to be a gigolo. Mr. Douglas gives a sterling performance. Nella is a temperamental diva and Rudig (Ferdinand Gottschalk), her singing teacher, is of the opinion that her voice is cold and soulless. He thinks that she ought to have a love affair. At the moment, Count Albert is her chief admirer, but, after having succeeded in helping Nella along in the operatic world, he is wont to pay court to other singers.Jim, as the Unknown Gentleman is alluded to most of the time, is smitten with Nella. He stands outside her window and the length of time he has been there is told through the number of cigarette ends on the pavement near him. The first scenes are in Venice and then one is taken to Budapest, where the prattling and credulous Rudig discovers that the devoted Jim is sharing an apartment with a Marchesa who is presumed to be posing as the young man's aunt. Nella has not met Jim up to that time, but she manages to make his acquaintance by calling at his apartment and saying that she is looking for somebody else.When the handsome Jim hears that he is thought by the charming prima donna to be a gigolo, he pretends that it is the truth and, although Nella is somewhat disappointed, she, nevertheless, finds Jim so agreeable that she falls in love with him. This affair of the heart is supposed to cause Nella to sing with warmth and fervor. She even attracts the attention of an impresario from New York, a Mr. Fletcher, who sends her a contract to go to the Metropolitan.To say more than this would spoil the story for those who do not already know it. This picture is exceptionally well staged, the settings having been designed by Willy Pogany. Miss Swanson looks most attractive in Mlle. Chanel's graceful sartorial creations.\\"Sooky.\\"ALTHOUGH there are some amusing incidents in \\"Sooky,\\" the sequel to that clever picture \\"Skippy,\\" there are also some dull ones, where the producers are too eager to draw tears. Skippy, Sooky and Sid are again seen in the persons of those youngsters, Jackie Cooper, Bobby Coogan and Jackie Searl.Skippy in this film, which is an adaptation of Percy Crosby's book, \\"Dear Sooky,\\" is not the wholehearted boy he was in the previous picture. While he is devoting his time to punching Sid, the commander of a uniformed force known as the Boone Boys, or when he is getting up in the morning, he is like the Skippy of old, but when he becomes so filled with sympathy for Sooky and Sooky's mother, the episodes are rather maudlin.There is a suggestion of \\"Tom Sawyer\\" in parts of this film and in other sequences one is reminded of Dickens's \\"The Christmas Carol\\" and also of \\"Skippy.\\" But none of it is nearly as pleasing as its forerunner.Skippy here has a dislike for shower baths and he argues with his father, Dr. Skinner, before taking his morning wash. He considers getting under the shower just about the same as being sent out in the rain without his clothes. But while this scene has its whimsical touches, it is not comparable to those in \\"Skippy,\\" where the youngster gives himself a lick and a promise in the morning and carefully wets his tooth brush, so that his mother will think he has cleaned his teeth.Notwithstanding its feeble spots, and there are many, the acting of the three little lads is really remarkable. Jackie Cooper is especially convincing both in the laughable and the sentimental chapters. Master Coogan is very appealing and he creates some fun by his sturdy attempts to blow a bugle. Jackie Scarl succeeds in much the same fashion as he did in the film of \\"Tom Sawyer.\\" In fact his part is still called Sidney. He has that sneer and telltale proclivities that infuriate Skippy.Strange People.THE picturization of Ben Lucien Burman's novel, \\"Mississippi,\\" is a lethargic tale of floating shanty dwellers in the lower Mississippi country. It has, however, been admirably directed and the performances of Lew Ayres, Anita Louise, Harry Beresford and Elizabeth Patterson are very true to life. But with all its good qualities, it is problematical if it makes a good entertainment for anybody who has not encountered these squatters, whose belief in spirits, strange superstitions, their lack of imagination, their melancholy singing and their fiery hatreds are set forth in a knowledgeful fashion by Russell Mack, the director.It is a story of an old Mississippi steamboat captain named Lilly, who, having killed a man, adopts his victim's child. When the grown-up boy, referred to as States, discovers that Lilly is not his father he is very bitter and there ensues a series of events which include the smashing of States's shanty by Captain Lilly, a challenge from States to Lilly to fight a duel and finally episodes wherein Lilly wins States's favor and Towhead (Miss Louise) is on her way to become States's wife.One moment a man points a gun at Captain Lilly and misses. Then States fires at the object moving in the weeds and wings his man, a fellow called Chicken Sam, who, after receiving first aid from States, takes his vengeance by informing the lad that Lilly is not his father.According to one of the characters, an elderly woman known as Vergie, it is preferable to live a distance from the Court House, for the spirits are more accessible in the country than they are in town. In one scene Towhead seeks the help of a medium in trying to win States's affection.It is all pretty glum, in spite of the capable direction and the good work of the players.

Mr. Coward is capable of doing better, though there are moments when the dialogue lets off caustic sparks.The writing and acting of the lead role, by Mr. Coward himself, are equally austere. This results in a cold front between the spectator and the people on the screen, and as a consequence the problem of Dr. Christian Faber is remote and only clinically interesting. In his soul searching, Dr. Faber recalls the adage, \\"physician heal thyself,\\" and that is the challenge in this struggle between the emotions and the intellect.Less intellect and more emotion on Mr. Coward's part probably would have made for a warmer performance. His manner is too cool and reserved to carry the conviction of a man consumed by passion. In contrast there is a nice suggestion of animal vitality to Margaret Leighton's portrayal of a Mayfair temptress and there is compassionate resignation and dignity, however misguided, in Celia Johnson's performance as the aggrieved wife.As the propelling force of this triangle, Mr. Coward has molded an adult, literate set of characters, but for all their outward sophistication, they struck us as a naive lot. Companionship and association have succeeded romantic love as the fusing power between the Fabers when the doctor innocently takes his wife's schooldays' chum to the theatre and experiences the reawakening of a dormant passion. As time goes on, he develops into a jealous, possessive lover who no longer can control his emotions, though his intellect warns him to terminate the affair and prompts him to confess that he loves his wife \\"deeply and truly and forever.\\"Perhaps Mr. Coward just wants to prove that psychiatrists are as human and capable of blundering as the next fellow. But somehow it doesn't seem natural that such an understanding and presumably proper person as Mrs. Faber would react as quietly as she does to her husband's adulterous conduct. She is, indeed, for all the sympathy inherent in such a role, the weakest link in this romantic chain, for, recognizing her husband's predicament, she makes no attempt to draw him away from Leonora Vail.Or, perhaps, Mr. Coward was striving for some oblique observation about wifely obligations. If so, the intent was never quite clear. Certainly he had something more in mind than just a simple story of an intelligent man who becomes a slave to his own passions, the while being able to help others out of similar muddles. In any event, the fact is \\"The Astonished Heart\\" is sluggish entertainment. Despite the polish of the performances, the frankness and urbanity with which adultery is treated via words and actions, the picture lacks that feeling of intimacy necessary to the establishment of close bonds between the audience and the actors.

The inclusion of Black Sabbath might come as a surprise to fans who remember Ozzy Osbourne's comments six years ago about speculation that his band would be nominated to the hall, which is in Cleveland. ''The nomination is meaningless,'' he said in a news release at the time, ''because it's not voted on by the fans. It's voted on by the 'supposed' elite of the industry and the media, who've never bought an album or concert ticket in their lives, so their vote is totally irrelevant to me.''

The ceremony will take place on March 13 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan.

London Theater Awards       At the Evening Standard Theater Awards in London yesterday, ''Billy Elliot,'' with music by Elton John, below, was named best musical, and Brian Friel's ''Home Place'' won best play. Simon Russell Beale won best actor for ''The Philanthropist,'' and Harriet Walter won best actress for ''Mary Stuart.'' The Sydney Edwards Award for best director went to Michael Grandage, for two shows, ''Don Carlos'' and ''Grand Hotel.''  Andrew Lloyd Webber has made a deal with the BBC for an ''American Idol''-style television contest to find a singer for the lead role of Maria in his new version of ''The Sound of Music,'' The Guardian reported. The winner of the contest -- which is said to have the working title ''How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?'' -- is to be offered the starring role for the entire first run. The musical is to open at the London Palladium next fall.    McCartney to Avoid China       After viewing surreptitiously filmed images of dogs and cats in China being killed for their fur, Paul McCartney, left, said he would never perform there and would boycott the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, the BBC reported. The film, shot this summer by an undercover investigator connected to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, shows animals in cages being thrown from a bus, and into boiling water. ''I wouldn't even dream of going over there to play, in the same way I wouldn't go to a country that supported apartheid,'' Sir Paul said. ''This is just disgusting. It's just against every rule of humanity. I couldn't go there.'' A Chinese official said boycotts were not justified and blamed American and European consumers for buying the fur.    Footnotes       Jerry Mitchell, an investigative reporter at The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss., whose work has led to the conviction of four Ku Klux Klan members for crimes in the 1960's, has won the John Chancellor Award for excellence in journalism. The $25,000 prize is administered by the Columbia School of Journalism, and the award will be given today at the Low Memorial Library at Columbia.  Bryn Terfel, right, the acclaimed Welsh bass-baritone, said in an interview with BBC Welsh radio that he was considering taking a year off from opera in 2008. Mr. Terfel, 40, said he wanted to spend time with his family, and to concentrate on concerts and radio and television work. This fall he sang the title role in ''Falstaff'' at the Metropolitan Opera.  Cast changes in ''Wicked'' will bring three players to Broadway who have been in the show's national tour.

And in peak tourist season, an estimated 300,000 to 350,000 soccer fans will swell the ranks in Paris.    While the games are spread While the games are spread among 10 French cities (including Bordeaux, Lens, Lyons, St.-Etienne, Marseilles, Montpellier, Nantes and Toulouse), the hub will be Paris and St.-Denis,  six miles north, where the 80,000-seat Stade de France was built for this event.     The French are determined to leave their imprint on the 1998 version of the quadrennial tournament -- Yves Saint-Laurent has designed uniforms for the officials (the final on July 12 will kick off with a Saint-Laurent fashion show), and a welcoming campaign inaugurated by the mayor's office is strenuously promoting golden-rule concepts to shopkeepers, taxi drivers and waiters. (It is hoped that unions won't leave their imprint on Cup events, with an Air France strike threatened as of early last week.)     And although only 2.5 million people are lucky enough to hold tickets for any of the 64 matches (sold out since mid-April), the mayor of Paris and French soccer officials are determined that no visitor to the city be left out of the action. The party starts  on Tuesday with a citywide parade led by four 66-foot-high motorized figures, which will end at the Place de la Concorde. Six giant screens --  at the Place du Trocadero, the Hotel de Ville, the Charlety Stadium, the Place Stalingrad, the Vincennes Hippodrome and the Porte de Clignancourt -- will show games live.     The games will be found at a variety of other, nonofficial places -- the Lido cabaret, for example, on the Champs-Elysees, is opening its doors before dark to present special soccer lunches with live screenings and a menu created by Paul Bocuse ($115, at 5.7 francs to the dollar).     The key nonsoccer event will be the Three Tenors concert, with Pavarotti, Carreras and Domingo, held on the Champs de Mars on July 10 at 9 P.M. Ten thousand tickets for seats are on sale, $130 to $1,140, at (33-1) 53.41.10.09","excerpt":"non-ticket holders can gather on the Eiffel Tower lawns to watch on large screens.     Nonetheless, behind the banner-waving crowds and the beer parties, Paris will continue to lead a very active nonsporting life.

Some hotel rooms are still available in Paris; Rail Europe, for example, has set up a special number for reservations: (888) 850-8918.  Note that some hotels are raising  their rates during the World Cup.     The style is Directoire, the design theme is literary Paris at the Hotel Libertel Quartier Latin, 9 Rue des Ecoles, fifth arrondissement, (33-1) 44.27.06.45 or (800) 949-7562, fax (33-1) 43.25.36.70, a few blocks from the Sorbonne. All 29 air-conditioned rooms at the year-old hotel are decorated with portraits (Andre Gide, Colette and Jacques Prevert among others). The walls of the breakfast room sport discreetly stenciled quotations from Baudelaire, while the inviting lobby offers comfortable armchairs, a tea service and browsable bilingual bookshelves. Doubles: $170.     Breakfast at the Etoile Pereire, 146 Boulevard Pereire, in the 17th, (33-1) 42.67.60.00, fax (33-1)  42.67.02.90, features 31 exotic jams and jellies like banana, chestnut, peach-hazelnut and lemon. That's one for each of the 21 plain but reasonably priced rooms and 5 suites overlooking a quiet courtyard. The residential neighborhood in western Paris offers an attractive garden and playground across the street, plus the shaded jogging paths of the nearby Monceau and Bois de Boulogne parks. Doubles: $140.    Budget: Artists and academics are drawn by the cheerfully Bohemian aura at the 59-room Hotel Bellevue et du Chariot d'Or, 39 Rue de Turbigo, in the third, (33-1) 48.87.45.60, fax (33-1) 48.87.95.04. The stained-glass windows in the bar-breakfast room exude the bygone glamour that the no-frills rooms lack. The garment-district location north of the Pompidou Center is nondescript but central; the spacious bedrooms sleeping four ($77) are one of the city's best bargains. Doubles: $60.     Luxury: The exclusive residential district between Trocadero and Place Victor Hugo is home to Le Parc, 55 Avenue Raymond Poincare, in the 16th, (33-1) 44.05.66.66 or (800) 949-7562, fax (33-1) 44.05.66.00. The British designers Nina Campbell and Viscount Linley created a cozy country-house ambiance for the 116 air-conditioned rooms, which are in four turreted turn-of-the-century buildings grouped around a tree-shaded garden. Alain Ducasse, the Michelin star-spangled chef, runs one of the hotel's two glamourous restaurants. Doubles: $420 to $485.    The Marriott Champs-Elysees, 70 Avenue des Champs-Elysees, in the eighth, (33-1) 53.93.55.00 or (800) 228-9290, fax (33-1) 53.93.55.01, brings American style (a floor-to-ceiling glass-topped atrium) and American  amenities (king-sized beds, computer hook-ups, irons, no-smoking floors) to its 192 rooms. Some rooms have windows only onto the atrium; the best ones overlook the Champs-Elysees. The quiet outdoor dining terrace, shielded from automobile and pedestrian traffic, is a summertime bonus. Doubles: $490 to $632.     Where to Eat          Maceo, 15 Rue des Petits Champs, (33-1) 42.97.53.85, on the site of the historic Mercure Galant near the Palais Royal, is the latest spinoff of the ever-trendy Willi's Wine Bar. The ornate Napoleon III walls have been daubed with Ralph Lauren Red. The  menu features vegetarian entrees as well as delicate seafood starters like curried shrimp with bean sprouts. Dinner for two with wine: $100.    Adjoining the elegant Passage Vivienne shopping arcade, Le Grand Colbert, 2 Rue Vivienne, (33-1) 42.86.87.88, is a lively brasserie where, amid gilded 19th-century mirrors, diners enjoy green-bean salad laced with foie gras, preserved duck and excellent sole meuniere. Dinner for two with wine: $80.    Anastasia would feel right at home at Nikita, 6 Rue Faustin Helie, (33-1) 45.04.04.33, especially when the Cossack musicians play their violins and  accordions. Tsarist treats at this romantic White Russian hangout include creamed herring spiked with dill, smoked salmon with blini,  shashlik (marinated lamb kebabs) and tangy Russian cheesecake. Dinner for two with wine and a Gypsy serenade costs $115.    At Ma Bourgogne, 19 Place des Vosges, (33-1) 42.78.44.64, the cuisine is as classic as the 17th-century stone arches that shade its sidewalk terrace, with views of the fountains on the lovely Place. Specialties include Burgundy-style snails with garlic and steak tartare with some of Paris's most irresistible frites. Dinner for two with wine: $95.     Le Rubis, 10 Rue du Marche St.-Honore, (33-1) 42.61.03.34, a wine bar a few blocks from the Ritz, encourages customers to carry their sandwiches and salads out to the oilcloth-topped wine barrels on the sidewalk.  A ham-and-cheese omelet runs $6.15 and a glass of Beaujolais is $1.60. The petit sale (salt pork with lentils) is the $8.75 plat du jour on Wednesday and worth noting on the calendar.    As far from the soccer frenzy as one can get within the city limits is Le Pre Catelan on the Route de Suresnes in the Bois de Boulogne, (33-1) 44.14.41.14. Not for nothing is it one of Paris's most expensive one-star restaurants. Beneath the stars in a glorious walled garden, Frederic Anton  presents dramatic main courses like boned sea bream baked in a shell of rock salt and herbs (cracked open at the table to reveal the flaky fish), with a fragrant Provencal stuffing of tomato, basil and olives. Dinner for two with wine: $210.

Veterans wistfully recall when nearly all of Florida's Grapefruit League baseball stadiums were barely more than fields of dreams transplanted to the tropics. But spring training for the uninitiated still promises an intimacy and informality that seem preferable to the rank commercialism, crude crowds and impersonal arenas of the regular season. Not to mention the sacrifice of weekday afternoon games to the exigencies of television. No other sport celebrates its annual prefatory phase to this degree","excerpt":"none has the good sense to begin the preliminaries in spring, when a new season heralds renewal and when fans from the North desperately need it.   When I was a young Brooklyn Dodger fan, our family probably couldn't have afforded the trip from New York to Florida for spring training. It never even occurred to me to ask. And, by the time I was 10 years old, the Dodgers had defected to California. After that, I couldn't have cared less (or, in the dialect of Brownsville, I    could've    cared less) about most of the regular season, much less the preliminaries. But what a plaque outside the Port St. Lucie, Fla., sports complex obliquely proclaims to be the \\"magic to stir men's blood\\" had, as it turned out, been suppressed just beneath the surface. All that was required to transform me into a true believer again was the birth of two sons and the arrival of spring.

Some say it should be labeled \\"the Italian 'Boys Town,'\\" some say \\"the answer to 'Shoe Shine,'\\" and some say \\"the Naples 'Dead End' Kids.\\" All are substantially descriptive","excerpt":"none is completely accurate.Perhaps \\"the Italian 'Boys Town'\\" comes closest to the mark, for much of it is reflective of that popular American film. Indeed, it is frankly stated that the priest who is the hero of the tale is inspired to his work among the urchins—the post-war \\"scugnizzi\\"—of Naples by the example of Father Flanagan. And most of the sentimental story of his establishment of a home for twenty of these waifs in a Naples convent parallels the story of 'Boys Town.\\"Likewise, the innocent optimism and religious piety of this film are very much reminiscent of the spirit of the one from Hollywood. The priest is an idealistic zealot whose simple faith in boys is repaid by all of his thievish, cynical charges becoming honest and repentent in the end. The principal boy, in the same way, is a poignant, appealing little thing whose sense of decency and moral justice is remarkably superior and apt. As played by Adolfo Celli, the priest is a bit refulgent, too, and the little boy, played by Mario Russo, is a cherub in heart-rending rags.But, then, the pious optimism and the glib theatricality are disturbed every now and again by intrusions of shattering realities. In the first place, the background of Naples, its actual streets and ugly slums, which have been used as the setting for the action, is still evidence of squalor unrelieved. One riotous scene in which the padre chases a thieving urchin through the streets is also a sharp illumination of a cynical atmosphere. And in three or four of the youngsters—especially in the arrogance of one, a snaggle-toothed tough, played by Antonio Cirelli—are seen glimmers of the genuine, credible things. In these boys, the \\"Dead End\\" intimations are solemnly justified. And one wonders whether \\"the answer to 'Shoe Shine'\\" is demonstrated in the pat solution worked out here.In short, one misses in this picture—and in Director Luigi Comencini's work—the uncompromising realism and the scorn of easy sentiment which has marked such plausible pictures of post-war Italy as \\"Shoe Shine\\" and \\"Paisan.\\" THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Guaglio,' Italian Film on Style of 'Boy's Town,' New Feature at the Avenue Playhouse"},{"year":"1959","title":"Chmn McCloskey scores various proposals to end delinquency PANACEAS SCORED FOR DELINQUENCY","excerpt":"None Is Effective in Itself, Head of State Youth Unit Tells Parley of Experts"},{"year":"1930","title":"Seaboard Air Line train derailed SEABOARD TRAIN DERAILED.","excerpt":"None Is Hurt as Four Pullman Cars Leave Tracks at Clinton, S.C."},{"year":"1973","title":"19 schoolchildren on class outing are injured on May 30 in accident on roller coaster at Bertrand's Island Amusement Park, NJ, when one roller‐coaster car rams another from behind","excerpt":"none is hurt seriously 19 CHILDREN HURT ON COASTER RIDE"},{"year":"1927","title":"Woods Methodist Ch near Barleysheaf, N J, sold at auction because it has no congregation Woman Buys Church for $450","excerpt":"None Is Left in Congregation"},{"year":"1993","title":"ON March 4, 1913, Woodrow Wilson was sworn in as President of the United States.

The Theresienstadt camp, established in 1941, served mainly as a holding point for prisoners on their way to the death camps farther east.  It also became a place of temporary confinement for painters, writers and musicians. The Nazis found that the artistic dimension of the camp made for good propaganda, a disguise for atrocities being committed elsewhere. They concocted an absurd film -- \\"Hitler Presents the Jews With a City\\" -- in which Theresienstadt metamorphosed into a bustling, culturally active village. A Jewish organization was allowed to put on a concert series that included chamber, choral and orchestral music, even several operas.

Think of one of John Cheever’s well-groomed but morally bankrupt characters at a Westchester dinner party, and the look comes drunkenly alive. By 1963 even Amy Vanderbilt had come around, issuing a qualified endorsement — plaid evening jackets were acceptable on cruise ships only — in her “Complete Book of Etiquette.” Two years later Vanderbilt’s rival Elizabeth Post also gave her assent, also with conditions: the style was welcome on “less formal” occasions, and only in summer. Nearly half a century later, tartan dinner jackets are far more identified with the holidays, with doorbells, sleigh bells and clinking cups of wassail. D&G’s fall collection mined the nerdier possibilities of the item to comic effect: the runway models all wore heavy black glasses, batwing bow ties and worried expressions, as if they had second thoughts about their prom dates.

For those sitting in Manhattan or Washington, it's easy to say that a cease-fire should wait.   Salvadorans, unfortunately, bear the consequences of delay. The day your editorial was published, the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front guerrillas launched an indiscriminate mortar attack on military headquarters in San Salvador. A 9-year-old girl and her 16-year-old brother were both killed, and their aunt and mother were injured.   We urged Congress to use our military aid for leverage: on the Government to punish the Salvadoran army murderers of six Jesuit priests last year and on the guerrillas to agree to a cease-fire. In this you see a \\"hidden tilt.\\" We do tilt heavily (and openly) in favor of stopping the violence and saving lives.   Your opposition to a cease-fire amendment shows a lack of understanding of the amendment and the legislation to which it would have been attached. You are simply wrong to say the Administration \\"urged conditioning the aid reduction on guerrilla acceptance of a cease-fire.\\"   The legislation withholds 50 percent of El Salvador's military aid up front, and it allows the President to restore this aid on Day 1 if he judges the F.M.L.N. (as the Farabundo Marti front is known, from the initials of its name in Spanish) is not bargaining in good faith.   The amendment we supported would not have kept aid from being withheld, nor would it have given the President any additional authority to restore it","excerpt":"none was needed. It would have merely added an additional requirement for the F.M.L.N.: not just to bargain in good faith from Day 1, but also to agree within 60 days to a cease-fire arrangement.    If the Senate had adopted this amendment, the only signal that would have been sent would have been its hope that the negotiations progress rapidly and that the killing stop as soon as possible.   \\"A cease-fire is supposed to crown peace talks sponsored by the United Nations,\\" you write. Apparently, you haven't read the agreement reached by the Salvadoran Government and the F.M.L.N. on this issue. Last May at Caracas, Venezuela, they called for negotiations for political agreements that would lead to a cease-fire by Sept. 15 and specified that negotiations for \\"final agreements\\" would continue after a cease-fire.   After a decade of war that continues to claim innocent lives, the people of El Salvador deserve an end to the violence.

This is from \\"Personal Pleasures\\" (Ecco, paper).   Good company is delightful bondage; to be alone is to be free. I may do what I choose, within the limits of capacity and means. So long as I keep myself unspotted from the world, there is none to stay or molest me or prevent me in my doings. I can, if I will, stand on my head, and none to comment, question, smile, or stare. . . . Aloneness can still be attained, by those who have the will to it. A perpetual and enforced state, it might cloy and irk; an occasional adventure, it might be wasted, unpractised, difficult; a frequent yet not immoderate indulgence, its drony beauty binds and snares, enspells and yet sets free; we come to it as prisoners for a space enlarged, as thirsty men to a tavern. The Poet as Lover    For Shakespeare's contemporaries, to be a poet was to be consumed by love: it provided inspiration, subject matter and an apt metaphor for poetic creation. This is from \\"Words With Power: Being a Second Study of 'The Bible and Literature' \\" by Northrop Frye (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich).    In Shakespeare's day it was generally assumed that the poet was a lover, and that if he was not he was probably a rather poor creature, and almost certainly a dull poet. That is, one of the chief sources of his inspiration was . . . the union with his mistress in which the experience of being one flesh, identical with someone else, supplied the generative power for his poetry. The union was nearly always \\"of imagination all compact\\": that is, it didn't happen. The great majority of Elizabethan poetic mistresses were as unavailable as Elizabeth: they were coy, proud, disdainful, \\"sworn to live chaste,\\" like Romeo's Rosaline, married to someone else like Sidney's Stella, capricious or promiscuous. . . . When the union in one flesh does take place, there is still frustration, this time inherent in the brevity and the many accidents of the act, and above all in the inability to forget that two people never really become one person.    The Roots of Lincoln's Prose     James M. McPherson argues that two of the most important influences on the stirring cadences and homely imagery of Abraham Lincoln's prose were his robust youth and early reading. This is from \\"Abraham Lincoln and the Second American Revolution\\" (Oxford University).    Lincoln grew up close to the rhythms of nature, of wild beasts and farm animals, of forest and running water, of seasons and crops and of people who got their meager living from the land. These things, more than books, furnished his earliest education. They infused his speech with the rhythms of nature. And when he turned to books, what were his favorites? They were the King James Bible,    Aesop's Fables, Pilgrim's Progress,    and Shakespeare's plays. What do these four have in common? They are rich in figurative language -- in allegory, parable, fable, metaphor -- in words and stories that seem to say one thing but mean another, in images that illustrate something more profound than their surface appearance. Here lies one of the secrets of Lincoln's success as a communicator: his skill in the use of figurative language, of which metaphor is the most common example. Life's Universal River     Eugene Ionesco found in flowing water a startling metaphor of individual human existence. This is from \\"Fragments of a Journal,\\" translated by Jean Stewart (Paragon House).    In this broad river there are innumerable eddies. In each eddy the same water is whirling round as in all the rest of the river: foul, or clear, or muddy, or bearing leaves, plants, bits of branches. . . . The water, which is the same in all the eddies in the stream, is as it were the substance of the eddy. But the dynamic form of this eddy, its structure, its movement are different from all the rest: one is more rapid, another less dangerous, another has a broad swirling motion, a different architecture in movement, a different rhythm. Every eddy is an individual self. Its organization, its particular movement are its personality. The self is a particular organization. Every eddy is different from all the others. Nobody is another person. Every eddy is anarchical. Every eddy has its own reality, which is evident and not illusory, according to the way it organizes the river water which is common to all. . . . The eddies will disappear perhaps. But not until the universal river disappears. The Wanderer's Lament     Her sojourn with a group of nuns in Gabon inspired Caroline Alexander, who was retracing the journey the traveler Mary Kingsley had made in the 1890's through Africa, to compare her peripatetic life with their stationary one. This is from \\"One Dry Season: In the Footsteps of Mary Kingsley\\" (Vintage, paper).    Their deep contentment to abide like this -- here, in this one small mission on the edge of an out-of-the-way river in equatorial Africa -- forever, if need be, contrasted poignantly, I felt, with my own nervous energy. Someone once said that exploration is the physical expression of an intellectual passion, and it is the traveler's conceit that there is much wisdom to be gained in the investigation of this wide world. Yet wrapped in the darkness of those matchless evenings, I knew that no knowledge I might ever amass would win me the naive wisdom possessed by the Sisters of the mission. Against my nature, I could not help wondering whether it would not be better to submit humbly to the miracle of existence than to be worn out by a continual prowling and pacing, peering and prying, into the nooks and crannies of the world.
