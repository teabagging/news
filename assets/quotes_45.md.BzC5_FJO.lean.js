What happens there at collection times, such as last month's pret a porter showings for spring and summer &#8216;78, sends tremors and telegrams of news to the rest of the interested world. Actually, there are groups of equally creative designers in New York, Milan and, sometimes, in London, and most of them are on the same wavelength. But that magic name of &#8220;Paris&#8221; cryStallizes the fashion of the moment and gives it the stamp of approval. What Paris designers are now advocating with their usual panache and unique flair is what designers in Milan and New York are also saying: The clothes for 1 978 should celebrate the body that's underneath them. The fabrics are light, semiinopaque or sheer &#8212; even if they're wool or knit; the silhouettes are loose, caught in somewhere with a sash or belt, but moving on the body in an unfettered way. Last month, as one Paris collection after another rolled by, the sight, or sense, of breasts beneath these clothes became so commonplace it ceased to be the sensation it might have been a season ago. In fact, it was often obvious that the models had nothing on under these new clothes and, while this did stir some special appreciation, it did not seem offensive or vulgar &#8212; just natural and in the character of today's fashion which is attractive and wholesomely sexy. What is significant is that this &#8220;freed body&#8221; fashion is evident in the clothes of all designers &#8212; from the avantingardists to the established, worldinknown design names such as Dior, Givenchy and Ungaro. Each does it in his own way, but there is no question about the direction they are all taking. But what does this mean to us &#8212; the real women of the world who are not endowed with the gorgeous bodies of fashion models, and who have occasional lumps and bumps in the wrong places? What the new fashion is saying is Take a whole new look at yourself. Celebrate your body and do away with anything that stiffly confines it. Here are highlights from the collections of some of Paris's most important designers, each of whom took an individual approach toward celebrating and enhancing &#8212; the freedom of the body.

The state plans to allow a nonprofit group, the Seventh Regiment Armory Conservancy, to assume control of the building and turn its rear section, a 55,000-square-foot open room known as the Drill Hall, into a center for the visual and performing arts. The Seventh Regiment Veterans have objected to the plan, saying that their organization should decide on future uses. Among the high-profile buildings designed by Herzog & de Meuron are the new de Young Museum in San Francisco and the Tate Modern in London.

The building, between 66th and 67th Streets, is the leading location in the city for renowned art, antiques and crafts shows. While it will remain the site of the Winter Antiques Show, the fate of its other traditional events is undecided.

He has been running his own show as Prospect Park's resident storyteller for the last two summers. He was discovered, he said, by Betsy Gotbaum, the former Commissioner of the Department of Parks and Recreation, and Tupper Thomas, the president of the Prospect Park Alliance. He said they saw him informally performing in the park and wanted to sign him up, but they didn't know for what. Then the storytelling job, sponsored by the Ezra Jack Keats Foundation, turned up, and he was hired as a raconteur. (Keats was a children's book author and illustrator in the 1960's and 70's whose settings were mostly urban.)   Cooper-Moore's storytelling sessions begin with parables or riddles, move to a medium-length tale and finish with a longish tale, all folk stories he has mostly heard from others. There were the Polish and Czech workers in the building where he lives in East Harlem who told him stories. Tales repeated by African neighbors have also enhanced his repertory. Then there's the baby a friend of his has recently adopted from China, who may come on Sunday, and for whom he will dig up stories. \\"I've been reading Chinese meditations and the country's history,\\" he said in his ribbon-smooth accent from the Piedmont region of Virginia.   His storytelling turns eclectic when accompanied by his songs, which he writes and plays on his hand-made instruments. \\"This year, I'll be writing songs for each program,\\" he says. What more could a child ask for on a Sunday afternoon? (Ice cream.)   The free storytelling is on Sundays at 1 and 2 P.M. through Aug. 28. The D train, stopping at Prospect Park, is the closest subway. Another free storytelling program is held on Mondays and Thursdays at the Third Street Playground (entrance at Prospect Park West and Third Street","excerpt":"Park Slope side) at 4 P.M. daily except Mondays through Aug. 1.   In Central Park, storytellers have been congregating at the Hans Christian Andersen statue for 37 years; Diane Wolkstein, the director, is in her 27th year. The stories told there on Saturdays from 11 A.M. to noon are not just those of Andersen, but also tales from the Grimm brothers, along with stories from Borneo, Haiti and China.   Tomorrow, Marcia Lane and Ulf Arnstrom are to be telling Scandinavian stories. Ms. Lane is to start with Hans Christian Andersen's story \\"The Collar,\\" in which a man's shirt collar seeks a wife. He romances a comb, an iron and scissors, but is turned down flat. He ends up being made into paper, upon which his story is written. \\"Isn't that like life?\\" Ms. Lane added.   Mr. Arnstrom, an editor of a Swedish storytelling journal, is flying in from Stockholm to tell Swedish folk tales in his soft, gentle voice. His program, in English, is to center on \\"The Pearl,\\" in which three women claim ownership of a lustrous sea gem. Whoever makes the biggest fool of her husband gets the pearl. (What a sense of humor Scandinavians can have.)   The free programs, held rain or shine, run through Sept. 24. Adults are asked to remain with their children.

That may come as a relief to some potential audience members, although children, especially girls, fall in love with the March sorority no matter what. The story is told from Jo's perspective as a middle-aged woman looking back.   This play has 23 songs on a recorded track, making the production seem almost operatic. The two-hour show (with an intermission), is tonight at 7 and tomorrow and Sunday at 2 P.M. Tickets are $10; $6 for children. From July 20 to 24, it is to be performed at Inner-Space Theater, 134 West 26th Street, Chelsea; information: (212) 989-2969. Model Ship Sailing   Chess and Backgammon    Bryant Park   Avenue of the Americas, at 40th Street   (212) 983-4142   Recommended ages: 3 and up   Through October    Three years ago, Robbie Biederman had an enterprising idea, and his father, Dan Biederman, the executive director of the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, took action. Inspiration blew in when Robbie, who is now 7, was visiting the Luxembourg Gardens and the Tuileries during a family vacation in Paris. Why couldn't children race model sailboats in the Bryant Park fountain back home in New York City?   \\"I thought it was too small,\\" Mr. Biederman said of the Josephine Shaw Lowell fountain, \\"but we tested some boats and it turned out to be a perfect size.\\" Patina Milon, an 8-year-old from New York City, spent a half hour one day last week circling the pink-granite fountain with her rented model Henley, the jib luffing uncontrollably.   The model sailboats, which may be rented for $2 an hour, are attached with strings for navigating. The boats were made and lent by Fred Hutchins, the owner of Jan's Hobby Shop on the Upper East Side. Two boats were stolen a few weeks ago, leaving only three.   Bryant Park is also offering chess and backgammon lessons and sets to rent for games at the Parisian cafe-style chairs and tables. (The park really does have a Gallic air, even though the fountain is Italian Renaissance style and is named after an American suffragist.) The New York Chess and Backgammon club is the sponsor. A free lesson is arranged for first-time players; thereafter, you may pay from $30 to $100 for an hour's lesson with masters, senior masters and grandmasters. If you simply wish to play, the fees are 50 cents a game for each player for speed chess (10 minutes or less); $4 an hour for each player for slow chess (more than 20 minutes); 50 cents a game for each player for backgammon, and $4 an hour for each player for checkers.   The sailing, lessons and games are daily from 11:30 A.M. to sundown, weather permitting. They are at the 41st Street entrance. Lessons may be scheduled by calling the club at (212) 302-5874. Little West Street Path    West Street at West Thames Street   Battery Park City   Lower Manhattan   (212) 416-5300   Recommended for all ages    A new pathway for in-line skaters, bicyclists (with and without training wheels), tricyclists, runners, dogs, roller skaters and skateboarders has been created along the West Side Highway, almost along the waterfront. Crickets can be heard at dusk in the shrubs behind the wrought-iron fence; a breeze slips in from the Hudson. The straightaway, as flat as a mesa top and illuminated at night, allows no cars. It is four blocks long and has sidewalks on both sides; a cul-de-sac has benches. The pathway will ultimately be a service road for buildings going up on adjacent empty lots, so enjoy it while it lasts.   Not far away, at the Vesey Street entrance to Hudson River Park, the New York City Police Department's Troop A mounted unit exercises its horses in a new ring, usually every morning or afternoon. (There is no set schedule.) If you're lucky, you can see the horses doing serpentines and figure eights, but not chasing bad guys.   And have you checked out the new 27-foot-wide pathway in the West Village, running from Little West 12th Street to Harrison Street off the West Side Highway? One TriBeCa mother said it had changed her life, as she can now glide safely on her in-line skates to retrieve her car at a parking lot. For now, the pathway, part of the Hudson River Park Conservancy's urban boulevard plan, ends at the northern end of Hudson River Park, at Stuyvesant High School. Other skaters have already discovered the path, but there's room for everyone. An attractive fence keeps you from stumbling into the river, although the fence is completed only down to Hubert Street; a concrete wall separates the path from the highway. A lot of people use the route at sunset.
