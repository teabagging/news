Where are Bennet Cerf's entrepreneurial seeds, Maxwell Perkins's worshipful authors, Mary McCarthy's well-red bedfellows? Where are the editorial assistants lunching frenetically at the Oyster Bar counter?

It developed soon after the Brothers Harper published Seneca's \\"Morals\\" in 1817, and almost everyone be lieves that it is going to stay right where it is.   Today, about 15,400 people work in book publishing in New York City, a figure that has essentially remained constant since 1985. Although employment could decline slightly in the next decade, Donald S. Lamm, president of W. W. Norton & Company, said, the industry's center would remain here. \\"It would take a seismic event to move trade publishing out of New York,\\" he added.    Because nothing seismic appears imminent, every publishing executive contacted agreed that, in the words of Roger W. Straus, the president of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, \\"New York will remain the hub of American publishing.\\"  The City's Strong Lure \\"    Despite the financial pinch that many publishers of fiction and nonfiction books have been feeling in recent years, the bleak balance sheets have not added up to disillusionment with New York.   On the contrary, the city continues to hold a strong lure. Eight years ago, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich moved most of its trade, or general-interest, book publishing to San Diego. But \\"our operation gradually worked its way back to New York,\\" said Rubin Pfeffer, managing director of Harcourt's trade division.   Of course, publishers of medical and educational books are scattered across the United States, and many smaller trade houses and regional publishers thrive outside New York City. But the overwhelming number of fiction and nonfiction publishers remain in Manhattan.   As Paul Neuthaler, chief executive of Bantam Doubleday Dell, noted, \\"There is a concentration here of editors, agents and executives that does not exist in any other American city.\\"    New York also leads all other cities in retail book sales and is the home of the major book clubs.

The Massenet version is superior in its stylish and reasonably honest study of the heroine, but it is considerably less flamboyant and effective as an exercise in vocal theatrics. Miss Moffo is charming, graceful and sensitive in both operas, and by the added intensity of her singing in the Puccini work makes a distincti on between the two Manons: Mr. Di Stefano, the Massenet Des Grieux, likes to croon sometimes, but on the whole gives a tender, impassioned and vocaliy handsome performance. Mr. Laba floods the recording with beautiful tone and luscious phrasing. As the Lescaut in both operas, Mr. Kerns is excellent, and other singers handle brief bits satisfactorily.

They strike targets both innocent and guilty: corrupt police officers, slimy lawyers, brutal hit men, computer hackers and that most hapless of modern comic figures, the mime. The slightly futuristic scene of this comic mayhem is Beerlight, a techno-Hobbesian city where life is nasty, brutish, short and wired, and where crime is ''the new and only art form.'' One of its up-and-coming masters is Dante Cubit, who, with his jittery pill-fueled partner, the Entropy Kid, executes an ingenious heist. Dante reprograms a bank vault time lock designed to send would-be robbers 20 minutes into the future, where they are already handcuffed and in police custody. Instead, he sends himself 20 minutes into the past and into the locked vault, which he will open when the Entropy Kid and the ''real time'' version of himself enter the bank again. The plan is for Dante to shoot his doppelganger -- but Dante Two survives, prompting an intense ''menhunt'' by Beerlight's brutal police, an opportunistic lawyer, a romantically motivated hit man and Rosa Control, Dante's well-armed girlfriend. The chase culminates in a surreal and potentially catastrophic encounter between the two Dantes. While the body count is high, the tone is anything but grim, thanks to Aylett's wickedly funny commentary on this bullet-riddled, nihilistic metropolis and its inhabitants. But be warned: the mime doesn't survive.
