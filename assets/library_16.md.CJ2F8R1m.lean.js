The selection of pieces drew on Coltrane's most complex post-bop tunes (\\"Giant Steps,\\" \\"Countdown\\"), his modal jazz influenced by Asian and African music (\\"Miles's Mode,\\" \\"India\\") and, for one selection (\\"The Drum Thing\\"), the unfettered free jazz that filled his last albums before his death in 1967. The sets regularly returned to Coltrane's versions of the blues, from \\"Mr. Day\\" (1960) to \\"Up 'Gainst the Wall\\" (1962) to \\"Transition\\" (1965), which levels the blues progression down to a one-chord vamp. As his music evolved, Coltrane cut away harmonic strictures, giving the soloists more space for passionate incantation.

The state has charged Mr. Smiley, a prominent map dealer who lives in the Chilmark section of Martha's Vineyard, Mass., with three counts of larceny stemming from a June 8 visit to the Beinecke. Surveillance cameras captured him removing a map from a Beinecke book, and a Yale detective found valuable maps that appear to be from Yale's collection in Mr. Smiley's briefcase and jacket, according to an incident report. In August, Mr. Smiley pleaded not guilty to the state charges. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also investigating the case amid signs that maps are missing at other libraries that Mr. Smiley has visited over the years.

Under the bill, homeowners could deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes. The measure would cost the state about $166 million a year and save homeowners an average of 8 percent on their income tax bills, said Rae Hutton, a spokeswoman for the Senate Republicans. The deduction was allowed for several years in the 1980's but was eliminated in 1990. Gov.

It is the first abduction of the head of a diplomatic mission there, coming as the American and Iraqi governments are vigorously pressing Arab nations to send ambassadors to Iraq.   A1    In the shifting landscape of the new Iraq, battle lines are being drawn block by block, with religious Sunnis and Shiites lining up on opposite sides and sectarian violence continually on the rise.   A7    U.S. Commando Rescued  One member of a four-man Navy Seal reconnaissance team has been rescued after his group was reported missing in a mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan, a senior Defense Department official said. Pentagon and military officials declined to release details of the rescue until the status of the other members of the team, still listed as missing, could be determined.   A1    U.N. Court May Try 9 Together  Prosecutors at the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague are preparing a joint trial of nine of the highest-ranking officers accused of playing integral roles in the Srebrenica killings. Such a large joint trial would dwarf any other proceedings the court has held.   A3    German President Faces Choice  Now that the German chancellor, Gerhardt Schröder, has lost a vote of confidence, the president of Germany, Horst Köhler, must decide whether to desolve Parliament, a political challenge much greater than his largely ceremonial job has presented till now.   A3    New Pope Showing Softer Side  Supporters and skeptics alike say Pope Benedict XVI is revealing himself as a man more complicated, subtle and personally warm than many expected from his years as the Vatican's defender of the faith.   A4    Mexican Rebels on 'Red Alert'  The uneasy peace between the government and the Zapatistas has been shaken recently as Subcommander Marcos, left, and rebel leaders have put their forces on high alert, shuttered their five governing centers in Chiapas and issued a flurry of communiqués calling for a nationwide political movement.   A6    President Vicente Fox's party seemed to have lost an important state election, dealing a new blow to the president's declining fortunes and raising questions about his party's ability to mount a strong national campaign before the presidential election next year.   A6    Qurei Offers Hamas 'Unity' Role  Ahmed Qurei, the Palestinian prime minister, said Hamas and other militant factions had been invited to join the Palestinian ''unity government'' as it prepared to take control of areas evacuated by Israel in the Gaza Strip.   A4    NATIONAL   A8-11    Sparring Over Rules For Court Nomination  With a White House nomination of a new Supreme Court justice coming up, members of the Senate began sharpening their differences as lawmakers battled over the proper line of questioning at confirmation hearings and the right of Democrats to filibuster a nominee they deem unacceptable. As senators sparred in interviews, op-ed pages and television appearances, the Bush administration sought to keep its deliberations over a potential successor to Sandra Day O'Connor out of public view.   A1    Looking at the Court's Term  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's unexpected retirement announcement shifted public attention toward her legacy and the Supreme Court's future and away from the term that just concluded. But the term contained its share of notable developments that taken together cast a shadow of ambiguity over Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's legacy.   A1    Former Nominee in Spotlight  Judge Robert H. Bork, the former Supreme Court nominee whose rejection 20 years ago has hovered over every confirmation since, is back in the spotlight. Mr. Bork squared off once again against his former nemesis, Senator Arlen Specter, above, the Pennsylvania Republican whose critical interrogation during the 1986 hearings helped doom Mr. Bork's nomination.   A11    Less Help for Troubled Species  Republican critics of the Endangered Species Act in Congress have drafted legislation changing the law's purpose and hedging the government's obligation to take all necessary steps to bring back to robust health any species on the brink of extinction. Representatives of environmental groups who have seen the draft legislation said that the change, achieved by redefining the word ''conservation,'' would severely undercut the law.   A9    States Resist Medicare Law  States are openly resisting a provision of the Medicare law that requires them to pay billions of dollars a year to the federal government to help finance the cost of the new Medicare drug benefit. Texas is leading the charge against the requirement, which states see as more onerous than the mandates imposed on them by the 2002 education law, the No Child Left Behind Act. Bush administration officials say the federal Medicare law clearly requires states to make the payments.   A9    EDUCATION    Schools to Get Less Money  A new analysis of federal money that public schools receive for low-income students shows that a record number of the nation's school districts will receive less for the coming academic year than they did for the one just ended. More than two-thirds of the districts, or 8,843, will not receive as much financing as before.   A9    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-5    Police Charge 2 Teenagers In Brooklyn IPod Murder  Two Brooklyn teenagers were arrested on charges that they robbed and killed a 15-year-old in East Flatbush when they stole his friend's iPod, the police said.   B1    Mediating the End of Life  A team of doctors and ethicists at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx is part of a program that aims to resolve medical conflicts at the end of life. The program gives its bioethicists a central role in mediating end-of-life issues among doctors, nurses, patients and family members.   B1    A Long Island Town Grieves  Tragedy struck two families in Long Beach, N.Y., early Saturday, and the news of a fatal limousine crash quickly spread through the community. As the facts settled in yesterday, the town grieved.   B1    SPORTSMONDAY   D1-10    Federer Wins Third Wimbledon  Roger Federer of Switzerland defeated second-seeded Andy Roddick 6-2, 7-6 (2), 6-4 to win his third consecutive Wimbledon title. Federer joins Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras as the only men to win three consecutive titles at Wimbledon since World War II.   D1    ARTS   E1-14    Muslim Hero in TV New Series  ''Sleeper Cell,'' a new series set to premiere on Showtime this year, will center on an undercover F.B.I. agent who is a practicing Muslim. It is the first major role in an American series that depicts a Muslim as a hero seeking to check the intentions of terrorists.   E1    'Magic Flute' for the Family  The Metropolitan Opera is planning to adapt Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's ''Zauberflöte'' into a shorter, family-friendly version sung in English as ''The Magic Flute.'' The move is aimed at drawing children to opera, though purists worry it may be the first step toward commercializing the Met.   E1    BUSINESS DAY   C1-8    Legally Downloading Movies  Hollywood studios are preparing to let people download and buy electronic copies of movies over the Internet in response to the rapidly growing use of Internet video, and are now considering online business models they dismissed as recently as a year ago.

Researchers have analyzed the stress response in exquisite detail. They know that perpetual surges of adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol sear the body like a drizzle of acid, and they believe that chronic stress, along with its loyal comrades hostility anger and depression, can sicken and even kill us.    Scientists suspect the sensations like optimism, curiosity and rapture - the giddy, goofy desire to throw wide your arms and serenade the sweetness of spring - not only make life worth living, but also make life last longer. They think that euphoria unrelated to any ingested substance is good for the body, that laughter is protective against the corrosive impact of stress, and that joyful people outlive their bilious, whining counterparts.    Researchers who followed a group of medical students over 25 years found that among those who had rated on the easy going end of a test measuring temperament, only 2 percent had died by age 50. By contrast, 14 percent of those who had scored as churlish and hostile had died.    By what happiness is healthy, and what the body is actually doing when it is exulting itself, science has only the most suggestive of clues. Endorpohins, the brain's indigenous version of opium, and the chemicals reputedly behind the runner's high, are turning out to have less to do with joy than with easing the perception of pain. Another compound receiving some attention is oxytocin, a small hormone secreted by the pituitary gland and the possible mediator of feelings of satisfaction and harmony. But most experiments thus far have been limited to rodents, and scholars of behavioral medicine seem reluctant to hunt for the human version of a cuddle drug.    \\"Our focus is always on what's making people sick so we can fix it,\\" says Dr. Redford B. Williams of Duke University Medical Center.    Sadly, too many scientists describe happiness from a negative perspective. By this logic, happiness is healthy because it spares us the enfeebling impact of anxiety or inspires us to cultivate such worthy habits as eating vegetables, avoiding liquor and cigarettes, and sleeping eight hours a night. Yet even the grimmest researcher knows that real joy is not the lack of stress but its own decidedly active state of possession, the ripe and gorgeous feeling that we are among the blessed celebrants of life. \\"You have a delicious, as opposed to a vicious, spiral of emotions,\\" says Dr. William F. Fry Jr., a psychiatrist at Stamford University Medical Center.    Researchers complain that one reason they have trouble understanding happiness is that it is a difficult emotion to recapitulate in the laboratory. \\"If we could come up with an easy experimental manipulation to make subjects happy,\\" says Dr. Williams, \\"we wouldn't be sitting around here studying anger and depression.\\"    One state of joy that scientists have been able to capture in the laboratory is laughter. Sustained hilarity, it turns out, is among the more agreeable forms of aerobics. The muscles of the abdomen, neck, and shoulders rapidly tighten and relax","excerpt":"heart rate and blood pressure increase; inhalation and expiration become spasmodic and deeper. When laughter subsides, blood pressure and pulse are likely to fall lower, often more salubrious levels than before the merriment began. \\"One hundred laughs is equivalent to 10 minutes of rowing,\\" says Dr. Fry.    Laughter also helps gird against discomfort. In an experiment at Allegheny College in Meadville, PA., a group of students was shown a videotape of Bill Cosby while a control group viewed a videotape on plants in hanging baskets. Both groups received mild but increasingly insistent electrical shocks and were told to signal when the pain grew too great to bear. Perhaps to nobody's astonishment, the Cosby watchers were able to endure a significantly higher jolt than were the plant viewers - although how much of the latter group's agony resulted from the tedium of their enforced entertainment cannot be vouched for.    Even when studying jocularity, researchers cannot help but consider its downside. Among the relatively scant listings on laughter in the scientific literature are an inordinate number about \\"pathological laughter,\\" cases of psychiatric patients who laugh to mask miseries, or brain-damaged patients who laugh for no reason. One paper describes a man who arrived at an emergency room in Ohio after having accidentally inhaled a mild insecticide. The patient had no symptoms beyond slight numbness, tremors and uncontrollable laughter. Doctors could find no physical or neurological damage, but the man continued to laugh for 55 minutes, to the point where he complained his abdominal muscles were killing him. He was given a tranquilizer intravenously, his laughter ceased, and the doctors sent him home, no doubt with frowns of triumph plastered firmly on their faces.

There is this view in Congress that out there in the \\"real\\" America, people don't care about foreign policy and certainly don't want to pay for it now that the Soviets are gone. I beg to differ. What you find when you go to the heartland is that many people are keenly interested in foreign policy and open markets and are far more willing to contribute to them than are the know-nothing freshmen Republicans who claim to speak in their names.         Patrick Buchanan undoubtedly touched a chord with his arguments about job insecurity, but the fact is, Mr. Buchanan's isolationist-protectionist foreign policy prescriptions were utterly repudiated by Republican primary voters throughout the mid-American farm belt, where Bob Dole trounced him.

Once the bad boy of the avant-garde, Mr. Shepard arrived on Broadway this spring with a revival of his Pulitzer Prize-winning play, \\"Buried Child.\\" And in the fall he joins the ranks of Horton Foote and Edward Albee when New York's Signature Theater Company devotes its season to his works. In CRUISING PARADISE (Knopf, $23), a collection of short stories, dialogues and journal entries, Mr. Shepard deals mostly in recollections: A boy visits a seedy motel to find the mattress on which his drunken father burned to death. A woman slices off her lover's finger  while wrapped in his embrace. A man and a woman spar bitterly and then part, for reasons unknown to either. A movie crew bakes under the Mexican sun while Indian voladores, or \\"flying men,\\" dangle from a pole in an ancient ritual. There is nothing pretty about Mr. Shepard's supposed paradise: here people wrestle with their demons and, more often than not, the demons win.

The one-story, two-bedroom wood frame homes are clustered in groups of three, four and five on seven streets in the 38-acre site.\\n\\nSo far, 60 units are occupied by residents ranging from 55 to 95 years old. Thirteen additional units have been reserved with $10,000 deposits, and four are still available. Thirty prospective residents have each paid a $1,000 refundable deposit for a place on a waiting list. \\n\\nA resident who becomes ill or incapacitated can hire an attendant. Medical and attendant care are available for hire from the Community. \\n\\nA 5,200-square-foot community center is being built, to include a post office branch, three meeting rooms, an art gallery and a kitchen.

Consequently, a number of high-end-car makers have been following Range Rover's lead and are busily developing their own elegantly appointed four-by-four's. What remains to be seen is whether the Germans, the Swedes, et al. can project the middle-American toughness that gives the sport vehicle its cachet.\\nTHE BMW LATTE\\nThe Bavarian Motor Works enters the sport utility market with its most innovative model since the 535i Touring. While the \\"Latte\\" shares the traction problems that have plagued other Beemers, it more than compensates with the kind of conveniences today's upscale truck owners demand: a Braun espresso console","excerpt":"heat-resistant triple-carbon cup-holders with front and rear anti-sway bars and full-sport jounce bumpers, and a CFC-free miniature Jenn-Air refrigerator, which tucks into the dash. (The limited-edition \\"William Sonoma\\" also includes a camp-size Viking stove and a complete set of All-Clad cookware.)\\n\\nTruly the ultimate dining machine, the \\"Latte\\" comes equipped with a Lohman turkey-calling kit for those adventurous souls who consume only what they kill. As for luxe, calme et volupte, the tasteful interior is what you expect in a German automobile: leather this supple looks good enough to eat. With a \\"Latte,\\" you run out of road before you run out of food.\\n\\nTHE MERCEDES DKNY-SL\\nWith the stunning, new \\"DKNY-SL,\\" Mercedes-Benz (Stuttgart) and Donna Karan (New York) have together come up with a stylish way to capture the women's market, which currently accounts for 46 percent of total auto sales in the United States. The solution is remarkably simple: a four-wheel-drive transmission mounted to a shopping cart. But God is in the details. A vast web of cargo netting keeps packages under control during intensive maneuvers. Conveniently situated in both driver- and passenger-side door panels is a hair dryer/nail clipper/tweezer/mascara wand/eyelash curler/lipstick brush licensed by the company that makes the S.O.G. Paratool. The interior mirrors are Dorian Gray-scale tinted. And standard with each vehicle is an inflatable Safe-T-Man, available in salt-and-pepper-haired white lawyer; black-haired, brown-skinned M.D., and bald Hispanic personal trainer. (Button-on legs are optional.)\\n\\nTHE CADILLAC SAN CLEMENTE\\nThe \\"San Clemente\\" is the first sport \\"ute\\" created especially for the mature market. It comes fully loaded with four-channel antilock disk brakes on all four wheels and a Magellan Global Positioning System that not only keeps the driver oriented but can also retrieve lost golf balls.\\n\\nA generously sized glove compartment snaps open to reveal an attractive pullout heart-rate monitor, occult-blood home test kit and Wahl personal trimmer. Nonslip, cushioned floor mats are available in 20 decorator colors. And a unique Owner Profile System \\"remembers\\" seat position, mirror settings, radio stations, birthdays and anniversaries. \\n\\nTHE SAAB ROAD WORRIER\\nThe Saab \\"Road Worrier\\" has taken the safety features of the Discovery and put a sober Swedish spin on it. For starters, the vehicle has a digitally monitored top speed of 40 m.p.h. The chassis is a titanium boxed shell. And each seat back contains a Duram Emergency Smoke Hood in case you're forced to park near a restaurant that allows cigarette smoking. Most important, Saab knows that safety features can often be liabilities and that researchers at the University of Michigan Medical School have found extensive evidence of air-bag trauma. The \\"Road Worrier\\" is fully prepared for such an emergency with dual Air Bag Evac Kits.  Encased in upholstery-leather sheaths with childproof rivet closures, these hand-forged Buck knives will allow you to cut yourself free if an air bag should accidentally deploy.\\n\\nWhen push comes to shove, the \\"Road Worrier\\" is a family car. Child-seat covers sewn from the same rugged thornproof oilcloth used in Princess Anne's shooting breeks will protect your car's interior from spilled formula, vomit stains and puncture wounds; snug-fitting metal mesh effectively separates children from the adult passenger compartment, and, for lesbian couples waiting to adopt, a Cassell's Chinese-English dictionary stows neatly in the glove compartment.\\n\\nTHE MACK DE SADE\\nThe \\"De Sade\\" is just the rig for any freewheelin' libertine who thinks a four-by-four is too vanilla.  The club cab sports all the amenities, from the genuine P.V.C.-covered bench seat and studded-leather racing-harness-type restraints to a full-featured TENS Unit and autoclave. Out back on the flatbed, there's plenty of room for a quartersawed oak pillory, two 14-gauge aluminum spanking horses with retractable blaze-orange safety triangles and a locking wire-mesh cage with ergonomic padded cuffs. Privacy is also an option with an all-steel cap that installs in a matter of minutes, if you have willing help. Purchase your vehicle before Oct. 31 and receive a dealer rebate -- plus a gross of heavy-duty lash straps. As if spending this kind of money on a truck weren't punishment enough.

The &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer and performer Tina Fey wrote the script and gives the material a stylized vitality. But it does add a be-yourself finale that, while standard for such movies, this picture doesn't quite seem to buy — it's the kind of bored manipulation you come to expect from the Plastics, the pack of hallway-shrewd and glamorous teen queens who rule, through subtle terror, the high school that Cady (Ms. Lohan) attends. It's her first brush with socialization, since Cady was home schooled by her zoologist parents, who raised their daughter while traveling in Africa. Since most of &quot;Girls&quot; consists of the outsider Cady observing the tribal rites of her new setting and laying it all out in narration, this movie is great home for the meticulous and ruthless deadpan that Ms. Fey has perfected for the satirical &quot;S.N.L.&quot; newscast. Though narrative cohesion isn't the strength of &quot;Girls&quot; — as a series of moments, it works better from scene to scene than as a whole — the intelligence shines in its understanding of contradictions. Scene by scene, you can't help but be impressed by &quot;Girls&quot;; it's like a group of sketches linked by theme, with some playing much better than others. But after a while, it does begin to seem like it has the easily diverted attention span of one of its archetypal high school kids — you feel a little like a scold for wanting it to buckle down and concentrate. — Elvis Mitchell Tribal Rites of Teenage Girls Who Rule by Terror"},{"year":"1964","title":"The Heatherwood Shopping Center in Commack, L.

Hardy Fuchsia     Q. When my wife and I were in Ireland last June we saw a hedge of fuschia and were told it was a hardy Fuchsia magellanica. Would it be hardy on the North Shore of Long Island? If so, where can we find it? T. G., Manhasset, N.Y.   A.  Yes, this species of fuchsia is hardy. In \\"Wyman's Gardening Encyclopedia\\" the plant is described as coming from Peru and Chile and as naturalized along roadsides in southern Ireland. According to Donald Wyman the plant has \\"died out several times in plantings in Boston.\\" His recommendation is to try the plant and see how it survives, if it can be found at a local nursery or through a mail-order source. Cool Plants     Q.    I will be spending weekends at my country house in central Ulster County. The thermostat will be set at 50 degrees during the week. Are there any house plants that would be appropriate for this temperature? V.S., Manhattan.     A.  Yes. Many plants require cool temperatures, especially camellia and gardenia plus the herb rosemary. Also, since most plants go through a dormant period during the winter months, several flowering plants such as geranium and fuchsia could be \\"stored\\" at these cool temperatures provided they are kept in low light and watered only moderately. Heather     Q.    On a recent trip to Scotland we were enchanted with the heather that was in bloom. Are there any varieties of heather that we can grow in Westchester? Are the plants deer proof? E.H., Peekskill, N.Y.     A. Yes, many heaths and heathers can be grown in Westchester County. But as to any plant being deer-proof, we cannot promise anything on that score.

More on Stolen Trees     On Oct. 21 a reader described how her young evergreen trees were sawed off near the ground and taken away about two weeks before Christmas. She asked for a recommendation of an odoriferous repellent that would be repulsive when the trees were taken indoors to a warm temperature, but would not harm the tree. The answer implied that there was no such repellent available. But there is a solution. I suggest using a concoction developed by Gerardo Sciarra who is on the staff of Cornell Plantations here in Ithaca. The mixture called \\"Ugly Mix\\" is used to make trees unattractive to thieves and therefore is a preventive measure. Here is the recipe: in a glass bowl mix 20 ounces of hydrated lime with four ounces of Wiltpruf, a commercial anti-desiccant. Mix these two ingredients to a paste. In another glass or aluminum bowl put two gallons of cool water (63 degrees). Add the paste mix to the bowl of water and stir well. Add to this mixture two standard-size bottles of food coloring such as pink, orange or whatever. This mixture is sprayed on the conifers, but the temperatuare must be above 40 degrees. The mixture will \\"color\\" the conifers but not harm them. It will last for several weeks and is eventually washed off by snow and rain. C.H.H., Ithaca, N.Y.

The Oak Ridge group believes that using microwaves as a heat source is more efficient because it requires no heat exchanging devices or oven and involves no moving parts that require maintenance. Microwaves heat materials by vibrating the bonds between atoms, causing friction. In the project, radioactive sludge is concentrated and heated by steam inside a cylindrical tank. Blades spread the sludge into a fine slurry, which is fed into a drum and bombarded with high-frequency, high-power microwaves. This heats the slurry to 120 degrees centigrade for drying and then to 300 degrees. By keeping the molten slurry below 350 degrees, gasification does not take place. When the slurry cools, the waste assumes a crystalline-solid form that can be sealed inside the drum and taken to a waste disposal site.

Gites are privately owned, usually by a villager who lives nearby, so if anything should go wrong there is authoritative help close at hand. And they are not expensive: a gite might rent from 1,000 to 1,500 francs a week during the holiday months ($187 to $286, calculated at 5.23 francs to the dollar) and from 700 to 1,100 francs during the rest of the year ($134 to $210). You could easily pay that much for a room in a hotel for one night. To be sure, you pay a supplement for heating ($14 to $24 in the coldest months) and for the rental of sheets and house linen (about $9.50 per bed), and you will probably want a car for shopping and for exploring the more extended reaches for your chosen region; but when you consider that four or five people, and even more, can comfortably share a single gite, it is obvious that renting a gite is an inexpensive way to enjoy a vacation in France.

Just because Victor died doesn't mean it will happen to me. We're all going to go some time, some of us before others.\\"    Two men wore identical blue T-shirts with the message, \\"Don't take your organs to heaven","excerpt":"heaven knows we need them here!\\"    The men and women meeting on a recent Monday evening in New Hyde Park are members of a support group for organ-transplant recipients and their families. The group is sponsored by Homecare Management Inc. of Ronkonkoma.    The number of recipients has remained fairly steady over the last few years, but attendance has grown significantly at few support groups on the Island for recipients, both before and after surgery.  3-Year-Old Chapter in Uniondale    A Long Island chapter of the Transplant Recipients International Organization was started in 1989 with 35 participants, and attendance at monthly meetings has grown to about 70, said Anne Treffeisen, the head of the chapter who received a liver transplant six years ago. The group meets in Uniondale and features a professional speaker each month.    The popularity of the first group run by Homecare Management in Ronkonkoma led last year to the start of the New Hyde Park group. The new group began with six members and now draws up to 18 people at its meetings. A third group was formed in the summer in Long Island City.    Support groups meet two times a month and provide a forum for recipients and their families to support one another while waiting for donor organs and after the transplants, said Catherine Hirsch, director of social services for Homecare Management. There is no charge.  'Regular Networks May Be Broken'    Evidence shows that when people face crises, support groups can make a big difference in improving their lives, Ms. Hirsch said, adding:    \\"The groups provide them an opportunity to bond, share, feel intimacy and closeness. People who are waiting to receive donor organs have many things going on in their lives. They are frightened that they're dying. They have financial concerns. Their regular networks may be broken down.\\"   While hospitals address medical needs, Ms. Hirsch said, there is often a need for more emotional support, and support groups pick up the slack.  \\"If you take care of a person emotionally, he'll do better physically,\\" she said.    Homecare Management plans to start a transplant-recipient support group for children and their families, Ms. Hirsch said. \\"Children transplant recipients have special needs and would be best served in their own support groups,\\" she said. \\"We're aiming to get this going by November.\\" Plans for Groups at Stony Brook    Stony Brook University Hospital is the sole federally designated transplant center on the Island, specifically for kidneys. Last year 22 kidney transplants were performed at the hospital. Up to August there have been another 22 this year. There are no formal support groups at the hospital, but hospital officials hope to introduce them, said David Bekofsky, a spokesman for transplantation services in the surgery department.    \\"We encourage patients to participate in support groups,\\" Mr. Bekofsky said. \\"In any situation where somebody goes through lifesaving surgery there are side effects and dramatic changes in life style. Many people need more support than they can get from their family alone.\\"   For Robert Carroll, 34, of Queens, who three years ago had pancreas, kidney and liver transplants at the same time and from the same donor, being part of the New Hyde Park support group has been very helpful, he said.    \\"For the first few months after surgery I held my breath, waiting in fear for my body to reject my new organs,\\" he said. \\"The medical staff at the hospital tried to help, but their main priority is to fix bodies, and they didn't have time to offer me emotional support. Talking to a psychiatrist who hadn't experienced this didn't mean the same thing as talking to others who understood what I've gone through.\\" 'Help Each Other Ease the Guilt'    One of the most difficult factors, Mr. Carroll said, is living with the guilt that the donor had died.    \\"We carry guilt around that we were waiting for someone to die, for us to be able to live,\\" he said. \\"We have to help each other ease the guilt by reminding ourselves that these people would have died anyway; they just would have gone to their graves with their organs.\\"    The United Network for Organ Sharing in Richmond keeps data on transplants and the national transplant waiting list. According to a spokeswoman, Karen Slack, there is no breakdown for numbers in Long Island, but statistics are kept by state.    Last year in New York there were 530 kidney transplants, 161 liver transplants, 119 heart transplants, 1 pancreas transplant, 3 heart-lung transplants and 19 lung transplants. The total of 833 was up from 824 in 1990.   As of June this year the national waiting list had 20,953 for kidneys, 2,571 for hearts, 2,149 for livers, 866 for lungs, 771 for pancreases and 162 for heart-lung combinations. Shortage of Donors    As donations stay about the same, the waiting list continues to grow, Ms. Slack said, adding that in 1990, 2,105 people from the combined waiting list died while awaiting organs.    Concern over the shortage of donors was one topic for participants at the meeting of the New Hyde Park support group.    Larry Juliano of Albertson, said: \\"I'm one of the lucky ones who got a new kidney eight years ago. But it won't last forever, and I hate to think of what will happen down the road when I'll need another one. Will I be able to get one?\\"    The other issues included concern over insurance costs and fear that by next year insurance will not cover the expensive daily medications that transplant recipients have to take, the hope that patches will deliver medications and the recent death of the first man to receive a baboon liver.    \\"Animal rights' activists are angry at using animals for experimental procedures,\\" a woman said. \\"But let's face it. Human beings come first. You have to be in the position we've been in. Then you can talk about it.\\"  Hopes and Realities    Ms. Hirsch said that for transplant recipients, the issues and psychosocial needs before and after the transplant were very different.   \\"Before surgery people are usually dying and are very frightened,\\" she said. \\"Their main concern is getting that transplant to have a chance to live. After the transplant recipients realize that things aren't perfect. They must deal with harsh realities, that they have to be permanently on expensive medications that may have side effects and may play havoc with their moods, that they may have to go in and out of hospitals. In essence, they've traded a terminal illness for a chronic illness.\\"   A heart-transplant recipient from Queens, Richie Bernardo, who leads the group, said the most difficult time was before the transplant, waiting for a donor. \\"When I first heard the word transplant, my hair stood up on end,\\" he recalled. \\"Today I'm 57 on the outside, but inside I'm 37. You have to beat it mentally and say, 'I gave this heart life the same way this heart gave me life.' \\" Visits to New Recipients    The support group is like a family, he said, adding: \\"We share each other's happinesses and sorrows. Now, a year and a half after my heart transplant, I try to be on the giving end. I go to hospitals and talk to heart patients. When they see me standing there, it's a help to them. When I see fear in another man's eyes, I hold his hand and tell him that I've been through it. It's not easy, but he'll get through it.\\"    Another man in the group, Rob Skaretka of Forest Hills, said he had been very frightened before his heart transplant. \\"I was in the hospital,\\" Mr. Skaretka recounted, \\"and I saw Richie there visiting, just six weeks after he had had his transplant. I couldn't believe it. He looked so great that suddenly I wasn't afraid anymore.\\" Support Groups Grow For Transplant Patients"},{"year":"2003","title":"WE tried","excerpt":"heaven knows we tried.
