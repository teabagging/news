Cohan's stage comedy. \\"The Home Towners.\\" Having been produced with a sense of restraint and an intelligent conception of the coupling of the cinematic values with the lines, it provided an agreeable entertainment. It has, it is true, mechanical defects, for sometimes the voices were a trifle explosive and on other occasions they were not a little too weak. But it was plain that with experience the players will learn to control their voices, or, perhaps the directors will eventually learn more about the control of sound.It is perhaps the first feature-length production, in which there is no singing, that actually holds the interest through the story. It has its quota of amusement as well as suspense, and because several of the players were accustomed to the stage, they played their parts without being intimidated by the fact that microphones were in the offing.This Vitaphoned conception of \\"The Home Towners\\" is a great stride in the right direction for talking films, and one of the principal reasons is the fact that the adapters have used common sense in what changes they made in the play. They give certain scenic additions with sound, but these episodes enhance the worth of the production. A conversation is carried on in an automobile, and it is an integral part of the story. There are other sections that take place aboard a train. In the beginning the camera is switched from a compartment on board the train to a flash of the train itself as it speeds on through the darkness.The director is a little too fond of jangling telephone bells and a buzzer that sounds abnormally loud, but, even so, it is not irritating. However, if these sounds were more subdued, it would add to the general realistic idea of the picture. There are other sounds that strike one as being artificial, even though they undoubtedly are obtained from the real thing. There are also periods of silence when one expects to hear a buzz or rustle.Richard Bennett, who appears as \\"Vic\\" Arnold, a rôle acted on the stage by William Elliott","excerpt":"Robert McWade, who portrays the same character he did before the footlights, and Robert Edeson, as Mr. Calhoun, do a great deal to cause one to take this feature more seriously than any others. Mr. McWade was given to shouting on the stage, and his voice is even more stentorian in this shadow translation. He is, however, thoroughly amusing as the fault-finding and suspicious South Bend man who causes all the trouble.Mr. Bennett grasps better than any of the other players what is wanted in this talking picture, for his intonation is most pleasing and his diction invariably clear.Mr. Edeson has a minor rôle, that of the publican whose daughter is to marry \\"Vic\\" Arnold, but he reveals that in spite of his long absence from the stage he has not forgotten that words must be accompanied by suitable actions and expressions. Gladys Brockwell, a screen actress, figures as Mrs. Bancroft, and she does quite well with this character.Doris Kenyon is charming as Beth Calhoun, the girl who is engaged to \\"Vic\\" Arnold, but much more was to have been expected from the vocal side of her performance.This comedy, it may be remembered, is concerned with the disappointment of the elderly P. H. Bancroft of South Bend, when he discovers that this old friend \\"Vic\\" Arnold is engaged to marry a girl less than half his age. Bancroft, who eventually is alluded to as a man with a \\"Main Street mind,\\" suspects in turn the brother, the husband and even the mother of Arnold's bride-to-be of conspiring to get money from Arnold. He hears that old Calhoun has invented a bottle washer and that Arnold has bought 51 per cent, of the stock for $200,000. Arnold tells him that Beth Arnold's brother Wally is now earning $15,000 a year in his (Arnold's) brokerage concern, and that Arnold expects to make Wally a member of his firm.From Wally, to Bancroft's surprise, he learns that this young man has been approached by another firm. Bancroft, an overbearing personality, forms his own conclusions and \\"Vic\\" Arnold resents his friend's insulting Beth. Bancroft eventually antagonizes the Calhoun family, and in the end the man from South Bend wilts under a tirade from Wally. Bancroft has spoken of brigands and bandits, but he subsequently discovers that the invention was worth while, that Wally really did have an offer from a rival broker and that Beth really loves Arnold.

The black, white and gray environment may constitute going cold turkey, but the artist's gleefully perverse conflations of modern art and suburban life continue. The abject and the abstract keep close company in mannequins whose frozen poses of submission or dominance are so heavily doused in paint that they have a geological mass, and in rock-solid drapes whose contrasting grays conjure up the wan tones of old family snapshots or a Jackson Pollock drip painting blurred by Gerhard Richter.

And, to be perfectly candid about it, \\"Archie\\" and his colleagues prove to be about as mobile as a glacier while being as colorful in speech as a top kick bawling out a hapless yardbird.Mr. Bowers' remembrances of things past during the World War II unpleasantness, is, to put it specifically, merely literary and often funny dialogue wrapped up in largely static situations handled by a platoon of professionals unencumbered by the strong arm of direction. We have assembled here a group of college graduates with civilian air training snagged for service in the Civilian Pilot Training program who finally were jettisoned as buck privates at an air base near Denver, the like of which would be any soldier's dream.Our zany group is headed by Private Robert Mitchum, an ace goldbrick with the brain of a benign Machiavelli and enough charm to fascinate a cobra much less sergeants and the gorgeous dames who, oddly enough, abound in the area. How our men manage to live like generals — permanent passes, the use of a jeep, money handed to them gladly by their love-hungry damsels and other privileges—should be any G.I.'s vision of heaven.The point is, Mr. Mitchum wanders through this farce with the speed and elan of a poet dreaming of Nirvana. So do Mr. Webb, his confused but admiring sidekick; Martha Hyer and France Nuyen, as their respective ladies-in-waiting; Louis Nye, Del Moore and James Lydon, as their barracks buddies; and Richard Arlen, as the base commander. Robert Strauss, as a raspy-voiced ogre of a top sergeant and Harvey Lembeck, as his sycophantic duty sergeant, are comic stereotypes but they are, at least, energetic about it.Mr. Mitchum, with the aid of scenarist Bowers puts it all into an undisguised confession when he confides to Mr. Webb: \\"We are operating in the realm of the supernatural.\\" His \\"Archie\\" isn't precisely supernatural but he and his wacky contingent are awfully hard to believe or really laugh with.

She was an accomplished pianist and vocalist when she met and in 1933 married James Edward Downey of Hartford, CT. The couple lived in Providence until 1940. Dorothy and James Downey were blessed with four sons and then two daughters. As she would with her grandchildren a generation later, Dorothy imbued her children with an individual sense of uniqueness, values and fair play. She made each person she touched feel like the most important being in the world. The Downeys lived in the New Haven area throughout the 1940s and afterwards in Concord, MA. In 1954 they moved to Darien, CT. Some years later, following her husband's death in 1969, Dorothy relocated to her home in North Salem. Mrs. Downey is survived by her children: Dr. James L.

Ever since he burst upon the New York art scene in the late 1950's -- helping to set the stage for Pop, Minimalism and a few other art movements -- he has been relentlessly, at times frantically productive. Forget the artist's often-quoted desire to \\"operate in the gap between art and life.\\" It has sometimes seemed that Mr. Rauschenberg might actually close that gap, simply by filling it with the prints, drawings, paintings, sculpture, photographs and dance sets of his own making.   Ready evidence of Mr. Rauschenberg's nonstop creativity is available here in two full-scale exhibitions of his work. At the Corcoran Gallery of Art is a moving, frequently revelatory show of 100 works that the artist made in the early 1950's, before fame and fortune struck. It has been organized by Walter Hopps under the auspices of the Menil Collection in Houston, and many of its paintings, collages, assemblage sculptures and photographs have only recently been rediscovered. They confirm the artist's early inventiveness and prescience, shedding further light on, among other things, the fascinating subject of his influence on Jasper Johns.

The exhibition, which opens to the public on Sunday and occupies nine specially built galleries on the museum's second floor, is the largest devoted to Mr. Ryman's quietly ravishing white-on-white paintings in this country. Its 83 works span almost 40 years, from the mid-1950's, when the artist was exposed to the tenets of Abstract Expressionism while working as a guard at the Modern, to the present, when he is widely considered one of the most important painters of the postwar period.    But contrary to the usual display methods at major museums, there's not a single label or text panel in sight, a condition that even the most seasoned art viewer may find a bit disorienting.

In November 1990, Carnegie Hall sponsored its first Professional Training Workshop as part of its centennial celebration. Robert Shaw, the pre-eminent American choral conductor, was invited to lead the program, and more than 200 choral conductors, singers and music administrators came from all over the United States for five days of intensive work on Brahms's German Requiem, and a performance with the Orchestra of St. Luke's.   It was evident both from the performance and from the videotapes of the training sessions that something special had happened. Mr. Shaw had taken a disparate group and transformed it almost overnight into a chorus disciplined and flexible enough to give a moving, persuasive performance of a towering work of the choral repertory.

For the umpteenth time, a generally familiar situation has been shaped professionally as only the English movie makers can. Crisply, graphically, with the pertinent precision of a compass needle, the simplest of stories has yielded an engrossing World War II drama with nary a false note.With the ship ready to depart from Alexandria harbor on an important mission in 1941, the nub of the plot is this: two Italian frogmen are hauled aboard, one seriously wounded. Have they mined the vessel or not? Mr. Mills isn't about to abandon ship or evacuate his crew of 1,200, much less hospitalize the wounded enemy, unless the prisoners talk. And they won't.The picture is primarily a battle of nerves between Mr. Mills, as the coldly determined captain, and Ettore Manni, as the equally strong-willed Italian commandant.Mr. Mills is Mr. Mills.

But it does offer, as Mr. Wilson suggested, at least one forum of the sort he described, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine on Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street. In recent decades, under the imaginative leadership of the Rev.

Born in Salt Lake City, Borzage entered the movies first as an actor before moving behind the camera in 1916. In the manner of the day, he worked hard and fast, directing eight features in 1918 alone. His sweat and a sublimely expressive visual style paid off, and he won one of the first directing Academy Awards for his delicate handling of love against the odds in the 1927 drama ''Seventh Heaven.'' Like a number of other Borzage films, this story about a Parisian sewer worker and the waif he rescues centers on a man and woman whose love becomes a bulwark against a brutal, brutalizing world. Love in these films can seem almost spiritual -- notice the light that can flood the faces of the possessed -- but it's also resolutely physical, keeping lovers tethered both to each other and to a world that sometimes exacts a cruel price for so much happiness. In his deeply felt adaptation of Hemingway's ''Farewell to Arms'' (1932), Gary Cooper's American lieutenant and Helen Hayes's British nurse (right, with Adolphe Menjou) find temporary refuge in each other's embrace, a union whose passion the director elevates into a sacrament. War threatens love in both films, breaking bodies and killing souls, much as it does in ''The Mortal Storm'' (1940), which stars Margaret Sullavan as the only daughter of a German family ripped apart by National Socialism. James Stewart plays the freethinker who loves the daughter","excerpt":"Robert Young plays her fiancé, a true Hitler believer with madness in his eyes.

Supported by several local businesses and individuals, the program, titled \\"Women at Risk,\\" will focus on the prevention of heart disease, presented in a format designed for both the general public and professionals.    It will begin at 8:45 A.M. with informational talks and discussions of special-risk factors for women, including stress, exercise, nutrition, hormonal treatments and balance, and the sources of chest pains.

WRITERS HELP LIBRARY     The Pelham Village Library for 75 years has been housed in two basement rooms of the Hutchinson Elementary School on Lincoln Avenue and is arguably the smallest library in the county. As the only library serving the 4,500 households of Pelham Village and Pelham Manor (Manorites are charged a fee of $5 a year), it is stretched to its limits.    Since 1986 plans have been simmering for a new library to serve both communities free of charge. To that end, a fund-raising campaign for $1.68 million is under way to renovate the Christian Science Church at Wolf's Lane and Colonial Avenue in the village.    The building was acquired last year for a $50,000 down payment by the Friends of the Pelham Library. A payment of $250,000 toward the acquisition cost was made last month, and the final payment of another $250,000 will be due next April. The rest of the total amount, to be raised from the community, Federal grants and businesses, will go toward reconstruction. The new library is to open in 1993.    Among several planned fund-raising events is a series of three lectures titled \\"Pelham Writers Speaking for a New Library,\\" to be held on Thursdays at 8 P.M. in the church. Admission is by donation of $10 to $25.    Inaugurating the series this Thursday will be Joe Klein, political columnist for New York magazine, whose topic will be \\"What Comes Next? America After the Hot and Cold Wars.\\" Mr. Klein recently covered elections in the Soviet Union, and Israel during the Persian Gulf war.    On May 23, Nicholas Lemann, national correspondent for The Atlantic and regular contributor to The New Republic, will discuss politics and race in America.   The final program on June 6 is called \\"A Friend Writes: Three Staff Members Take a Look at Life Between the Lines at The New Yorker.\\" They are Mark Singer, Lawrence Wechsler and John Bennet.    For reservations call 738-1779. BLESSING THE PETS     The Hammond Museum in North Salem will hold a Blessing of the Animals and the Land at 2:30 P.M. today in the Japanese Stroll Gardens. The free ceremony seeks to heighten concern for the environment.     Anyone who wishes to do so may take a plant to be blessed, or a pet -- properly leashed or in a carrier. The blessings will be administered by several clergymen. Among them will be the Rev. Barbara Pescan of the Unitarian Universalist Church in Redding, Conn.; the Rev. Bevan Leach of St. James Episcopal Church in North Salem; John Mortensen, a Zen Buddhist priest from Katonah, and Wendal Deer With Horns, a local Indian spiritual leader.    The museum is on Deveau Road off Route 124. In case of heavy rain, the event will be canceled. For more information, call 669-5033. WAVE HILL IMPRESSIONS     Wave Hill, the art and environmental center in the Bronx, recently commissioned four American photographers to record their impressions of the 28-acre estate. The results will go on exhibition Tuesday through Oct. 27. The 28-acre estate, its gardens, groves, buildings and views over the Hudson River have been captured in a photographic essay composed of 80 pictures.    Lois Conner's contribution is a series of studies emphasizing the romantic elements of the landscape. Her work is in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, and others.    The Museum of Modern Art recently featured a retrospective of Jan Groover's photographs. For the Wave Hill exhibition she has focused on the wild gardens and pathways, revealing nature in disorder. Her work appears in many collections, including those of the Corcoran Gallery in Washington and the Milwaukee Art Museum.    Stephen A. Scheer's double exposures, sometimes with artifical light, produce surreal images and the unusual effects for which he has attained his reputation. The Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Field Museum in Chicago and the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan collect his work.    Finally, Philip Trager, known for his architectural photography, has produced a portfolio of pictures evoking the serenity and order of the combined landscape and architecture. His work is represented in the Yale University Art Gallery, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Corcoran Gallery and the Museum of Modern Art.    Visiting hours are Tuesdays through Sundays from 10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. in the Glyndor and Wave Hill House Galleries. Admission to the grounds is $2 on weekends, or $1 for students and the elderly. Admission on weekdays is free. The center is at West 249th Street and Independence Avenue. Call (212) 549-3200 for directions or more information. SPRING PLANT SALE     Scheduled strategically just before Mother's Day, the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx will hold its spring plant sale Friday and Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. under the big tent next to the conservatory.    Among thousands of annuals, perennials, ferns, orchids, tropical and native plants for sale, there will be 146 species of iris, 11 kinds of day lilies and roses suitable for this climate, including Queen Elizabeth, Chicago Peace, Pink Parfait and Tournament of Roses. Astilbes, hostas and a large selection of herbs are also on the list.    Those who would like to take a guided nature walk around the twin lakes can do so at 10:30 A.M. The group will meet in the lobby of the Watson Building. The fee is $5. Admission to the plant sale is free.    The Botanical Garden is at 200th Street and Southern Boulevard.

Although its sincerity and tragedy are obvious, the character and motivations of the principals in the World War II triangle involving an English farm woman, her soldier-lover and the rough sergeant who helps destroy their fragile idyll remain as indistinct as a distant echo.One warms to the pastoral romance that develops between Glenda Jackson, as the self-sufficient farmer tending her lonely acres while her husband is a captive of the Japanese, and the errant, young private from a local base. A viewer accepts the eventual love and sex, her lover's decision to desert and her plan to dress him as her \\"sister\\" to avoid detection and gossip, among other things.Miss Jackson's portrayal is, at first, poignant and convincing as she projects dignity and understandable desire for the love and companionship she has long missed.But she is somewhat less than credible subsequently as the strong-willed, bickering woman who, for debatable reasons, creates problems and then suffers her somewhat childish lover's alienation because of them.It is difficult to entertain the idea that Oliver Reed, as the brutish broth of a sergeant, would barge in on the household to make loutish advances, and invite the \\"sister\\" to an Army Christmas dance and not quickly discover the masquerade. And it seems improbable that Brian Deacon, a newcomer from British TV in the role of the masquerader, would chance the dangers of near-rape as well as exposure as a deserter. He is youthfully handsome but emotionally shallow in a characterization that could benefit by further explanations.Michael Apted, the director","excerpt":"Robin Chapman, the scenarist, and Graham Cottle, the producer, who are also making their movie debuts, fitfully capture nuances of speech and manners as lovely and real as the muted colors of the film's English countryside.

Dave Stewart of the Oakland Athletics has strung together four consecutive seasons of winning 20 games or more. Is he nearing a record?      A. He's barely in the hunt if the major league mark is what he's aiming for. With four straight 20-victory seasons, Stewart is not even a third of the way to the record of 14 such seasons in a row set by Cy Young while pitching for Cleveland and St. Louis of the National League and Boston of the American League from 1891-1904. It would have been 15 straight if Young hadn't come up short with an 18-19 record in 1905.   Still, Young's record stretch includes a high of 36 victories in 1892 and a low of 20 in 1900. In five seasons during the streak, Young even eclipsed 30 victories. Chances are Stewart's pursuit of the Cy Young Award (which he's never won) will be more fruitful than his pursuit of the Cy Young streak. 20-Victory Streaks     Q.    Which pitchers since 1901, when the American League began, have been 20-game winners the most consecutive times in each league?      A. The pitchers known as Big Six and Big Train are the big deals when it comes to 20-victory seasons in a row since the turn of the century. The National League leader is Christy Mathewson, who never failed to win at least 22 games in a season for the New York Giants in the 12-year span of 1903-14. His season high was 37 victories in 1908. The American League leader is Walter Johnson, who never failed to win fewer than 20 games in a season for the Washington Senators in the 10 years from 1910-1919. His season high was 36 in 1913. Both pitchers were natural right-handers and both, naturally, are in the Baseball Hall of Fame.   Among left-handers, the leaders in consecutive 20-victory seasons also are Hall of Famers: Lefty Grove in the American League and Warren Spahn in the National. For the seven years from 1927-33, Grove won from 20 to 31 games a season for the Philadelphia Athletics. For the six years from 1956-61, Spahn won either 21 or 22 games a season for the Milwaukee Braves.   Seven other pitchers in the last 90 years have managed to link 20-victory seasons at least five times, starting with Joe McGinnity of the New York Giants (7 seasons from 1900-06) and including the following: Three-Finger Brown of the Chicago Cubs (6 from 1906-11)","excerpt":"Robin Roberts of the Philadelphia Phillies (6 from 1950-55); Ferguson Jenkins of the Cubs (6 from 1967-72); Grover Cleveland Alexander of the Phillies (5 from 1913-17); Carl Hubbell of the Giants (5 from 1933-37); and Catfish Hunter of the Oakland Athletics (4 from 1971-74) and New York Yankees (1 in 1975). Coaching Fraternity     Q.    A year ago, Bryan Murray was dropped as head coach of the Washington Capitals and replaced by his brother Terry. Was that a first in the National Hockey League?      A. Not only that, but it appears to have been a first in professional sports, certainly in the four major ones in this country. No pro baseball, basketball or football coach has been let go in favor of his brother, and the closest thing to this kind of brotherly change in the N.H.L. involved Lynn and Muzz Patrick with the Rangers.   Lynn coached the Rangers for 107 games from Dec. 21, 1948, through the following season. Three coaches followed before Lynn's brother Muzz took over for 105 games from Jan. 6, 1954, through the following season. Muzz served as head coach for another 34 games three coaches after that (September-December 1962), and eventually in the 1980-81 season Lynn's son Craig (nephew of Muzz) took over the Rangers in the first of his two coaching stints.   Of course, this was all part of an all-in-the-family scenario, for Lester Patrick was the founding father of the franchise, as well as the natural father of Muzz and Lynn and the grandfather of Craig.

Mr. Pak's feel for melodrama adds a piercing and thoughtful end note similar to the emotional gravity found in Stephen King novellas like &quot;The Body&quot; and &quot;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,&quot; both in Mr. King's collection &quot;Different Seasons.&quot; But it's Mr. Pak's respect for the actors that he's selected that seems to work hand-in-exoskeleton with the thematic mission of the protagonists in each chapter of &quot;Stories.&quot; It's this quality that links the film's segments closely to &quot;Different Seasons.&quot; The most startling aspect of &quot;Robot Stories&quot; is not the mix the filmmaker built from spare parts left on the curb, but Mr. Pak's evolving dramatic acumen. He's a talent with a future. — Elvis Mitchell Soulful Androids Who Endure Those Cold Humans"},{"year":"1933","title":"Description of flight","excerpt":"robot control failed fliers when lost over African peaks Robot Control Failed British Distance Fliers When Lost in Clouds Over African Peaks"},{"year":"1998","title":"NASA is about to send experimental probe into space to test some of favorite concepts of science fiction","excerpt":"robot craft will not only be driven by advanced ion propulsion engine, it will also take care of itself, navigating through space on its own and occasionally calling home to let people on Earth know how it is doing; spacecraft, called Deep Space 1, is to be testbed for new technologies that may be incorporated into next generation of probes sent to explore solar system and beyond in next century; drawing (M) Ion Propulsion of Science Fiction Comes to Life on New Spacecraft"},{"year":"1962","title":"Dr O P Perason clocks level-flight and dive speeds with movie camera SCIENCE NOTES: GIANT ROBOT","excerpt":"ROBOT DEMONSTRATED HUMMINGBIRD SPEED"},{"year":"1998","title":"Robots, already in widespread use in manufacturing and other commercial applications, are moving into everyday life","excerpt":"robot developers envision multibillion-dollar personal robotics industry, as recent advances in computer science, artificial intelligence and engineering couple with growing consumer acceptance of electronic gizmos; researchers see potential for personal robots that can perform one or more domestic tasks and help disabled people do simple chores; unlike hulking, mechanical tin cans in science fictions movies, tomorrow's personal robots are likely to be much smaller and look less like humans; small mobile robots, with whirring motors, flashing lights and occasional beeps, are beginning to appear in schools, toy stores, gift catalogues and even growing number of robot specialty shops; photos; chonology of 77-year history of robots (L) And Now, R2D2 for You, Too"},{"year":"1935","title":"Gimbels reproduces museum BARNUM MUSEUM REVIVED.","excerpt":"Robot Freaks Put on Exhibition by Department Store."},{"year":"2020","title":"How Churchill showed caring in the dark days of World War II.

The meager clues lead our men from New York to Beverly Hills and a motley crew of suspects, including several gangsters, a circus clown and another sinister and non-sinister characters.
