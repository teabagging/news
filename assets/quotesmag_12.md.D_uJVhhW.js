The Soviet director shows how lust for the golden sand transforms this rather weak, timid individual into a human tiger ready to murder the person who tries to force him to turn his ultimate find into the farm's treasury.In their desire for an all-round happy ending, however, the producers almost outdo Hollywood and their strivings hardly enhance the value of the picture.

It is her assertion that the most moral resolution of the situation in the Persian Gulf lies in the United States attack on Iraq. She is concerned that the citizens of Iraq would suffer far more severe injuries from months of devastating trade and diplomatic sanctions than from almost constant sorties of American and allied aircraft.   Let us take Ms. Lefkowitz's advice and examine the more profound or moral aspects of the war. When American soldiers marched off to kill and die on other battlefields, they were told they were making the world safe for democracy. Assuming Kuwait's al-Sabah family is restored to power, can we tell our fighting men and women that they have made the world safe for monarchy?   And although one might fancy declaring our purpose in the gulf to fight evil, it is clear to even the most ingenuous observer that our interests are not quite selfless. Indeed, as Ms. Lefkowitz points out, we must deal with human aggression and evil. However, responding in kind is ineffective, as proved by humankind's continual state of warfare.   It does not show a deep regard for human life that President Bush, Ms. Lefkowitz and many others have decided to give war a chance, without seeming to consider the lives that are inevitably lost. Too many people have died already, too many of \\"our boys\\" and too many of \\"them.\\" Perhaps Ms. Lefkowitz is correct. Perhaps war is the only inescapable solution to the gulf crisis. Nonetheless, it does us no good to fight while looking through rose-tinted night-vision goggles of philanthropy and \\"world betterment.\\" DAVID MORGAN SOLLORS  Great Neck, L.I., Feb. 3, 1991 First, How Do Children Feel About the War?","excerpt":"Rose-Tinted Goggles"},{"year":"2014","title":"For Valentine’s Day: a cosmetics bag featuring a work by an Australian painter","excerpt":"rose-tinted lip balm and glosses; a makeup palette for office and date night.

So it's easy to imagine that it could be emotionally arduous to create them. But the process, Ms. Spradlin says, has never been particularly contentious, until she and four dancers began rehearsing her newest work: the aptly named ''Survive Cycle,'' which is to have its premiere Tuesday night at Dance Theater Workshop. Ms. Spradlin began this quartet with the idea of exploring breakdowns. What started as a theme seems to have become a self-fulfilling prophecy. ''The process became a lot about misconnections and breakdowns as well,'' she explained. ''So at some point I just made the decision to try to bring that forward as something I was working with very directly: the relationship with people onstage, and also the people not onstage.'' She paused, laughing. ''Like me.'' Last week Ms. Spradlin and her dancers -- Cédric Andrieux, Walter Dundervill, Paige Martin and Tasha Taylor -- were still deciding what material would make the final cut. Remaining on the table are videos, shot by Glen Fogel, in which the performers talk explicitly about issues that arose during the dance's creation. It's not likely to be a he said/she said reality TV drama: Ms. Spradlin goes for visceral impact over narrative through lines in her work. ''Survive Cycle,'' which includes live music by Chris Peck, a landscape of shredded clothing and lots of tightly choreographed dance, should prove no exception.

It is broad comedy at its broadest, and often at its funniest. Mark Twain never did anything like it, but it is solemnly affirmed that if he were alive he would laugh at it, and prob???ly he would. Few people can resist an outright assault of burlesque if it goes far enough along the wide way of incongruity, absurdity and tumbling action. \\"A Connuecticut Yankee\\" goes as far as anything of its kind to date.The method of this production is the same as that of Mr. Fox's other film on Broadway, \\"Over the Hill.\\" As the latter makes a mass attack on lachrymal emotions, \\"A Connecticut Yankee\\" assaults the stronghold of laughter—and breaks it down. Both scorn subtlety, suggestion, delicacy. Both beat their way to their goals—and get there. The one prizes the flooding sob more than the timid tear, the other the loud laugh more than the discerning smile, and each is rewarded with what it seeks.There are some really irresistible scenes in \\"A Connecticut Yankee.\\" Its main idea, of course, offers many opportunities for hilarious fun, and a good number of these have been seized. There is skill and wit in parts of the picture, as well as slap-stick, and even the purely rough and tumble stuff is often such mockery as any man must laugh at. True, there are scenes in which the effort to be funny is too evident for the fun to run free, and sometimes the waving of the flag is just cheap stuff, but it's a long picture and much of its length is good for anybody's digestion.The comedy does not pretend to be a translation of what Mark Twain wrote. Its hero is a Yankee of 1921 who is inspired by Mark Twain's book and a clout on the head to go adventuring at King Arthur's court by way of a dream. Then some of the incidents of the book, with many others, including a Ford, motorcycles, slang, and references to prohibition, the recent war and various things of which Samuel L. Clemens knew nothing come teeming after each other. The knights of old would have thought Mark Twain's Yankee was out of style beside his 1921 successor.The picture has been made on a lavish scale. An announcement on the program states that every available motorcyclist around Los Angeles was drafted for the big battle scene, that 370 pounds of nitroglycerine were used to destroy a castle built in the hills, and that two miles of roadway were constructed for the march of the motorcycle army. The film seems to verify these statements, and others like them. It certainly was not made in a studio with stock properties.And, incidentally, it achieves some striking scenic effects. Emmett J. Flynn, who staged the production, had an eye for the spectacular as well as the massive and incongruous. He was successful in all three.The cast is excellent. Harry C. Myers makes a capital Yankee, adding considerable to the merriment of the picture by his pantomime. The others, especially Pauline Stark as the heroine, Charles Clary as King Arthur, William V.

THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1951","title":"to R Thomas POETRY PRIZE AWARDED","excerpt":"Rosemary Thomas Wins Twayne First Book Contest"},{"year":"1961","title":"WILLIAM KYRIAKYS and Radley Metzger, a new young writer-director-producer team, rate an A for effort and a solid B for their first feature, \\"Dark Odyssey.\\" Shot here in New York on a shoestring budget, with a small cast of unfamiliar faces, this thoughtful, unpretentious and creatively turned little drama (co-written with James Vlamos) describes the local vendetta of a young Greek sailor who jumps ship and finds shelter with a Greek-American family and a compassionate girl. Presented by Era K M Films (the new partners), it opened on Saturday at the Cameo, and thereby hangs a curious tale.Ready for release two years ago, the English-language project was thumbed-down locally without a Greek sound track—a long painstaking dubbing process. In both languages, two identical versions are now alternating at the Cameo, providing a unique sampling for lingering customers. Even in Hindustani, the picture would owe no apologies. Excellently photographed by Peter Erik Winkler, with a fine, brooding musical score by Laurence Rosenthal, it moves forward steadily with simple purposefulness.Obviously Messrs Kyriakys and Metzger have charted a contemporary Greek tragedy, with a primitive-minded hero, played by Athan Karras, stalking a family betrayer far from home. And the mellowing atmosphere of his Washington Heights sanctuary, with Old World Greek parents and two modern-minded daughters, is intended to contrast two cultures. This it does nicely, in a series of quiet vignettes underscored by lifelike dialogue, as one of the girls furtively dates a sunny American extrovert and the other steadfastly trails Mr. Karras.There's the rub. It's impossible to believe that the most murderous resolve wouldn't melt before this winsome, practical heroine, beautifully played by Jeanne Jerrems. Furthermore Mr. Karras, our hero — and hers (again, why?) — remains grim, taciturn and seething to the end. Finally, on the side of Greek tragedy, the picture clips off melodramatically, sidestepping cumulative strength and missing a heaven-sent chance for a real original, emotional wallop.On the American side of things, right here in our town, Mr. Winkler's clean, searching camera views of the George Washington Bridge area, various waterfronts, and canyon panoramas that pointedly dwarf the cast, are a joy to behold. Of the other cast members, David Hooks is an amiable sailor","excerpt":"Rosemary Torri, as Miss Jerrems' tart-tongued sister and Edward Brazier, as her suitor, do well indeed; and Nicholas and Ariadne Zapnoukayas (especially in later scenes) make persuasive parents.In itself, \\"Dark Odyssey\\" is not an occasion for cheering. But for a fresh, economical approach to an ancient dramaturgical formula, Messrs. Kyriakys and Metzger rate a warm welcome to the movie fold.

That's the saga of Mira Nair.   Miss Nair, the Indian director of the Academy Award nominee \\"Salaam Bombay!,\\" is bound for Uganda next week to put the finishing touches on her latest film, \\"Mississippi Masala.\\"   And to know just what is cooking with Miss Nair, it is necessary to know a soupcon about Indian cuisine.   Masala, she explained, \\"is a collection of hot spices of different colors.\\" So, she said, \\"Mississippi Masala,\\" which has among its stars the American actor Denzel Washington in the role of Demetrius and the newcomer Sarita Choudhury of Bangladesh as a young woman named Mina, \\"is an interspicial romance.\\"   The story revolves around an Indian family expelled from Uganda, with the rest of the Asians living there, in 1972 by the despotic ruler Idi Amin. Miss Choudhury plays the daughter","excerpt":"Roshan Seth, the Indian star who lent his formidable presence to films including \\"Gandhi\\" and \\"My Beautiful Laundrette,\\" portrays the father, a liberal lawyer, and Sharmila Tagore, who starred in Satyajit Ray's \\"Apu\\" trilogy (and is the grandniece of the great Indian author Rabindranath Tagore), plays the mother.   \\"This family find themselves in Greenwood, Miss., where they are poor relations of a richer Indian family who own a motel,\\" said Miss Nair, who wrote the screenplay with Sooni Taraporevala, her collaborator on \\"Salaam Bombay!\\" \\"And the father is sort of obsessed with suing the Government of Uganda for his property, and the daughter manages the motel.   \\"She begins a relationship with Demetrius, a young black man who is a carpet cleaner in the town. They sort of cross the border of color in both their communities, and when this relationship is discovered, it explodes tension in the black community and the Indian one and brings back memories of the Uganda that this family had left.\\"   Referring to the love between Mina and Demetrius, Miss Nair said: \\"That is the cornerstone that binds Africa and Mississippi and India and everything in the film. It is also about the father's obsession with Uganda and feeling personally betrayed because he was expelled by people he considered his own. It is very much about what is home and dislocation, and made especially more so because this is about Indians in Africa who have never known India -- and that is what Mina is, and Demetrius is an African-American who has never known Africa.\\"   Miss Nair, who began filming in late August in Greenwood, finished shooting 80 percent of \\"Mississippi Masala\\" on schedule in mid-October and returned to New York to edit that part of the film before moving on to Uganda, where she will begin 10 days of filming in Kampala on Dec. 9 after a rehearsal period.   \\"This is the first film to be shot In Uganda since John Huston made 'The African Queen,' \\" Miss Nair said. After a safari in Tanzania, she said, she plans to return to New York City in January to begin final editing.   She said she hopes to have \\"Mississippi Masala\\" ready in time for the Cannes International Film Festival next spring -- \\"if they invite us.\\" Jeff Goldblum as Jesus     How about Jeff Goldblum and David Lynch?   \\"The Fly\\" meets \\"Blue Velvet.\\"   Cinematically speaking, it sounds like a match made in a test tube -- in Twin Peaks.   But we're getting ahead of the story.    Actually, the versatile Mr. Goldblum, who has been seen on screen recently as the wild actor in the British comedy \\"The Tall Guy,\\" has been passing the autumn in Paris as Jesus.   Professionally speaking, that is.   His companions have been Bob Hoskins and Natasha Richardson, and the vehicle of their collaboration is a movie called \\"The Favor, the Watch and the Very Big Fish,\\" directed by the English film maker Ben Lewin.   \\"I play a pianist,\\" Mr. Goldblum said, tracing the route to his portrayal of Jesus. \\"I sort of suffer from identity delusions. Sometimes when I'm the piano player, I claim to be Frederic Chopin and sometimes other people, until I go for this girl and there's an incident and I go to jail.\\"   After three years behind bars, Mr. Goldblum encounters Bob Hoskins, playing a photographer for a religious artifacts store who is looking for a model for a series of pictures on the life of Jesus. In a twinkling, Mr. Goldblum seizes the opportunity to make some money, and the pictures become a hit.   \\"I become sort of a celebrity,\\" Mr. Goldblum said in summing up the picture, which is in production until the end of the month, \\"and I think it's the traditional boy finds girl, boy loses girl, boy becomes Jesus.\\"   Mr. Goldblum said he was drawn to the colorful, funny, passionate character he portrays and to the opportunity to work with Mr. Hoskins and Miss Richardson.   What he is thinking about next is working with Mr. Lynch on a film about Nikola Tesla (1856 to 1943), the Croatian-born electrician and inventor who worked briefly for Thomas Edison, plugged us into alternating current, and designed the power system at Niagara Falls, among other high-voltage feats.   \\"He was charismatic and unique, and his life crossed paths with Mark Twain and J. P. Morgan,\\" Mr. Gold blum said, noting that he started reading about Tesla some years ago after \\"someone said if anyone ever does anything about this guy, you should do him.\\"   Not long ago, Mr. Goldblum said, he heard that Mr. Lynch shared his interest in Tesla and had a script about the inventor. \\"I'd like to do anything with him,\\" Mr. Goldblum said of Mr. Lynch.   Speaking of his career in general, Mr. Goldblum said, \\"I just know I feel like I have a big appetite to do a lot of things I haven't done, and if I'm lucky, I'll keep getting the chance.\\" Nykvist Turns Director     Sven Nykvist, best known as cinematographer on 22 films by Ingmar Bergman and an Oscar winner for \\"Cries and Whispers\\" and \\"Fanny and Alexander,\\" is at work as a director.   For the last month, in southern Sweden, with a cast that includes such Bergman colleagues as Max von Sydow, Liv Ullmann, Erland Josephson and Ewa Froling, Mr. Nykvist has been filming \\"The Ox,\\" based on an actual event in the severe drought of the 1860's that drove many Swedes to the United States. \\"The Ox\\" tells the story of a man who stays behind with his wife and is driven to a desperate, brutal act of betrayal that wounds his family and their close-knit community.   The film is being produced by Jean Doumanian, a former producer of \\"Saturday Night Live.\\" At the Movies"},{"year":"1966","title":"USSR, Bulgaria and Czech charge US blocks progress coward nonproliferation treaty, Geneva conf","excerpt":"Roshchin blames US desire to keep open possibility of W Ger access to nuclear arms; Fisher rejects charges SOVIET SAYS U.S. BARS ATOM PACT; Accusation Made as Geneva Talks Near Adjournment"},{"year":"1966","title":"17-nation Geneva disarmament conf recesses for 5 wks","excerpt":"Roshchin earlier holds conf valuable in clarifying prospects and obstacles; Foster blames USSR for impasse in effort for nonproliferation treaty, citing USSR unwillingness to accept US assurances on NATO nuclear sharing; issues statement holding conf made gains; leaves for Washington; Trivedi holds Communist Chinese recent nuclear test shows its hostility to disarmament; urges any nonproliferation treaty ban further mfr of nuclear arms and provide for cuts in existing stockpiles Russian Sees Arms Talk Gain; Asserts Positions Are Clarified; In Statement Before Recess He Says Latest Round Was Not 'Utterly Fruitless'"},{"year":"1966","title":"Roshchin and reprs of Poland and Bulgaria rule out all talk on nonproliferation treaty so long as US wants to retain option of sharing nuclear arms within NATO","excerpt":"Roshchin notes that to USSR proliferation ban means arms must not be transferred to country not possessing them whereas to US it means transfer is permitted so long as restrictions are imposed on use; rejects Fisher suggestion to draft treaty language on undisputed points as giving 'illusion of progress,' SOVIET ADAMANT ON NUCLEAR PACT; Bars Negotiation Until U.S. Drops Sharing Concept"},{"year":"1969","title":"Geneva conf session","excerpt":"Roshchin says USSR remains ready to resume negotiations on treaty on gen and complete disarmament SWEDEN SUPPORTS RUSSIA ON SEABED; Opposes U.S. in Advocating Total Demilitarization"},{"year":"1967","title":"offer introduced before Geneva conf by Foster","excerpt":"Roshchin silent Soviet Silent on U.S. Offer"},{"year":"1967","title":"USSR rejects US concessions to Ger and Italy of 3-yr term of inspection by Euratom before Atomic Energy Agency assumes duties and abolishing nuclear powers veto over amendments to treaty","excerpt":"Roshchin, in conf with Foster, says USSR opposes submitting USSR-US draft leaving these articles blank SOVIET REBUFFS U.S. ON NUCLEAR TREATY"},{"year":"1976","title":"BAD GASTEIN, Austria, Jan. 22 (AP) &#8212","excerpt":"Rosi Antlermaier of West Germany, the leader in the World Cup ski standing, almost fell near the finish but recovered and won her first Cup race of the season today, the special slalom.

Since then, Clunies&#8208;Rosses have been the virtual monarchs over five and a half square miles of coconut palms, distributed over 27 islands in two atolls. The present Mr. Clunies&#8208;Ross, sometimes called Ross V, succeeded at 16 when his father was killed by Japanese bombs. After the war, a United Nations fact&#8208;finding mission visited the islands and described Mr. Clunies&#8208;Ross&#8217; rule as feudal and anachronistic, and no doubt it was, with Ross V, barefooted and bedaggered, exercising what authority got exercised. Britain formally transferred administration of the islands to Australia in 1955. Ross V, after years of rejecting Australian sovereignty, formally gave in in 1972 but retained title to the property. Now, after rejecting previous offers, he will cash in as well. The first thing Australia will have to do, apparently, is find out where Cocos is for sure and count the newborn democrats.

The Cinderella in Rossini's \\"Cenerentola\\" has neither a fairy godmother nor a magical pumpkin carriage. In fact, tonight's \\"Great Performances\\" presentation of the opera buffa includes dark elements of child abuse and embezzlement. But no matter. Cinderella gets her prince and, equally important, she gets an opportunity to be sung by Cecilia Bartoli, currently the  mezzo-soprano darling of the promotional mills in the music business.         This production, taped in November at the Brown Theater in Houston, imports from Italy Roberto De Simone's staging for the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. The set is relatively spare, dominated by a large bifurcated staircase that makes for somewhat clumsy entrances and exits. But there is nothing unwieldy about the Rossini score, which, with Bruno Campanelli conducting the Houston Symphony and  Grand Opera Chorus, ripples along buoyantly or tenderly with beguiling inventiveness.
