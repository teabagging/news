That fact is to be insisted upon as first in importance in making up the record. What we have here is an impressive demonstration of the fact that a masterpiece may be put into the movies without mauling. The producers are to be credited with‚Äîor better, glorified for‚Äîa thoroughly conscientious attempt to be faithful to the spirit and letter of their original. And they have suc-ceered to a notable degree. That is perhaps not to be wondered at, for people who have intelligence enough to know they have in hand a great story for exploitation unspoiled may be assumed to have intelligence enough to devise the means of telling it.At this point, for no reason at all, the information shall be vouchsafed that this is a foreign film, made in Italy by the Unione Cinematramica Italiana with an Italian to direct and a French actor in the title r√¥le.So Cyrano lives, loves and dies on the screen of the Colony very much as he has on the stage of all the civilized world. It is Rostand's hero himself who swaggers among his cadets of Gascoigne, who fights off a hundred men because Roxane has smiled upon him, who breathes through the proxy of Christian the love messages forbidden to his own tongue, and who, at the end wounded to death, rises to brandish his sword against its messenger and go down with his \\"white plume\\" of honor unsoiled.That the producers have been able to put Edmond Rostand's \\"Cyrano\\" on the screen, and not some pallid and denatured caricature of it, is all the more notable because at first thought it would seem impossible. The story, the wonderful story, replete with the quickening movement of \\"sword and cloak\\" romance freshly and spontaneously told, is there, of course, for the screen to tell. That much is a free gift from the genius of the author.But there is so much more to \\"Cyrano de Bergerac\\"","excerpt":"its fantasy; its humor, now robust and now whimsical; its pathos; above all, the delicate imagery of its poetical text. The words Rostand put into the mouth of his hero on the stage are golden words and his phrases flash like quicksilver. What can the screen do with these?Well, the notable thing about this production is that it succeeds in conveying some of these intangibles, and by so doing offers food for thought as to whether it has not enlarged what have appeared to be the limits of moving picture presentation. Rostand, as well as telling a story, has sung a song, and the producers have succeeded in catching at least a substantial echo of its music.The present reviewer does not wish to exaggerate this aspect of the presentation. He recognizes that there is difficulty in estimating it, for he has some familiarity with the play in its original form and it may be that memory supplies something of what is lacking. Nevertheless, it is certain the stimulus for memory is there, and that certainty adds to the impression that even for those making acquaintance with the long-nosed Gascon for the first time, a sense of the more subtle values of the play is there if they will take it.Some of these values can be conveyed by the intelligent directing and acting always noticeable. For some others, the screen has no method but the use of sub-titles. It is not the ideal method but the producers have done the best they could with it. In many cases, notably at the more important points, they have quoted from the original text. There are more sub-titles than are usually found in a photoplay. Judged under ordinary standards, this would be considered a blemish. But these titles were written by Edmond Rostand.The production is in colors through-out. That fact in retrospect is less important than in anticipation. There are many times when the colors add a pictorial value. There are moments when some happy combination of colors, costume and background flashes a pleasurable effect that is outside and supplementary to the dramatic value. But, to balance this, there are not infrequent moments when a sense of unreality in the coloring distracts the eye and diverts attention from the progress of events.Perhaps before this tribute should have been paid to the value of the contribution of Pierre Magnier, who plays the r√¥le of Cyrano. Those who may believe the methods of subtlety and repression have no value for screen purposes are recommended to watch him at work and learn. Possessed of the authority and economy of means belonging to a well-trained actor of the French school, he accomplishes much with little apparent effort. He is never out of the character and one feels like blessing him for the exaggerations he has omitted. One would be tempted to say the closing scenes are more affecting in the photoplay than on the stage, if one could forget the absence of a voice, but if there is any justification for the temptation at all, it lies in the sincere and moving power of his acting in the final scenes. Linda Moglia is a Roxane who as the play progresses gets a deeper and deeper hold on her audience, and Angelo Ferrari is a satisfactory figure as Christian. The whole production speaks for the excellent taste and evident proficiency of Augusto Genina's direction.

On this still and blistering night, listeners in shirtsleeves watched musicians, conductor and soloist in shirtsleeves fight for the energy and concentration this all-Mozart program demanded.    Andre Previn, now a neighbor of the Caramoor summer festival, conducted the Orchestra of St. Luke's. He also played the piano in Mozart's C-minor Concerto. Joshua Bell brought his youthful muscle to the G-major Violin Concerto, and at the beginning there was Mozart's Symphony in A, the No. 29.    The last is a hot-weather friend. It wastes no time on formal introductions or reluctant farewells. With its wonderful grace comes a cheerful abruptness.

Mr. Bell is the second young American violinist to play Mozart in the New York area within the last few days. His appearance made an interesting contrast to Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg's at Mostly Mozart on Thursday when she played the A-major Concerto. In native talent, they are not that far apart. In purpose and method, they are.    Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg is both buoyed and weighed down by her public persona, one in which extravagant stage mannerisms have their precise musical equivalent. So often on Thursday, it was her idiosyncratic feeling for Mozart that we heard. Mr. Bell's path is more direct. At Mostly Mozart, one thought, \\"What a striking personality she is.\\" On Saturday, one thought, \\"How simply Mozart's music speaks.\\"    Did Mr. Previn give us an eventful evening? It depends on what you mean by \\"event.\\" He is as scrupulous and caring a pianist as he is a conductor. He also wrote his own cadenzas, handsome ones. His gestures invite a natural legato from his players and yet insure their precision. It doesn't take long for listeners to realize that they will neither be dragged into excess nor be led off on some heaven-storming charge.    Mr. Previn is above all a civilized musician. He does not shake the earth. Professional to the bone, he gives an aura of informed and deeply felt respect for everything in front of him.

collaborator on memoirs of public men. One of them, the autobiography of a former Soviet ambassador to Washington, was chosen a decade ago by your publication as one of the best books of the year. So I feel comfortable taking issue with the distinguished writer Cynthia Ozick in what seems to me an unwarranted criticism of Joseph Lelyveld's ''Omaha Blues'' (April 3), a memoir of his own rather extraordinary life, both public and private.    I hasten to say that I have never met him and have no professional connection to The Times whatever, although we both served as correspondents in India, at different times and for different publications. I found that Lelyveld's determined attempt to search down the sources of his professional lapses and personal pain presented a refreshing and often moving contrast not only to the grand pooh-bahs of your own occasionally bloviating newspaper but to others. It would be invidious to name names, but the authors of such memoirs should heed George Orwell. In reviewing the autobiography of Salvador Dal√≠, one of the most artistically accomplished self-promoters of the last century, he wrote: ''Autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful. A man who gives a good account of himself is probably lying, since any life when viewed from the inside is simply a series of defeats.'' Lelyveld must have realized that, and Ozick is mistaken in criticizing him as a superior sort of Mr. Gradgrind.    Ozick lives a rich interior life that, by her admission in your paper only the previous Sunday, is enhanced by her schedule of staying up until 3 a.m. and rising at noon or later. It seems well suited to mining her own personal and literary experience, and her great talent lies in drawing so many shades of meaning from it in prose that jumps off the page. But I truly doubt Ozick has a clear conception of the active kind of life Lelyveld has lived in the public arena, and how it has been affected by private, darker shadows. I do not fault her for this. But I do fault her, and perhaps the editors of your own weekly (who have improved it immeasurably by giving much wider latitude to writers like her), for not applying one of the basic principles of reviewing.    Many years ago I reviewed books for The Times Literary Supplement","excerpt":"its fine editor later became one of your daily reviewers. At that time, it was probably the best such publication in the world, and he had one overriding lesson: Judge books, articles, writings of any kind on their own merits.    Lelyveld has written his own kind of book; he can do no other. He deserves to be judged by the goals he has set himself and his own methods for achieving them. If Ozick finds his goals and methods unworthy, she certainly has the right to say so (although by criticizing a journalist's book for its concern with facts, she might find herself in a rather uncomfortable position in this or any newspaper). I would not want anything different in her own brilliant writing, but she might have tried to arise just a bit earlier, and extend a slightly longer and wider reach through her own exquisitely rich imagination toward that Other that we, as journalists especially, are enjoined to try to understand.

By the time it disbanded at the close of 1977, Return to Forever had etched a place in popular culture, complete with arena tours and Top 40 albums (one of which, ''Romantic Warrior'' on Columbia, would eventually be certified gold). Moving away from the band, Mr. Corea, above, briefly reconnected with its fluttering early sound; in 1978 he recorded a pair of solo albums with the former Return to Forever members Joe Farrell (reeds) and Steve Gadd (drums) and a sharp new bassist, Eddie Gomez. An array of projects have preoccupied Mr. Corea in the years since -- for a crash course, splurge on ''Rendezvous in New York'' (Image Entertainment), which chronicles a reunion-heavy 2001 Blue Note residency on 10 DVD's -- but Return to Forever has rarely re-entered the picture. That's changing now, somewhat: Mr. Corea's most recent album, ''The Ultimate Adventure'' (Stretch), pointedly evokes his early-70's sound. And next week at the Blue Note, he introduces something called Forever Returns, with Mr. Moreira and Mr. Gomez. The absence of Mr. Clarke undercuts the premise a bit, but the music should soar nonetheless.

A Harvard scholar of human rights policy assesses the new nemesis of our age and tries to determine what offenses against our system might be allowed in order to preserve that system -- under what circumstances, for instance, we can hold suspects without trial or counsel, or on what evidence we can start pre-emptive wars.    DEVIL IN THE MOUNTAIN: A Search for the Origin of the Andes, by Simon Lamb. (Princeton University, $29.95.) A delightful romp with heroic geology, in which the author conveys the inner workings of a modern science without neglecting the adventures in climbing, driving, slogging and drilling.   And Bear In Mind"},{"year":"2004","title":"(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)    EATING CROW, by Jay Rayner. (Simon & Schuster, $23.) This fantasy, by a London restaurant critic who has certainly read Evelyn Waugh, concerns a (fictional) restaurant critic who has undergone a conversion to apologizing for his offensive conduct, to such √©clat that soon the United Nations sends him around the world to apologize for international grievances of which he understands nothing.    RIVERS OF GOLD: The Rise of the Spanish Empire, From Columbus to Magellan, by Hugh Thomas. (Random House, $35.) Thomas, author of ''The Spanish Civil War'' (1961), concentrates here on the mere 30 years between Columbus's first contact and Magellan's circumnavigation to address the extraordinary speed and scope of Spain's imperial expansion as part of Europe's amazing rise to world power in the Renaissance.    ORDINARY WOLVES, by Seth Kantner. (Milkweed, $22.)

WAKE UP, SIR! by Jonathan Ames. (Scribner, $23.) In this laugh-out-loud, neo-Wodehouse novel for the recovery era, an eccentric, alcoholic writer, needing help of every kind except financial, employs a gentleman's gentleman named Jeeves -- perhaps the very same one -- who may, however, be only imaginary. A plot of fine inanity develops, set in an artists' colony, where the hero improbably acquires a sounder grasp on things and people.    AN UNFINISHED SEASON, by Ward Just. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) Just's 14th novel, whose cast here encapsulates the ethos of 1950's Chicago and its suburbs, where the author himself grew up, brings to life a Midwestern coming-of-age story in which the narrator encounters an adult world full of suggested betrayals and closely held secrets.    SERIOUSLY, by Lucia Nevai. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) This assured first novel lands its yearning young heroine, Tamara, in upstate New York, rebounding from a life deranged by her crazy mother, who burned the house down and with it herself and Tamara's father and younger sister. Her story unfolds episodically, building toward a moment that finds her surrounded by admirers and ex-lovers.    PUBLIC ENEMIES: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34, by Bryan Burrough. (Penguin Press, $29.95.) A colorful history of the mobile, heavily armed, self-glamorizing desperadoes called forth by the Depression and of the government's response, organized by the rigid, brilliant, incorruptible and ultimately creepy J. Edgar Hoover.    JEROME ROBBINS: His Life, His Theater, His Dance, by Deborah Jowitt. (Simon & Schuster, $40.) A grand survey of the great and deservedly popular choreographer of ballet and Broadway, as well as a personal examination of a radically unhappy man; at 57 he could call himself ''a Jewish ex-commie fag who had to go into a mental hospital.''

''The Master'' is as much about the life of a writer and the artistic process as it is about his struggle with homosexual desires. To leave the latter out would be dishonest, but to say it defines the novel strikes me as myopic.

The time is a dreamlike morning, in the summer of 1931, and the northern Swedish countryside is so green that the fertility seems almost oppressive. A father is shaving, watched by his tiny daughter who is fascinated by what is‚Äîto her‚Äîa mysterious rite. One after another, several small boys jump off a barn roof flapping cheese-cloth wings‚Äîtheir determination to fly is doomed, but cushioned by a haystack. In an abandoned house nearby, a young man tries without success to hypnotize a pliant girl. Someone observes: \\"What a nice day this would be if it were Sunday.\\"It's actually Tuesday and the community of Adalen is sinking into the kind of gentle delirium that overtakes a man who is slowly freezing to death.Thus begins \\"Adalon 31,\\" Bo Widerberg's sun-dappled film about a strike 38 years ago that erupted into such violence it toppled Sweden's Conservative government and brought into power the Social Democrats, who have remained in office almost continuously ever since.\\"Adalen 31,\\" which was awarded the Grand Jury Prize (in effect, the second prize) at this year's Cannes Film Festival, was shown last night at the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall. It will be repeated there today at 6:30 P.M.The film is the Swedish director's sixth, but only his third to be seen here. \\"Raven's End,\\" which I missed, was an entry at the 1965 New York Film Festival, and \\"Elvira Madigan,\\" which I did see, was at the 1967 festival and later had a very successful commercial release.Widerberg is an enthusiastic but slightly schizoid director, torn between his loudly stated political activism and a barely controlled passion for visual images so lush they are intoxicating in a numbing way. Curiously, \\"Adalen 31\\" works just because of this duality.The pastoral beauty gives ironic perspective to the growing intensity of the strike‚ÄîI kept thinking throughout the film that if I had to starve in a strike, I couldn't imagine a lovelier (or more unlikely) setting in which to do it. At the same time, the naive but sincere social purpose of the film constantly gives strength to its lyricism.Most importantly, Widerberg defines his drama in terms of people and vignettes that are cryptically simple without ever being banal. To be sure, the management representatives are evil in their arrogance. \\"We have to think of the welfare of our shareholders, one dark-suited man says piously as he calls in the army to protect his scabs. At the same time, the strikers are as decent and noble as those in any 1930 agitprop drama.The style is familiar‚Äîsuch as cross-cutting between the heavily laden dinner table of the factory manager and the more meager one at the home of a striker‚Äîbut the specifics are mostly true and often as funny and touching as the poor young man who tries desperately to effect a seduction through hypnosis. The optimism of Widerberg's light-filled images (which are almost presumptuous in their evocation of the Renoirs, p√®re et fils) are balanced by the film's undeviating march toward its violent climax, which is simply and tersely staged.It too, however, is so beautiful that I think even Widerberg must have been somewhat self-conscious about it. He adds a closing title to the effect that although the events at Adalen resulted in the establishment of a welfare state, \\"equality has not yet been achieved.\\"\\"Adalen 31,\\" which will be released here later by Paramount Pictures, is determined that we shall not be too dazzled by sense impressions to get its message. I wasn't, and I suspect that if Widerberg ever resolves the conflict within his esthetic impulse, his films will be a lot less interesting.

Hand a similar decoration to Carol Reed, who has directed it with the same grim urgency as his \\"Night Train,\\" and to a thoroughbred cast for a flawless performance. \\"The Girl in the News\\" has not the headlong haste and violence of its predecessor","excerpt":"its impact comes rather from the relentless accumulation of small events which twice bring an innocent young nurse under the shadow of the gallows. Its tension increases like the tightening of a steel spring and it snaps only at the last moment.As the young woman twice accused, Nurse Graham is first brought to book for the death of a querulous female invalid who took an overdose of sedative and left unexplained certain incriminating circumstances. Acquitted despite the doubts of her own attorney, the nurse unwittingly steps into a trap when the wife of an invalid offers her employment. Thus when the wife and her paramour, the butler, dispose of the husband by using the identical sedative, the nurse's guilt is taken for granted. That the illicit lovers nearly succeed until an ironic twist betrays them gives the film its hectic pulse.Like the Englishman he is, Mr. Reed is a very devil at creating terror by contrast. The sense of impending disaster he allows to accumulate behind the commonplaces of small talk of a barrister's flat, and the murder itself gains in enormity when set against the archaic and time-slowing formalities of an English court or the politely isolated manners of his characters. Camera and sound track are constantly used with decisive effect. When a chambermaid takes tea to the already slain husband, the butler's hand momentarily dims the radio to hear her scream of discovery; a playful kitten pawing at the hem of a nightgown relates an invalid's painful progress to a forbidden medicine chest, and the courtroom sequences are clean of needless mumbo-jumbo. Characters, humorous or sinister, are revealed in a moment's flash. Mr. Reed keeps to the point.The performances are extraordinarily good. Margaret Lockwood's young lady in distress is forthright and true from moment to moment; Barry K. Barnes plays the young attorney with clipped precision, and Emlyn Williams adds another character to his series of malevolent portraits as the butler. To single out others would be an injustice to a cast that is perfect from top to bottom. Bring out the smelling salts, folks. Another spellbinding English thriller has come to town!

It demonstrates how a close-knit network of Nazi agents operates‚Äîhow a soldier's remark to his girl friend about a suspicious transfer of his unit tips the spies, how an innocent-looking bookseller in an English town guides an espionage ring and how a pattern of information is winnowed through great resource. And it is climaxed by a splendid representation of a commando raid on a French coastal town, with the British suffering grim and heavy losses because the enemy was forewarned and prepared.\\"Next of Kin\\" was put together to do something more important than entertain‚Äîa necessity which placed a rigid premium upon reality and credibility.

And that's its point.For the American prints, which Universal is distributing commercially, J.

In fact, the majority of the prisoners in \\"Concentration Camp\\" are not those alleged enemies of the State, the Jews, but simple German workers who had the courage to talk back to an arm-band, stubborn bourgeoisie, with a certain political faith and the backbone to stand up for it, and a sprinkling of innocent bystanders who had the misfortune to get into the way of some Storm Trooper's drunken brawl.In any case, the riffraff forces of lawlessness which have recently been loosed upon the world enjoy a sadistic Sabbat in \\"Concentration Camp,\\" and the only piece of cinematic comfort tossed to us at the end is the valor of the workers in an airplane factory, who raise clenched fists and vote for a strike in the rather prominent teeth of a Nazi spellbinder.

The acting of Rodolfo de la Serra, as the heroic sergeant whose good qualities are not appreciated by his moody wife (Celia Gamis) is competent, as is that of Alberto Mendoza in the role of a corporal who forms the other point of the fatal triangle.

Across the United States, so-called album-oriented rock (AOR) radio stations are playing an increasing amount of older material, sometimes as high as 80 percent. In some cities, these album-rock stations now face direct competition from a new kind of oldies format -''classic rock,'' which draws exclusively on the 1960's and 1970's staples of album rock.   ''Rock oldies are in,'' said Jeff Pollack, whose Jeff Pollack Communications is a consultant for 40 stations in the United States, including about 20 album-rock stations. ''In the last year, there has been a significant increase in the amount of classic rock being played.''

Intriguing street names have drawn generations of visitors to the older sections of London, in roughly the same spirit, I imagine, that drew Marcel Proust to the place names of his Combray and Balbec.   One drizzly morning, in search of things past and equipped with a ''Dictionary of City of London Names,'' by Al Smith (Arco, 1970), ''The Streets of London,'' by S. Fairfield (Macmillan, London, 1983) and Christopher Hibbert's ''London: The Biography of a City'' (Penguin, 1980), I took the Underground east to Aldgate (from either the Saxon eald meaning old, or ael-gate, open to all). Geoffrey Chaucer lived above this oldest gate in the city, but since 1761 there has been no gate there to live above. However, the Aldgate pump, on the site of a communal well, is a London landmark.   A few steps from Aldgate is Houndsditch, which, according to John Stow's 1598 ''Survey of London,'' served as a repository for dead dogs. However, Mrs. Fairfield points out that ''every ditch in medieval London must have been similarly abused'' and suggests that hunting dogs were kenneled in the vicinity. These days, no dogs roam Houndsditch","excerpt":"its main features are a department store and a parking lot.

That ''Brokeback'' is a landmark is a matter of empiricism","excerpt":"its merits as a work of art are a matter of taste. What has gone missing is that this is also that rare American film that seamlessly breaches the divide between the political and the personal, the past and the present. Here, against the backdrop of the great American West, that mythic territory of rugged individualism and the Marlboro Man, is a quietly devastating look at masculinity and its discontents.      Jack and Ennis, the lovers played by Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger, marry unhappily, but their wives pose far less of a real threat to their happiness and physical well-being than do other men -- those overbearing fathers, bullying bosses, leery strangers and lead-pipe-wielding thugs who shadow their affair from start to heartbreaking end. On Brokeback Mountain, away from what Whitman called ''the clank of the world,'' Jack and Ennis are free to follow their own (Whitman again) ''paths untrodden.'' The mountain becomes their lost paradise, a realm of absolute freedom separate from the law, society and, most radically, the yoke of identity. On Brokeback, the two men are neither straight nor gay, much less queer; they are lovers, which probably accounts for the category confusion that has greeted the film.

Dressed in dark uniforms, they solemnly climb a long, dim staircase. And while the priests who are their masters gaze sadly down at them from windows and niches, like paintings framed in centuries of patient grief, each boy approaches a carved portrait bust of the school's honored founder and spits at it‚Äî as hard as he can‚Äîuntil spittle drips from its noble aquiline nose.To catch all the spirit of Bellocchio's film one needs to see it all. But this sequence, with its intricate interweaving of beauty and disgust, its deeply elegiac sense of satire, its gorgeously ceremonial invocation of what it most despises, will do for starts. There is a sense in which the entire movie is an elaborate put-on","excerpt":"its most private moments, theatrically staged demonstrations; and that sense typifies the kind of movie that this director, with three highly individualistic films now to his credit, seems committed to making.Like his \\"Fists in the Pocket\\" (1966) and the popular \\"China Is Near\\" (1967), Bellocchio's present film deals with the younger members of a relatively closed society from which the crying need‚Äî and the ultimate impossibility‚Äîis escape. In this case the social unit is a miserable boys' school for rich unteachables run by priests, like a medieval fortress in the midst of a modern city. The movie follows the academic year from the school's opening (a vicious son being deposited by his vile dad) through Christmas recess to the end of the spring term. But its structure is not so much temporal as spatial, or perhaps, spiritual‚Äîand \\"In the Name of the Father\\" maligns several kinds of father at various removes and at many levels of authority.One student (Yves Beneyton) leads a revolt, ostensibly in the name of science and progress, and he uses the school play‚Äîin a brilliant and terrifying and most improbable conceit‚Äîas a means of mass persuasion. But he is himself a demagogue, a rational madman, a Frankenstein recruiting monsters ‚Äî and he is no less evil, though somewhat more potent, than the school's vice rector (Renato Scarpa), who is his only serious adversary.The film thus represents a closed system, in which the lines and the actors may change but the horror remains. \\"In the Name of the Father\\" is a work of extraordinary boldness and fantastic invention. But its dramatic limitations are such that the boldness declines into bravado and the invention mostly extends variations on a monotonous theme.However, I can think of a dozen sequences together where the film takes magnificent life, and if any movie could be no more than the sum of its beauties, \\"In the Name of the Father\\" would take the prize simply on quantity. With its students locked in their cells each night, its priests in helpless disarray, its kitchen hands in sullen discontent, a mad dog roaming its corridors and a meek assistant master scrawling obscene graffiti on the dining hall walls‚ÄîBellocchio's prep school is not quite the perfect image of the prison of our lives. But it is at times an impressive distorting mirror; and at times, a most intensely lyrical freak show.\\"In the Name of the Father\\" played last night in the New York Film Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.

But what the film does show is the swirling pressures of the lower depths out of which he emerged, and it shows them with exacerbating truth. For all its unloveliness it has beauty and breadth and heart.Gorky's school lay outside the pillared porticos of the university itself. His dormitory was the verminous waterfront of Kazan; his instructors, the ragged graybeards with the folk-wisdom of those who neither read nor write; his classroom, the baker's hovel loud with the slapping of dough and the grunting of pigs. Significantly, his one excursion amid the intellectuals was bitterly disillusioning. Rather, his inchoate resentments were converted into a bright, fierce faith by the vagabond dispossessed who shared his bread and shelter.Perhaps in this one catches not so much Gorky's inner struggle for equilibrium as one does the outer forces which molded his belief. These the camera has caught magnificently: the exultant surge of movement when the riverfront derelicts save the cargo of a sinking boat, the rhythmic slapping of the dough-smeared hands in the baker's shop, the childish cruelty and cunning of the drunken baker, the episode of the befriended kitten. As Gorky, N. Valvert playes with limited range but intensity; as the porcine baker, S. Kayukov gives a brilliantly satirical performance.

(Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.) Even as he offers a lengthy and scathing history of the papal institution, the author explains why he has ''never even considered'' leaving the Roman Catholic Church, arguing that the papacy -- despite its flaws -- remains a symbol of Christian unity that conscientious believers can support while still being in ''loyal opposition'' to the pope. Last year in the Book Review, Jack Miles found this a ''candid, richly informative and perfectly timed book.''    When the Emperor Was Divine, by Julie Otsuka. (Anchor, $9.95.) This muted first novel follows the fortunes of a Japanese-American family sent from their comfortable California home to an internment camp in Utah during World War II. Last year our reviewer, Michael Upchurch, said, ''What impresses you most is how much Otsuka is able to convey -- in a line, in a paragraph -- about her characters' surroundings, about their states of mind and about the mood of our country at a time of crisis.''    The Reckless Mind: Intellectuals in Politics, by Mark Lilla. (New York Review, $14.95.) These essays about why so many brilliant and influential intellects have made terrible political choices are animated by a sense of disappointment that the Heideggers, Benjamins and Foucaults of the world were so indifferent to the barbarity of the 20th century. ''Lilla has a gift for nimble exposition, and each study in his collection is illuminating, often revelatory,'' Sunil Khilnani wrote here in 2002.    Jesse James: Last Rebel of the Civil War, by T. J. Stiles. (Vintage, $16.) In his heavily revisionist biography, the author maintains that James's early experiences as a Confederate guerrilla and death squad member shaped his later career as an outlaw. Far from the daring bandit of legend who robbed the rich and gave to the poor, James is portrayed as a ruthless, impulsive killer driven by a desire to defeat the goals of Reconstruction. This account ''is so carefully researched, persuasive and illuminating that it is likely to reshape permanently our understanding of its subject's life and times,'' Richard E. Nicholls said here last year.    Bet Your Life, by Richard Dooling. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) In his fourth novel, Dooling, a writer and lawyer based in Omaha, sends three insurance investigators (two men and the woman they both lust after) on a crusade against ''viatical'' policies, in which cash-strapped AIDS and cancer patients sell their policies at deep discounts to pools of ghoulish investors. ''Dooling is a maverick talent'' who is ''excited by ideas and brimming with research,'' Mark Costello wrote in these pages in 2002.    The Mulberry Empire: Or, The Two Virtuous Journeys of the Amir Dost Mohammed Khan, by Philip Hensher. (Anchor, $15.) This sweeping novel, an act of homage to the 19th century's literary greats, tells of Britain's disastrous adventure in Afghanistan, which began in 1839 and ended several years later in the British Empire's worst military defeat. Its ''plotting is smooth","excerpt":"its observations are acute; and the hundred or so minor and major characters are beautifully drawn,'' Jason Goodwin said here last year.    Nine Horses: Poems, by Billy Collins. (Random House, $12.95.) Collins, who has just completed his two-year tenure as the nation's poet laureate, disregards assonance, alliteration, wordplay, an exotic vocabulary and other standard tools of versification in favor of humor, a surreal imagination and a conversational style that highlights his no-clutter aesthetic. ''One appeal of the typical Collins poem is that it's less able to help you memorize it than to help you to remember, for a little while anyway, your own life,'' Mary Jo Salter wrote in these pages last year.    Divided Loyalties: How the American Revolution Came to New York, by Richard M. Ketchum. (John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $16.) In a tale of ambivalent revolutionaries, the author reveals the private as well as public divisions between rebel and loyalist leading to the Revolutionary War, best exemplified in the turmoil among New York City's 25,000 inhabitants in 1774. ''Ketchum is a vivid storyteller'' who ''weaves a complex but forceful narrative web from many diaries and memoirs,'' Gil Troy wrote here in 2002. The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution, by Barnet Schecter (Penguin, $16), views New York, according to Troy, ''as the keystone to understanding'' the war. His account ''reinforces the lessons that our freedoms had to be earned, and were not guaranteed.''

A new rule just approved by Congress aims to strengthen the agency's hand. It involves lawsuits in which the plaintiffs contend that a product caused death or a disabling injury like blindness. Starting Jan. 1, a company will have to tell the commission when three such lawsuits in a two-year period are either settled in court or out of court in a plaintiff's favor.    It's a big advance. At present, hazards can easily be concealed when suits are settled and case records sealed as part of the agreement. But the new rule still gives companies room to hide. Under the law's two-year, three-lawsuit criterion, for example, a company that settled two death claims on a product in 1991 and a third claim in 1993 would not be obliged to alert the commission. Moreover, many years may elapse between the filing of a lawsuit and its resolution.   If the new rule doesn't quickly improve reporting, Congress will need to tighten it further.

Buck struck up a conversation with the captain of a Norwegian cargo boat. We repaired to a bar, where the two men drank whisky and I had a root beer.

It was Berlioz's final work, yet he lived seven grim years after completing it. In his old age, he was all but forgotten in his  country, known mostly as a critic. How he could have written such music in an atmosphere of utter futility is a wonder.         For the most part, \\"Beatrice\\" is done with filigree lightness. Its melodies are long, elegant and memorable","excerpt":"its orchestration is bracing and precise. The central characters' mix of intellectual cynicism and emotional naivete is captured from the first tumbling bars of the overture. Occasionally, Berlioz touches on darker chords and themes. Writing his own libretto, he introduces a character named Somarone, a pompous, amateurish Kapellmeister who foists a \\"Grotesque Epithalamium,\\" or wedding ode, on the unsuspecting Shakespeareans. He is a tribute to the busybodies who made Berlioz's life an artistic hell.

A6     Top German Rejects Turkey   Klaus Kinkel, the Foreign Minister of Germany, told Turkish leaders in Ankara that although Turkey ''belongs to Europe,'' the country's record on everything from human rights to the economy made its entry into the European Union impossible for the foreseeable future. Membership in the Union is Turkey's foremost foreign policy goal, and some fear that rejection will fan Islamist sentiment.

Officials said they did not know if the canister actually contained the nerve gas.

Most critics treated B-movies with freezing contempt, cin√©astes rarely gave them a second thought and, to this day, only a few maverick film historians have bothered to discuss these quickie classics, which from the early forties through the late fifties could always be caught in derelict metropolitan theaters located between penny arcades and tattoo parlors.The very best of the B's were made on workhouse budgets under coolie conditions by the likes of Val Lewton, Andr√© de Toth, Rudolph Mate and Roy Rowland‚Äîmodest, movie-wise, endlessly inventive craftsmen who would take a hopelessly hack assignment and turn it into 95 fast minutes of sharp detailing, understated performing and hard-nosed truth. They went after action, atmosphere and nervy, offbeat characterization, using their junk material, as the film critic Manny Farber has said, \\"to capture the unworked-over immediacy of life before it's been cooled down by art.\\"Right now, as for the last 20-odd years, hundreds of these shoestring miracles continue to show up on television and continue to be put down by daily and weekly guides as \\"quaint archaisms\\" or \\"just so much celluloid.\\" To give readers a fair idea of what they're like and how well they've survived the small screen, I offer here, from TV's inventory of canned goods, 10 of my favorite forgotten B-jobs and a moment or two from each of the ten that has stayed with me for years.1. \\"D.O.A.\\" (directed by Rudolph Mate) gives Edmond O'Brien his one right role as a loner-loser dying with each breath from a slow-acting poison meant for somebody else. He spends his last hours and energies hunting his not-quite murderer, encountering the bad, the worse and the implacably malign in a San Francisco whose benign, placid backgrounds vindictively counterpoint his mounting grief and rage. But \\"D.O.A.\\" is no \\"Odd Man Out,\\" no metaphor for the modern world","excerpt":"its power is derived from the central image of one chunky, sweating, absolutely desolated human and from the way it puts the spectator inside that human's skin and nerves. Case in point: the superb three-minute sequence when O'Brien, crazed by the doomful diagnosis he's just received, pounds down the steps of a hospital, yowls like a primate, then cuts and runs and keeps running till he blunders against a newspaper kiosk; along the front of this kiosk and in fat bunches on the counter are copies of Life magazine.2. \\"Ramrod\\" (Andr√© de-Toth). In essence, the Western is a ballet with three basic choreographies: The Call-out, the Walk-out and the Shoot-out, \\"Ramrod,\\" which pits an amiable, unscrupulous cattle baron against an amiable, unscrupulous saddletramp, works exquisite combinations and permutations with all three. Watch, above all, what may be the most quietly, ominous and austere gunfight ever filmed: a shot of a man squatting awkwardly by a stream; a shot of Joel McCrea taking small, stiff-legged steps to come up behind him; a shot of the man glimpsing McCrea's reflection in the stream and realizing death is inescapable; a shot of him trying to grin amiably; a shot of McCrea grinning cruelly back.3. \\"The Prowler\\" (Joseph Losey). Van Heflin is a rogue cop, Evelyn Keyes a prurient, slightly pathetic housewife who makes faces at lawn-loving neighbors. Soon after doing what they like to do, they do what they have to do‚Äîmurder her husband. But if \\"The Prowler\\" is discount \\"Double Indemnity,\\" it's also a lot more comfortable with American places and objects, with the kind of sneaky, dangerous eroticism good tabloid melodrama needs. (Even in separate cars parked at a jammed freeway rest-stop Keyes and Heflin forge chains of intimate knowledge.) And the finale‚ÄîKeyes in a $4-motel box suffering labor pains silently while Heflin moans‚Äîis as graphic and grueling as a battlefield amputation.4. \\"The Gangster\\" (Gordon Wiles). Daniel Fuchs adapted his own novel, \\"Low Company,\\" loading the script with lines that turn soda-jerks into small-time Falstaffs. (\\"Go wash your teeth and take care of your family.\\") It's a darkly-shot, bitter, poetic movie about people who measure out their lives with coffee spoons in a Coney Island luncheonette. One of these people is the gangster, Shebunka (Barry Sullivan). He has never used or wanted to use guns; as a result, ruthless outsiders can push him easily, disdainfully out of his little empire of bungalow bordellos. (\\"Who do you know, Shebunka, and what have you got?\\") At the end he has nothing, not even his insistent self-pity; when gunmen wait off-camera to kill him, he holds out his arms and receives their bullets like a benediction. An immense compassion moves beyond clich√© or campiness. I admire and honor as well the funny, forlorn humanity of Akim Tamiroff crooning to his new ice-cream machine and John Ireland looking and looking at his wife in her rump-sprung bathrobe and saying suddenly and mildly, \\"You know, I never had a good day with you.\\"5. \\"He Walked by Night\\" (Alfred Werker). Using the drainpipes of Los Angeles, Richard Basehart scuttles under the city to steal electronic gear; the stealing is precise and passionless, the thief as colorless as a glass of water. He has no traits, no idiosyncracies and, though we catch his name once, virtually no identity. We never know or care to know what he does and whom he sees when he's not in the drainpipes, for the real achievement of this movie is in its acute presentation of someone who's managed to make society altogether irrelevant. Forget, therefore, the occasionally intrusive civic-minded narration and concentrate instead on those five minutes of brilliantly visual storytelling as Basehart, wounded, goes, not to a doctor, but to his own room‚Äîusing his own surgical instruments and magnifying mirrors to remove the bullet himself.6. \\"The Leopard Man\\" (Jacques Tourneur). Thirty-four years after its release, this thriller, about a psychopath who terrorizes a Mexican border town, may still be a bit ahead of its time. There's not a cheap trick in it, not an excessive shot or a single piece of cinematic rhetoric. The camera is logical and lucid, linking an image, an idea, to a character's perceptions, pulse rate, wave length. Thus, in a candlelight procession of hooded, keening penitents, it draws you moment by moment deeper into the guilt-ridden mind of the still-unknown killer who walks among them. Various directors over the decades have tried aping this effect without even coming close; none, to my knowledge, has had the skill or nerve to take on the nightwalk: A tipsy se√±orita-swinger leaves the local hangout, heads home through back streets clicking castanets, wobbling on much-too-high heels. She fears her mother's wrath; the fear is magnified, resonated by sight and sound so that every pebble, bird, cloud partakes of abiding evil. Just as she reaches her door, a branch shakes, bends and, as her mother bolts the door against her, springs up. She screams, and her mother, mockingly, screams louder. At the height of her mother's screams, blood leaks under the door.7. \\"Killer McCoy\\" (Roy Rowland). The story veers between ludicrous and lamentable. (Street-kid with sweet left hook; father with bottle problem; mobsters with big bet riding against the kid; trainer saying things like, \\"Kid, I'm throwing in the towel, the sponge, the stool.\\") But for once and for the last time, Mickey Rooney gets the chance to use a body as eloquent as Cagney's. You're best off, then, simply feeding on Rooney as he deals his drunken father the most poignant movie-slap ever put on film or parodies a flamenco dancer or relishes a rubdown, a shower, a frankfurter, a kiss. Try, especially, to catch him stroking his girl's hair with 8-ounce boxing gloves and see how long it is before you find yourself forgetting about the gloves.8. \\"Gun Crazy\\" (Joseph H. Lewis). A carnival marks-person (Peggy Cummins) and a deadeye hick (John Dall) turn Middle America into a pistol range. And while the round-faced apple-cheeked kill-happy kids chase around, we get a looney look at the country entering the fattening fifties. There's no message, really, or if there is one it's delivered by Cummins in a jolting line spoken while she's wandering around a treeless sun-drenched shopping center: \\"Hey, it hurts me here! Everything in these forty-eight states hurts me!\\" Yet the line is nearly lost under the blasting of horns, the idiot yells from a nearby fun house. Scene after scene abounds in similar tiny, tossed-away triumphs that are never underscored or overworked. Among these triumphs: a pump-jockey deliberately and with utmost delicacy cutting through the fan-belt of an out-of-state Cadillac; an expensively-dressed matron unloading the contents of a supermarket shopping cart, then the shopping cart, into her car; a pair of object-hungry young marrieds fondling pressure cookers in a department store and shivering orgiastically while a hold-up goes on.9. \\"Jeopardy\\" (John Sturges). For its first 10 or 15 minutes, this one has the look of a low to medium-grade nail-biter. (Barbara Stanwyck and Barry Sullivan make camp between nothing and nowhere; Sullivan is pinned under the pilings of a jetty; and in hours the tide will cover his head.) Director Sturges loves, as a five-year-old cave dweller would and a Hitchcock sometimes does, the banal, beautiful reality of bumper jacks, tow ropes, lug wrenches, crowbars, joists, grapples. He loves, too, exploiting the plain, pure physicality of hard, marred men doing difficult jobs. Ralph Meeker is just such a man, the rescue operation just such a job, and both together wind the movie up like a tight spring; a rough equivalent to the last half hour might be watching the invention of the wheel.10. \\"The Incredible Shrinking Man\\" (Jack Arnold) \\"reduces, by means of special effects that are stamped on the retina, a good-sized, middle-class male into something a little less than the least of earth's creatures. In a way, this might be considered as a merely superb piece of science fiction; in the same way, Kafka's \\"Penal Colony\\" might be read as a plea for prison reform. I mean that for me, at least, the movie's singularity and strength come from its quiet integrity, its stubborn refusal to rely on gimmickry ‚Äî though just the battle against the spider or the scaling of the cellar steps or the whiney, peevish voice issuing out of a doll house could have easily carried the highest-priced sci-fi. While I don't know how to overpraise these sequences, I respect even more that quiet closeup of Grant Williams studying his bed, registering thereby an eternity of sexless nights; that icey complaisance of his brother drawling, \\"Well, there must be certain . . . domestic problems\\"; that cheery masochistic mask of his wife's face while she sews and sizes the smallest of coverlets. As for the closing speech, I'll say only that it's worth committing to memory.Just in case I come across as a cranky atavist or, worse, a nostalgia addict, I hasten to recommend \\"Murph the Surf\\" (Marvin Chomsky), a fairly recent release that seems to me to have something very much like the zest and velocity of my old B's. Though \\"Murph\\" was generally assigned to second-string critics and allocated two sticks of type at the foot of most movie pages, I'll probably see it five times more for the sake of watching Don Stroud ignore the unbelievable cleavage of a blue-haired Miami Beach matron in favor of the believable seeded onion roll he is ravening.Wallace Markfield is a novelist who writes about popular culture.

The Orangemen were that until this past Saturday, when they were upset by Johns Hopkins, 11-10, at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse.     Now Syracuse (3-1) has a quick chance for redemption. This Saturday, the Orangemen play host to Princeton (3-0), which replaced them as the nation's No. 1 team in the weekly ranking of the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association.     At least Syracuse does not have to worry this week about ERIC WEDIN, Johns Hopkins's face-off specialist. In his first three college seasons, Wedin scored a total of five goals. In his first two games this season, he scored one goal. Against Syracuse, he scored five goals and propelled his team into fifth place in the national ranking.     ''That was an upset, sure,'' said BRIAN LOGUE, the editor of Lacrosse Magazine, ''but that's been common this year. There have been many upsets because the top teams have become so close in ability.''     This week, the 10 coaches who rank the teams placed Princeton first, followed by Notre Dame, Maryland, Georgetown and Johns Hopkins. Syracuse fell to sixth, followed by Massachusetts, Loyola of Maryland, Virginia and Duke.    NOTRE DAME       If you agree that Duke, North Carolina and Penn State are Eastern colleges, 19 of this week's top 20 men's teams are from the East. The exception is Notre Dame, second in the nation, its highest ranking ever","excerpt":"its previous best was sixth in 1996.     Notre Dame (5-0) has not allowed 10 goals to any opponent this year. Its past two games were victories over Virginia by 11-8 and Loyola of Maryland by 10-7. It next plays at Hofstra Sunday, and road games pose no extra threat because the Irish are 4-0 away from home.     The key players for Notre Dame have been attackmen TOM GLATZEL (18 goals and 4 assists) and DAVE ULRICH (7 goals and 7 assists) and goalie KIRK HOWELL (7.00 goals against average and a .628 save percentage). They are three of the six seniors who start -- three on attack, two on defense and the goalie.     ''We've been getting unbelievable play from our seniors,'' Notre Dame Coach KEVIN CORRIGAN said. ''This is the first time in our seven years here that we've had a lot of experience at every position.''     Things should get even better for the Irish. They have no athletic scholarships for men's lacrosse, but they will have them starting in the fall. In January, the university decided that all of its sports teams, male and female, would have the full number of scholarships allowed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association.    MARYLAND WOMEN       JEN ADAMS of Maryland has broken one N.C.A.A. career record for women and is within sight of another.     In leading Maryland, the defending national champion, to a 5-0 start this year, Adams recorded 16 goals and 15 assists. The last assist, during a 20-4 rout of Brown, was the 133rd of her college career. That broke the record set from 1993 to 1996 by KELLY AMONTE of Maryland, now the coach at Northwestern.     The N.C.A.A. career points record is 420, by KAREN EMAS of Delaware from 1981 to 1984. Adams, with 328 points, ranks fifth, and she has 14 regular-season games and as many as three N.C.A.A. tournament games to break the record.     Adams is a 21-year-old senior from Australia, a midfielder who plays an attacking game. She was the national player of the year the past two years, and last year she won the Honda Award as the outstanding female athlete in any college sport.     When she broke the assists record, Maryland called a timeout to retrieve the ball and honor her. Her teammates were ecstatic. Adams was baffled.     ''What was that all about?'' she said. ''What's the big deal? We have so many people on the team that can score. Anyone could be up there doing it. That record and stuff are not a big deal.''     Wrong, her teammates told her. It was indeed a big deal, and they explained it to her.     ''Oh,'' she said. End of celebration.

The most familiar type are standard fluorescent bulbs, consisting of a single glass tube with metal prongs at the ends. These bulbs are usually straight, but one variety is circular","excerpt":"its prongs are situated where the ends of the tube meet.   The cost of standard fluorescent bulbs is generally about three times that of ordinary incandescent bulbs having the same wattage. Fluorescent bulbs, however, typically produce 6 to 10 times as much light and last 13 times as long, based on comparing a standard 40-watt incandescent bulb with a 40-watt fluorescent one.   The chief reason that fluorescent bulbs last longer is that unlike incandescent bulbs, they have no filament. Fluorescent light is produced when electricity energizes particles called phosphors coating the inside of the tube.   Because fluorescent light is emitted along the entire length of the bulb rather than from a single point, as with incandescent bulbs, its most effective use is where diffused rather than focused lighting is needed.   Good locations for standard fluorescent lighting are overhead (enclosed in fixtures with or without shades, called diffusers) and near the upper corners of walls.   In the latter location, soffits - strips of finished wallboard or paneling - can be mounted parallel to the bulbs to hide them when viewed head-on. By leaving the space above or below the bulb open, or by installing a diffuser, light can be directed onto the ceiling or walls to softly illuminate large areas.   Another good location for standard fluorescent lights is beneath kitchen cabinets. Small fixtures with short bulbs 16 to 18 inches long are available for this task. Using these to illuminate countertops greatly reduces the amount of overhead lighting needed for that purpose.   The lack of a filament also makes fluorescent bulbs resistant to vibration and rough handling, which are hazards to most incandescent bulbs. Fluorescent bulbs are therefore also a good choice for workshops, basements and garages.   But most fluorescent lights do not operate well at low temperatures. If you plan to install a fluorescent bulb where temperatures may drop below 50 degrees, choose one designed for the temperatures likely to be encountered.   Fixtures for fluorescent bulbs must also be designed for cold temperatures; select one whose ballast (a voltage regulating device found on all fluorescent bulbs) is rated for the same temperatures as the bulb.   The quality of light produced by a fluorescent bulb depends largely on its phosphors. Standard phosphors emit light from relatively few areas of the spectrum. As a result, fluorescent light is often criticized as harsh, cold and poor in rendering colors.   In fact, most standard fluorescent bulbs deliver light that is properly termed cool and that dulls reds, imparting a bluish tint to whites and greens. These bulbs are called cool-white and are usually labeled as such.   Cool-white bulbs are most appropriate for daytime use to supplement natural light. For use at night or where there is little natural light, choose warm-white bulbs, a somewhat costlier standard type. Light from these is more like that of incandescent bulbs: it enhances reds, dulls blues and gives a yellowish tint to whites and greens.   Costlier still - about nine times as expensive as ordinary incandescent lights - but dramatically better at rendering colors than conventional cool-white and warm-white bulbs, are a new generation of standard bulbs called rare-earth or tri-stimulus fluorescent bulbs, which are carried by lighting distributors. They contain phosphors that emit light from more of the spectrum than older models.   Besides standard fluorescent bulbs, there is a type called compact fluorescent bulbs. These, also relatively new, consist of one or two short U-shaped tubes (sometimes enclosed in a glass or plastic diffuser) set in a base that either contains a ballast or that plugs into one that is removable.   The ballast includes a threaded end like that on ordinary incandescent bulbs. This makes it possible to substitute compact fluorescent bulbs for incandescent ones in many conventional fixtures, including floor and table lamps and fixtures in ceilings and walls.   Compact fluorescent bulbs are expensive (about $15 to $30), so it is important to make sure that the bulb you choose will fit the lamp or fixture in which you plan to install it.   To do this, disconnect the lamp or fixture or shut off the power to it and measure the length and width of the space above the socket. Then compare these measurements to the size of the bulb. Also notice any constrictions around the socket, particularly those formed by the wire support, or harp, for the shade on floor and table lamps.   If the dimensions at the base of the harp are too narrow to accommodate the base of a compact fluorescent bulb, you can obtain a socket extender to raise the bulb higher. At least one bulb manufacturer also makes bulbs with grooves in the sides of the base to accommodate harps.   Unfortunately, compact fluorescent lamps will not accept clip-on shades, and they cannot be used in fixtures controlled by conventional dimmer switches designed for incandescent lights.   To get the longest life from all fluorescent bulbs and at the same time save the most in energy costs, use them where leaving them on for at least a few hours at a time is justified.   Turning fluorescent lights on and off at frequent intervals shortens their life. But since the cost of replacing a prematurely failed bulb is less than the cost of the electricity used to operate it unnecessarily, it makes sense to turn the lights off when they are not needed, even if only for a few minutes.

Are lay persons allowed to attend Mass and other services at the Benedictine monastery in Solesmes, France, to hear the Gregorian chant? Where is the nearest rail station and can one stay in Solesmes itself? -- Thomas E. Crepeau, Columbus, Ohio A.  The monks of Solesmes are celebrated for their scholarly work on the Gregorian chant and, starting in the 1800's, for their revision of liturgical works. Their abbey, St.-Pierre, was founded in the 11th century and is between Le Mans and Angers.    If you are in Paris, you can arrive in time for the main Mass, offered daily at 9:45 A.M. Seating is limited and cannot be reserved, so it's a good idea to be on hand at 9:30 when the doors open for the Mass, sung by about 80 Benedict monks. There four other daily services, or canonical hours -- at 1, 1:50, 5 and 8:30 -- at which time you can hear Gregorian chant.    Taking the T.G.V. from Gare Montparnasse at 7:15 A.M. on any day but Sunday will get you to Sable-sur-Sarthe by 8:30. (On Sunday, the T.G.V. also leaves at 7:15 but, because of a layover in Le Mans, does not get to Sable-sur-Sarthe until 9:56.) The round-trip fare is $89.50 in first class, $59.80 second class, calculated at 5.25 francs to the dollar.   From the Sable train station to Solesmes, a two-mile trip, you can take a 15-minute ride on the No. 8 bus ($3.25 round trip), take a taxi ($7.25 one way), rent a bicycle or walk. Bike rentals at the station are $8.40 for a half a day or $10.50 for a full day.    There are several trains a day in each direction between Sable and Paris. Frequency depends on the day of the week and the season, so it is best to check first. The last train back to Paris leaves at 6:52 P.M.   If you plan to stay in Solesmes overnight, your choices are very limited. The only hotel in town, the Grand (telephone 43.95.45.10, fax 43.95.22.26), faces the abbey","excerpt":"its rate is $77 for a double. The Grand has a restaurant and charges $8 a person for breakfast.   Another option is to lodge at the Abbey of St.-Pierre, which is for men only, or at Ste.-Cecile, its female counterpart. Ste.-Cecile is open to women, couples and families. Most rooms have two beds or more. Reservations must be made far ahead (especially for religious holidays) by calling 43.95.45.02 or by writing to Soeur Hoteliere, Abbaye Ste.-Cecile, 72300 Solesmes, France. While the announced rate is $30.50 for bed and three meals, visitors may donate more. Note that lodging is closed to guests from Oct. 1 to Palm Sunday (a week before Easter). Services, with female singers, are similar to those at St.-Pierre.    St.-Pierre is open only to male visitors, and they are asked to respect the rules of relative silence (no radios and television). They may eat in the refectory. Visitors have their own rooms and bathrooms are down the hall. Up to 35 visitors can be accommodated, and lodging is open all year. For reservations, call 43.95.03.08, fax 43.95.68.79 or write Pere Hotelier, Abbaye St.-Pierre, 72300 Solesmes, France. Since there is no imposed rate, guests decide how much they wish to pay.   There are also hotels in Sable: the Escu du Roy (43.95.90 31), where a double is $47.60, and the Hotel-Grill, where a double is $42. Breakfast is $5.30 a person at both places. Learning to Make Pasta  Q.  I plan to be in Rome and Florence in September and would like to attend some demonstration classes for making pasta. Do you know of any schools that hold classes or demonstrate the preparation of a variety of pastas? -- Edgar Holton, San Francisco A.  Your timing is not quite ideal since September in Italy is still considered a holiday month. In addition, none of the schools surveyed in Rome and Florence offers a course specifically in the making of pasta. Most have courses that are broader in scope and that begin in mid-October when the weather is cooler.   But all is not lost. There is at least one school in Rome and one school in Florence that said it could arrange a private lesson in September with a chef who speaks English.    The school in Rome, which calls itself Atavolaconlochef (Atthetablewiththechef), can set up a private lesson in pasta-making, according to Maria Teresa Meloni, a spokeswoman.    Ms. Meloni said that the lesson, lasting three hours, would cover all the basics: making the dough for egg noodles, semolina and durum wheat noodles as well as making such different kinds of pasta as spaghetti and tagliatelle and even making stuffed pasta, like ravioli or tortellini. You would also learn to prepare very basic sauces. The cost is $196, computed at the rate of 1,529 lire to the dollar.   Although the school (60 Via dei Gracchi, 00192 Rome) does not reopen until October, you can leave a message; telephone and fax (06) 3203402 or telephone (06) 3222096.    In Florence, the Cordon Bleu is willing to set up a private five-hour lesson that covers the basics of pasta-making and cost $249. The school is at 55 Via di Mezzo, 50121 Florence; telephone (055) 2345468.  Cruising in Germany  Q.  Can one take a boat on the Main from Wurzburg to Mainz. -- Tom Wurl, New York, N.Y. A.  There is no regular service linking these two cities. There is, though, a cruise from Sept. 10 to 17 from Wurzburg to Rudesheim (which is 21 miles beyond Mainz). The line, Scylla Tours, has no other ships schedued on this route in 1994.

It is called \\"The Silent Village,\\" now at the World, and it was made by Humphrey Jennings for the British Ministry of Information. It achieves its heart-breaking impact by the simplest of means: it merely transfers the tragic history of Lidice to a small South Wales mining town. And, through its coal-smudged miners, its plain and impassive women, the washed and uncomprehending innocence of its children, we see that what happened to Lidice might well have happened to the world. For the folk of that doomed Czech village were no different from the humankind that found their small destinies in the Welsh village of Cwmgiedd.It is its documentary factualness, its very modesty, that drives the truth home so irresistibly. Mr. Jennings has not resorted to the lurid or the spectacular. He has not even shown the Nazi firing squads. Oppression is the voice from a mobile loudspeaker and the sudden crackle of rifle fire","excerpt":"its result, the crimson stain behind the ear, the grotesque posture of the dead. He has practiced restraint in all things, intent on showing us the quietly modulated lives of ordinary folk and how the fabric of their everyday existence is suddenly sundered by the power of the brute. He has spent at least as much footage on the quality of life in Cwmgiedd before the conquest as he has upon the conquest itself. Because of that we can care more greatly when disaster comes.He has recreated lovingly the shape of familiar things‚Äîthe old castle-crowned crags commanding the Welsh countryside, the brooks and trees that people love with an unspoken love; the everyday tasks in which the men go to the mines and the women shop, scrub stone steps and dust the china on the mantelpiece; and finally the children in school, the same children that one day will walk in a dismal file through the sun-streaked playground to the waiting Nazi trucks which will scatter them forever.Death has meaning only when it touches what you have learned to love. And because one comes to love this village as one's own, one feels its death more deeply. This is the quiet image that most of us carry in our hearts, whether the village is Lidice, Cwmgiedd or Little Falls. Out of that simple truth, Mr. Jennings and his village of miners have made a film that speaks with a still small voice. But its echo is louder than trumpets.On the same program the World is offering a slightly revised version of \\"Thunder in the East,\\" now called \\"Hara Kiri.\\" First released here in 1934, it tells the story of a Japanese naval officer who wins a battle at sea against an unnamed power, but betrays his love and his honor in doing it. Charles Boyer plays, and plays superbly, the role of the officer, and Merle Oberon gives a fine performance as his wife. The film is still a fine one, and though its protaganist is more sympathetically conceived than we are now willing to accept, \\"Hara Kiri\\" has a curiously prophetic quality about it.

This may not be fair, but it is inevitable. And it puts \\"Tol'able David's\\" successors at a disadvantage. No matter how good they may be, they are almost certain to be outclassed by their sterling predecessor.On the other hand, any King-Barthelmess picture has a right to insist, too, that it be compared with the second of the series, \\"The Seventh Day,\\" and this gives it an advantage. It can be deficient in more ways than one and still show superiority to its nearer relative.This is the case with \\"Sonny,\\" the third in the line, which is at the Strand this week. It is not another \\"Tol'able David,\\" but it is far better than \\"The Seventh Day.\\" Considered by itself, without reference to its family, it is, on the whole, worth while. A majority of its scenes have been efficiently directed","excerpt":"its settings and photography, which really come under the direction of the film, are usually, though not always, excellent; Mr. Barthelmess does some of his best work in it, and several others in the cast succeed in giving meaning to their parts. Its story is unoriginal and, in its latter stages, rather obviously set and stretched, but it provides Mr. Barthelmess and the others with oportunities for several appealing characterizations. Also, except where its sentimentality becomes too sticky, it is emotionally sound‚Äîand pleasantly touched with humor, too.The story employs the now familiar idea of double identity in connection with the war, with a dash of spiritism added, which, however, though definitely affirmed as a fact by the pictures themselves, is put forward somewhat problematically in timid subtitles. The heroes, who look alike, are Charles Crosby, a well-to-do youth with a blind mother and adoring little sister, and Joe Marden, who, when he goes to the war, leaves behind only a ragged little dog. The two become buddies at the front; Crosby, known as \\"Sonny,\\" is killed, and Joe comes back to his home, to impersonate him for a little while for the ???ke of his mother. The rest, including the affectionate exposure of the sympathetic imposter, may be imagined.In portraying his two characters, and in differentiating between then, Mr. Barthelmess points his performance skillfully. As Sonny's young sister, Pauline Garon looks and acts not only like a young sister, but also like a find for the screen. Margaret Seddon is persuasive as the blind mother, and Herbert Grimwood, in the r√¥le of a designing old scoundrel who seeks to marry his daughter to the wealthy Charles Crosby, adds a character to the story which saves its by-plot from the appearance of having been dragged in by the heels in order to lengthen and complicate the entirely sufficient main narrative.

More than 25 years ago, Mr. Berne released the first album on Empire, his own label. He has trafficked in the above-ground music industry since then -- recording for the Polygram imprint JMT, and, more fleetingly, Columbia Records -- but nothing seems to satisfy him more than self-reliance. Since 1996, Mr. Berne has channeled his autonomy through Screwgun Records, which he runs out of a brownstone in Brooklyn. The label faithfully mirrors its founder's ethos of hardscrabble abstraction: until recently, Screwgun CD's came in industrial brown cardboard, with graffiti-like scribbles by the graphic artist Steve Byram. ''Pre-emptive Denial,'' the label's 16th release, bears more colorful packaging but leaves the music raw","excerpt":"its source material was a bootleg of Mr. Berne's band Paraphrase, performing in the East Village just seven months ago. Dividing evenly into two 25-minute tracks, the album follows the sort of wide exploratory arc that has long typified Mr. Berne's compositional voice. The catch is that Paraphrase is a free-improvising trio, shaped as much by the sensibilities of Drew Gress, the bassist, and Tom Rainey, the drummer, (above left, with Mr. Berne, center, and Mr. Gress). Appearing in Mr. Berne's native Park Slope next week, the musicians will see their work supplemented with spontaneously arranged projections by Mr. Byram and another artist, Jonathon Rosen. This cross-disciplinary experiment could succeed or fail; either way, it should jibe with Mr. Berne's intrepid ideals.

This picture, which is the chief attraction at the Paramount Theatre, is called \\"New York\\"","excerpt":"its story was evidently inspired by the relatively recent romance of a celebrated songwriter and a millionaire's daughter. During the love scenes between the hero and the Heroine Irving Berlin's compositions serve as an accompaniment.\\"New York\\" is Luther Reed's second directorial effort. His first adventure in this line was the picturization of Michael Arlen's story, \\"The Ace of Cads.\\" In this new vehicle he had a chance, provided he had a good script, to make a strong photoplay. However, the mere unfurling of a heart-to-heart affair between a trap drummer in a noisy resort and a wealthy girl, even when the path of true love is halted by the death of a rival, is not in itself enough to be an up-to-date cinema entertainment. The atmosphere is needed, coupled with natural actions on the part of the players.Mr. Reed appears to draw his characters from the screen rather than from the blooded ones of real life. Their gestures are annoying and their flirtations are childish, so much so that one is impelled to believe that this \\"New York\\" is a deliberate appeal to immature mentalities. One would almost think that the porducer had decided that in the past motion pictures were over the heads of the majority of spectators.There is in this film the best-drilled jury that ever sat in court. The instant something happens these twelve trusted men bend forward like soldiers at the command of a hard-fisted sergeant major.The d√©nouement hinges in a simple thing that spells its future the instant it is introduced, and you are fully aware that, although the defendant. Michael Angelo Cassidy, is having no easy time, in the end his friend. Buck, will come forth with the evidence that will startle the villain, Trent Regan. Trent when meditating is wont to draw on paper rows of query marks. A sheet of music with these marks is found and it fits in nicely with what Trent is seen drawing in another place. Hence the jealous Trent is forced to admit that Angie Meller was killed when he and she struggled for the possession of a revolver.The subtitles in this production are no better and perhaps no worse than the action of the picture.Ricardo Cortez, with elastic bands on his shirt sleeves, is supposed, as Michael Angelo Cassidy, to have captured the affection of Marjorie Church. It is a case of love at first sight. Lois Wilson, like the other players, has listened to instructions. Even that capital actor William Powell is far from effective in this tale. Estelle Taylor, as Angie Miller, the woman of the underworld, is striking only because of her startling taste in fur arrangements and frocks. Richard \\"Skeets\\" Gallagher makes Buck a character who at least seems to have a little blood running through his veins.Frank Cambria's stage contribution, \\"Under the Brooklyn Bridge,\\" is an interesting feature of the surrounding program.Other Photoplays.\\"Flesh and the Devil,\\" with Greta Garbo and John Gilbert, is at the Capitol.At the Mark Strand the feature is \\"The Night of Love,\\" with Ronald Colman and Vilma Banky.\\"The Lunatic at Large,\\" with Leon Errol, is the new film offering at the Hippodrome.Helene Chadwick in \\"Stolen Pleasures\\" is the chief attraction at the Broadway.\\"Beyond the Wall,\\" a re-edited version of \\"Between Worlds,\\" is the principal picture at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse.Harold Lioyd's new comedy, \\"The Kid Brother,\\" is at the Rialto.John Barrymore in \\"When a Man Loves\\" and special Vitaphone features will be presented on Thursday evening at the Selwyn Theatre.\\"The Slums of Berlin\\" is holding over at the Cameo.\\"The Big Parade\\" is at the Astor; \\"The Fire Brigade,\\" at the Central; Vitaphone subjects and \\"The Better \\"Ole.\\" at the Colony; \\"Beau Geste,\\" at the Criterion; \\"Tell It to the Marines,\\" at the Embassy; \\"Old Ironsides,\\" at the Rivoli; \\"What Price Glory,\\" at the Sam H.

PETER WATROUS Jacky Terrasson    Jacky Terrasson, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. The pianist Jacky Terrasson is a master of dynamics, and his trio, with Ugonna Okegwo on bass and Leon Parker on drums, is tight, concise and empathetic. The band is also dedicated to swinging, and it gets a light but furious forward motion going. Mr. Terrasson isn't afraid of strange chords and unusual juxtapositions; he traffics in surprise.

Little Jimmy Scott's piercing wail infuses everything he sings with an aura of metaphysical lamentation. The songs are mostly ballad standards that lend themselves to a keening rhythm-and-blues style, suggesting a hybrid of Dinah Washington and Little Anthony. The program focuses on songs from Mr. Scott's forthcoming album, \\"Dream\\" (Warner Brothers). He is backed by a quartet led by the pianist Ken Ichi Shimazu. Shows are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11 and at 8:30 and 10:30 on Sunday night. There is a music charge of $23.50 tonight and tomorrow and $17.50 on Sunday. S. H. Jazz Album of the Week    Kevin Hays, \\"Seventh Sense,\\" (Blue Note; CD only, $10.99). For those who love the more experimental albums recorded by Joe Henderson, Bobby Hutcherson and Andrew Hill on the Blue Note label in the 1960's, \\"Seventh Sense\\" is a jolt of joy. Mr. Hays, a pianist best known for his association with the tenor saxophonist Josh Redman, has assembled an excellent band (including Seamus Blake on saxophones, Steve Nelson on vibes, Doug Wiess on bass and Brian Blade on drums) that wheels its way through his open, moody compositions along with works by -- surprise -- Bobby Hutcherson and Joe Henderson. Although the recording isn't well sequenced -- three slow tunes in the middle make it a bit hard to listen to -- it captures the charge that experimentation had in the mid-1960's, when harmonic and rhythmic exploration merged with a solid grounding of swing. It helps that the rhythm section drives so hard; this is an album built on the relationship between piano and vibes and a roaring bass and drums. P. W.

Obviously, Mr. Ripley and Mr. Monter have drunk deep at the well from which the French cinematic impressionists fetched salt water prior to 1939. For this gloomy and spectral endeavor to catch the essence of beauty sadly lost is a grim exercise in visual discords, in human anguish and jangled moods. As such, it is moderately impressive","excerpt":"its stylization is consistently severe.

There, without knowledge of his whereabouts, his wife has also come, and throughout the film she pines in illness near a saloon where he sometimes plays. And thus, with the shattered lovers so near and yet so far apart, is enacted a curious bar-room drama, with the two lovers finally joined in death.Francis Lederer plays the bleakly tragic pianist quite stiffly in his lucid, normal phase and makes a wild and pathetic Looney Louie when he is hopelessly out of his mind. Sigrid Gurie is persistently somber, both in sickness and in health, as his wife, and Alexander Granach and J. Carrol Naish are splendid as two brothers who conflict within the plot. Mr. Ripley has directed the picture, as noted, for mordant effects, and has utilized music elaborately to actuate sad moods. \\"The Moldau\\" is played at frequent intervals‚Äîand, to this writer's ears, exceedingly well. The producers, however, could have skimped music and spent more money on lighting their sets. It might help matters slightly if you didn't have to strain your eyes to see what goes on.

Although Steadman Fagoth, a prominent Misurasata leader, announced ''open political war on the Sandinists,'' other leaders explained that Misurasata planned only to strengthen their popular grassroots organization. Mr. Fagoth later fled to Honduras where, in the company of declared counter-revolutionaries and with support from right-wing organizations, he regularly calls for Miskitos to join him in overthrowing the Sandinists.

So there's the inevitable point, befitting a performance where the star wears pajamas, when her eyelids grow leaden and her head so heavy that she bumps it against a lamp.

The fact that any performance -- and life itself -- is a minefield of potential embarrassments provides both the form and content of this blissful piece of theater of abashment. The show \\"101 Humiliating Stories\\" (there are only 17, actually, but each has numerous subsets) is a chain of artfully paced narratives of excruciating moments recollected in, well, not exactly tranquillity, but with the modulated control of a master comic eternally poised between ingenuousness and irony.   Ms. Kron, who is a member of the theater troupe Five Lesbian Brothers, combines a novelist's sense of the telling social detail with a Chaplinesque knowledge of the humor in the yawning gap between intention and action (or, as she puts it, between the self you see in your mirror at home and the one that leaps out at you from store windows). She realizes, as she tells us, brushing a sheaf of papers to the floor, that there's \\"a second set of behaviors that I exhibit to people that I am not aware of.\\"   This premise infuses autobiographical tales that cover all manner of faux pas: stories of hair caught in school-bus doors; of \\"geeky celebrity encounters\\"; of fainting in the corridors of a Michigan junior high school in a green-and-white polyester gym suit; of speculating, with wicked specificity, on the horrific events that must have led to the abandonment of a sanitary napkin spotted near the entrance of the same institution and of walking down the halls of a business office with a skirt tucked into a pair of pantyhose.   All of the anecdotes, in fact, are spiritually akin to the sorts of dreams in which you find yourself naked before a crowd. They are linked by a series of scenes in which Ms. Kron imagines herself addressing her Lansing, Mich., high school reunion, explaining -- in styles ranging from cringing to confrontational -- both her sexual and professional identities. No alternative, of course, is safe when you're standing behind a podium.   The show, which has been artfully staged by John Robert Hoffman and was first presented in a rougher form at the Serious Fun festival last summer, is part of the Gay Games and Cultural Festival. The question of how Ms. Kron presents herself as a lesbian to the world at large (and particularly to her former classmates) is a prime source of the social awkardness she describes. But \\"101 Humiliating Stories,\\" at the New York Theater Workshop through July 2, is really for anyone who has ever had cause to blush. 101 Humiliating Stories  Written and performed by Lisa Kron; directed by John Robert Hoffman; set by Amy Shock; costume by Jose Gutierrez and Chip White; production stage manager, Janet M.

Reputed to be the richest man in the world, His Highness invited us to give five command performances in his realm (April 27 to May 1, 1926).   Our expectations of a modern hotel were dashed when the company found itself in a shabby English rest house in the suburb of Secunderabad.    The British Cinema where we were to perform had been built in 1890. Its roof was thatched","excerpt":"its walls were of corrugated iron, its seats of rickety bamboo, its small stage of splintery wood, its temperature of about 110 degrees unmitigated by breeze from any fan.    Yet on opening night, the theater was filled with English and Indian dignitaries. In one stage box sat rows of some of the Nizam's many sons, all in identical maroon uniforms. In the opposite box sat an equal number of the Nizam's pre-adolescent daughters in brilliant saris. At the rear of the stage, behind our dark velvet cyclorama, perched 39 of the Nizam's supposed 350 wives, peering through slits in the backdrop.   We first saw the Nizam as he scurried around backstage. He looked like a severe schoolteacher as he supervised the seating of his family. No turban. No rubies, pearls, emeralds or diamonds from his fabulous collection.    Ruth St. Denis reported that on our last night the Nizam came to her dressing room with his aide-de-camp, who handed her a package that had the shape of a jewel box. When she later opened the gift, she found a book of the Nizam's poems inscribed to her and Ted Shawn, which was more than any Denishawn Dancer received from this richest man in the world.

He found a path to ''unilateral disarmament'' by envisioning such a public clamor for an end to the arms race that if Reagan or the Soviets should refuse to consider our modest proposal for a bilateral freeze, our leaders would not be able to cast the issue aside, but would have to accept unilateral disarmament. This is absurd. As is his conclusion that the clamoring itself is unilateral since we cannot possibly clamor equally in the Soviet Union.

Both are recent acquisitions of the Preservation Society of Newport County.    Chepstow, a three-story Italianate villa designed by George Champlin Mason, the Newport architect, is scheduled to open on Friday. It will be available for tours, by appointment only, on Fridays and Saturdays through October. Built in 1860 as a summer residence for Edmund Schermerhorn -- a first cousin of one of the town's most active hostesses, Mrs. William Astor Jr. -- Chepstow was bought in 1911 by Mrs. Emily Morris Gallatin, of the Morris family, prominent members of New York's Old Guard. The property, named for the town in Wales that the family came from, overlooks Narragansett Avenue, where generations of summer visitors have strolled.    Although far less grand than some of Newport's mansions, Chepstow houses an outstanding collection of art and furniture, including some from other Morris family residences. Among the many American paintings bequeathed to the society and hanging here are works by George Harvey, Fitz Hugh Lane and Granville Perkins. Among the furnishings is a walnut Queen Anne side chair said to have belonged to William Penn.    In late summer -- probably in early August -- the Isaac Bell House on Bellevue Avenue will also open to visitors on Fridays and Saturdays -- as a work in progress. The mansion, named for its original owner, a prosperous New York cotton broker and key investor in the trans-Atlantic cable, is undergoing an extensive restoration. Built from 1881 to 1883 by the New York architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White, the house is said to have been a great influence on Frank Lloyd Wright. It is one of the country's finest examples of the shingle style. Although the exterior restoration was completed early this year, research for the interior is still going on. In addition to viewing the elaborately detailed exterior of uniquely patterned cedar shingles, towers, chimneys, porches and columns, visitors can expect to see firsthand how such a complicated restoration develops. There will be no furniture or collections in the rooms until the project's completion, which is expected to take several years.    The tours cost $8 each, $5 for students and children.

Writing on the occasion of the play's Broadway premiere in 1955, Bagnold's friend Cecil Beaton said that the work was ''as whimsical as Sir James Barrie, as poetic as Giraudoux, sometimes as zany as the Marx Brothers, yet with all the elements of a detective story.''

Based remotely on a plot situation proposed by President Roosevelt and developed by six well-known authors into a Liberty Magazine serial last year, the film relegates its formular murder-mystery theme to the background and concentrates, quite properly, on the more significant subject of the American cooperative.The problem Mr. Roosevelt submitted to Miss Rita Weiman and to the Messrs. Van Dine, Hughes, Adams, Abbot and Erskine was whether it was possible for a man, weary of faithless friends and a wasted life, to convert a $5,000,000 estate into cash, disappear and start anew in some worth-while activity. Not having read the Liberty story, we are unable to report on the literary sextet's solution. But we have been informed, reliably we hope, that Republic's script writers, Lester Cole and Nathaniel West, have used the President's question as a springboard of their own, and have plunged from it into the swifter current of a topical problem.The guinea pig they have created to answer the Presidential inquiry is James Blake, corporation counsel and lobbyist extraordinary for National Canneries. By wining, dining and golfing the Senate, he has blocked passage of the Trades Reconstruction Corporation Bill, which would have created a Federal fund to reopen some of the nation's closed smaller industries as cooperatives. Now, weary physically and spiritually, he has gone on a fishing trip to New England and wanders into a town meeting at Springdale. It is a town typical of the many communities that had been hoping for passage of the TRC bill. Its one industry, a vegetable and fruit cannery, is closed","excerpt":"its workmen are idle, its farmers unable to market their crops. Blake decides to play with the cooperative experiment.With considerable interest, the picture traces the methods of his conversion of securities into cash and his disappearance, leaving a charred body in the wreckage of his car to suggest his suicide. It turns frankly editorial in its depiction of the successful development of the Springdale Cooperative and in its reiteration of the benefits derivable from this national panacea, but through it all runs a crisp vein of melodrama, built upon the murder of Blake's wife on the very night he disappeared. Although there is no disputing its propagandist intent, the film‚Äîunlike the Soviet lectures‚Äîhas not reduced its narrative to a moralizing bludgeon.Phil Rosen's direction is fluid, Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld's score admirable and the cast uniformly competent. Henry Wilcoxon plays Blake with vigor and sincerity, Sidney Blackmer is properly evil as the unscrupulous president of National Canneries and there are pleasant contributing performances by Betty Furness as the cannery owner, Barnett Parker as the butler, Wade Boteler as the sheriff and Evelyn Brent as Blake's faithless wife.

Rubin, taking a little air out of the rapidly rising dollar, suggested that the Administration has ended its two-year-long effort to drive up the dollar against the world's other major currencies. Mr. Rubin has said repeatedly over that time that ''a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States.'' Yesterday, in a subtly worded change of policy, he said that while a strong dollar was still in America's interest, ''we have had a strong dollar for some time now,'' a phrase he used three more times.     The comments by Mr. Rubin set off a torrent of activity on world financial markets and knocked the dollar down just before it hit 125 yen, a four-year high. For the day, the dollar settled in New York at 122.60 yen, down 0.94 yen from Thursday. Against the mark, the dollar ended at 1.6568, up a slight 0.0064 from the day before. $(Page 1.$)    TCI Names New President  The board of Tele-Communications Inc. appointed Leo J. Hindery Jr. president. That title was previously held by John C. Malone, who remains chairman and chief executive. In recent years, Mr. Malone had withdrawn from daily management, leaving that responsibility with Brendon Clouston, president of the company's giant cable operations. The move was seen by analysts as part of an effort to bolster the shares of Tele-Communications, which have lagged badly in a bull market, as have those of other cable companies. In December, as part of that effort, Mr. Malone announced that the company would begin a sweeping program to cut costs, reduce debt and improve net income. $(36.$)    N.A.S.D.

At 11 p.m., ''TOP CHEF,'' from the ''Runway'' producers, will have its premiere. This cooking competition, with the celebrity chef TOM COLICCHIO as its lead judge, is worlds better than Fox's ''HELL'S KITCHEN'' was.    ''BLACK. WHITE.'' also makes its debut this week (FX, Wednesday at 10 p.m.). This six-part documentary, in which a white family and a black family are heavily made up to switch races, starts out slow and obvious, but by Episode 2 offers unexpected, cringe-inducing commentary. And BRUNO MARCOTULLI, the white dad, is fun to hate.    Speaking of social relevance, do you think you're too cool to watch ''BATTLESTAR GALACTICA''? Because you're not. So catch up, starting with the must-see mini-series that set it all up","excerpt":"iTunes has it all. On Friday, the second season of this splendid space drama comes to a 90-minute conclusion (Sci Fi, 10 p.m.). More people need to watch this show, as it's one of the best on television.

The portraits - all done by academy members past and present - are of consistent quality. They suggest the effort of major figures of 19th- and 20th-century American art to make the artistic conventions to which they were committed more elastic. Any exhibition on this subject raises questions about the wall that exists between an artist and his attempts to present himself as he is.   There are 72 portraits in the show from more than 1,300 works in the academy's celebrated portrait collection. The artists include Samuel F. B.

Dimitrieff, who plays the Sultan; the attractive Agnes Petersen, who acts the much-sought-after Princess Gulnar, daughter of the bearded and wealthy Sultan, and Julius Falkenstein, who is the Sultan's Astrologer.It is through the roguish Ali that the story is told, for it is his dream. He is a brow-beaten husband until he becomes fascinated by a whistle. This ends in his embarking on his adventurous dream, in the course of which he is called upon by the Astrologer to masquerade as a fabulously rich potentate, Prince Furam, who has arrived in the Sultan's domain before his caravan, which is bearing costly gifts to the Sultan.Ali, not knowing how many camels there are in Araby, is asked the strength of his caravan and he hazards 10,000 camels, which causes the old Sultan's eyes to widen. To the Sultan it is fairly certain that he will give the hand of his daughter to this mighty Prince, instead of having her become the bride of the warrior Hussen, who, be it known, has captured the handsome Achmed.Ali at one juncture rides to fame on the back of a hippopotamus. This startles all those in the Sultan's fair city. Eventually, the Sultan becomes a little peeved because Furam's caravan does not put in appearance, and when this stout gentleman is peeved he usually orders those who have aroused his anger to be hanged.It chances that Ali, realizing that he is in hot water, steals the Sultan's raiment and flees to the desert, hoping for the best. The best happens, for when an imposing caravan is attacked by marauders, the fortunate Ali, blessed by Allah, temporarily, straddles the lead camel while the animal is on its haunches. A spear from the desert raiders strikes the camel and off it goes. But that is not all, for the other camels follow, and just before the Astrologer and Prince Achmed are to be hoisted on the gibbet, the welcome sight of Ali, or the masquerading Prince Furam, is perceived by the Astrologer and also the Sultan. To the latter it is the much-maligned Furam riding at the head of 1,000 camels, the first group of the caravan bearing wonderful treasures from afar.Ali, however, is deserted by Allah in a subsequent sequence, but fear not, he is not killed, but in the end he has what might easily be termed a rude awakening.

The problem with the tale is that it comes from Ives himself, a notorious fabulist and purveyor of unverifiable anecdotes.         Like the best legends, it feels true: Mahler and Ives saw uncannily alike. Michael Tilson Thomas has juxtaposed the two composers in a compelling program with the New York Philharmonic. He begins with Ives's \\"From the Steeples and the Mountains,\\" which bears the inscription, \\"From the Steeples -- the Bells! -- then the Rocks on the Mountain begin to shout!\\" One thinks at once of Mahler's gloriously anarchic Third Symphony, whose introduction was originally titled \\"What the mountain rock tells me.\\"    MUSIC REVIEW","excerpt":"Ives and Mahler, Through the Same Lens"},{"year":"1950","title":"Sens Ives and E D Thomas bill creates investigatory comms composed of Cong members and pub, latter chosen from Pres panel of 30 outstanding citizens and holding balance of power on comms, to probe any matters of 'urgent pub importance,' INQUIRY BILL ASKS ROLE FOR CITIZENS","excerpt":"Ives and Thomas of Utah Urge Bipartisan Commission on Grave U.S. Issues"},{"year":"1958","title":"Sens Goldwater and Ives clash over Repub labor bill G.O.P.

Today, two leading piano manufacturers produce instruments incorporating Mr. Stahnke's technology.   Like the player piano of the 1920's, a reproducing piano plays a musician's previously recorded performance, but there the similarities end. The wooden, honky-tonk sound of the old player piano came from its inability to distinguish dynamics -- the difference between loud and soft -- and the inaccuracy of its timing. In contrast, Mr. Stahnke's piano so closely matches a performance that even the pianist cannot hear the difference.

In this city, after all, \\"New Yorkers walk fast, talk fast and think fast,\\" says George Frohlinde [ noam doublechecking ] , the owner of the Village Chess Shop. Many of those fast thinkers have been immigrants, and with each wave of immigrants, New York's standing in the chess world has risen. Of the 41 American grandmasters, 22 live in or around New York. [ noam doublechecking ]  Here are some of the high points of its history: 1857 -- Paul Morphy, the prodigy from New Orleans, creates a stir in New York when he arrives to win what was considered the first national tournament. 1886 -- Wilhelm Steinitz, an Austrian who later became a U.S. citizen, wins a world championship match. He died in 1900 in an insane asylum on Wards Island. 1905 -- Jose Raul Capablanca, one of the most intuitive and gifted players ever, arrives from Cuba to attend Columbia's engineering school. 1920 -- Samuel Reshevsky, who was later widely thought to be the world's great chess prodigies, arrives from Poland to begin a North American tour in New York at age 8. He later takes up residence in the city. 1924 -- One of the great all-time tournaments is held at the Alamac Hotel. The field includes Capablanca, Emmanuel Lasker and Alexander Alekhine, world champions all. Capablanca spent some of his years as champion living in New York. 1945 -- The Soviet Union demolishes the United States, 15 1/4 to 4 1/2, in a match played by by radio telegraph. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, above, makes the ceremonial first move at a Manhattan hotel ballroom. 1959 -- Bobby Fischer, who grew up in Brooklyn and is considered one of the strongest players in history, drops out of Erasmus Hall High School to pursue chess. He is already United States champion and the youngest grandmaster in history. \\"It's a good thing he did,\\" says his first coach, John W. Collins. \\"I don't think he would have succeeded in too many other things.\\" 1972 -- Fischer wins the world title from Boris Spassky as a worldwide television audience watches. The New-York based commentator for PBS, Shelby Lyman, becomes a celebrity in his own right.  1989 -- Gata Kamsky defects from Russia at the New York Open, where he was the youngest entrant, at 14. He is now a Brooklyn resident and the highest-ranked American player. 1990 -- \\"Chess\\" makes its debut on public access television, Channel 16 in Manhattan. The host of the Saturday morning show, Jim Savage, analyzes games and interviews players in a studio on 23d Street. 1992 -- The first Chessathon is held in Central Park. The annual event, now held at Grand Central Terminal, pits thousands of children against masters. 1993 -- The film \\"Searching for Bobby Fischer\\" opens. Perhaps the best-known chess movie, it tells the story of Joshua Waitzkin, a real-life New York chess prodigy. Like the film \\"Fresh,\\" released last year, it spotlights speed chess as played in Washington Square Park as a source of street-based creativity. A New York specialty, speed chess uses a clock that keeps track of the time players spend thinking. Players are usually allowed five minutes a game.

Mr. Jessel wants something less lachrymose and more whimsical. There are scenes in this production that betray little imagination in their direction, and, as happens in many a melodrama, the excitement of the characters, their joy or their sadness, in lieu of causing a sob makes one smile.The great shame of Private Izzy Murphy is that he said he was an Irishman. He told Eileen Cohannigan that he was Isadora Patrick Murphy. Through his name and courage Mr. Murphy becomes a doughboy in the Fighting Sixty-ninth, and it is somewhere in France that Private Murphy writes to Eileen informing her that his real name is Isadore Goldberg. Our hero is wounded and many in the audience think that he has gone West, but in the stream of khaki that pours down Fifth Avenue his familiar face is beheld. His father and mother see him and be sees them. The Cohannigan family see him, and he sees them. Eileen is very much in love with Private Murphy and does not care a rap what his name was. So Private Murphy wins in war and peace.Vera Gordon is excellent in the r√¥le of Private Murphy's mother. Patsy Ruth Miller is docile and affectionate as Eileen.
