To cast a ballot in a party primary, a voter must be registered and enrolled in that party. Here are the highlights of some major races. THE SENATE NEW YORK    In New York, four Democrats are seeking the nomination to challenge Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Republican Senator. The Candidates    ROBERT ABRAMS, 54. Lawyer, State Attorney General since 1979. Elected Bronx Borough President, 1969. First won office as Assemblyman from the Bronx, 1965. His compaign had raised about $4.2 million as of late last month.    GERALDINE A. FERRARO, 57. Lawyer, former New York City public elementary school teacher and Assistant District Attorney in Queens. Elected to Congress from Queens, 1978. Chosen Democratic Vice-Presidental nominee in 1984. Had raised about $4.3 million.    ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN, 51. Lawyer, New York City Comptroller since 1989. As Congresswoman, served on House Judiciary Committee during impeachment hearings of President Richard M. Nixon. Won Democratic nomination for Senate in 1980, but lost election to Alfonse M. D'Amato. Elected Brooklyn District Attorney, 1981. Has raised about $1.8 million.    AL SHARPTON, 37. Child preacher, ordained at age 10 by a Pentecostal minister in Brooklyn. Active in various civil rights causes for two decades. Making first run for elected office. Had raised about $60,000. The Issues    The Candidates have few major policy differences. Mr. Abrams and Ms. Holtzman support cuts in defense spending three times as deep as those advocated by Ms. Ferraro, and more sweeping changes in health insurance. She alone supports the death penalty. In the last month, the race has boiled down to a bitter referendum over Ms. Ferraro's family finances, and she and her rivals have accused each other of lies and distortions. Analysis    There are no publicly available statewide polls to provide a reliable picture of the race, but most analysis and the campaigns themselves foresee a close contest between Mr. Abrams and Ms. Ferraro. The outcome depends heavily on turnout, which is forecast to be less than one-quarter of the state's 3.8 million registered Democrats. Returns from upstate, where one-third of registered Democrats live, may prove pivotal. Connecticut The Candidates    CHRIS BURNHAM, 35. Two-term state representative from Stamford who is on leave from his job as a public finance specialist with First Boston. His campaign has spent about $430,000.    BROOK JOHNSON, 45. Millionaire textile executive and political greenhorn from Greenwich. His campaign has spent about $900,000, much of it Mr. Johnson's own money. The Issues    Mr. Burnham and Mr. Johnson hold similar positions on the major issues. Both favor the creation of private enterprise zones, tax breaks for investors to create jobs and stimulate the economy, and spending curbs to reduce the Federal deficit. Both support a woman's right to choose an abortion. Analysis    Mr. Burnham is campaigning as a \\"grassroots\\" candidate whose greatest strength is his willingness to knock on doors and even walk across part of the state to reach voters. He won the endorsement of the state Republican Party at its convention in July. Polls show that few people are aware of his candidacy, and he is running 40 or more percentage points behind Mr. Dodd.    Polls show that despite his spending twice as much as Mr. Burnham, Mr. Johnson is doing just about as poorly against the incumbent as his rival. THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 5TH DISTRICT: QUEENS, NASSAU The Candidates    GARY L. ACKERMAN, 49. Former publisher of The Queens Tribune. He served in the State Assembly from 1979 to 1983 and has represented the 7th Congressional District in central Queens since 1983.    RITA MORRIS, 68. Professor of Library Science at Nassau County Community College. Although she has been involved in local community and school groups in Westbury, L.I., she has no prior political experience. The Issues    The cost of health care is important in the district and both candidates support a comprehensive national health insurance program that would be financed largely through employer payroll taxes. Mr. Ackerman fovors Federal aid to retool defense firms like Grumman, many of whose residents live in the district. Mrs. Morris has called for speeding up public works projects to create jobs. Analysis    Mr. Ackerman, who has apologized to constituents for writing 111 bad checks in the House bank scandal, is endorsed by Democratic committees in three counties. They have lent volunteers and other support to his campaign, which has increased Mr. Ackerman's already strong voter recognition, particularly in Queens, Ms. Morris is considered a long shot, but this is the year of the woman and often of dissatisfaction with incumbents. 6TH DISTRICT: QUEENS The Candidates    FLOYD H. FLAKE, 47. Has represented the southeast Queens district for six years. He previously gained a local reputation as the socially active pastor of the 6,000-member Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in Jamaica, Queens.    SIMEON GOLAR, 63. Lawyer, former chairman of the city's Human Rights Commission and City Housing Authority and a Family Court judge. He has run uncuccessfully for the House four times. The District    The 6th District, which emerged relatively intact from the recent Congressional redistricting, includes predominantly black middle-class areas like Cambria Heights and Springfield Gardens, predominantly white middle-class sections like Bellerose and pockets of poverty and deterioration in South Jamiaca and the Rockaways. The Issues    Mr. Golar, backed by the Queens Democratic organization, says Mr. Flake has been a \\"part-time congressman\\" who spends too much time on his church activities and not enough on his congressional duties. Mr. Flake dismisses the charges, saying the \\"real issue\\" is that he is working to help the community gain \\"grass roots\\" power and that this threatens local party loyalists, for whom Mr. Golar is fronting. Analysis    Mr. Flake started as the far-better-known incumbent, with a small army of committed political workers from his church, so the outcome will depend on how successful Mr. Golar and his own cadre of party workers are in making Mr. Golar known to the voters and in persuading them that Mr. Flake has shortcomings that shortchange them. 10TH DISTRICT: BROOKLYN The Candidates    EDOLPHUS TOWNS, 58. Teacher, hospital administrator and college professor in New York before becoming deputy borough president of Brooklyn in 1976. Elected to Congress in 1982.    SUSAN ALTER, 50. A founder of the Flatbush Development Corporation. Has been a member of the City Council since 1978.    FRANK SEDDIO, 45. Lawyer and former police officer. Former district manager of Community Planning Board 18 and former assistant commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation. The District    The new 10th District, which sits like a canopy over the northern part of Brooklyn, was redrawn this year to maximize black voter strength. Still, it pulls in widely diverse areas, including predominantly white middle-income sections like Carroll Gardens and Brooklyn Heights","excerpt":"predominantly minority areas like Bedford-Stuyvesant and East New York; Williamsburg, where Hasidic and Hispanic residents co-exist uneasily, and white, blue-collar Cararsie. The Issues    Mr. Towns, who is backed by the Brooklyn Democratic organization, says Ms. Alter, his principal opponent and a white woman, does not understand \\"the unity of the black community.\\" He also argues that she does not have the seniority or connections to be effective in Congress. Ms. Alter criticizes Mr. Towns for \\"poor constituent service,\\" for his involvement in the House Bank scandal and for taking money from the tabacco industry. Mr. Towns rejects those charges, saying he had \\"overdrafts\\" but no bounced checks. And he says he accepts less tobacco money than other New York congressmen. Analysis    After facing only token opposition in the voting booth since his election to Congress in 1982, Mr. Towns is contending against strong anti-incumbency sentiments, redistricting and an unexpectedly strong showing by Ms. Alter. Mr. Towns has captured almost every major political endorsement but must hold on to the support of the largely minority sections of the new district to win. Ms. Alter, who entered the race late, has made inroads into the mostly black neighborhoods. Mr. Seddio is expected to get support mainly in Canarsie, where he is from. 12TH DISTRICT: QUEENS, BROOKLYN, MANHATTAN The Candidates    ELIZABETH COLON, 40. Former executive director of the Association of Puerto Rican Executive Directors, a public policy and advocacy organization. She lives on the Lower East Side.    RUBEN FRANCO, 45. Former president of the Puerto Rican Legel Defense and Education Fund, a civil right group. He lives in the South Bronx.    ERIC RUANO MELANDEZ, 42. Assistant professor of psychology at Bronx Community College and is a member of the New Alliance Party. He lives in the South Bronx.    STEPHEN J. SOLARZ, 51. United States representative from the 13th District in Brooklyn since 1975. Serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Lives in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn.    NYDIA M. VELAZUEZ, 39. Former secretary of the Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs in the United States. Lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The District    Hispanic residents represent 58 percent of the district's total population. Of the registered Democrats, Hispanics represent 49 percent, non-Hispanic whites are 29 percent, blacks are 16 percent and Asian Americans are 5 percent. The Issues    In a race where the leading candidates are not widely separated by ideology, the central issue is whether a non-Hispanic, Mr. Solarz, can capably represent a district that is predominantly Hispanic. Mr. Solarz says that he can, and that he has the experience to deliver services more effectively. His rivals say he will be out of touch with his Spanish-speaking constituents. Analysis    With a $2 million warchest that has enabled him to inundate the Spanish and English-language media with advertisements. Mr. Solarz is considered the frontrunner. But he has been wounded by the House bank scandal, and if one Hispanic candidate -- most likely Ms. Velazquez or Ms. Colon -- can grab a preponderance of Hispanic votes, the race could become extremely close. 17TH DISTRICT: BRONX, WESTCHESTER The Candidates    ELIOT L. ENGEL, 45. Former teacher and State Assemblyman who grew up in Co-Op City. Seeking his third term in the House, where he serves on the Foreign Affairs Committee    MARIO BAIGGI, 74. Was Bronx Democratic Congressman for 20 years. Mr. Biaggi's most recent term was cut short in 1989, when he received an eight-year prison sentence for among other things, bribery and extortion. A judge freed him last year to receive treatment for what were called life-threatening heart and neurological problems. The District    The redrawn 17th District cuts through the northern Bronx and darts into parts of southern Westchester County. Its population is now nearly two-thirds black and Hispanic. Some of Mr. Biaggi's former strong holds, like the white ethnic neighborhoods of Morris Park and Thogs Neck, were excised. The district includes includes Co-Op City; the Irish working-class enclaves of Woodlawn and Norwood, and south Mount Vernon and its middle-class black homeowners. The Issues    While neighborhoods vary, voters have many of the same concerns -- affordable health care and housing, more jobs, lower taxes and above all, safer streets. And for many, Mr. Biaggi himself is an issue. He has based his comeback bid, in part, on his political record, a reputation for championing the working people through unflagging constituent service and legislation over 10 terms in Congress. Mr. Engel has tried to shift the focus to Mr. Biaggi's conviction on charges stemming from the Wedtech bribery scandal. Analysis    Mr. Biaggi, a police officer for 23 years prior to his political career, has been endorsed by the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and other police groups. But he faces formidable obstacles, including Mr. Engel's contention that Mr. Biaggi \\"disgraced\\" his former office. Democratic leaders have not welcomed Mr. Biaggi back. Though less colorful than his opponent, Mr. Engel is better-organized and better-financed.

But rising consumption and capital spending in Japan suggest it may be revving up its motor, too. A spate of reports on economic activity in July that are due out in Tokyo this week -- the unemployment rate and retail sales today, automobile production and automobile exports tomorrow and construction orders and industrial production on Wednesday -- should give a clearer picture of whether the Asian giant is waking up.    TOO INCHOATE TO CALL -- Gassing up the S.U.V. is getting expensive, and the value of your house might be about to turn south. Glass half empty. On the other hand, the economy is humming along. Glass half full. The monthly measure of Americans' economic anxiety level comes out tomorrow, and whatever it shows, it will not be a trend. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell last month after rising in June, rising in May and falling in April. (Last Friday, the University of Michigan's monthly survey showed a sharper-than-expected drop in consumer sentiment, so brace yourselves.) Three other gauges of our collective material well-being -- figures on personal income (expected to be flat), personal spending (expected to be up 0.2 percent) and jobless claims -- follow on Thursday.    COMING INDICATORS -- Then there are macroeconomic numbers: factory orders for July, due out tomorrow","excerpt":"preliminary G.D.P. growth for the second quarter and preliminary corporate profits on Wednesday; construction spending for July on Thursday; and then the big one, the August unemployment rate, on Friday. It will probably remain at 5 percent, though Bloomberg News said the median forecast of the economists it surveyed called for an increase of 190,000 jobs. Taken together, the reports are unlikely to be surprising enough to move the stock market out of its current meandering in the neighborhood of 10,500.    REST STOP -- Auto sales for the month will also be announced on Thursday, and are expected to be down sharply from the blowout months of June and July. General Motors, which cleared out much of its inventory by using employee-discount pricing for all comers, is likely to report a big drop in sales, while Ford stands to gain. The Big Three are still offering employee-price promotions, but the sizzle has faded. August sales figures from leading retailers are also due out Thursday; some disappointing results last month were attributed to consumers spending more time and money in car lots than in malls.  THE O.C. SINGERS -- Is there such a thing as an O.C. effect? The popular Fox teenage drama ''The O.C.'' has spawned several successful soundtrack albums featuring music by bands like Nada Surf and the Dandy Warhols, which are not typically heard on prime time (or on MTV, for that matter). One of the best known ''O.C.'' bands, Death Cab for Cutie, releases its new album, ''Plans,'' tomorrow, providing a test case for a possible crossover effect on sales.    ALSO THIS WEEK -- Hawaii is capping the price of wholesale gasoline, the first such action by a state since the price controls and oil shocks of the 1970's.  A New Jersey judge will weigh whether to postpone the Sept. 12 start of a trial that will pit Merck against a postal worker who had a heart attack after taking the company's painkiller Vioxx.
