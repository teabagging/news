For example, she appropriates images from a variety of sources, including books. She uses photographs not to document reality but to question what reality is and to expose meanings in Eastern and Western art that have not previously been brought to the surface. She dislikes generalizations and makes art that argues that nothing can be known once and for all, and no identity -- whether personal, sexual or national -- is ever immutable.   What distinguishes her lush but spare and exacting work is not its intellectual ambition but its sensibility, self-assurance and independence. In the best works in her show at Jay Gorney Modern Art in SoHo, Ms. Charlesworth's call to consciousness is not at the expense of enchantment and feeling. Her blend of spiritual intensity and conceptual precision has the freshness and weightlessness of those medieval and Renaissance miniatures or predella panels in which the world seems revealed for the first time.

In its place comes a new -- and equally dubious -- strategic calculation. With Iraq now installed as public enemy No. 1, the threat of Iranian adventurism is dismissed as a lesser evil. In some ways, it's simply the old failed policy in reverse. Baghdad's control over the Shiite south was seen as a strategic bulwark against a fundamentalist Iran.

Tax-exempt municipal bonds would also have less intrinsic appeal under a system of lower tax rates, but money-market funds, bank accounts and corporate and Government bonds would gain new sparkle.
