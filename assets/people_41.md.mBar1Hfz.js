Andrew Graham-Dixon, the chief art critic at the London newspaper The Independent, argues that while Hodgkin's work cannot be limited to one school of painting, if it falls within any tradition at all it is that of the Intimists -- Matisse, Bonnard, Vuillard -- \\"only insofar as his concern has always been with the articulation in paint of moments of thought or feeling.\\" Or as the 62-year-old Hodgkin, who was knighted in 1992, puts it himself: \\"I paint representational pictures of emotional situations.\\" Hodgkin's art has been slow to evolve. It was not until the mid-1970's, Mr. Graham-Dixon believes, that the painter's work reached its potential. Most of the paintings from the 1980's on are rendered in vivid, evanescent oils on wood and frame, with the frame becoming inseparable from the painting itself. \\"Howard Hodgkin\\" is that rare but sublime match of author and subject, paintings and text. Indeed, Mr. Graham-Dixon's erudite and endlessly quotable study is a profound meditation not only on this particular artist's work and career, but on the nature of art itself.\\nROBIN LIPPINCOTT IN SHORT: NONFICTION","excerpt":"Representations of Emotion"},{"year":"1950","title":"DEPORTATIONS DENOUNCED","excerpt":"Representations of Foreign Born See 'Police State' Here"},{"year":"1932","title":"Chinese-Japanese relations TOKYO IS DISTURBED BY ATTITUDE ABROAD","excerpt":"Representations on Sending of Troops to Shanghai Create Concern Among Officials.

By Lawrence K. Grossman. Viking, $24.95.     Ever since the decline of ancient Athens, the opponents of direct democracy have had a ready-made rationale: such government might be nice, but it just isn't practical","excerpt":"representatives are necessary to educate the population and filter out any of its political eccentricities. But according to Lawrence K. Grossman in \\"The Electronic Republic,\\" technology is making representative government obsolete. The public, now able to educate and organize itself with computer networks, no longer wants its will to be filtered through Washington. Mr. Grossman examines the implications of this change and offers tentative suggestions so that the new \\"electronic republic\\" might avoid the pitfalls that befell Athens. Not surprisingly, the question that worried Jefferson reappears: If the people have power, will they be up to the challenge of ruling? Mr. Grossman answers with a qualified yes; the people, he argues, will probably be no worse than the politicians they now elect. But he also worries about the decline of a central control, wondering if a \\"big brotherhood of the entire citizenry\\" will emerge. And he fears that the information superhighway -- the people's main tool of liberation -- will become a private toll road for monopolistic corporations. But it is often unclear whether Mr. Grossman looks forward to the future or dreads it, and his ponderous, repetitive prose does not help. He sometimes resorts to fortune-cookie aphorisms: \\"Everything depends on how the technology is used, by whom and for what purpose.\\" Of course, Mr. Grossman, a former president of the Public Broadcasting Service and NBC News, is most comfortable when reporting firsthand experiences within the television industry. But when he suggests that PBS should expand into \\"democracy's great electronic forum\\" at the Government's expense, one wonders about his political savvy. The future may hold direct democracy, but it is hard to envision a larger Government check for PBS. DOUGLAS A.
