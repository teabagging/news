At Carnegie Recital Hall Tuesday night, accompanied by the thoughtful and responsive pianist Margo Garrett, Miss Martin presented one of the most exciting debut concerts of the year. She offered music ranging from Monteverdi to Mozart to Mahler and beyond, singing in English, French, Italian, German and even Hungarian with impeccable diction and sure musicianship.   Miss Martin built Monteverdi's ''Il Lamento d'Arianna'' into a narrative of excruciating intensity, yet three songs from Mahler's ''Des Knaben Wunderhorn'' were marked by serene elevation. It is this chameleonlike ability to adapt to her material, combined with a lovely voice, that makes Miss Martin an important artist. Berg's ''Vier Lieder'' (Op. 2) were laden with a heavy, smoldering sensuality, yet Miss Martin effortlessly leapt into Mozart's courtly ''Chi'io mi scordi di te?'' (K. 505), then delivered a selection of Poulenc songs while leaning against the piano like a cheerful chanteuse. Miss Martin even managed to impart a touch of class to Nicolas Flagello's sweaty ''Quattro Amori.'' Surprisingly, it all worked","excerpt":"Miss Martin is the mistress of all she surveys.

Earlier in the recital, the Japanese-born musician, who has studied in her native land and with Beveridge Webster at Juilliard, displayed a penchant for proper but episodic interpretations. And her preference in repertory for the Romantic epic and the Impressionist image required much more. Such works as Scriabin's Sonata No. 5 and Schumann's Fantasy were lacking in structure and drive. A broadly shaped phrase would end and another gesture would begin, at times stiffly. Miss Nakai's technique, while more than adequate, also stiffened in the face of some of Schumann's and Debussy's demands.   Yet, Miss Nakai's basic instincts were correct and in the demanding, expansive Liszt work - as in the American premiere of Miyoshi's Scriabinesque ''En Vers'' - she showed herself to be in full control of the musical material. Perhaps the intervening intermission relaxed her nerves, or perhaps she simply understood this music well and has lived with it and cared for it. But the Liszt Sonata unfolded with concentration and sensitivity","excerpt":"Miss Nakai's technique was still not transcendental, but her musical understanding lifted this performance well above the others on the program and was distinguished in its own right.

Produced by Niccolo Theodoli, with an English dialogue sound track tacked on by the American distributors, this sorry import squanders some lavish, heavily populated settings and such capable performers as Gino Cervi and the curvaceous Silvana Pampanini in a smirking account of how two American sailors play havoc with the glory that was Rome and, of course, Nero's.The excruciating mugging and bleating of these two \\"top bananas,\\" Walter Chiari and Carlo Campanini by name, set the tone and pace of the whole Joe Miller enterprise. Martin and Lewis, supposedly their American counterparts, are Shakespearean in comparison.

Somerset Maugham's novel \\"The Painted Veil,\\" which accompanies the Palace's new stage bill. It will be recalled that the 1934 version, even with Miss Garbo's artistry, was less than memorable. Likewise the new picture yesterday.Mr. Maugham's ironic drama of an adulterous tangle in a British colony in and around Hong Kong has been moved up to 1949, but it generally seems as remote now as the very setting. Even with two very workmanlike performances (including Miss Barker's), the handsome oriental mounting of David Lewis' production, and a generally adult approach to a serious theme, it misses fire. Ronald Neame's thoughtful direction is no match for a conversational and rather cumbersome plot, by now familiar, that unwinds slowly and none too forcefully.Karl Tunberg's scenario follows Mr. Maugham faithfully in content, with some minor character shuffling. Miss Parker is a selfish, American (this time) bleakly married to a British bacteriologist. Bill Travers, who revengefully takes her to a plague-ridden outpost after discovering her affair with a weak charmer. Jean Pierre Aumont. Steadied by a friendly, rather seedy George Sanders, as a village resident, and a wise nun, splendidly portrayed by Françoise Rosay, the cynical wife seeks and finds retribution. Unlike Herbert Marshall, back in 1934, Mr. Travers dies, as his wife finally comes to love him.Exquisitely gowned, and looking as cool as a cucumber, cholera or no cholera, Miss Parker makes a sincere, often moving heroine, in spite of (at least to this viewer) her almost blinding beauty. It's a tough part","excerpt":"Miss Parker tackles it like a professional. Mr. Travers is earnest, but a boyish contrast indeed to Mr. Marshall's suave icicle.

A distant relation of \\"Oklahoma!\\" with such unrelated godfathers as Stephen Vincent Benét and Plutarch, this lively fable skillfully blends a warm and comic yarn about the rustic romances of a family of Oregonian pioneers with strikingly imaginative choreography and a melodic score several notches above standard. And, an amiable and talented cast go to it with a will to make these cheerful ingredients infectious.Perhaps it is not especially important to divine precisely what the author, or the scenarists who adapted his story, \\"The Sobbin' Women,\\" had in mind. Suffice it to say that the results add up to a gay tale about seven strapping young farmers whose unkempt persons and filthy cabin have never benefited by the tender distaff touch until, that is, the oldest brings home a comely bride.That tiny but spirited lass not only changes their manners and habits but also, in typically feminine fashion, acts as Cupid's handmaiden by introducing them to Plutarch's legend about the Sabine women (Mr. Benet's \\"Sobbin' Women\\"). So, hungering for companionship and love, our rugged Romeos raid the village according to the Latin tradition and return with six unwilling maidens, who, as might be expected, learn to like the arrangement even if their parents do not.Call this a somewhat thin story line but it has been enhanced by the contributions of Michael Kidd, whose dance creations are in keeping with the times (1850) and with the seemingly unbounded energy of the principals. He has provided them with a repertoire that could be exhausting. But such agile craftsmen as Jacques d'Amboise, Marc Platt, Tommy Rall, Russ Tamblyn, Matt Mattox and Jeff Richards give them a dizzying whirl. And, it might be noted specifically, the combination of ballet, acrobatics and a knockdown and drag-out fight he has conjured up to go with a barnraising scene should leave audiences panting and cheering.The eight songs fashioned by Gene de Paul and Johnny Mercer are fresh and lilting and fitted neatly into the speedy proceedings. Chances are that \\"When You're In Love,\\" a ballad delivered in fine, romantic style by Howard Keel and Jane Powell, will be hitting the juke boxes soon. \\"Spring, Spring, Spring,\\" gaily warbled by both the \\"brothers\\" and \\"sisters\\" of the title, and 'Wonderful, Wonderful Day,\\" to which Mr. Keel's pretty bride, Miss Powell, gives a smooth and tender rendition, are easy on the ears too. And, \\"Sobbin' Women,\\" a rhythmic, bouncy ditty, is done rousingly by Mr. Keel and his \\"brothers.\\"Stanley Donen, a director who is no stranger to M-G-M musicals, has kept the pace of this lark swift and in time with the tunes. And, Mr. Keel, whose baritone is as big and impressive as his frame","excerpt":"Miss Powell, who sings and acts to the pioneer manner born, as well as their sturdy and energetic kinfolk—and this must include the nubile, dancing damsels they abduct—are lovely to look at and hear. Although the powers at M-G-M are deviating from the normal song-and-dance extravaganza in \\"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,\\" it is a gamble that is paying rich rewards.Featured on the stage are Nanci Crompton, the ballet corps, the Rockettes, an equestrian act featuring Roberto De Vasconscellos and Erika, Larry Griswold, the Glee Club and violinist Harry Cykman and the Music Hall Symphony Orchestra.

By Mary Wilson with Patricia Romanowski and Ahrgus Juilliard. Illustrated. 292 pp. New York: St. Martin's Press. $16.95.    EARLY in her autobiography about her years with Motown's premier hit makers of the 1960's, Mary Wilson recounts how as a child she was beaten for soiling her aunt's gowns while playing dress-up. Punishment from authority figures hammered home a lesson - ''maintain peace, no matter what the cost'' - that Ms. Wilson retained even when the gowns were provided by Berry Gordy Jr., the founder and owner of Motown Records, who intended to promote the glamour of the ascendant Supreme, Diana (formerly Diane) Ross. Every successful musical group needs members who hold the act together, who feel without question they are part of an operation greater than themselves. Ms. Wilson was the adhesive of the Supremes, the group that symbolizes Motown for many people. In the triumphant afterglow of Motown's 25th-anniversary television special, various general histories of the company (Nelson George's ''Where Did Our Love Go?'' remains the most coherent and thoughtful) have appeared. But never has a Motown veteran spoken out as a first-person witness from inside Hitsville. Ms. Wilson, who lives in Hollywood and works as a singer, took the title of this book from the Broadway musical ''Dreamgirls.''

Especially with some promotional posters of a girl bluntly informing her parents of her pregnancy. Well, here in the middle of a deluge of screen junk about flaming youth, is a surprisingly decent and, absorbing case history that rings true. With a cast headed by Mary Webster, William Campbell, Martha Scott and Jim Backus, this deceptively labeled little drama, produced by Edmond Chevie, opened yesterday at the Paramount.It's just too bad that a picture assembled with so much care and thought should hinge on the matter of a simple, typographical error (on a marriage register). A trick of fate, perhaps, but a trick nevertheless. Also, at about the half-way mark, the sensible little heroine, herself roughened up considerably by fate, foolishly snares herself a no-good, trumpet-playing rake who should have fooled nobody.The plot traces the shock, shame, bitterness and desperation of a singularly nice young widow and mother unable to prove her marriage after an elopment. (A Mexican clerk has scribbled Payne for Bayne.) Unable to convince her embarrassed family or her cool parents-in-law, the hapless girl drops her \\"crowd\\" (equally nice youngsters), latches onto some sleazy, fly-by-night musicians. Unable to make her new paramour marry her, she is salvaged from a car wreck by the fine lad, a disk jockey, who has loved her all along.Such a tale of woe may sound like big soap opera suds, but it isn't, and for very apparent reasons. The acting is consistently good: Miss Webster, a younger Jeanne Crain type, in a very tough role indeed","excerpt":"Miss Scott, as her sweet, weak mother; Mr. Backus, a callous but realistic stepfather; Damian O'Flynn and Katherine Barrett, as the frosty in-laws. William Campbell plays the slick, despicable trumpet-tooter Miss Webster prefers to the stalwart Ron Hagerthy (again, why?), and both lads are fine. So are the shapely Jackie Loughery and an old friend, Jackie Coogan, on the sidelines.If the acting is all it should be, so is Joe Parker's adroit direction. The dialogue is excellent, which brings us to the real stars of this disarming little picture: Dale and Katharine Eunson, the scenarists. Simply by refurbishing a stock story through all-too-human characterizations, Mr. and Mrs. Eunson have shaped an appealing, if not memorable, sermon on self-deception and selfishness.

Walker, the 100th Mayor of New York City Bob Hope, for once, looks frightened almost out of his wits. Almost, but not quite. Smiling uneasily beneath a slanted hat brim, a rather subdued comedian saunters through Paramount's \\"Beau James,\\" a stanchly affectionate screen Valentine to a political legend, which opened yesterday at the Astor.Adapted from Gene Fowler's biography by Jack Rose (who also produced) and Melville Shavelson (who directed), this rather jauntily righteous drama should offend and enlighten nobody.The background for a political career that was undeniably picturesque could hardly be more so, capturing a vintage Manhattan in a VistaVision panorama replete with period trimmings, tunes and excellent color photography. The Jimmy Walker we find here is a frank playboy who somehow managed some clean figure-skating around notorious civic corruption and lived for, and certainly amid, the bright lights of a city he loved.The picture, and Mr. Hope himself, state simply that the political Jimmy Walker was \\"honest but dumb.\\" After a song-and-dance campaign (apparently) that landslides him into City Hall, the unwilling Mayor naively instigates three actions that more or less simultaneously backfire him all the way to Albany, in the Sea-bury investigations of 1928.These are some independent civic appointments, a disgusted tolerance of Tammany Hall demands, made by Paul Douglas as its spokesman, and his frank preference of a Broadway showgirl (Vera Miles) to his estranged wife (Alexis Smith).Most of the picture jovially waves Mr. Hope on uptown, where he vacillates between the two loving, rather exasperated ladies. With the investigation's outcome pending, Mr. Hope somewhat gallantly resigns, after joining Jimmy Durante, playing himself, in a soft-shoe shuffle and shakily leading a St. Patrick's Day parade.Considering their rather deferential assignments, Miss Miles, as Betty Compton","excerpt":"Miss Smith, and Darren McGavin, as the Mayor's secretary, are surprisingly convincing. Mr. Hope's hero is a likable fellow, unquestionably. Maybe it doesn't matter that a personable, capable man, in the country's second toughest political post, became \\"the city's heart\\" instead of its con-science.
