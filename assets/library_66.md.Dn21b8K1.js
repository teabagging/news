''Our idea was to present classical concerts in an at-home, living room atmosphere,'' Ms. Balint said. ''The hall at the Bronxville Women's Club, with its near perfect acoustics, lends the feeling of being a guest in a home.  With a preconcert lecture to give familiarity to what is coming up and a lavish, festive reception following the music, the series offers complete evenings of friendship, music and food.''     The third season of Chamber Music Westchester opens tonight at 7:30 with a preconcert talk by A. Lucky Checkley Jr., then travels from Baroque to Bluegrass, as Ms. Balint is joined by another virtuoso of the mandolin, Barry Mitterhoff, and the guitarist William Anderson. The stylistic progression includes music by Vivaldi, Beethoven and Albeniz leading to a Brazilian Choros, the traditional American ''Old Joe Clark'' (for that one Ms. Balint trots out her fiddle), and true to the evening's title, two bluegrass tunes by Bill Munroe.

In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, grape juice and 1 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil, stirring. Remove from the heat and cool.    2. In a food processor, purée the grapes with the syrup, sake and lime juice. Transfer to a 9-inch-by-9-inch metal pan and freeze, stirring with a fork every 30 minutes, for 3 hours, or until it is firm but not solid. Serve in sake cups and garnish with a halved (or peeled) black grape, if desired.     Note: the granita may be made a few days in advance and kept tightly covered.

Place the flours, salt, milk, 1/4 cup water, 2 tablespoons melted butter and eggs in a blender.     Mix for 10 seconds or until perfectly smooth. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.    2. Meanwhile, stir together the mascarpone, preserves and lemon zest in a small bowl, using a rubber spatula. Refrigerate until needed.    3. To make the crêpes, preheat a 7-inch seasoned crêpe pan over moderate heat and brush with a little of the melted butter. When it is hot, ladle 1 1/84 cup of the batter into the skillet, tilting it to evenly spread the batter as quickly as possible.    4. Heat until the edges are cooked and the bottom is colored with dark swirls, about 45 seconds. To flip the crêpe, use a fork to lift one edge, and then quickly turn it over with your fingers. Cook the second side for 30 seconds, and then slide it onto a wire rack. Continue with the remaining batter, stacking the cooked crêpes.    5. To serve, spread each crêpe with Nutella, and then add a few spoonfuls of the filling. Fold in half.
