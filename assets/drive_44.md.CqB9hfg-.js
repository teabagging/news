But, when Frank Tuttle, the director, proceeds to unbosom his yarn of rum, romance and robbery, there are incidents that cause one to think that there may be quite an exciting half-hour in Old Nassau, if this picture is shown there in its present form.It is another case where the pro???er in estimating the mentality of audiences has aimed nearer the kindergarten than the preparatory school. So far as the dialogue portions are concerned, they are not particularly good in tone and the lines are hopeless. With the possible exception of Chester Conklin, all one can say for the utterances of the players is that they memorized them. There is very little back of the words and the male contingent are partial to a monotone.Mr. Conklin appears as a janitor at the university. He has been brought to this lowly position through his weakness for gin. Charles Rogers impersonates Jimmy Duffy, who, while he is unaware of it, is the janitor's son. This results in the lovely idea of the janitor keeping an eye on Duffy, a Princeton student.When Duffy first reaches the seat of learning he is accosted by a young man who asks what Duffy is going to take up. Duffy has his hand on a baseball glove and the other student supposes that Duffy will go in for baseball. But Duffy, in a spoken sequence, asserts that he is going in for books. His companion forthwith digs up a \\"book\\" and the credulous Duffy takes it to be a copy of \\"As You Like It\\" or something of the sort. His friend, however, explains the mystery of this book by twisting one corner off it and demonstrating that its weight is chiefly caused by whisky.Through Mr. Conklin there is a blacksmithean attempt to wring a tear from the audiences. This janitor, who has adopted the name of Conlan, and is known to the students as \\"Pop,\\" appears to be heartbroken because of all the young men whom he encounters in the course of his none-too arduous duties, Duffy is the only one who has not up to that moment addressed him as \\"Pop.\\"To add to the confusion of things in this banality, Duffy falls in love with Fay, a performer in a Wild West show. Then there is a Trenton speakeasy frequented by thugs who, after a drink or two, steal the money Duffy had collected for a college fund. Poor old Conlan is incured but the money is regained and in the last fade-out Fay and Duffy are beheld all serene as they walk away from the camera on Princeton's grounds.In one of the audible portions of this venture, Mr. Conklin hazards a cough. It sounds more like the last part of a lion's growl.It is a pity that in many sections of the world some gullible persons will gain a lamentable idea of Princeton University from this film. Sons of Harvard will be intensely amused at it, for it hasn't even the trifling virtues of the screen idea \\"Brown of Harvard.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Rum, Romance and Robbery."},{"year":"1923","title":"liquor bearing label of T Shine's restaurant seized in fashionable apartment NEW YORK 'EVIDENCE' IN WASHINGTON RAID","excerpt":"Rum, So Labeled, Is Found in Big Liquor Stock Seized in Fashionable Apartment."},{"year":"1952","title":"As a pleasant reminder of the culinary possibilities of rum, the distiller of a Jamaica rum recently held a Caribbean garden party in the Manahattan home of food writer Poppy Cannon.
