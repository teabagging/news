And then he adds, as if as an afterthought: \\"And she is going to make history!\\"   Through the dimness, Geraldine A. Ferraro flashes her familiar smile. A shiver of emotion passes through the crowd.   The first woman to run for Vice President of the United States from a major party is running for public office again, hoping to win a Senate seat from New York next year. Everywhere she goes -- Democratic fund-raisers in Washington, campaign stops in New York -- she generates tremendous feeling. But is it excitement, or just nostalgia? Running for Same Seat    When Walter Mondale summoned her to Minnesota to be his running mate in 1984, Ms. Ferraro had been planning to run for the same Senate seat she is running for today -- the one held by the Republican Alfonse M. D'Amato. As she explains it, she is simply picking up where she left off. \\"Everybody's gone on with their lives,\\" she said recently. \\"It's time for me to get on with mine.\\"   Yet to many New York politicians, there is something almost poignant about Ms. Ferraro's latest campaign, a \\"you can go home again\\" optimism that defies most electoral experience -- especially her own.    The last time Ms. Ferraro was considering a Senate race, she was an up-and-coming but relatively obscure Congresswoman from Queens. Now, at age 56, she has a permanent place in American history texts, and her candidacy for any office is a national event.   But fame for Ms. Ferraro came with unpleasant side effects. In 1985, her husband, John Zaccaro, a real estate developer, pleaded guilty to scheming to fraudulently obtain bank financing. Three years later, her son, John Jr., was convicted of selling cocaine to an undercover agent. Both events received extensive coverage, and they continue to exert an undeniable drag on her candidacy.   At a recent campaign speech delivered to a standing-room-only crowd at Columbia University, Ms. Ferraro said she thought crime was the biggest problem facing New York State. After the speech, a young woman asked with some embarrassment how Ms. Ferraro could be an effective voice against crime given her own family's experience.   Ms. Ferraro brushed aside the question, saying that her husband and son, now in law school, had \\"paid their debt to society.\\" But as she travels across the state, the question always seems to be lurking just beneath the surface.   \\"There's a lot of interest in her out there,\\" said one prominent New York State Democrat. \\"But I can't put my finger on a lot of support for her.\\" Passion for Politics    \\"Gerry,\\" he added, \\"has a passion for this stuff that overcomes a lot of other factors.\\"   This passion may be hard for many to understand. In her book about her Vice-Presidential race, Ms. Ferraro wrote that if she had known the pain the campaign would cause her family she would have asked Mr. Mondale to choose another running mate.    Now, though, Ms. Ferraro maintains that neither she nor her husband nor her three children ever regretted the race. \\"The good times so outweighed the bad,\\" she said. \\"Who else had the opportunity to do what we did?\\"    Ms. Ferraro's propensity to talk about her feelings and experiences -- even if in contradictory terms -- makes her unusual among politicians","excerpt":"she gives an impression of openness at a time when many other candidates seem pre-programmed.  Rapport With Voters    \\"She distinguishes herself by having a real rapport with voters,\\" said Madeleine Albright, a friend and foreign-policy adviser of Ms. Ferraro's. \\"People sense a personal warmth in her.\\"    Ms. Ferraro says she is running for the Senate because she believes in public service, and thinks she can make a difference. \\"The thing I look forward to is being able to have a voice in the policies that affect this country,\\" she said in a recent interview.    Clearly, she also misses Washington.  \\"I'm so anxious to get back here,\\" she confided recently to a Washington reporter.   In her years in the House, Ms. Ferraro was known as a moderate Democrat with a keen insider's understanding of Congress; after just three terms she was already close to many in the House leadership. In the years since she left Washington, Ms. Ferraro has satisfied her political urges by campaigning for other Democratic candidates. If she has any doubts about becoming a candidate herself again, after a seven-year hiatus, she does not show them. Facing a crowd of potential voters, she seems relaxed and confident, happy to be back on the stump.  Traditional Democratic Issues    In her campaign, Ms. Ferraro says she plans to emphasize traditional Democratic issues like education and health care, and women's issues, like abortion rights, which she favors.    The recent hearings on the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court -- and the charges of sexual harassment leveled against him -- have heightened public consciousness about women's issues, and Ms. Ferraro has not hesitated to take advantage of this. When Anita F. Hill came forward to testify against Judge Thomas, Ms. Ferraro praised her for her courage and disclosed that she too had once had a boss who made advances to her -- when she was 18 and working as a part-time typist.    Beyond raising such issues, though, Ms. Ferraro does not offer many concrete proposals for dealing with them. Her campaign speeches tend to be heavy on lofty goals and low on practical details.    \\"I want to go to Washington for the same reason I ran for Vice President,\\" she told the audience at Columbia. \\"I believe it is time to give the country back to the people.\\" Other Democrats Running    More than a year before the election, it is difficult even to guess about her chances of making it back to Washington because of the crowded Democratic field. In addition to Ms. Ferraro, there are three other Democrats who would like the nomination. They are Robert Abrams, the New York Attorney General; Elizabeth Holtzman, the New York City Comptroller, and Representative Bob Mrazek of Long Island.   On many issues, it is hard even to tell the candidates apart; in the past, as Ms. Ferraro herself frequently notes, she has supported all of her present opponents. Six years ago, for example, after she decided not to run against Mr. D'Amato, she invited Mr. Abrams to breakfast and urged him to make the race instead. He declined.    \\"Bobby's a good person,\\" Ms. Ferraro said, acknowledging the awkwardness of now running against him. \\"But I can be the more effective person.\\"   In this confusing four-way race, Ms. Ferraro has the obvious advantage of nearly universal name recognition, and the money that that attracts. Federal election filings show that she led her rivals in fund-raising for the first six months of the year, although she also led them in spending. Negative Feelings Expressed    Some recent polls, which are considered highly speculative, show Ms. Ferraro to be gaining on Mr. Abrams, who is generally considered the front-runner for the nomination. But the polls also show voters have stronger negative feelings about Ms. Ferraro than they do about her opponents.   Ms. Ferraro candidly acknowledges her high negatives, and speaks openly -- indeed disconcertingly so -- about how she plans to combat them.    \\"When we did our focus groups, we found out there are people who don't like me -- it's hard to say, but they don't,\\" she said in an interview at her Manhattan campaign office.    \\"When we pressed it,\\" she continued, \\"when we said what do you know about her, they said 'We know she ran for Vice President, we know she had all this personal stuff.' When we said to them: 'Did you know her father died when she was 8, that she attended college on a scholarship, that she went to law school at night?' When you went back to them, their opinions moved.\\" Heavy on Personal History    Not surprisingly, Ms. Ferraro's stump speech, still in its formative stages, leans heavily on her personal history -- on her painful childhood, her hard-won college education and her struggle to attend law school at night.    Still, it is precisely Ms. Ferraro's personal history that has prompted many New York Democrats to question whether she is the best candidate for the party to put up against Senator D'Amato next November. Mr. D'Amato, a second-term Republican, has been badly bruised by a series of recent ethics investigations (Over the summer, the Senate Ethics Committee rebuked him for the way he managed his office but declined to censure him.) Some Democrats fear that Ms. Ferraro's own experience would make it difficult for her to exploit the Senator's most obvious vulnerabilities.    \\"There is a concern among active Democrats that the Achilles heel for D'Amato is the ethics problem,\\" said Ed Szczesniak, chairman of the Onondaga County Democratic Party. \\"So the person with the greatest opportunity for success is the person who is quote-unquote squeaky clean.\\" Ms. Ferraro, he said, lowering his voice, \\"comes with baggage.\\"   Many Democrats are also concerned about the \\"spoiler\\" effect that Ms. Ferraro's candidacy could exert. Political analysts say they believe she will draw support away from Ms. Holtzman in New York City and Mr. Abrams upstate, making it difficult for any candidate to enter the general election with a clear mandate. And recently, some feminists have gone so far as to urge either Ms. Ferraro or Ms. Holtzman to drop out of the race to avoid splitting the women's vote.   For her part, Ms. Ferraro dismisses these worries as \\"shallow,\\" and as for the concern that she is not the best candidate to challenge Senator D'Amato, Ms. Ferraro insists it is unfounded. \\"Everybody knows everything about me, and everything they know is good,\\" she says, adding, If you're Al D'Amato, how do you attack someone's family?\\"   In Senate Campaign, Ferraro Picks Up Where She Left Off"},{"year":"1921","title":"The following intimate account of the fatal riots in Florence, Italy, which were part of the widespread attempt on the part of the Bolsheviki to effect an uprising throughout the nation, was contained in a letter written to a friend here by Miss Rebecca Baker a Pennysylvania girl, who is now a resident of Florence. on March 5:   AMERICAN GIRL SAW RIOTS IN FLORENCE","excerpt":"She Gives an Intimate Account in a Letter of Attempted Bolshevist Uprising, THIRTY PERSONS KILLED Fascisti Accept Challenge to Battle and Resort to Medieval Tactics When Ammunition Fails."},{"year":"1938","title":"Mrs. Walter Oliver Ford entertained with a luncheon yesterday in the Trianon Room of the Ambassador for Mrs. Leonard B.

SHE IS ME, by Cathleen Schine. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) A skillful domestic comedy (full of cancer victims and short tempers) whose title refers to the frightening probability of growing up to become our mothers. One major character is an expert on ''Madame Bovary''; she is trying to develop a Bovary movie treatment, while nearly everyone has one or more symptoms of Flaubertian adultery.    HOW TO BREATHE UNDERWATER: Stories, by Julie Orringer. (Knopf, $21.) Parents seem well-meaning but ineffectual in these stories; they do everything right, but it doesn't necessarily work. Children and adolescents operate in a secret world of their own, a kind of callous, Darwinian universe that admits reality as illness and loss, aggression and sexuality.    A VENETIAN AFFAIR, by Andrea di Robilant. (Knopf, $24.) Di Robilant elicits, from family documents, an engrossing love story of the 18th century, about one of his aristocratic ancestors and a beautiful, intelligent woman who was altogether unsuitable to the family.    LIVES OF THE CIRCUS ANIMALS, by Christopher Bram. (Morrow, $24.95.) Bram's exceedingly clever novel, set in the world of the theater, is well paced and sexy (both gay and straight); a character much like Ian McKellen is particularly acute about narcissism, the great motor of the stage, which he sees escaping into more and more of everyday life.    ALBION: The Origins of the English Imagination, by Peter Ackroyd. (Nan A. Talese/ Doubleday, $40.) An ingenious essay in cultural anthropology that tries to define its subject through art and literature, without respect to the disciplines of history; for Ackroyd, ''Beowulf'' informs Milton, whether he read it or not, and the same English music is heard in Dowland and Britten, Constable and Blake.    ONE LAST LOOK, by Susanna Moore. (Knopf, $23.) A fine historical and political novel, recorded by Lady Eleanor Oliphant, sister to the governor general of India in the 1830's; its grand set piece is a state visit to the Punjab to ally with a maharajah. Everything goes wrong in Afghanistan, though, and terrible things are seen by those with courage to look.    ELIZABETH COSTELLO, by J. M. Coetzee. (Viking, $21.95.) A haunting short novel whose author was awarded the Nobel Prize last month; its title character, an aging novelist who travels on the university lecture circuit (as Coetzee himself has done), gets into trouble by embracing difficult, unpopular positions on animal rights and the suppression of horrible facts. Compassionate in principle, chilly in practice, her character could support an allegorical proposition: people often fail to behave as they know they should.

One of Miss Whiting's special talents is her ability to use these resources in ways that, rather than seeming to be name-dropping, add warmly revealing color to her programs. She has never done this more effectively than in her current show, written and produced for her by Jack Wrangler, at Freddy's Supper Club, 308 East 49th Street. The fact that her father wrote the songs for the only Ethel Merman show that ever flopped out of town leads her to sing a song from a revised version that finally reached New York - ''You're an Old Smoothie,'' a love song built on collegiate hip talk of the Depression years. This recalls a conversation with Miss Merman in which they find that each made her stage debut playing the same role in ''Girl Crazy,'' which leads to a song by George and Ira Gershwin that they both sang in the show: ''Boy! What Love Has Done to Me,'' a torch song that is both funny and touching in Miss Whiting's treatment.

In her eight months as acting chairwoman, she had cut the annual rate of Russian inflation from around 1,200 percent to 225 percent. But in the end she had run afoul of a superior force -- Russian bankers. \\"Paramonova has declared war on large Russian banks,\\" a banker was quoted in The Financial Times, \\"so we have no alternative but to declare war on her.\\" It turns out that Russian banks borrow long-term at fixed rates of interest from the Central Bank of Russia, and lend short-term to their customers. High inflation allows them to repay their debts to the Central Bank with cheaper rubles.   As a substitute for Greenspan, it is true that Paramonova had her disadvantages.

Central bankers in rich countries no longer have the power to commit serious crimes against their economies. Greenspan would be stripped of his authority by American bankers long before he would be allowed to debase the dollar badly.

ANNETTE MESSAGER (Los Angeles County Museum of Art/Museum of Modern Art/Abrams, paper, $24.95), the catalogue to her  first retrospective exhibition in the United States, now at the Art Institute in Chicago, offers a concise introduction to her art. Ms. Messager, whose greatest  influence is the work of the Surrealists, often works in series; photographs and taxidermized animals have been two constants of her introspective and sometimes  menacing artworks. One of her most tender yet macabre early series, \\"The Boarders,\\" featured an installation of stuffed sparrows in hand-knit sweaters, which she baptized, punished and took for \\"walks,\\" conflating maternal, childlike and corporal impulses. In the 70's, she tackled themes other artists pursued much later: her photo series \\"Voluntary Tortures,\\" which documented women's mudpacks and plastic surgeries, anticipated the work of Jenny Saville and Orlan by nearly two decades, and she used jokes and aphorisms as a means of  ironic cultural commentary long before Richard Prince and Jenny Holzer did. Recently, Ms. Messager has combined drawing and stuffed toys in more pointedly political pieces about global issues. Written by the exhibition's curators, Sheryl Conkelton of the Museum of Modern Art and Carol S. Eliel of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, \\"Annette Messager\\" overlooks some of the artist's  quirkier early works (for \\"My Approaches,\\" for example, she sat at a cafe table  and photographed businessmen's flies), and it neglects to clarify this proto-feminist artist's relationship to American feminist art of the 70's, many  of whose concerns she shared. Still, it traces the evolution of Ms. Messager's singular vision and confirms her status as one of France's most engaging post-modern artists.

She had never been west of Muskogee, and she, her parents and seven brothers and sisters were stepping on a train bound for San Francisco.    \\"I remember as we drove to the train, I felt so sad,\\" she said. \\"I wasn't excited at all. I was trying to memorize every tree, and what the school looked like, which flowers were blooming in my grandfather's front yard, all those sorts of things.\\"    But unlike the Cherokees along the notorious Trail of Tears of the 1830's, who were forced to move from their homeland in what is now the Carolinas and Georgia hundreds of miles west, Wilma Mankiller eventually came home again.    Hers is, in fact, a remarkable tale of a life come full circle, chronicled in a new book, \\"Mankiller: A Chief and Her People\\" (St. Martin's Press), which she wrote with Michael Wallis, a Tulsa journalist and author. It takes her from a childhood in the heart of Cherokee territory to a life as an unhappy housewife in the San Francisco Bay Area to what she says was an awakening in the protests of the 1960's that led her back to Tahlequah in the late 70's as an agitator for water lines, better schools and health clinics.   In 1985, she became the principal chief of the 94,460-member Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. The first elected female leader of a major Indian tribe, she won a full four-year term in 1987 and was re-elected in 1991.   Chief Mankiller, whose mother is of Dutch and Irish descent, is a stocky woman whose face radiates a placid authority. But she can quickly inject a humorous edge into the conversation -- for instance, when the subject of her name comes up.    \\"Mankiller,\\" an old term of respect for Indian warriors who guarded tribal villages, has been in her family for several generations. It's not an unusual name in these parts. There are Fourkillers and Tenkillers and Whitekillers, too. But outside of Oklahoma, she says, it draws comments, questions and even nervous laughs.    \\"Some people do earn their names in native culture,\\" explains Chief Mankiller, who turns 48 on Nov. 18. \\"I didn't, but I don't always tell people that. Sometimes I just say that Mankiller is my name, I earned it, and I let 'em wonder.\\"    But not just anyone can joke about the name. As her book makes clear, she was not amused when the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, noting her presence at President Clinton's economic summit in Little Rock, Ark., said: \\"Our favorite name on the summit list, we have to admit, is Chief Wilma Mankiller, representing the Cherokee Nation, though we hope not a feminist economic priority.\\" Chief Mankiller calls the remark \\"a cheap shot\\" and \\"a rather unfortunate remark about my surname.\\"    At the modern brick-and-glass Cherokee Nation headquarters, the chief offers a study in eclecticism. For one thing, her wall decorations range from the tribal seal to Georgia O'Keeffe prints, from old legal codes written in the Cherokee syllabic alphabet to framed letters from Ronald Reagan and George Bush.   \\"It just came and the staff put it up,\\" she says dismissively of the Reagan letter, which congratulates the chief on her leadership. \\"Ronald Reagan was not good on Indian issues at all. I met with him, along with some other people, and he didn't have the tiniest bit of interest in Indian issues,\\" including increasing Federal funds for Indian health or education. Still, his letter is up there on her wall.   As a tribal chief, she knows plenty of traditional dances. But her favorite dancing song, she says, is Aretha Franklin's \\"Respect.\\"    Chief Mankiller is at once the guardian of a centuries-old Cherokee heritage, encapsulated in the seal and the legal codes, and the chief executive of a major corporation, Cherokee Nation Industries, whose income from factories, a motel, gift shops, a ranch, a lumber company and other concerns accounts for nearly half the tribe's $76 million annual budget. Call the chief and a recording says: \\"Thank you for calling the Cherokee Nation. If you're calling from a touch-tone phone and know your party's extension, please dial it now.\\"   While the Cherokee have a much stronger economic base than many other tribes, and tend to mix their economic and social activities more freely with the surrounding non-Indian population, Chief Mankiller says the money the tribe directs back into health-care and job-training programs, Head Start and a local high school has not produced miracles.   \\"If you look at data over the last 20 years, we've had an impact in infant mortality and the educational attainment level,\\" she says. \\"We're nowhere near where we need to be on any of those issues, nowhere near, but we're headed in the right direction.\\"   In her book, Chief Mankiller alternates accounts of the Cherokee Nation with her own personal narrative, both uncommon stories of survival. In her case, a head-on automobile collision in 1979 almost killed her","excerpt":"she has battled a degenerative nerve disorder, myasthenia gravis, and a few years ago she would have died from kidney failure had an older brother not given her one of his kidneys.   \\"To think of myself outside the context of the tribe or my family or my community would be very difficult,\\" she insists in the interview.   One of the most critical episodes in Chief Mankiller's life was the seizure in 1969 of Alcatraz, in San Francisco Bay, by a group of Indians who claimed the island \\"in the name of Indians of all tribes.\\" They stayed there for 19 months, and Ms. Mankiller visited frequently.   \\"I had felt there was something wrong with me because I wasn't happy being a traditional housewife,\\" says Ms. Mankiller, who at the time was married to a wealthy Ecuadorean businessman, Hugo Olaya. \\"I started listening to what these people were saying. What Alcatraz did for me was, it enabled me to see people who felt like I did but could articulate it much better. We can do something about the fact that treaties are no longer recognized, that there needs to be better education and health care.    \\"This was also the time of the women's movement,\\" she adds, growing more animated. \\"I saw women standing up and speaking out. All these things were powerful influences on me.\\"   She had returned to Oklahoma a few times to see relatives and in, 1971, to take home the body of her father, Charley Mankiller. By 1977, divorced, she returned for good with her daughters, Gina and Felicia, who still live nearby with their four children.    \\"I never felt home until I came home,\\" she explains. \\"When I came back here, then I began to understand, this is where I belong.\\"   \\"One day I went to the courthouse in Stilwell to check on some land and I'm walking across the courthouse square. And there's a group of Cherokee men, old guys chewing tobacco, just sitting in judgment of everybody and the world. And then someone said, 'Ho, there goes John Mankiller's granddaughter!' That had such an impact on me. It was very sweet to my ears. I knew I was home, because no one in a courthouse in San Francisco would have ever said that.\\"    Another profound event a few years after she moved back was her marriage to Charlie Soap, 48, a full-blooded Cherokee and community activist whom she credits with helping her get involved with Cherokee issues and to win election as chief.   \\"My ideas were way more liberal than those of the people I was asking to elect me,\\" she says. But Mr. Soap, who had been in the area a long time, helped to assure the elders that she was not too radical and emphasized that, at least before the arrival of the white man, Cherokee women played a major role in tribal government.   Ms. Mankiller attracted considerable attention with her ascension to tribal leadership in the 1980's and her designation as a Woman of the Year by Ms. Magazine in 1987 -- as well as with honorary degrees from several Ivy League colleges and installation in the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y.   She says that when publishers approached her about writing a book, she insisted that it cover plenty of Cherokee history and the flaws of several figures long revered in American history, from Columbus (she includes a quote from the Indian activist Russell Means that Columbus \\"makes Hitler look like a juvenile delinquent\\") to Thomas Jefferson.   What's next? Next year she and her mother are off to Ireland to search for their roots. And what about 1995, when she is up for re-election?   Her husband, ever the supportive political spouse, says: \\"I'd certainly like to see her continue. If she runs, I'll be there, supporting her, going down roads campaigning for her.\\"    And Chief Mankiller, the successful politician, is judiciously noncommittal. \\"I've kind of put off thinking about that, because it's two years away,\\" she explains. \\"Maybe I'll start thinking about it in the spring.\\" AT WORK WITH: Chief Wilma Mankiller; The Name's the Most and Least of Her"},{"year":"1999","title":"Interview with dancer/choreographer Jin Xing, who is among growing number of transsexuals in China and first to speak openly about her sex change","excerpt":"she has become a celebrity; photo (M) Beijing Journal; As China Changes, a Sex Change Can Bring Fame"},{"year":"1940","title":"LONDON.

Ophelia remains, perhaps to some, as an innocent woman, a dutiful daughter filled with passion and beauty, and is yet stricken with adversity in life. A careful analysis of this seemingly uncomplicated character suggests otherwise, however. Indeed, Ophelia becomes almost characteristically insane-she sings in conversation, weeps and wails, and ultimately ends up drowning herself-but her madness afflicts her so because she has been used by her father, by her brother, and even by Hamlet himself","excerpt":"she has been toyed with emotionally by these men, and the guilt she suffers from Hamlet's artificial insanity and rejected love ultimately becomes too much for her to bear. Thus, in critical review of the play, Ophelia mentally suffers from the scars of unwanted love and exploitation rather than any singular or isolated cause. … Polonius instructs Ophelia to think of herself as a \\"baby\\" (Act I, Scene II), and even though Ophelia protests that his vow of love were done in an honorable fashion, Polonius insists that the \\"blazes\\" of professed love are nothing short of misconceptions that will eventually become extinct (Act I, Scene II). As such, Ophelia is instructed to never see or speak with Hamlet again. The instruction made by Polonius, as is the unfortunate but common case with most girls stricken with youthful love at the time, is the first blow to her sanity. Though Ophelia agrees to obey, it is clear within her initial protests that she believes both of them-her brother and her father-to be wrong about Hamlet. … Hamlet is obviously hurt by Ophelia's lack of affection to his vows of love, but she has done so because she has been instructed to believe his love is irresolute and improper. Had her father and brother been more mindful to her affections, they would not be so blind as to the consequences of their actions. Having now believed to be the immediate cause of Hamlet's perceived insanity, Ophelia hopes to return his affections. Upon seeing Hamlet further on in the play, she claims, \\"I have remembrances of yours, that I have longed long to re-deliver; I pray you, now receive them\\" (Act III, Scene I); naturally here Ophelia is speaking of love, which she wishes now to give to him. However, unfortunately she is denied that which she has come to deliver. Hamlet harshly proclaims that she should not have believed his writings and professions of love…It would be difficult for any person to deal with such a blow. Not only was her love betrayed but she has been mocked as a person and as a female. Furthering her despair, no doubt, is the death of her father, which, according to the prevailing attitudes of the characters, is the sole reason for her break with sanity. … However, to tie Ophelia's despair into a neat package that aligns with the death of her father is to completely disregard the calamities that befell her before Polonius' untimely death. Here was a woman who was greeted by eloquent professions of love only later to be put in doubt by both her father and her brother. Ophelia was then greeted with erratic and aggressive behavior by a man who spoke passionately of her, and later was mocked and ridiculed by him. Ophelia, in short, was a victim to the uncontrollable forces around her, and the rejection that ultimately led to her suicide.

The playwright, Barbara Lebow, has, with tenderness, personalized the tragedy.

In this winner of the 2002 Camera D'Or from the Cannes Film Festival, Ms. Lopes-Curval and her co-writer Francois Favrat are out to depict the cramped, meaningless lives of a place that doesn't really exist after the summer is over; in effect, it's like being backstage at Brigadoon during the period when the magic is over.  Her achievement is so particularly — and peculiarly — realized, evoking the enforced parameters and rhythms of small-town life, that the movie itself begins to feels restrictive. Ms. Lopes-Curval has managed to create a world of trapped people, and after a while we feel stuck in that world of no imagination with them.

Even as she moves into her 70's, the pianist Dorothy Donegan remains one of a kind. As a child, her skills so impressed the great jazz pianist Art Tatum that he gave her lessons, and she can still keep listeners on the edges of their seats with her unpredictable roller-coaster rides, which draw on whatever crosses her mind. Even her longtime New York accompanists -- the bassist Jon Burr and the drummer Ray Mosca -- often seem in danger of falling off the Donegan Express. Although no longer as volcanic as she once was, Miss Donegan still has a strong stomping foot that pounds home the beat to even a casual listener.

The fact that the alto saxophonist Richie Cole has been influenced by both the drummer Buddy Rich and another alto player, Phil Woods, accounts for much of the power of his virtuoso style. From 1969 through 1972, he was in Buddy Rich's Big Band, a group that carried out explosive ideas set off by Mr. Rich's drums. The influence of Phil Woods started in Cole's high school years, providing a basis for the saxophonist's lively, positive attack.

The report also faulted the United States for not paying attention to the issue after World War II.   A1    Old Regime Slips Out of Zaire  President Mobutu Sese Seko left Kinshasa by motorcade and airplane. His trip was described as an official visit to Gabon, but few believed his aides' claims that he would return. Many of his close associates were said to be quietly leaving as well.   A1    Israel Accused Over Torture   A United Nations committee summoned Israel to face charges that it had legalized practices that violate the international convention against torture. Israeli officials argued that ''moderate physical pressure'' was not torture, and said such techniques had helped them foil 90 planned terror attacks.   A1    Bosnian Serb Found Guilty  A United Nations tribunal in The Hague convicted Dusan Tadic, a Bosnian Serb, of killing two policemen and of torturing prisoners in camps near Prijedor in 1992. It was the tribunal's first verdict in a war crimes case from the former Yugoslavia.   A1    Clinton Campaigns in Mexico  President Clinton campaigned through Mexico, seeking Mexicans' trust and approval and emphasizing the importance of ''respect and dignity'' in relations between the two countries. He also defended a new American immigration law that is unpopular in Mexico and Central America, where he will go next.   A6    Discipline and Praise for Labor  Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain admonished the 419 Labor members of the new Parliament to maintain party discipline. Many people, including some former Conservative officials, praised him for turning control of interest rates over to the Bank of England.   A11    F.B.I. Seeking Potential Spy  American officials said the F.B.I. was investigating an intercepted telephone conversation that suggested the Israeli Government had an intelligence source that could obtain sensitive American diplomatic material. Israel denied it had any spies in the United States.   A15    General Tells Apartheid Story  Gen. Magnus Malan, South Africa's Minister of Defense during the apartheid era, told the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission that he had ordered raids into neighboring countries that resulted in civilian deaths, and that he had created a branch of the army that became notorious for its brutal handling of political activists. General Malan said he had no intention of seeking amnesty for any of his acts, all of which he considered within the law.   A16    NATIONAL   A18-26, D24-25    Top Enlisted Soldier Faces Army Sex Charges  The Army charged its highest-ranking enlisted soldier with sexual misconduct and indecent assault involving four servicewomen over nearly three years.

Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno are split over whether a special prosecutor should look into Democratic fund-raising, officials said. They said Mr. Freeh had not formally recommended a special prosecutor but had told Ms. Reno it would be a good idea","excerpt":"she has refused to name one.   D25    Another Snag for Budget Deal  The balanced-budget deal reached by the White House and Congressional Republicans hit another snag, over the terms of tax relief for families with children in college. A White House aide said the Republicans had agreed to $35 billion in education tax cuts; a top House Republican disputed the figure.   D24    Mayors Plead for Flood Relief  Mayor Pat Owens of Grand Forks, N.D., and several North Dakota and Minnesota colleagues visited Washington to plead that flood relief for their towns not be held up by unrelated disputes. Many of those disputes were soon resolved.   D24    Bipartisan Move on Secrecy  Four members of Congress proposed overhauling the system for creating and unsealing official secrets. The four, who span the ideological spectrum from conservative Republican to liberal Democrat, agreed that the Government classifies too much and declassifies it too slowly.   D25    Cockroaches Linked to Asthma  A national study conclusively shows that allergic reaction to cockroaches is a major cause of the high level of asthma in children in inner cities, researchers said.   A18    Laser Dentistry Is Approved  The Government approved the nation's first laser to repair dental cavities. The device replaces drills and, in tests, made local anesthesia unnecessary for most patients.   A18    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-14    Explanations Are Sought In Fire That Killed 6  The grandmother of six children killed by a fire in Passaic, N.J., said it had been preceded by an explosion that sounded like it came from the basement. The authorities said they were still looking for the cause.   B1    61 Charged in Airport Thefts  The authorities arrested 61 people suspected in the theft of air cargo from warehouses around Kennedy International Airport. Most of them had brought stolen goods to undercover agents who posed for three years as middlemen.   B14    Success for Minority Students   New York City school officials said their year-old effort to increase the number of black and Hispanic students at the city's best high schools had been successful so far. A special 18-month coaching program for some of those students allowed half of them to score high enough on the entrance exams to win a spot this fall at one of the schools.   B4    Tax Break to Be Withdrawn  Mayor Giuliani decided to withdraw a generous tax break originally promised to the builder that wins the right to develop the New York Coliseum site. Some among the five teams of developers still vying to buy the site complained angrily that the Mayor was changing the rules in the middle of the competition. Mr. Giuliani's aides said that with the rebounding real estate market, the tax break was no longer needed.   B2    150 Years for City College  City College turned 150 years old, and celebrated its astonishing achievement as the public college that became known as a proletarian Harvard. Its alumni include eight Nobel Prize winners.   B1    HOME   C1-12    Auction Set for Harriman Estate  Sotheby's will auction the possessions of the late Pamela Digby Churchill Heyward Harriman later this month, hoping for a little bit of the same frenzy that accompanied a similar auction of the estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.   C1    SPORTS   B15-21    ARTS   C15-22    BUSINESS DAY   D1-23    Reshuffling Telephone Rates  The Federal Communications Commission took steps to reshuffle billions of dollars of telephone rates, raising prices for some services, generally for businesses, and holding the line on others, including local service for homes. In a separate deal, the F.C.C. agreed with AT&T to lower long-distance rates for all users.   A1    Stocks Fall, and May Fall Again  The Dow Jones industrial average fell 139.67 points, or nearly 2 percent. Other major indexes also tumbled because of interest-rate and inflation fears. Further losses could occur today because of an agreement in Washington that any cut in the capital-gains tax would apply to all sales from yesterday on.

So have scores of other dieters who came to lose weight. Hundreds more return periodically for reinforcement - in both a clinical and social sense; all the dieters interviewed said they have found social acceptance here that they did not enjoy at home. Many say the Durham experience has changed their lives. Miss Mack, for example, not only lost 50 pounds but also switched careers - from architectural designer to buyer and sales clerk in women's clothes - and met the man she will marry. (The meeting was at a softball game that pitted the participants in two diet programs against each other.)   It is no wonder, then, that Durham, a city of about 104,000 long known as a tobacco town, has gained a reputation as ''The Diet Capital of the World.''

But then, the big screen has always been educational, often in ways the film makers never particularly intended. For children willing to sit still at the movies this summer, there have been lessons galore, many of them about human relations, values and the American family. Here are a few of them. The only good mom is a dead mom.   In \\"Corrina, Corrina,\\" a mother has died recently and suddenly (we don't know just how) and the daughter's grief is intense. One of the teen-age boys in \\"Milk Money,\\" which opens on Wednesday, never knew his mother at all (she died at his birth).  Both mothers favored 1950's-style fashions (floral prints and orange polka dot sundresses), which is natural enough for the mother in \\"Corrina, Corrina,\\" since it is the 50's but odd for the mother who died in the 80's (even if she did remind her husband of Grace Kelly). Maybe the subliminal point is that the last time there were really good mothers was 40 years ago. In \\"Lassie\\" and \\"Angels in the Outfield,\\" the mothers are also long departed. Living mothers don't fare quite as well. The mother (and to be fair, the father) in \\"North\\" are bad enough to make their child consider divorce. They manage to squabble with each other throughout one dinner without even acknowledging little North's presence at the table. Nannies are more loving than parents, but they don't really count.   The mother in \\"Baby's Day Out\\" doesn't even know what her infant's favorite picture book is","excerpt":"she has to get that information from the nanny. (Although the baby is preverbal, he indicates his preference with sounds and the nanny, clearly sick of this one selection, says to him, \\"Couldn't we read another book?\\") After the baby escapes from his kidnappers, it's the nanny who knows him well enough to figure out where he has now crawled to. Ditto for Whoopi Goldberg, playing the nanny in \\"Corrina, Corrina,\\" who rescues her young charge from grief-related mutism. But there is an equally relevant message: you can love your nanny just so much and no more. Molly is hooted at by her peers at school. \\"What a dodo!\\" one shrieks when Molly presents the family portrait she has drawn. \\"She drew her maid instead of her mommy.\\" Most dads are psychologically absent -- or worse.   The best father of all is Mufasa in \\"The Lion King,\\" but maybe that's because he is fated to die. Living fathers ignore you, a la \\"North.\\" The biker father in \\"Angels\\" gives his child up for adoption. The businessman dad in \\"Baby's Day Out\\" can't remember to say goodbye to his son without repeated prodding, and he doesn't hold the child once during the entire movie. The wetlands-preservation-advocate widower father in \\"Milk Money\\" -- an otherwise nice guy -- is willing to go to jail for his principles but doesn't seem to have considered who will take care of his son while he's there.   Meanwhile, with the exception of the earnest father, who has remarried and moved to the farm since his first wife's death, in \\"Lassie,\\" not a dad in sight can deal with grief. Could it be that dads are just big children? The father in \\"Andre\\" calls his wife \\"the only real grown-up\\" in the family. With only good dead mothers and flawed fathers in sight, maybe kids are learning that they have to be as independently invincible as Baby Bink and the Little Rascals. Animals are a child's best friend, and not a bad parent substitute.   The best parent in a summer movie may have been Lassie. She helps her boy mourn his dead mother, stop moping around the house and start a sheep business. Eventually she saves his life. A close second is the gorilla in \\"Baby's Day Out,\\" who does more than any other human (even the nanny) to protect the baby from the bad guys. Milo, the dog in \\"The Mask,\\" steals the key that gets Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) out of jail. Petey, the dog in \\"The Little Rascals,\\" is just one of the gang. Andre the seal dances, paints and plays dress-up; he does, however, watch entirely too much television. Rich is bad.   When Fred Flintstone gets a big promotion and a raise in \\"The Flintstones,\\" he treats his best friend, Barney Rubble (who is actually responsible for Fred's new success), badly. At a cookout, when the family's pet dinosaur grabs Barney's steak from the grill, Fred makes no effort to replace or retrieve it. He just says, \\"You'll have to fight Dino for your dinner.\\" Waldo in \\"The Little Rascals\\" is born rich, so he never had any friends in the first place. The rich people in \\"Black Beauty\\" make their horses wear a bearing rein, which forces them to hold their heads unnaturally high. (In the syntax of children's movies, hurting an animal is an extreme sign of depravity. Consider Willy's owners in last year's \\"Free Willy\\"; they wanted to do in the whale to collect his life insurance.) Girls are a mystery to boys.   Girls are so threatening or yucky or divine that boys have to band together in formal alliances like the He-Man Womun Haters Club of \\"The Little Rascals\\" or in informal hordes just to maintain their equilibrium. In \\"Milk Money,\\" three preadolescent boys raise $100 as a group to pay a prostitute to expose her breasts. At a treehouse slumber party, when they all bring objects that mystify them, the collection includes a diaphragm and an eyelash curler. The hippest of the three explains his world view: \\"It's a battle of the sexes and believe me, we are way behind.\\"    Children are likely to note, however, that no matter what happens before, the movies' endings are politically correct, pulled like a rabbit from a hat. Girls get into Spanky and Alfalfa's club because \\"things have to change sometime.\\" The prostitute in \\"Milk Money\\" becomes rich and independent. Fred Flintstone shakes off his contaminated wealth and renews his friendship with Barney. Black Beauty lives into retirement, Lassie gets her sheep farm, and Andre the seal returns to the wilds.    Shortly after Lassie had gone over the falls and the family presumed her dead, I overheard two young companions discussing the turn of events. \\"It's obvious she's not dead,\\" said the 8-year-old. The 11-year-old agreed: \\"Yeah. She's the star, and the stars never die.\\"   That's what they learned at the movies.

By Harry H. Taylor. (Louisiana State University, $16.95.) Harry H. Taylor's first novel, ''The Divorce Sonnets,'' chronicles the ill-fated marriages of Calvin Hart, a highly intelligent, impetuous talk-show host who tries but cannot escape the contradictory values of his puritanical New England upbringing. More than a means of earning a living, talk has always been a significant part of Calvin's life. His stolid mother ''feared language because of its possible releases,'' but his flamboyant father, a comic and a ventriloquist, ''was all talk.'' On and offstage, he assumed different roles and disguises, always cleverly deflecting attention from himself. Calvin, too, immerses himself in a steady stream of chatter, avoiding the women in his life as well as ''that center of mutedness, his being.'' Calvin's four wives reflect different aspects of his essential nature. Kasey, the first, is an aspiring dancer, ethereal, elusive and so self-contained that Calvin does not ''feel married'' to her. Fern is intelligent, austere and possessed of the fatalism and forbearance characteristic of his impassive mother. Sheila is passionate and self-indulgent, an alcoholic with an ego as fragile, narcissistic and insatiable as Calvin's own. Lisa, his last wife, is the youngest and most pragmatic","excerpt":"she implores Calvin to shed the passivity born of pent-up aggression and the destructive myths of his past. Finally, a violent confrontation forces him ''to touch the edges of his unanalyzed life,'' to silence the deafening noise of his existence, allowing the possibility of intimacy and reciprocal love for the first time.

Like the works she creates, Ms. Taymor is not easily classifiable","excerpt":"she is a director, a designer, a mask and puppet maker, a choreographer, film maker and fabulist. She creates worlds of visual splendor and an almost childlike fantasy that, like good fairy tales, reveal grotesquerie and even horror just barely beneath the surface. Her work as a designer and director reflects her literal and artistic journeys through Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Bali, Japan and Paris and her apprenticeships with Joseph Chaikin, Herbert Blau and the Bread and Puppet Theater. This background has resulted in productions of Shakespeare, opera and original works in which the visual, the narrative and the symbolic are inseparable. Ms. Taymor integrates techniques and esthetics from a wide variety of theatrical cultures. But unlike  some contemporary directors who seem to plunder other cultures for inspiration only to come up with mere superficial borrowings, she creates a unique yet somehow familiar vocabulary that, as Eileen Blumenthal, a professor of theater arts at Rutgers University, says in her highly readable JULIE TAYMOR, PLAYING WITH FIRE: Theater, Opera, Film (Abrams, $49.50), is a \\"new theatrical organism.\\" Ms. Taymor, who collaborated on the book with Ms. Blumenthal, describes each of the 15 productions she has designed or directed since her work in Bali in the mid-1970's. This book will be of interest to anyone who wonders where the magic, spirit and theatricality of the theater have gone in recent times, or to anyone who values the visual and creative imagination.

At first the features of Roland Colman are hidden under putty and greasepaint, but this Clown sits at a mirror and gradually wipes off the disguise until the well-known physiognomy of the popular player is revealed.It is, of course, a highly romantic affair, but the scenes in the circus are brilliantly filmed. After an exciting happening, Mr. King turns his camera to the unperturbed countenance of the circus band leader. This director has also accomplished remarkable effects by soft shadows and the close-ups of both Mr. Colman and Miss Banky fit in nicely with the action of the narrative.The comedy in the circus scenes is very well done, for although some of the tricks are ancient they belong to this type of show. There is the strong man who awes the audience with his lifting of prodigious weights and then there is the clown and his absurdities.Tito and the prince resemble each other like the proverbial two peas. The Prince's father dies, and after the heir apparent, like Humpty Dumpty, is beyond picking up by all the king's horses and all the king's men, Tito finds himself bound to accompany Illyria's noblemen to the royal palace or be arrested for the murder of the Prince. The beautiful trapeze artist suspects foul play and as she hears that the Prince is safe she believes that Tito has been slain. Therefore with a pistol concealed in a bouquet of flowers, she goes forth to put a bullet through the new King.Throughout this good-natured and interesting romance there are some joyous situations. At first one is impelled to regret Mr. King's permitting the trapeze artist to leap out of a window, but when she happily saves herself by clinging to a tree one realizes that it is her circus stunts that serve her in good stead.The way in which Tito gets away from the palace is artfully arranged, for the Chancellor, who might have killed Tito (as the King), discovers that it is unnecessary. When the Chancellor informs the clown that he (Tito) must be apprehended for the slaying of the King Tito cooly tells that official that he will have a hard time proving that he (Tito) is not the King.Mr. Colman fills the dual rôle with much artistry. His mustache is longer and neatly curled as the Prince. This Prince also wears a monocle. The clown has put a faint suggestion of a mustache and his face does not appear to be as well nourished as that of the Prince.Miss Banky is attractive enough as the circus performer, but after the Chancellor has bought her one of Illyria's latest creations, she is stunning. Miss Banky also delivers a competent performance. Gustav von Seyffertitz is splendid as the Chancellor.

Her name was Sister Thérèsa of the Child Jesus. The first patroness saint is Joan of Arc.In case this holy sister is unfamiliar to those who are not entirely acquainted with the saints of the Roman Cathlic Church, this singular and definitely parochial French-made picture should make it obvious why. For its action takes place almost entirely in the convent of Lisieux and the events it reports are nothing other than the very intimate spiritual experiences of a young nun.She was born Thérèse Martin and, when she was only 14, she indicated to her father that she would like to follow her two sisters into the order of Carmelites. Her wish is at first forbidden","excerpt":"she is considered too young. But she addresses her petition to Pope Leo XIII at a public audience, against instructions, and is received.The remainder of the film is a solemn showing of the details of her novitiate, of her acceptance of final vows, of her reaction to divine inspiration and of her death from tuberculosis at 24. There is a guarded encounter with a rigid prioress over an act of mortification by one of the later novices, plus a delicate implication of some dissension within the sisterhood. But it is kept on a theological level, and that's all the drama there is.The principal inducements of the picture are long and loving shots of the sweet face of pretty Frances Descaut, who plays the rapt young nun, some interesting scenes of life within the convent and a tender musical score. Other sisters are hard to distinguish, which diminishes what personal conflict there is, and the death scene of Sister Thérèse is inordinately agonized and long. Her canonization, briefly mentioned, is for the subsequent miracles said to have been performed through her.Dubbed English dialogue is spoken in bad synchronization with lips, and an English narrator comes in often to give the effect of a documentary film.Whether this picture will have meaning or interest to others than those who can accept its transcendent intimations is doubted by this reviewer. It suggests but fails to convey a comprehension of the extroardinary exaltation of a nun.

Now Ms. MacLaine, 71, has again become one of Hollywood's busiest actresses. Earlier this year she appeared as Endora in ''Bewitched,'' which will be released on DVD on Oct. 25","excerpt":"she is getting early Oscar buzz for her supporting role as an emotionally sheltered grandmother in the current ''In Her Shoes,'' with Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette; and in the forthcoming comedy ''Rumor Has It'' she plays a woman who allegedly inspired the Mrs. Robinson character in ''The Graduate.'' Craig Modderno spoke with Ms. MacLaine about what she has learned and what she thinks her co-stars can learn from her.    Why are you in such demand now?    I really don't know. I never had more than two films out in one year before. I don't even live in California, so it's definitely not a result of me hustling on the Hollywood social scene. I'm not sure some of the people that I recently worked with really knew what I had done.    Curtis Hanson, the director of ''In Her Shoes,'' told me that he wished there was time each day just to ask you questions about ''The Apartment.'' Were you surprised your two co-stars didn't have the same interest in your career?    Surprised? Somewhat. Hurt? Definitely. If I had worked with Bette Davis, for example, I would have spent every moment between takes asking about her relationship with Jack Warner. Cameron and Toni never asked me anything. Cameron used to spend the first hour of the rehearsal period talking about the problems she had getting out of her house and avoiding the photographers outside. Nicole Kidman, who I adore, asked me questions about longevity when we made ''Bewitched,'' but nothing else about the business. Jennifer Aniston and I on ''Rumor Has It'' talked a lot about human emotion and truth since her problems with her husband were surfacing in the press, but she never asked me about the business either.    Any mistakes in your career that you might have warned them against?    I regret turning down the lead role in ''Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,'' which Ellen Burstyn deservedly won an Oscar for. I said to myself: ''Who is this Martin Scorsese person? Why should I see his little film about 'Mean Streets'?''

This narrative of a poor working girl and her adventures in high gambling society never approaches plausibility, but it emerges as fair entertainment because of the excellent comedy provided by Stuart Erwin and Harry Green. Mr. Erwin contributes another of his clever comic performances in the role of a bashful suitor for Miss Bow's hand, and the only regret is that a full half of the film has to struggle on without him.In the course of her work as an usher Bunny O'Day (Miss Bow) finds a cigarette case and immediately falls in love with its owner, Douglas Thayer, played by Norman Foster. Her befuddled suitor, Ole Oleson (Mr. Erwin), lends her a limousine and a luxurious Park Avenue apartment to which he has fallen heir. Bunny, with her room-mate from Second Avenue, steps into high society and eventually marries Thayer, not knowing him to be a smooth-working thief and her apartment to be the headquarters of a notorious gambling club.Matters grow steadily less credible as the film progresses, but when Mr. Erwin is not on the scene to relieve the situation with his faithful-dog expression, Harry Green takes charge as the suspicious manager of the theatre and confidante of the two naïve girls. Bunny is finally arrested on suspicion of being implicated in a daring jewel robbery at the theatre. She discovers her husband's part in the theft and is prepared to sacrifice her own happiness for his. Thayer, however, gives himself up and goes to prison, while Bunny settles down to await his return.Norman Foster gives a pleasing performance, and the whole production is as good as the story permits.The stage show, \\"Three of a Kind,\\" has some expert entertainers and is well above the average.
