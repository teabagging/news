It is a problem that, for all his verbal cleverness, Liebling never entirely solves.\\" One is tempted to reply that, in fact, A. J. Liebling is the only boxing writer who ever worked his way around this contradiction. The reason -- as readers of \\"A Neutral Corner,\\" a collection of Liebling's previously uncollected boxing essays edited by Fred Warner and James Barbour, who teach English at the University of New Mexico, are quick to discover -- is that he was a great journalist.

Of course Liebling, who died in 1963, was fortunate enough to have lived in the last era when there were enough good fighters around to sustain interest in boxing more than once every two or three years.

As a silent film with musical effects, \\"The Flame of Love\\" might well have been the colorful tragedy that the producers tried to create, but the stilted dialogue of this version makes the entire production seem unreal and obscures the haunting Oriental beauty of the star, Anna May Wong.Miss Wong is one of the few cinema luminaries able to convey poignant emotion with restraint. It is her misfortune here to be forced to mouth pompous utterances which would be more appropriate to one of the unacted and unactable dramas of Bulwer-Lytton. George Schnell, as the Grand Duke whose desire for the lovely actress brings the tragedy to pass, gives the outstanding performance precisely because he suffers least in the lines assigned to him.The principal theme, involving the actress, Hai Tang","excerpt":"Lieutenant Boris and the Grand Duke, is excellent, but requires a more sophisticated treatment than it receives. The Grand Duke orders his adjutant, Boris, to bring Hai Tang before him. After imbibing much wine, he tries to make love to Hai Tang, but is wounded by her brother, who is condemned to die. Hai Tang submits to his attentions in return for her brother's pardon, but the Duke, aware by this time that his young lieutenant loves the girl, releases her from her bargain with the understanding that she leave Russia and see Boris no more.Mr. Schnell gives a splendid characterization as the suave and cultured Grand Duke, and up to the last, carefully avoids displaying the melodramatic villainy to which his part might easily have degenerated. He successfully infers, although the story does not always bear him out, that his stubborn interest in the Chinese girl is nothing more than a whimsical display of power. Mona Goya is excellent as a Russian lady who is interested in hurting Hai Tang, although her part is badly motivated and seldom logical. John Longden makes a passable Boris.Other Photoplays.\\"Zwei Herzen Im ¾ Takt\\" (\\"Two Hearts in Waltz Time\\") is at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse.At the Fifth.

In turn-of-the-century America, men personalized their mugs to reflect their place in the world. When you went in for your twice-weekly shave, your barber plucked your shaving mug off the shelf. You stepped up into the oak and leather barber chair, a throne for the middle class, and were pampered in a manner that would soon be nearly extinct. Today, shaving mugs are collectibles, selling for as much as $3,000 apiece. Barber chairs are cold chrome. The neighborhood barber is unlikely to have worked his way up from apprentice. In THE VANISHING AMERICAN BARBER SHOP: An Illustrated History of Tonsorial Art, 1860-1960 (Windmill Publishing Company, 2147 Windmill View Road, El Cajon, Calif. 92020, paper, $16.95), Ronald S. Barlow bemoans the loss and gives scavengers some hints about how to make money from the remnants. He pays tribute to a gentlemanly era of high-quality tools and pride in a job well done, but the book itself is a slapdash effort, too long in some places, too short in others. Mr. Barlow, the author of \\"The Vanishing American Outhouse,\\" includes a rapid history of the barber's profession, and the book is nicely illustrated, with vintage photographs and excerpts from barber-school manuals and barber-supply catalogues. \\"The Vanishing American Barber Shop\\" makes a persuasive case for barbering as an everyday art in its twilight.

By the time he got to the Powell Valley Middle School to kick off a fund-raising dinner for Oliver North, he had already missed \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" the Pledge of Allegiance and a booming rendition of \\"Proud to Be an American.\\" The 300 people who packed the cafeteria didn't seem to mind his tardiness: As he dashed up to the dais to introduce North, the Republican candidate for Senate in Virginia, the crowd gave Farris a standing ovation. Tan and handsome in his double-breasted gray suit and blue silk tie, he would blend in far better in the prosperous eastern suburbs of Arlington or McLean than in this tiny mining town in the far southwest corner of the state. But he is tremendously popular in Big Stone Gap, where he won a substantial majority in his unsuccessful 1993 race for lieutenant governor.\\n\\nFarris, 43, is a lawyer, an ordained Baptist minister, founder and president of the Home School Legal Defense Association and a likely Republican candidate for senator from Virginia in 1996. He is also the most recent embodiment of what has come to be called the Christian right. After serving as president of the Washington State chapter of Moral Majority, the Jerry Falwell organization, Farris gained national attention during \\"Scopes II,\\" the 1985 trial of a case brought by Christian fundamentalist parents against the Hawkins County, Tenn., public-school system. (Farris, who had moved to Virginia by this time, argued that requiring children to read parts of \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" for instance, represented an unconstitutional infringement on their religious beliefs. He won the case, but the verdict was later overturned.) He has labeled American public schooling \\"a godless monstrosity,\\" and his name appeared as a co-author on a policy paper by a group called Coalition on Revival, which has called for the United States to reclaim itself as a \\"Christian nation.\\" (Farris says that he only worked on an early draft of the document and that the organization included his name without his permission.)

But last week when Mayor Koch, surrounded by his housing and economic development aides, announced the program's second offering, it seemed much ado about relatively little.   After all, only 67 buildings - primarily mixed-use structures, with rental apartments over ground-floor commercial space - were put up for sale at from $12,000 to $40,000.

Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection last week, swamped by lawsuits over breast implants. But the odd thing about this multibillion-dollar mess is that there is considerable doubt about whether the implants are actually harmful. Scientific doubt, that is. The legal system seems convinced that implants cause a variety of maladies, but a number of scientific studies balk at that -- finding that the diseases are real, but the cause not established. The bankruptcy is real, though, halting all new lawsuits and delaying settlement of existing ones -- for at least two years and probably longer. And the company's owners, Dow Chemical and Corning, will no doubt see their investments go to women's claims.  TOBACCO Smoke, but Fire Next Year That huge class-action suit against the tobacco companies will have to wait. A big group of lawyers in New Orleans was going full speed ahead in its attempt to show, among other things, that cigarette makers concealed knowledge that nicotine is addictive. And they had plans to notify -- through nationwide ads -- up to 90 million smokers that they were part of the class. But last week the judge allowed an appeal now -- on whether the class should be certified. The bad news for the lawyers is that this means a delay of six months to a year -- just when they had their engines running. But one lawyer saw a silver lining -- that they could get the certification question cleared up now, before spending vast sums on the case.  PUBLISHING Words, Words, Words for Sale The Encyclopaedia Britannica was first published in 1768, before the existence of the United States -- or, yes, even Microsoft -- and is still going. But not surprisingly -- at a time when many homes have more computers than books -- sales are dropping, from 117,000 sets in 1990 to 51,000 last year. Then again, look at it this way: even in the age of the CD-ROM, fully 51,000 people and libraries shelled out $1,500 for the 32 volumes of this ultimate reference work. But that's not enough, and Britannica is losing money -- and last week its owner, a private trust called the William Benton Foundation, put it up for sale. And as befits the age, the potential buyers included not just publishers like Simon & Schuster but, you guessed it, Microsoft. TRADE WARS Tyrannosaurus Lexus? A world without Lexuses (Lexi?) would be a sorry place indeed. Some people would probably have to settle for lapel buttons saying, \\"I'm so loaded I could spend $50,000 for a mere car.\\" But just such a world loomed as a possibility last week as the Administration, making its move in some convoluted political game, plunked a 100 percent tariff on Japan's luxury cars. It's effective for cars arriving now, but won't be applied till late June -- allowing time for a settlement, or for this saber-rattling to pass. But if it sticks, that'll be it for new Lexuses, Infinitis and the like -- $30,000 to $50,000 is one thing, but $50,000 to $80,000? To the Mercedes dealer, Jeeves. And those of you scooping up \\"bargain\\" Lexuses now may find dealers few and far between.  BANKING Musical Bank Chairs Anyone inclined to brand loyalty must have a hard time when it comes to banks. These days, the \\"venerable\\" banks are the ones that haven't changed their name or ownership in, say, five years. Until 1988, Bowery Savings was a New York fixture, but then it was bought by H.F. Ahmanson, its branches turned into Home Savings offices. But then last week Greenpoint bought 60 Home Savings outlets -- mostly old Bowery branches. It paid dearly -- $660 million -- but Greenpoint used to be a mutual savings bank, and after going public it had a lot of money to spend. Now it has spent it -- and old Bowery customers face a new identity crisis.  AUTOS Chrysler Can Spare a Dime Chrysler tossed Kirk Kerkorian a bone last week, raising its dividend from 40 cents to 50 at its annual meeting -- after saying in December that there would be no increases this year. Not that it was admitting being swayed by Mr. Kerkorian's effort to buy the company, and his push for a far bigger dividend increase. \\"That was not the dominant issue at all,\\" said Robert Eaton, the chairman. Now, Mr. Eaton said, he simply hoped the \\"disruptive force\\" of Mr. Kerkorian's nudging just \\"goes away.\\" And Chrysler's tough stance seems to have worked, for no other big shareholders rallied to Mr. Kerkorian's cause, apparently a vote of confidence in Chrysler's cautious long-term plan. And the stock has settled at around $42, above the $39 before the bid but well below the $55 Mr. Kerkorian offered. STOCK MARKET Dow Drops 82","excerpt":"Life Goes On So why did the Dow industrials plunge 82 points on Thursday, the year's biggest drop? You could trot out the usual suspects -- trade deficits, bond prices, an economy too strong or too weak (pick one). Or you could just look at the numbers: the Dow had risen 750 since November, traders with a fear of heights were glancing warily about to see who'd jump first, and on Thursday some jumped. And remember: 82 points ain't what it used to be. In the days of an 800 Dow, that would have been a scary 10 percent. At today's lofty levels, this drop doesn't even weigh in at 2 percent. So there's a good chance the world is not coming to an end.  CONGRESS Tame the Deficit or Bust Balancing the budget has become almost a religious crusade for Republicans, with the House last week charging ahead and voting a specific plan to break even by 2002. Specific, that is, except for things like how they'll save $280 billion on Medicare. If the Senate passes its own cuts this week, they'll have to work out the differences -- mainly that $350 billion House tax cut. But then comes a likely veto -- the House vote, 238 to 193, is not veto-proof. . . . Senate budget-cutters, meanwhile, want to do away with taxpayer-financed elections, which were created as a post-Watergate reform, saying Government should stay out of politics. What did the Democrats think? It would create an \\"obscene race for dollars,\\" said Senator Christopher Dodd. FUGITIVES How to Steal a Billion It's hard to steal billions of dollars -- because, well, most people don't leave billions of dollars lying around waiting to be stolen. But a German developer named Jurgen Schneider is accused of doing just that -- a year ago, his vast real estate empire collapsed and he disappeared, leaving $5 billion in debts. And last week -- after continuing reports that put him in places like Switzerland and Iran -- he was arrested in Hollywood, Fla., trying hard to look like your basic retiree. Does he have something stashed away? Who knows. But the real question is, How could German banks have let this happen? They may be asked that more often now that Mr. Schneider's dream vacation is over. HOLLYWOOD All Eyes on Mr. Ovitz One thing is certain: Michael Ovitz will continue to call a lot of shots in Hollywood. The only question: where he'll be sitting. There was talk last week that he might leave the Creative Artists Agency, which practically owns Hollywood, to head MCA, which Seagram just bought. But the math gets tricky: Creative Artists could be worth $400 million now, and Mr. Ovitz probably owns half of it, but if he leaves and takes some top agents with him, it'll look a lot less valuable. In short, he's an awfully valuable man, so one wonders whether Seagram -- and its shareholders -- are ready to pay what it will take to get him.

''When Women Kill'' argues that most of the 3,500 women now serving sentences in American prisons for murder or manslaughter do not belong there because they are not responsible for what they did.

Alicia recounts a childhood spent living in the mountains with her grandparents, a childhood full of curses and magic, especially the power of the evil eye. As a young child she helped to harvest coffee. But the \\"worn-out valley . . . coughs up its young people -- the ones who make the progress -- to the city,\\" and so Maria took Alicia to the slums of Bogota, a 26-hour bus ride away. The two women's lives are filled with violent, unreliable men, women who keep their families together with little or no education or resources, and children who learn early \\"a lot about justice and injustice.\\" Deep-toned, almost sepia, the photographs -- such as views of the barrio, a dresser piled high with possessions, hands clasping a rosary -- combine Ms. Ewald's vision with those of her fifth-grade students, who took two-thirds of the shots, and convey a richness and dignity to the simplest objects.

Doctors wandered around lighted corridors with their medical kits, operating every now and then, and talking copiously about ethics. Nurses played about in all directions, fighting with young internes, and finally catching doctors with the defense of ethics broken down.\\"Night Nurse,\\" which is the name of it, is a potpourri of various things connected with a learned profession. There are scenes of kindly doctors, of operations, of ambulances, of an interne's practical jokes and of milk baths. As a sop to the tastes of an age which might not accept nurses without more familiar cinematic surroundings, there is a sentimental gangster and a party with a jazz band and a bar. There are fights and a rescue reminiscent of the old Marines.The story is of a girl who becomes a nurse in a hospital. While there she bandages a wounded bootlegger, and agrees to say nothing to the police about it. After her graduation she gets a case in a private house, where two children are allegedly starving. This is in the same place with the parties and jazz. She suspects something is wrong, and tries to get a doctor friend to tell the police. He lectures her about ethics.Things go from bad to worse, and while the family physician—who, of course, is starving the children in order that the inevitable trust fund may be shared—is away, she tries a milk bath as a means of salvation. The villain pours out the milk. But about then the kindly physician appears and prescribes a blood transfusion, and the bootlegger appears to dispose of the villain.Barbara Stanwyck has the part of the night nurse and Ben Lyon is the bootlegger. Joan Blondell is another nurse, and Clark Gable is the villain. The last-named seems to undertake his rôle with considerable enthusiasm. Charles Winninger, who is generally a comedian, is the amiable doctor in the case, and Rolfe Harolde is the one trying the starvation scheme of gaining trust funds.And, finally, last night's audience seemed to like parts of \\"Night Nurse.\\" At times it is exciting.Tucker Faithfull Seeks Role.Tucker Faithfull, younger sister of Starr Faithfull, has applied for a rôle in the cast of \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" at the Plymouth Theatre, it was said yesterday.

This incentive for nonborrowers, which has lured millions of dollars back into company coffers, is typically in the form of a higher dividend at the end of each year than the holder would otherwise obtain.

Angela Davis-Gardner has set her fine first novel, ''Felice,'' in this world. The action of the book takes place in the convent school of Sacre Sang in the Acadian province of Longfellow's ''Evangeline.'' Thus, Mrs. Davis-Gardner writes about one isolated world within another: the convent school set in the rocky landscape of Frenchspeaking North America, a land of fishermen and sailors, and the Indians they fear, contemn and surround with myth.

And while (as implied by her title) Miss Hill has this time left the Southern milieu behind, she has once more taken as her subject that nebulous, filamented and fragile relationship called marriage, that pairing in which man and woman become for each other lover, brother, sister, mother, father and friend. And she sets this alliance squarely where it belongs -within a context larger than the family of origin, the family of friends.

Friday's announcement that boat people will be interned at the Guantanamo naval base instead of getting automatic refugee status, as they have for 28 years, is intended to discourage Cubans from fleeing. But the measures made public over the weekend -- tightening the trade embargo, increasing anti-Castro radio propaganda and putting pressure on the United Nations to condemn the Castro regime -- send only one message: \\"Cuba is hell","excerpt":"life is unbearable. Get out of there.\\" \\n\\nThus, the harsh new policy toward Cuban refugees did not stem the flow of boat people heading for Florida. On the contrary, since Friday, the Coast Guard has picked up thousands more refugees. For desperate Cubans, the prospect of a bed and a meal at Guantanamo with some hope of making it to the U.S. as a political refugee is more attractive than the prospect of staying on the island with nothing to eat and no hope for change.

Today was a disaster,  I tell myself at least twice a week, stopping on my way home from work at a cafe that makes the most perfect Rice Krispies Treats, but this tastes delicious. Quentin Tarantino, asked why he eats Cap'n Crunch, replied, \\"Because it tastes good and is easy to fix.\\" Cap'n Crunch, Rice Krispies Treats: I'm addicted to refined sugar in its less refined forms -- breakfast cereal, cookies, ice cream, root beer, licorice, peanut brittle, et al., ad nauseam. Kid's stuff. When I'm happy, I consume sweets to celebrate. When I'm upset, I eat treats as consolation. Since I'm fairly manic-depressive, I never don't have a reason to be in the throes of sugar shock. I don't smoke. I don't do drugs. I do sugar --  in massive doses. So what? Who doesn't? What's the harm? Where's the interest? It's imperative that I be reading nonfiction prose when mainlining glucose. I stutter, and much of the glory of sugar is the way it seems like succor to my tired mouth muscles.

Told as a story narrated to a group of Italian refugees, who are fleeing from Monte Cassino as that famous Benedictine abbey is being shelled, it recounts how Benedict da Norca, a Roman nobleman, turned to a life of religious devotion and became a leader of the people in the fifth century. And it cites a miraculous episode, whereby St. Benedict put to shame a barbarian invader at Monte Cassino, as a symbol of hope in a ravished land.Though earnest and reverent in treatment and rather impressively played by tall, stern-faced Fosco Giachetti in the principal role, this film is theatrically ingenuous, in the manner of an amateur passion play, and it lacks dramatic continuity either of theme or incidents.

True, \\"Cossacks of the Kuban\\" has its occasional moments of genuinely native charm, but for the most part it is closer in spirit to Hollywood than to the steppe country.\\"Cossacks of the Kuban\\" does sing literally and figuratively when cameras catch the sweeping panoramas of rippling wheat fields harvested by pretty, sturdy lasses and even sturdier lads. It is an eye-catching kaleidoscope when bumper crops and consumer goods are displayed at the annual county fair. And, it is truly professional when the assembled farm teams display their varied talents in Cossack dances, folk songs and a climactic series of horse races.It is downright banal, however, when its plot calls for romantic misunderstandings between the managers of rival farms. And, it is less than inspired, too, when the bickering between these leaders prevents, for an intolerably long time, the marriage of their wards.However, the principals are superior to the plot. Katya Luchko is a strikingly photogenic heroine who makes the most of her songs and ordinary lines. She is a captivating heroine who snags the man of her choice despite the machinations of her love-sick uncle.Vassili Davidov makes a handsome suitor. And, Sergei Lukianov, as her strapping, mustachioed guardian, and Marina Ladynina, as the blonde, buxom opposite number with whom he spars romantically, turn in equally fine performances.Despite the many English subtitles, however, it might have been a good deal more entertaining if they all had something more substantial to scrap and sing about.

For some, life is meaningful only when one is flirting with death. This is, Mr. Fraser suggests, an ideal breeding ground for a serial killer.   The view in his play, \\"Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love\\" (at the Orpheum Theater), is cynical in the extreme -- a pitch black vision of people falling off the edge. With its pungent dialogue and highly graphic sexuality, the play repeatedly arrests the audience's attention, but the cynicism wears thin and the plot is porous. This study of sex and violence is not, as intended, a thriller. Instead of being mysterious, it telegraphs its twists, and at moments it approaches sentimentality.

In its decorated cabins hopeful blondes tried to entice bankers from their mutely suffering wives. On its sunny decks gamblers strolled with the daughters of elderly lens grinders. In its engine room, accompanied by the throbbing of those mighty pulses, desperadoes fought pistol duels with gamblers gone Robin Hood. The S. S. Transatlantic plowed on.But there is perhaps more to the Roxy's current guest than the categorical list of crimes that may be committed on the high seas. There is, for example, a good deal of excellent photography—occasionally put to unnecessary uses, but still present: There is also a bit of very fine acting by Jean Hersholt and other members of the first-class cabins. Finally, the trip from New York to the other side carries with it considerably more entertainment than is usual.As a story, Transatlantic has almost as many plots as it has officers. There is first that one which glides gently around the subject of love, then bows to it and moves away. After that, in the order of importance, is the gambler's warfare with four thieves who, uninspired by Plot 1, relieve the banker of the negotiable securities he is saving from the crash. And last of all comes the question of who shot the banker. Every one is suspected, most of them more thoroughly than the man who really did it.Edmund Lowe has the part of the gambler, and so heads the cast. It is he who tries to save the elderly lens grinder because of his daughter, and who fights a duel in the engine room in order to capture Transatlantic's main villain. Lois Moran is the daughter, and Jean Hersholt the father. The latter's portrait of a man who has worked hard all his life in order to take one good trip is excellent. John Halliday is the banker, Myrna Loy his wife, and Greta Nissen the dancer, who forms the other side of that triangle.The Roxy has taken the audience behind the scenes for the stage show, and lets it see what are fondly labeled \\"The Rehearsal Hall,\\" \\"The Stage,\\" \\"The Dress Rehearsal\\" and \\"The Theatre.\\" The main contributor is Herb Willaims, who calls, as usual, for his spotlight, and deals out havoc by way of two pianos. The usual ballet, dancers, acrobats and orchestra are also present.

And yet they do, up to a point, fit into accepted categories. In recent years Witkin has been shown in the company of photographers who paint or draw on their photographs in an attempt to go beyond or get around the naturalism of the unmanipulated photographic image - for instance, in ''Six Markers'' at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1981. He has also exhibited with photographers in whose work special photographic printing processes play a conspicuous part - for instance, in ''The Photographer as Printmaker,'' sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1982. \\n\\nSince 1980 an instructor of photography at the University of New Mexico, Witkin has won many awards and grants from the most respectable of our award and grant-giving organizations, including, in 1980 and 1981, the National Endowment for the Arts. Over the past 20 years he has exhibited and published widely both in this country and in Europe, including a one-man show this year at the Kansas City Art Institute and a retrospective opening in May at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.

Fortunately, there is no need for an edgewise word. The old man is telling the tale of his life, and it is a life well lived and well told -- in a single rambling sentence that runs the length of this slim volume. To an audience of young lovelies, the narrator recalls his bawdy adventures as a soldier, brewery worker and cobbler (or, as he euphemistically puts it, an \\"engineer of human feet\\"), but mostly talks of his undying devotion to appreciating the \\"European Renaissance,\\" which means, for the most part, chasing skirts. \\"A real man trembles like a frog about to leap whenever he sees a beautiful woman,\\" he says, \\"which is why art drives so many writers mad.\\" As translated from the Czech by Michael Henry Heim, the anecdotes fall out like cards from a well-shuffled deck: a story about a dead Austrian officer leads to a recollection of a dream about a monkey, which leads to a remembrance of a fight between a clergyman and a drunken sexton, which leads to rumors of a Prince of Lichtenstein's sexual dysfunction. Is there a point to the old man's tale? Perhaps not, but then it is enough to be charmed  by the thread of his verbosity.

The trial peeled back the skin of a small town and the life of a woman betrayed by the men she loved -- from a father who committed suicide, to a stepfather who sexually abused her, to a husband who left her, to a boyfriend who did not want her or her children in his life. Like a small-town Medea, Mrs. Smith acted out inexplicably, killing her sons, Michael, 3, and Alex, 14 months. Her lawyer, David Bruck, argued that she meant to take her own life instead..

Recalling her then, the sense I always get is of someone who had to rebuild the universe but had only five days instead of the six God took for himself. She worked five days a week hunched over a machine that stitched fine straw hats, her right foot welded to the power pedal, her fingers deftly gliding around the treacherous, pummeling needle. On many nights, after she had spent the evening hours cooking and washing up, I glimpsed her sitting stoop-necked on the edge of the sofa, moistening a tip of thread with her lips and straining with her tired, myopic eyes to slip the thread through the eye of the needle so she could restore a button on my or my brother Josh's shirt.    She was always sprinting, like a long-distance runner who had stumbled and had to make up a hundred yards. All the Holocaust survivors, most of them arriving in this country in their late 20's or early 30's, had to make up for lost time. The years that most people use to launch a career had been squandered in war and the limbo of refugee camps. With no time for schooling or training, they had to take the low-skill, low-wage careers in dressmaking, upholstery and shoe manufacturing, trails that American Jews had blazed a generation or two earlier. If they accumulated a small nest egg, they sometimes bought dusty candy stores and laundries, shabby tenements and dingy S.R.O. hotels -- damaged goods at fire-sale prices that Americans had too much dignity to touch.

The path twists through clutches of wait-a-bit thornbushes, past a snake hole in a baobab tree with a cobra skin decorating the entrance, and down a slope of fine powdery dust into the bed of the former Musengezi River, now no more than a series of pools separated by mud.   Without breaking stride, he passes some elephant footprints, shucks his frayed brown trousers and enters the green water. When he is up to his waist, about 30 feet from shore, he has reached the dead body. The goat was taken in the middle of her last drink by one of 100 crocodiles he says are in the pool.

Lesson One: There is no such thing as a peacekeeper or neutral force in an ethnic conflict. The very meaning of an ethnic conflict is that a society has been torn asunder, every community has grabbed a slice and there is no neutral ground left. That is why shortly after the Marines went to Beirut as part of a peacekeeping force to support the central Government, they discovered that there was no center to support. Even the Government was on one of the sides, and by supporting it the Marines were drawn into the battle. That is why the Marines were re-named by the locals \\"the International Militia.\\" That is why the Marines in Beirut quickly went from trying to protect others to defending themselves.

An odd revelation, you say? Well, it's only a small leap to Liggett's admission that smoking is addictive and causes cancer -- long accepted by most people as scientific fact. In the Great Tobacco Wars, though, a lot comes down to what you admit, and this is the first such concession by a tobacco company. Why did Liggett break ranks? Basically, it's a company in trouble -- its sales are infinitesimal compared with Philip Morris's -- and those state lawsuits could have been fatal. And by promising to pay 25 percent of its profits to 22 states, it could be promising 25 percent of nothing","excerpt":"Liggett is in the red already, and when it adds warning labels about addictiveness and cancer -- that's part of the deal -- it could sell even fewer cigarettes. Some tobacco foes had high hopes that documents promised by Liggett would help in the larger battle. ''We will break the back of this conspiracy of lies and deceit,'' one said. But the next battle will be over whether those documents really emerge.     UTILITY RATES  A Gift for Long Island  There's a certain odd pleasure in being at the bottom of any particular barrel, a strange pride in getting the shortest of all sticks. But Long Islanders, alas, will soon lose one complaining right: that they have the nation's highest power bills. They will, that is, if Gov. George E. Pataki's deal for a partial state takeover of Lilco becomes reality. The problem, of course, has been the billions spent on the disastrous Shoreham plant, but Mr. Pataki's solution, as Lilco heads toward a merger with Brooklyn Union Gas, is to have the state issue bonds and take over the Shoreham debt. Skeptics derided it as a political gift to consumers, but it's such a resoundingly popular idea that most politicians fell all over one another to get on board.     ANNUAL REPORTS  Puzzled? Just Click  Face it. Few people consider annual reports bedtime reading. What you get, basically, is a bunch of feel-good pictures telling you how warm and wonderful the company is (even if it has just been caught poisoning people or is on the verge of bankruptcy), followed by page upon page of numbers indecipherable to anyone lacking an advanced accounting degree. I.B.M. is out to change that, and it just posted its snazzy new on-line annual report (www.ibm.com/AnnualReport/1996). For the financially savvy, it offers all sorts of goodies you can't get in the paper copy: you can, say, click on two or more categories together, like hardware and software sales, and combine them in a single chart. But I.B.M. also says it has made the report accessible to all. You don't know what ''revenues'' means? Keep clicking, and you'll wend your way to a fourth-grader's definition. Here's another I.B.M. number out last week: Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman and chief executive, made $20.2 million last year, up 30 percent from 1995. Strangely, though, all the clicking in the world won't turn that up on the Web site.    AUTO SAFETY  Car Meets Truck; Car Loses  They're everywhere. Explorers, Grand Cherokees, monster Suburbans -- all engaged in the death-defying task of moving kids and groceries. Some drivers, of course, watch all this with mounting amusement -- they'd never be caught dead in these hulking gas-guzzlers. They'd better stop laughing; when it comes to safety, no car is remotely an island. Look at it this way: your sedan weighs a ton and a half; that leather-lined, CD-equipped tank coming at you weighs two tons. Your bumper is 16 inches off the ground; the other one is 21. Who gets hurt? You do. Only a third of vehicles on the road are light trucks, but more Americans die when car meets light truck than when car meets car. In crashes involving cars and light trucks, 80 percent of those killed are in cars. What to do? Make cars heavier? Make light trucks lighter? Ban cars? Ban light trucks? No, far simpler: just create extra lanes. One for cars, one for car pools, one for light trucks -- littered, of course, with boulders and tree stumps to climb over, to make the drivers feel powerful.    AIR BAGS  One Size Saves Some  On another auto safety issue, an odd debate is raging. In hearings in Washington last week, one safety official said air bags kill children because ''the dose is too big.'' If you make them less potent and save some children, though, you lose some adults -- a grisly calculus. An added twist: the less-potent air bags might save people who are wearing seat belts but not those who aren't. So assuming that all these tradeoffs have been calculated correctly -- and assuming that another solution is not at hand -- it comes down to a choice between saving children or saving adults without the sense to buckle up. That one's easy.    CELL PHONES  Digital Privacy? Not Quite  If only Newt Gingrich had had one of those new digital cellular phones, everyone said, he'd never have gotten into trouble talking ethics in a technological fishbowl. That was one of digital's big selling points -- safety from eavesdroppers. Last week, though, some security pros said it was pretty simple to crack into digital calls after all. Never mind.    PLASTIC UNLIMITED  Have Credit, Will Spend  Did credit-card companies think Americans wouldn't use all that plastic? Fat chance. They bombarded people with card offers -- a staggering eight billion or so in three years -- and now, naturally enough, Americans are charging things like crazy. And, increasingly, not paying their bills. A recent report showed that 3.72 percent of card holders were behind on their payments late last year, up from 3.34 percent a year earlier. Last week, in fact, one fast-growing card issuer, Advanta, said it would lose money this quarter because 7.5 percent of its loans had gone bad. The solution, as many card companies see it, is to tighten lending standards, but if that crimps spending, it could hurt the economy, making credit delinquencies even more likely. The good news, though: you might not get so many credit-card solicitations in the mail.    AN ENERGY ANSWER  It's Blowing in the Wind  Are solar and wind power the stuff of fuzzy-headed visionaries? That's been the conventional wisdom. They'll always be fanciful drops in the bucket, critics say; they can never compete. Last week, though, the idea looked downright mainstream. Enron, the Houston energy giant, said it's building the world's largest wind-power project -- a huge endeavor involving 150 turbines in Iowa, each 15 stories high, with 25-ton rotors. Competitive? Absolutely. They'll provide power for 50,000 homes at an efficient 4 to 4.5 cents a kilowatt-hour. And when the multiple-choice new utility world arrives, allowing people to pick their power, some environmentally conscious types might just go for renewable sources even if does cost a bit more.
