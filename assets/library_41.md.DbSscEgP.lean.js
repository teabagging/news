One is that of Sir John Lasher, a spineless young member of the London banking fraternity, and the other as that of Dakin Barrolles, a bank robber, who at least possesses courage and a sense of humor. The highly fictional aspect of this narrative, one angle of which is concerned with an unbelievable case of plastic surgery, does not vitiate the interest in the proceedings.The dialogue in this offering may be a trifle choppy, but this shortcoming is partly atoned for by William K. Howard's skilled direction, the fine photography and the good work of the players. It begins with Scotland Yard's minions' pursuit of Barrolles at night on the upper reaches of the Thames. The bank robber succeeds in eluding the police by swimming in and out of the river weeds. After a while he boards Sir John's houseboat, on which are the banker and his pretty wife. Sir John has imbibed freely of his favorite wine, much to Lady Lasher's annoyance. Barrolles demands a drink, pretending that he has a pistol in his pocket, and then he insists on Lady Lasher's bandaging his injured ankle. When he leaves he takes with him a locket containing the photographs of Sir John and Lady Lasher.In course of time Barrolles feels that he must choose between being taken into custody by the police or joining the army. It is in the early days of the war, so Barrolles goes forth to fight. Sir John is killed at the front and Barrolles is fright-fully disfigured by a bursting shell.The bank robber is perceived in Dr. Deon's headquarters, his face covered with bandages. The surgeon appears to have taken the locket photograph of Sir John to perform his plastic surgical operation on Barrolles's face. Soon the burglar's countenance is uncovered and he is, of course, Sir John's double, the surgeon having even eradicated an old scar on the patient's forehead. So Barrolles leaves the hospital as Sir John and one is called upon to believe that Lady Lasher not only takes it for granted that the bank robber is her husband, but she also welcomes the change in her husband's disposition.To add to the general excitement, there is a train wreck sequence in which Lady Lasher is rescued by the bank robber. There are also scenes in which Barrolles, while masquerading as Sir John, looks as though he is going to rob the bank of which he is presumed to be the presiding officer.There are a number of surprises in this film, and while it is hardly ever convincing, it at least possesses the spice of originality. Barrolles on encountering Charles Fox, his colleague in crime, is not recognized by the latter. Barrolles, however, rather delights in admitting his identity to his pal, who then thinks that they have the chance of a life-time to steal valuable securities from Lasher's bank.Scotland Yard figures throughout most of the scenes, Sir Clive Heathcote, the head of the British police, being always on Barrolles's heels.Joan Bennett is charming and efficient as Lady Lasher, Barbara Leonard lends distinction to a minor rôle. Donald Crisp is excellent as Charles Fox. Lumsden Hare's interpretation of the knowledgeful Scotland Yard commissioner is intelligent and well-spoken. Georges Renevant adds to the worth of this film by his careful impersonation of Dr. Deon. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"McLAGLEN IN LIGHT COMEDY \\"A Devil With Women\\" at Hippodrome Is Mirth-Provoking.

The growing popularity of these cruises, plus temperate weather, means that high season is practically year-round. Cost-conscious travelers may want to take advantage of the two brief low seasons, May 1 to mid-June, or mid-September through October. Prices are per person. Air fare to Quito, the starting point for most packages, is not included","excerpt":"meals are.    FOR -- Budget Travelers    COMPANY -- Adventure Life Journeys, 800-344-6118, www.adventure-life.com.    WHY -- The Sulidae, a sailboat built in 1901, accommodates up to 12 passengers in six cabins with private bathrooms. For those who want the thrill of sailing and the comfort of a hot shower, there is the Angelique. Nonsailing budget yachts include the Darwin, the Seaman and the Fragata. All boats have bunk beds and air-conditioning; some cabins on the Fragata have twin beds, a rarity among tourist-class boats. The Seaman will make kayaks available on request. Islands visited by all the boats include Española, Floreana and Santa Cruz. Snorkeling is available; equipment rental may cost extra. Packages include two nights in Quito, meals while in the Galápagos, a guide and hotel breakfasts.    HOW MUCH -- Sulidae, $1,550; Angelique, $1,660 in low season and $1,820 high season; Darwin, $1,430 low season and $1,525 high season; Seaman, $1,600 low season and $1,725 high season; Fragata, $1,865.    FOR -- Off-the-Beaten-Trackers    COMPANY -- International Expeditions, 800-633-4734, www.ietravel.com.    WHY -- The remote Isabela is the largest island yet one of the least visited. One vessel that makes the pilgrimage is the Evolution, a 1920's vessel that takes 28 guests. Two-person kayaks are available on board. Isabela is home to penguins, flightless cormorants, pelicans and iguanas, as well as Darwin Volcano and Darwin Lake. Other less-visited islands on the itinerary include Genovesa Island, which has one of the most diverse bird populations in the islands, and Fernandina, which has an active volcano. For those on a budget who would like to reach Isabela and Fernandina, Adventure Life Journeys offers the Samba, a tourist-class boat with bunk beds.    HOW MUCH -- From $4,198 for the Evolution and $2,130 for the Samba.    FOR -- The Pampered Set    COMPANIES -- Celebrity Cruises, 800-647-2251, www.celebrity.com; Lindblad Expeditions, 800-397-3348, www.expeditions.com.    WHY -- Mimosas, daily massages and evening cocktails al fresco are special touches offered on the Celebrity Xpedition. The ''sunrise deck'' has a hot tub and sauna. The Polaris (Lindblad Expeditions) offers massages atop a glass-bottomed pontoon boat in a secluded cove. The Xpedition visits Seymour and Bartolomé Islands and Las Bachas beach. The Polaris visits Santa Cruz, Española, Floreana, Isabela, Fernandina, Genovesa and Santiago Islands, and is the only large ship permitted to carry sea kayaks.    HOW MUCH -- Celebrity prices start at $4,400; Polaris starts at $3,650.

WHY -- If your idea of heaven does not include sleeping on a rocking boat, then a hotel-based day-tour package might be a better option. The Finch Bay Eco-Hotel on Santa Cruz Island serves as home base for an eight-day itinerary that visits Bartolomé, Seymour and Santa Fe Islands. The package includes seven nights at the hotel and five full-day excursions. The hotel is on the beach, and has an outdoor pool and a hot tub. Optional activities include scuba diving, sea kayaking, hiking and mountain biking.      Hidden away in the Santa Cruz highlands is the Royal Palm Hotel, a luxury resort spread out over 500 acres. It has a spa with exercise equipment and treatments, a sauna, a pool and tennis courts. Guests may choose between villas built into the hillside or studios and suites; each room has a whirlpool tub.     True landlubbers may keep to Santa Cruz, which has its share of attractions, including Los Gemelos (twin pit craters, formed by lava), Tortuga Bay and Garrapatero Beach, where there are blue-footed boobies aplenty. Day boat tours booked through the Royal Palm for an extra cost are available to the islands of Santa Fe, Bartolomé, Seymour and South Plaza.    HOW MUCH -- Eight-day packages at Finch Bay start at $1,787; there is a 25 percent discount for children under 12 sharing a room with parents (one child limit).

FOR -- Kidcentric Seafarers    COMPANY -- Ecoventura, 800-633-7972, www.ecoventura.com.    WHY -- Most Galápagos cruises are friendly-family, but Ecoventura markets some directly to families with children 7 and older who want to tour with other families. Activities include snorkeling, kayaking and water games. Food like hot dogs, spaghetti, macaroni and cheese and chicken fingers is served. There are also special parties, like a King Neptune costume event. Kids are encouraged to visit the bridge to learn about astronomy and navigation. Islands include Seymour, Isabela and Fernandina.    HOW MUCH Rates for a seven-night cruise start at $2,295. No charge for ages 6 and younger. Age 7 to 30 percent off cruise rate; ages 12 to 14 receive 20 percent off.

It's an album full of mourning, obstinacy and longing for redemption. When Irma Thomas sings ''Back Water Blues,'' or Dr. John sings ''World I Never Made'' or Buckwheat Zydeco sings ''Cryin' in the Streets,'' the old songs become haunted and prophetic. And when the Dirty Dozen Brass Band charges into ''My Feet Can't Fail Me Now'' or the Wild Magnolias update a belligerent Mardi Gras Indians chant with Big Chief Bo Dollis insisting, ''I'm not gonna let Katrina turn us 'round,'' the city's old party spirit reveals itself as defiance.    R. Kelly       R. Kelly keeps on extending ''Trapped in the Closet'' (Jive/Zomba), his R & B oratorio/serial/song cycle/soap opera/video narrative of infidelity and other secrets. Its latest form is a DVD with Chapters 1 through 12. While the seven new chapters aren't as tightly plotted as the first five, there are enough twists to keep catching viewers off guard -- no one expects the midget -- and enough loose ends for the 20 more chapters Mr. Kelly has vowed to make. And don't forget the music: he sings all the characters himself over the same basic track again and again, and after 12 iterations it hasn't even begun to pall.    Gal Costa       Gal Costa's melting, sensual voice has been a Brazilian pop archetype since she was the muse and advocate of the Tropicália movement in the 1960's. Through the decades she has tried material from the most refined bossa novas to pushy rock. Understatement suits her best, and on certain albums she finds a luminous equipoise. Her latest, ''Hoje'' (Trama, www.trama.com.br), is one of them. She chose most of the songs from a younger generation of Brazilian songwriters, to sing about love and culture and Carnival. Backed largely by acoustic guitars, piano and almost subliminal percussion, she sings with an unpredictable and intimate grace that's entirely her own.    Korn       In the 1980's Herbie Hancock used robots for his video clip of ''Rockit'' because MTV wasn't showing many African-American musicians. Things have changed. Korn's video for ''Twisted Transistor'' substitutes rappers (Snoop Dogg, Lil Jon, David Banner and Xzibit) for the members of Korn and places them in a mini-mockumentary of rock-star indulgence. The song barely makes an impression -- it's about ''a lonely life where no one understands you'' -- but the clip is funny, and having stand-ins certainly reduces wear and tear on indulged rock stars.    Fort Minor       Who needs guitars? Not Mike Shinoda, the rapper in Linkin Park's rap-rock who sounds better on his own. Recording as Fort Minor on the album ''The Rising Tied'' (Machine Shop Recordings/Warner Brothers), Mr. Shinoda collaborates with the hip-hop duo Styles of Beyond, while Jay-Z, hip-hop's canniest beat selector, is the executive producer. The sturdy, sinewy tracks are almost all in minor keys, while Mr. Shinoda stays as sulky as he is in Linkin Park. He's feeling sorry for himself (his label doesn't understand him, his career broke up his romance), for ghetto kids, for his Japanese-American relatives who were in World War II internment camps. And in ''Cigarettes,'' he sneers at his and others' addiction to gangsta rap: ''They're acting like we're idiots, they're lying to our face/ Maybe we are idiots, we buy it anyway.''    Secret Mommy       Found sounds are digitally sliced, spliced, modulated, turned into beats and bounced all over the place on Secret Mommy's album ''Very Rec'' (Ache). The results are snappy and cartoonish, full of stereo ricochets and staccato syncopation, with a woozy melody emerging now and then. Titles like ''Soccer Field'' and ''Dojo'' identify origins, but Secret Mommy's idea of recreational exercise must be loading a sound-editing program and moving around a mouse. Download ''Dance Studio'' at www.secretmommy.com.    Joggers       Two-guitar interlock defines the songs on the Joggers' album ''With a Cape and a Cane'' (StarTime International). The guitars move in tandem like mirror images, volley staggered funk chords or pick out odd-meter math-rock patterns","excerpt":"meanwhile the drums add even more counterpoint. ''We'll wind up the clockwork tonight,'' one song rightly promises. The vocals, carrying cryptic lyrics, are slouchy and unpolished -- one thing the Joggers have in common with their fellow indie-rock bands from Portland, Ore. -- but those guitars never miss.    Blackalicious       The hip-hop duo Blackalicious considers the smart, serious lyrics on ''The Craft'' (Anti) important enough to print, and they run to 12 pages of small type. The album title is right, with earnest, unimpeachable craftsmanship throughout, from the rapid syllable-slinging to the brawny, neatly gauged riffs and hooks. But the song that leaves duty behind is the one in which the words become pure percussion: ''Ego Sonic War Drums.'' It has an unremitting beat, a few notes banged on a piano and overlays of electronics and echoes that create ominous, relentlessly building pressure.    Lindsay Lohan       Suppose you're a star, your family's not entirely functional and the tabloids can't get enough, but at least you're not Michael Jackson. Then capitalize on it. Lindsay Lohan's new album is called ''A Little More Personal (Raw)'' (Casablanca), and the video clip for ''Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)'' begins with a radio reporter cackling over her father's troubles. That's followed by a shouting fight between parents -- ''I'm taking the kids!'' -- while a gothed-up, tearful Ms. Lohan wails, ''Did you ever love me?,'' and her younger sister sobs in a tutu. It all takes place in store display windows before a crowd and photographers: trauma as spectacle, hoping for a hit.
