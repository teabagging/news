He looked frightened, almost small in black tights and did not dance as well as he had with the Kirov Ballet or as he would in the future. He brought down the house. After the tension of this occasion, the atmosphere was relieved by another production on the same program - Miss Page's very lighthearted, pretty ''The Merry Widow.''   Now the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater has just brought ''The Merry Widow'' to New York for the first time in 20 years, during the company's New York debut engagement at Lehman College Center for the Performing Arts.

Happily, one consolation is immediately at hand. \\"The Metropolitan Opera Presents\\" has been taping productions at its Lincoln Center home for 20 years, compiling an invaluable library of world-renowned performances and performers. The re'ord is extended splendidly tonight with Verdi's towering masterwork \\"Otello,\\" featuring a career-crowning performance by Placido Domingo in the title role.         Verdi wrote \\"Otello\\" when he was nearly 74, some 16 years after \\"Aida,\\" his previous opera. He and his librettist, Arrigo Boito, a composer in his own right (\\"Mefistofele\\"), were at the height of their creative powers. The text is a miracle of compression, reducing Shakespeare's play from 3,500 lines to just under 800 while fully realizing the power of the tragedy.

In an era overrun with preening supermodels and \\"Baywatch\\" babes, daydreams about those dear old golden-rule days of feminine propriety can be as  consoling as a bowl of lumpy oatmeal on a dank morning.         But \\"Jane Eyre,\\" which opens today at the Paris, has it both ways. This early Victorian romance, adapted from Charlotte Bronte's 1847 novel, is also a feminist parable in which a strong, independent woman wins Prince Charming, but  on her own terms. If the film lacks the genial effervescence and comfy ensemble  acting of \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" it has an intensely focused performance by Charlotte Gainsbourg in the title role. Even though the screenplay (by Mr. Zeffirelli and Hugh Whitemore) gives Jane a paucity of verbal pith, Ms. Gainsbourg projects a canny critical intelligence and conveys the inner war between Jane's passionate spirit and her education in servility with a cool, clenched ferocity. She is an altogether more convincing Jane than either Joan Fontaine or Susannah York who played her in earlier film adaptations.
