Haig evidently feared that Cong might insist that so sweeping a pardon should be authorized by resolution of Cong; informant says that, even before Ford directed his counsel Philip W Buchen to learn from Watergate prosecutor Leon Jaworski how long it might be before Nixon could be assured of impartial trial, Haig had consulted Jaworski; Haig-Jaworski meeting is said to have been for purpose of 'documenting his case' when Haig presented proposal for immediate 'humanitarian' pardon to Pres on Aug 29; Haig, soon after, is said to have assured Nixon that 'full, free and complete pardon' would be forthcoming in matter of days; assurance was recd before arrival on Sept 5 of Ford repr Benton L Becker; Becker was instructed to say that pardon was probable, provided agreement could be reached with Nixon, his atty Herbert J Miller Jr and Ziegler as to details, including response Nixon would make; arguments used by Haig to sway Ford reptdly dealt largely with Nixon's mental state, his periodic moods of depression and withdrawal and his sometimes rambling insistence that he was not guilty of any criminal offense; at that time Nixon's phlebitis was quiescent; Haig is said to have stressed several times the risk of news leaks about impending pardon; Haig is said to have insisted that only Buchen and Pres counselor Robert T Hartmann be made privy to discussions and that it was Haig who directed that any information about discussions be kept from then-White House press sec J F terHorst (L) Haig Pleaon Nixon Health Linked to Ford's Reversal"},{"year":"2004","title":"Jeremy Eichler profile of classical cellist Matt Haimovitz","excerpt":"says Haimovitz, who was once major cello prodigy accustomed to playing in elite halls of Europe and America, has chosen altenative world, traveling US to perform in country and folk cafes, jazz spots and nightclubs, in his quest to find new meaning in classical music and to bring it to new audience;
