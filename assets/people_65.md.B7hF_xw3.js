Taking a cue from Christine Todd Whitman's successful campaign for governor in New Jersey last year, George Pataki, the Republican gubernatorial candidate in New York, is calling for a 25 percent reduction in income tax rates -- savings, he argues, that are possible without adverse consequences to localities dependent on state aid.    But when is a tax cut really a tax cut? Experience has shown that, barring an economic boom or a large amount of obvious fat in the budget, cuts at one level of government are often made up for by tax increases at another. The alternative is a reduction in services. If history offers a fair test, suggests Helen Ladd, an economist at Duke University and the Brookings Institution, it is in California and Massachusetts, where the consequences of local property tax rollbacks have been reverberating through government at both state and local levels for more than a decade. And here, argues Ms. Ladd, \\"the chickens are coming home to roost\\" in the form of higher state taxes or as deterioration in the quality of popular public services.

Does that mean the system is not working -- that free market environmentalism is being sabotaged by myopic corporate executives or hostile state regulators?         According to the latest studies, the answer is both cheerier and more complicated. So far, it seems, trading among utilities has not been needed to meet Federal standards. Indeed, A.

The proof, as if any were needed, was dramatized on Monday night at the City Center when the Martha Graham Dance Company offered a performance in tribute to its founder. The house was packed, the atmosphere alternating between intense emotion and roaring ovations.   The entire event, with free admission, had the kind of communal cathartic effect that Graham's following so obviously required. She had stipulated that there be no funeral.   To offer no respect to Graham at all, however, would be unacceptable and the outpouring on this occasion was telling. The dance field was there in force: Paul Taylor, Jerome Robbins, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Eliot Feld, Lar Lubovitch, Anna Sokolow, Pearl Lang, Dan Wagoner and Pauline Koner were among the choreographers and dancers.    Like so many Graham masterworks, the program had a theme of rebirth, of crisis resolved, of a new beginning. The first section, entitled \\"To the Future,\\" consisted of a classroom demonstration by 32 smiling and exuberant children in white leotards from the Graham school. There was also a recent film clip, showing Graham, in September, rehearsing her last complete work, \\"Maple Leaf Rag.\\"    The last of the four Graham dance pieces on the program was the 1931 classic, \\"Primitive Mysteries,\\" with its own theme of resurrection, a haunting amd spare vision of the adoration of the Virgin in the American Southwest. When the all-female corps exited to the sound of its own footfall, the stage was left bare. The curtain did not come down.   The Southwest, with its Indian and Mexican heritage, was an important influence on Graham's dances. Her ashes were scattered in the mountains of New Mexico on May 1 by Ron Protas, who is now, with Linda Hodes, the company's co-artistic director. Mr. Protas organized the program, which, a program note stated, was Graham's \\"wish of a gift to you.\\"   The entire Graham canon was distilled onstage. The children shouted out that they loved the sun, the earth and the world they lived in. Maher Benham had rehearsed them perfectly without smothering their eagerness. Some of the same leaps were performed by the adult professional dancers in \\"Acts of Light,\\" Graham's 1981 three-part piece to Carl Nielsen's music. Christine Dakin and Donlin Foreman offered a chaste view of the \\"Conversation of Lovers\\" duet, thankfully playing down the usual passion.    Indeed, one emotional peak was enough and it came in the subsequent \\"Lament\\" section, performed with burning intensity by Terese Capucilli.  The third part, \\"Ritual to the Sun,\\" equates the daily sunrise and sunset with a dancer's day. The company, led by Kenneth Topping and Maxine Sherman, was magnificent in this theatricalized Graham technique class.   The film clip, which included taped comment by Graham and stills of her by Barbara Morgan (prepared by Jeffrey Madoff) led into the self-mocking recent \\"Maple Leaf Rag.\\" Chris Landriau played the piano onstage for Miss Capucilli and Floyd Flynn, who were supported by Camille Brown, Kathy Buccellato, Laura Jimenez, Debra Kantor, Therese Maldonado, Miki Orihara, Miss Sherman, Daniela Stasi, Kim Stroud, Denise Vale, Myra Woodruff, Lyndon Branaugh, Mario Camacho, Duane Cyrus, Christopher Dolder, Peter London, Pascal Rioult, Tancredo Tavares and Young-Ha Yoo.   Mr. Camacho was also the frisky minotaur figure menacing Miss Dakin's poetic and fierce struggle with fear in the 1947 Graham-Menotti masterpiece, \\"Errand Into the Maze.\\" As for \\"Primitive Mysteries,\\" it was danced by members of the junior ensemble (Elizabeth Auclair, Lone Kjaer Larsen, Sheron Lynne Neverson) and the senior company. Suitably, Joyce Herring made the young woman who is identified with the Virgin warm and human.

As it turns out, there was good reason for the latter uproar. While Ms. Mock's film offers an admiring look at a bold, iconoclastic artist, it is not remotely on a par with either \\"Hoop Dreams\\" or \\"Crumb\\" (also among the documentaries \\"Maya Lin\\" eclipsed) when it comes to insight or daring. Directed  dutifully but unsurprisingly as a portrait of the artist at work, this film offers articulate analysis without generating any particular passion. There are  lengthy scenes of tearful visitors to monuments that Ms. Lin has designed, but these supply only secondhand emotion.

Under Mr. Gorbachev, Soviet forces escalated the war in Afghanistan and stepped up intelligence operations worldwide. Under Mr. Gorbachev, dozens of Kazakhs were killed in the bloody suppression of their national unrest in late 1986, and many were shot and beaten in Georgia for opposing the regime in spring 1989. It was Mr. Gorbachev who ordered the economic blockade of Lithuania.    To bolster his regime's diminishing control, Mr. Gorbachev sent to Baku troops who shot dead approximately 200 men, women and children, and wounded hundreds more. Under Mr. Gorbachev, Etibar Mamedov, co-leader of the Azerbaijan Popular Front, political moderate and historian, languishes in a K.G.B. prison.

Both United Nations peacekeeping troops and European Community observers were ordered out of Sarajevo for their own safety. The message was clear: Until the fighting stops, no outsiders want to be caught in the middle.   Blame for the new bloodshed is being directed principally at Belgrade, the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army and Serb militias who seem intent on seizing part of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the name of its Serb minority.

The Turkish Parliament has approved conditional cross-border fighting.   * Iran fought for eight years to control both sides of the Shatt al Arab waterway.   * Syria, too, is waiting for a situation made to order for the ambitions of its leader, Hafez al-Assad.   The military resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis will focus attention more closely than ever on the Arab-Israeli conflict, which is also a fundamental cause of instability in the region. A decisive United States victory will create new opportunities for peace in the Middle East. American leaders will have unprecedented political leverage with their Arab allies.    It is incumbent upon Congress and the Bush Administration to bridge their differences on bringing peace to the Arab-Israeli conflict, so that upon the resolution in the Persian Gulf, the United States can swiftly move forward with a peace initiative to engage moderate Arab and Israeli leaders in a direct dialogue for the first time since Anwar el-Sadat and Menachem Begin signed the Camp David Accords in 1979.   The Sadat Peace Foundation urges the Bush Administration to make every effort to continue the Arab-Israeli dialogue by requesting guarantees from moderate Arab and Israeli leaders to sit down at the table after the liberation of Kuwait and the dismantling of Saddam Hussein's Government.

The play, which opened the Pan Asian Repertory Theater's 14th season on Saturday at Playhouse 46, somehow manages to avoid bad taste. For one thing, the author studiously keeps the war itself far offstage. The play benefits from both local color and period flavor.   The scene is a bucolic community on the island of Maui, Hawaii, in which, at the outbreak of World War II, a community of transplanted Okinawans tries to come to terms with mixed loyalties. Some characters retain a close allegiance to their ancestral Okinawa, which is under Japanese control, while others are firmly committed to their new American home. This was, of course, long before Hawaii became a state.
