On her 102nd birthday, Baruch Dayan Emet, the beloved wife of the late Dr Samuel Abraham and loving mother of Judy Steinberg, Daniel Abraham, Jerry Abraham and the late Roy Abraham. Cherished mother-inlaw, adored grandmother, great grandmother and elder sister. Grandma Stella was an extraordinary, unforgettable woman whose long and distinctive life was an ongoing inspiration to her family and a remarkable source of blessing to the Jewish people and the world. The radiant matriarch of our family, she was for us the very embodiment of the Eishet Chayil, a woman of valour who was blessed with uncommon goodness, unflagging strength, deep wisdom, a profound faith and trust in God and Ishah Chashuvah, a woman of dignity in every sense, possessed of both inner and outer beauty. An outstanding daughter of the Jewish people and of the Jewish faith, Grandma Stella's life was filled with Torah and Mitzvot, as she devoted herself to helping others, in particular inspiring the young women of the Stella K. Abraham High School for Girls, of whom she was so proud to walk in her footsteps and like her to strengthen Jewish life, both near and far. Her memory will live not just in the causes and institutions that bear her name, but in our hearts forever.

Daniel and Ewa Abraham, Dr. Edward L. Steinberg and Judith Abraham Steinberg, Jeremiah and Geula Abraham and her grandchildren and her greatgrandchildren. She inspired her offspring with such a love of their ancestral heritage, that they have become in their respective communities pillars of their congregations, benefactors of World Jewry, patrons of universities and indeed patrons of almost every worthy cause in North America and Israel. Their philanthropies know no bounds and include causes interdenominational and are especially promotive of health, educational and general welfare concerns. Her son, Daniel and her son-in-law, Dr. Edward L. Steinberg are Honorary Alumni of our University and have been especially helpful in the development of our School of Economics and Business Administration which bears Daniel Abraham's name and The School of Economics and Business Administration Library, which bears the name of Dr. Edward L.
