In part because of their frequent visits to the Soviet Union, scholars of this generation combine a sharply critical view of the Soviet political system with a sense of respect and even kinship for Russians they know - not a few of whom are intellectual dissidents. While fully aware of the limited influence of these acquaintances on Soviet politics, the new Sovietologists are apt to be impressed by the dissidents' picture of Soviet society and history. Having come to know a post- Stalinist and postrevolutionary Russia that differs in many ways from the ''totalitarian model'' used by the older generation of Western Sovietologists, it is not surprising that one of them should ask whether or not the time has come to sketch out an alternative view of Soviet history. This is what Stephen Cohen, a professor of Soviet politics and history at Princeton University, has undertaken in ''Rethinking the Soviet Experience.'' WAS STALIN INEVITABLE?

President Reagan this month signed into law a bill restricting expert testimony, shifting the burden of proof and returning to the M'Naghten test in all Federal courts.   In the wake of the Hinckley case, the insanity defense has become a powerful symbol, a scapegoat for the failures of the entire criminal justice system. It is, at first glance, puzzling that the insanity defense occupies such a central place in the pantheon of right-wing demonology.

The Reagan Administration has polarized political conflict on those two issues by moving the Republican Party sharply to the right. A. James Reichley, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution who served on the White House staff during the Ford Administration, contends that the Reagan Administration not only has been much more conservative than the Carter Administration but ''significantly more conservative than the earlier postwar Republican Administrations of Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford.''   The major achievement of the Reagan Administration during its first two years has been to bring down the rate of inflation by backing the Federal Reserve's monetarist policy of restricting the growth of the money supply. Prof. William J. Fellner, a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute, who served as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers under both Presidents Nixon and Ford, holds that the spread of monetarism represents a counterstroke to what the late Prof. Joseph Schumpeter of Harvard saw as a ''march into Socialism'' by the Western democracies.

The selection process is so hushed that after Robert S. McNamara said in June 1980 that he was stepping down, for example, there was little stir about a potential successor. A. W. Clausen was quietly selected within a few months and was not challenged by the incoming Reagan Administration, but the change did not actually occur until a year later.   But the current search for the bank's seventh president, to succeed Mr. Clausen, who is quitting June 30, is unlike all the others. The decision will still be made by the White House, but quiet deliberations have given way to a less seemly process that looks a lot like political campaigning with favorite horses, Congressional endorsements and boosterism.

But the need for codification of technique has been stressed increasingly in the modern theater, most notably by Constantin Stanislavsky and Lee Strasberg. Reacting to the superficiality of the acting of their times, both sought to discover and reproduce the means by which the actor expresses the emotional truth of his character.     At the Moscow Art Theater, Stanislavsky called into being a new actor, who sought the truth of the character not only in the playwright's words but also within his own psyche. Strasberg took that new actor further into his own emotions with the Method, which relied even more on the actor's life experience, creating what some saw as the mumbling solipsist of the Actors Studio in the 1950's.

The tender solicitude for consumers demonstrated by the group after its meetings in London was also a historic first. After having run the price of crude oil up to a peak some 20 times higher than its pre-1973 level, OPEC members said they would now like to get together with oil consumers to stabilize prices. They also expressed their solicitude for non-OPEC oil producers such as Mexico, Britain and Norway, which they would like to join their club so that they too could have quotas set on how much oil they could produce.

The New York Public Interest Research Group believes that College Board's refusal to address the biases in the exam guarantees that the \\"new\\" exam will continue to leave women and nonwhites at a disadvantage.   The S.A.T. is marketed as a predictor of first-year college grades. Yet women, who earn higher first-year grades than men, score lower on the S.A.T. math and verbal section. Even the manufacturers of the test have been forced to admit that the S.A.T. underpredicts for women.   Moreover, women perform as well as, if not better than, men on New York State's Regents exams for algebra, geometry and trigonometry. Yet women consistently score lower on the S.A.T. math section. The manufacturers have no explanation why women score lower than men on the S.A.T. verbal section. It is well known that females perform better than males in high school English classes.   While no one would dispute that many nonwhite students receive an inadequate education, we believe the S.A.T. exaggerates white-nonwhite educational differences. John Morris, former president of Union College, stated when he dropped the S.A.T. as an admissions requirement: \\"We are convinced that the S.A.T. cannot escape cultural bias. The evidence we have reviewed is quite clear that the S.A.T. handicaps certain groups, women and minority students being prime examples.\\"   According to studies on file with the New York State Education Department, the S.A.T. was no more accurate than pure chance in predicting college grades in half the colleges that conducted studies to examine the test's accuracy. Indeed, high school grades, even considering the wide differences among schools, were a far better predictor than the S.A.T. of college grades.   Until the College Board proves publicly that this \\"new\\" exam is bias-free, no college or university should require the scores from students for admission, and New York should not use the exam for scholarship awards.

Transforming from a nerd to a punk means changing from being a person without fashion to one against fashion, moving from the bottom rung of the social ladder to off it altogether. In the cynical 1990's, there is no anti-fashion. It's now rebellious to have no fashion: in other words, to be a nerd. It may have been hip to be square for Huey Lewis in the 1980's, but for Blur and Pulp, two English bands that performed on Thursday night, it's punk to be square.   The two bands look back to that brief period of musical history when punk turned into new wave, when cynicism and romanticism met for a brief, shining moment.

KELLY gave fans plenty of what they wanted, plenty of what they didn't know they wanted and plenty they probably still aren't sure they wanted. There was a sex show in a cage, an extended homage to Stevie Wonder (complete with dashikis) and, at the end, an evangelical cartoon, accompanied by the opera remix of ''I Believe I Can Fly.'' (That remix -- complete with appearances by the voice of the singer's dead mother and the voice of God -- is available on bootleg versions of Mr. Kelly's unreleased album ''Love Land.'')    Suffice it to say that a lot has happened since then. There have been five new CD's since ''Love Land'' was scrapped. As news of his sex scandal spread -- along with a much-bootlegged videotape -- Mr. Kelly seemed to falter for a minute, but then he went into overdrive. His excellent 2003 album, ''Chocolate Factory,'' was a lot of romance and a few apologies, too: fans could hear it as an act of contrition. A partnership with Jay-Z ended in bad blood and lawsuits (though there are more good songs than most people think on the two CD's they made together), but Mr. Kelly kept making hits. Last year brought another new album, ''TP3 Reloaded'' (Jive), plus something even better than a hit: ''Trapped in the Closet,'' his R & B operetta, which tells the twisted story of -- well, you have to see and hear it to believe it. (The ''Trapped in the Closet'' DVD collects the first 12 chapters, and he promises more are on the way.) ''Trapped'' taught new fans what old fans already knew: the man is a genius.    On Tuesday he comes to Radio City Music Hall, for a concert that sold out just about as soon as it was announced.

Well, there's hardly anything more sentimental than the heart- on-sleeve Cuban ballad style known, in perfect Spanglish, as ''el feeling.'' It is the province of courtly crooners who make Julio Iglesias (a kind of modernized, internationalized ''el feeling'' singer) seem a little unromantic. The style is rarely heard outside the Cuban community, but tomorrow at 9 P.M., Soundscape - which will be set up like a nightclub, with tables and chairs - will present ''Una Noche del 'Feeling' '' (a night of ''feeling'') with the singer Regino Tellechea. The singer-guitarist Cary Del Rio and the virtuoso conga drummer Daniel Ponce will be special guests, and the backup band will include the drummer Ignacio Berroa. In the tradition of ''el feeling,'' other singers have been invited and are likely to perform. Soundscape is at 500 West 52d Street, near 10th Avenue, and admission is $8 (581-7032).

In recent summers, the British rock exports of choice have been either bands with buzzing, droning, noisy guitars and timid singing, or groups that combine rock riffs, rave-music dance beats and maracas and tambourines. This year, the music is a combination of the above. It merges buzzing guitars and rave beats, but it also reaches back to the 1960's to add a little soul to its sound.

But the real star treatment -- shouting, whistling, stamping, standing ovations -- greeted firefighters, police officers, rescue workers and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.     The front seats, 6,000 of them, had been donated to those uniformed workers and their survivors, many of whom had brought photographs to hold up for VH1's cameras. The rest of the arena joined in their cheers, gratefully and wholeheartedly. Performers, for the moment, had suspended any conflicts with authority figures. They flaunted fire- and police-department shirts, and they happily wore the hats passed up to the stage from the audience.     Simply by doing their jobs, the city workers have taken on clear symbolic roles. They are ''brothers,'' heroes, mourners and pillars of public strength.

Over that time, New Yorkers have come to count on its concerts as a way to discover music that may be ancient at home, but often sounds brand new and startling here. As a concert promoter, the World Music Institute has specialized in music and dance that preserve old traditions. But for its 20th-anniversary benefit concert, on Saturday night at TOWN HALL, it loosens up for some stylistic border-crossings and collaborations. In the real world of the 21st century, after all, many musicians run into one another on the circuit of world-music events, and they keep their ears open.    The music director for Saturday's concert is ZAKIR HUSSAIN, the Indian tabla virtuoso who dispenses fireworks whether he's accompanying a classical raga or working with jazz musicians. And the lineup spans considerable territory. There's percussion from the conga player GIOVANNI HIDALGO and the Brazilian drummer DENDE. There are assorted flutes from STEVE GORN (on Indian bansuri), and BAILO BAH (on Guinean tambin), and BRIAN FINNEGAN of Flook (on Irish flutes). And there is music for strings from SIMON SHAHEEN and ALI JIHAD RACY on the Arabic oud, MIN XIAO-FEN on the Chinese lute called the pipa and USTAD SULTAN KHAN on the Indian bowed lute called the sarangi.    The concert could turn into a one-world revelation or a cultural collision -- possibly both. But without the World Music Institute, neither this kind of concert lineup nor the audience to appreciate it might have existed in New York City.

(He packed it in, after 20 years, when an executive at his record label asked him to sing more like Bob Seger.) His son, the Nashville rock musician Bobby Bare Jr., and the producer and musician Mark Nevers have helped him create an elegant comeback album, his first in 22 years, ''THE MOON WAS BLUE'' (Dualtone), with some weird subversions. Low, trilled whistles and reverbed, spacey guitar sounds pass through the music -- it can be like a stoner's dream of the Nashville Sound -- and some of the repertory is unabashedly antique , including the Tin Pan Alley song ''Shine on Harvest Moon.'' Mr. Bare is careful with these songs, and you can tell that he has lived with them for a long time. This week he will play his first performance in New York in two decades. Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200.    MISSISSIPPI JOHN HURT, who died in 1966, was the hippie's blues singer: his light, gentle singing and rolling picking style, in old songs like ''Candy Man Blues'' and ''Frankie,'' found their widest audience when he restarted his career during the early 60's folk revival. In ''BLUES FALLIN' DOWN LIKE RAIN,'' a Hurt-centric concert that is part of the New York Guitar Festival, some musicians who were around for his rediscovery and some who discovered him later pay their respects: the guitarists Jorma Kaukonen and Brandon Ross, and the singer-songwriters Bill Morrissey and Jen Chapin.

It is, therefore, a kind of subjective biography—which is at the same time meant to be universal, pretty much to the degree to which it is also subjective. In this, \\"Akran\\" resembles much recent narrative work, and, in film, the early semi-autobiographical movies of Jerzy Skolimowski. I don't know whether Myers intends \\"Akran\\" as autobiography (for what it's worth, Mrs. Myers plays the hero's girl and wife and sometimes, I think, mother) but it doesn't much matter. The film's mode is personal confession—not so much of conscience as of consciousness.But the film's means are highly unusual, and in technique \\"Akran\\" must represent something of a tour de force. With a sound track mix consisting of more or less patterned noise along with snatches of monologue in the air or via tape or television (but almost no ordinary dialogue) and with an overpowering visual style that takes its start in sequences consisting wholly of stop shots, \\"Akran\\" leaves no doubt about the range and intensity of its ambitions.I rather like the intensity and resent the range. As it deals with the intimacies of its hero's life and especially his past, \\"Akran\\" achieves a density of image, mixing memory and desire, that does more to validate the poetry of the recollected commonplace than anything else I have seen in recent movies.But where it strains toward a major overview of the quality of the American experience—seen through the moods and anxieties of its protagonist—it begins to lose as much as it had gained, and curiously, becomes simpler as it means to become more complex.A voice begins intoning \\"Paul Hindemith is dead","excerpt":"Pope John is dead; Jean Cocteau is dead . . .\\" Television announcers give notice to all the sublimations of our collective guilt. And finally \\"life\\" appears — as a peep show, as a penny arcade, as one or another of those handy metaphors that, at least in cinema, are generally substitutes, rather than symbols, for what cannot possibly be genuine understanding.Occasionally, an attempt at major historical understanding does succeed in film, but only (as in \\"Rules of the Game\\" or \\"Weekend\\") in works of great clarity, formal control and intellectual precision. I don't think that Richard Myers has, or really pretends to, these virtues. The virtues he does have are real and rare enough — but they have to do with some of the potentials of the screen and with the compulsions of a private imagination, and not with the decline of Western Civilization.But there is enough going on in \\"Akran\\" to command anyone's attention. And much of that is lovely and wonderfully difficult, with a regard for strange nuances that is one of the pleasures of the movies.
