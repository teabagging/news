The 40-minute work was generated, the composer writes in the notes, by \\"feelings of loss, anger and frustration\\" as friends and colleagues have been felled by AIDS. In the score, inscribed next to melodic themes, are names of the deceased; one phrase recalls Paul Jacobs, the distinguished pianist for the New York Philharmonic.

In fact, his visits to the synagogue might be said to fall into the tourist category. So it's appropriate that tourism was the occasion for his presence at Temple Mikve Israel in Savannah, Ga., in August 1975, when he received a kind of writer's revelationone that set him to writing his new novel, &#8220","excerpt":"Members of the Tribe.&#8221; Mr. Kluger, his wife and two boys were doing some sightseeing in Savannah after vacationing at Hilton Head. Pe rusing a guidebook of the historical old city, Mr. Kluger saw a mention of Temple Mikve Israel, which was founded in 1733 and is the oldest in the South. And so, the Kluger family paid a visit. As they were walking down the aisle, Mr. Kluger's eye fell on a piece of paper lying there. Out of some obscure anti&#8208;littering instinct, he picked it up and noticed there was writing on it. The words, in a jagged script, read, &#8220;Get history of the Congregation.&#8221; BOOK ENDS"},{"year":"1995","title":"The countercultural revolution in the United States was personified in the Living Theater, the radical theater collective. Founded in New York City after World War II by Judith Malina and Julian Beck, the company began by producing the works of Gertrude Stein and William Carlos Williams before embracing the theories of Brecht and Artaud's esthetic of spectacle and \\"cruelty.\\" The result was a merger of theater, politics and art, John Tytell writes in THE LIVING THEATER: Art, Exile, and Outrage (Grove, $30). The group gained notoriety with productions of \\"The Connection,\\" about drug addiction, in 1959 and of \\"The Brig,\\" about brutality in a Marine prison, in 1963. Later in that year, the Living Theater was in the news when the Internal Revenue Service seized its 14th Street loft in lieu of back taxes","excerpt":"members of the troupe staged a sit-in in protest. The company moved to Europe, where members were involved in some of the student strikes of 1968, and did not return to the United States until 1983. Beck died two years later, but the theater continues under Ms. Malina and the playwright and director Hanon Reznikov. Although Mr. Tytell, who teaches English at Queens College, has captured the spirit of the era, he focuses mainly on the dynamics between Beck and Ms. Malina, with long accounts of their personal and sexual activities, as well as a pop history filled with a Who's Who of painters, writers and actors whose lives intersected with the Living Theater. The discussion of the collective's work lacks critical rigor, but the book offers a taste of the times and some insight into the underpinnings of the company.

Martin Charles Seham, a labor attorney who gracefully bridged the chasm between unions and managment, died April 1at Englewood Hospital, Englewood, New Jersey at 73, after a 21-year battle with Parkinson's disease. His death was announced by his son and law partner, Lee Seham. Seham's concern for the ordinary worker began when he was a Midwood High School student in Brooklyn. He organized a student rally to support the teachers' job action for better wages, picketing Foley Square, the seat of City government. Soon, the students were surrounded by mounted policemen, who herded them into traffic. Seham led his schoolmates in a spirited rendition of The Star Spangled Banner, and the police backed off. Seham's musical career continued at Midwood, where he was among the early writers and performers in the nowfamous ''Sing.'' A Brooklyn boy of modest means, Seham worked his way through Amherst College by operating a drycleaning business and selling compulsory beanies to successive freshman classes. He had passed up scholarships from other colleges, determined to attend Amherst and fully experience its alien gentile world. He found it both stimulating and accepting. In 1954, he graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, having served as his fraternity's first Jewish president. At Harvard Law School, he became an editor of the Harvard Law Review. In the contentious field of airline labor relations, Seham obtained the confidence of both management and labor. His practice included representation of many foreign airlines and several independent labor unions. He served for decades as General Counsel to both the Allied Pilots Association (1963-92) and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (1964-2002). His firm-Seham, Seham, Meltz and Petersen-has also represented unions of pilots and flight attendants. Seham was well known in the maritime industry as General Counsel to the American Maritime Association, a multi-employer bargaining association. A recognised advocate in the fields of utilities and Manhattan real estate, he was General Counsel to the Owners' Committee on Electric Rates and to the Midtown Realty Owners' Association. Seham felt a special pride in his representation of labor union clients, particularly the pilots and aircraft mechanics. He repeatedly waived fees amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars because of his conviction that the fledgling organizations stood for something important. He believed in the American legal system, and wanted to make sure that his union clients had their day in court, too. Seham's public service included a three-year term as Chairman of the New York City Public Utility Board","excerpt":"membership on the Board of the Bergen County (NJ) Urban League; and management of Hubert Humphrey's presidential campaign in northern New Jersey.
