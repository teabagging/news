It is all glory for the Paris Commune and for those who died fighting for it on the barricades.And yet—although the filmmakers charitably ignore the debauchery, brutality and vandalism of the commune, which did, after all, set fire to public buildings, massacre hostages, destroy the palace of the Tuileries, the Thiers library and the Vendome column—it is unable to hide, even in this subjective treatment, inklings of the stupidity, ineptness and confusion of the revolution's leaders. To this extent, it is an accurate picture of a bloody and worthless sixty-five days' war.Aside from our factual scruples, there remains the more cogent objection that \\"Paris Commune\\" is a singularly dispirited, over-attenuated and static motion picture.

The usual rigmarole of noisy detectives, clues, evidence, suspects and what is technically known as comedy relief is thrown overboard. The camera for a change sees all and knows all, which gives the murde of Gordon Rich by Richard Grant a delicious tang of its own. In fact \\"Guilty Hands\\" offers seventy minutes of stimulating murder-mystery entertainment.Lionel Barrymore's performance as the truculent, kindly old attorney who murders his daughter's fiancé out of his love for her is brilliant acting. Mr. Barrymore imparts color and distinction to the most prosaic lines; not a word is wasted.The murder itself is a finished specimen of homicide, a perfect crime planned and carried out on the screen—and spoiled because the dead man's mistress is gifted with that sixth intuitive sense. Grant warns Rich that he will kill him unless that notorious roué breaks off the engagement. On the night before the wedding, Rich pens a note to the police, sets a guard about Grant's cottage, locks his door and otherwise safeguards himself. The crime that follows is such an obvious case of suicide to all appearances that only a jealous woman could seek a further meaning. How the dead man keeps a promise and brings Grant down, a visit to the Capitol will reveal.There is an excellent scene between the murderer and the woman who has discovered him, in which he proves to her that there is sufficient evidence to convict her of the crime if she carries cut her intention of telling the police what she has learned. Grant makes his point more than clear by playing the rôle of prosecuting attorney before an imaginary jury while the woman stares on in terror.Kay Francis in this latter rôle plays well. Madge Evans and Alan Mowbray, in the rôles of daughter and fiancé, respectively, also perform capably and the assisting cast is without visible flaw. W. S. Van Dyke also deserves a word for his direction, particularly his use of shadows.Supplementing the feature is the third and final of the Bill Tilden tennis series, in which that actor-author-champion demonstrates the volley and smash. Lottie Mayer is the feature of the stage revue, \\"Splashes,\\" which centres around, a huge tank on the stage. Fritz and Jean Hubert, with innumerable mermaids, help out.

It appeared to be part of an effort to reduce the strain in relations that has developed since the hijacking.

And who else could have evoked with such success the humor needed to divert our attention from Liszt's vulgarities here?

But Mr. Cherkassky, as anyone knows who has heard the pianist since his American career belatedly blossomed in 1976, is just the opposite: impulsive, whimsical, heated. This is partly why he is often thought of as the last Romantic. His playing recalls an era before pianists heard themselves, when virtuosity meant acrobatics without a net and individuality was the only authenticity.   In an exuberantly eccentric concert on Monday night in Carnegie Hall, Mr. Cherkassky, who was celebrating his 80th birthday, still seemed the last survivor of the ante-recording age. No cold-blooded playing here. This was an extraordinary demonstration of pianism: anything could happen, and sometimes anything did. The program included hyphenated compositions once common to the Romantic piano recital: Bach-Busoni (Busoni's magisterial transcription of the D-minor Chaconne), and Tchaikovsky-Pabst (the 19th-century German pianist Paul Pabst's paraphrase of themes from \\"Eugene Onegin\\"). But so impulsively improvisatory and indulgently whimsical was the playing that everything should have been hyphenated yet again to include the pianist's name.

E. Kleinschmidt's Arct???c production. \\"Primitive Love,\\" now decorating the Cameo screen. The caption writer appears to have tried to jazz-up the froen North in his valiant struggle to live up to the sense of the main title. There are in this subject a number of passages that recall Robert J. Flaherty's memorable feature, \\"Nanook of the North,\\" but, except for those sequences depicting polar bears and walruses, this current attraction suffers by comparison with its predecessor.It is obvious that there is no end of difficulty in getting something different from the vast wastes near the top of the world, and for that reason Captain Kleinschmidt has been compelled to picture scenes that are quite similar to those in \\"Nanook of the North.\\" The stretches showing the dogs outside an igloo during a blizzard are very much like that particular part of Mr. Flaherty's film. But Flaherty added drama, by showing more of the dogs, by giving one a better idea of their ferociousness and their ravenous hunger, and by giving a clearer picture of the animals as they shook the frozen snow from their heads. On several occasions Captain Kleinschmidt strikes an interesting note, but more than once he fails to carry it through to a satisfactory conclusion.Captain Kleinschmidt deserves great credit for his unforgetable chapter in a former production of a mother bear and her cub, which was one of the striking features in the National Board of Review's compilation, \\"Thirty Years of Motion Pictures.\\" And although in \\"Primitive Love\\" there are some excellent glimpses of life in the stark North, the killing of polar bears and walruses and the constant struggle for food and clothing, there is nothing quite as touching as the sight of that great white bear fighting to protect her round little cub.There are seven characters in this production. Ok-Ba-Ok is described as a modern cave man","excerpt":"Sicca Bruna is his wife; Wenga is the flapper daughter and Amutuk is the sensible daughter; Patunuk and Itak are rivals for the hand of Wenga, and Annok is Ok-Ba-Ok's grandmother.One of the sober titles sets forth that Annok feels that she must go forth to her death. She explains that her wrists are weak and; her eyes are too dim to follow the needle. The old woman is supposed to be ready to crawl out onto the chilly wastes and stagger along until she perishes from exhaustion.The killing of the polar bears with harpoons furnishes quite an exciting chapter, but the series of scenes devoted to the slaughter of a giant walrus is even more thrilling, for in this case the Eskimos are in a small boat, which seems likely at any moment to turn turtle. Through clever balancing, the men manage to haul the dead monster aboard. The sight of a herd of walruses is rather startling; the title writer likens them to the \\"tired business man who has a front row at a musical comedy.\\" THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1930","title":"Raises quota of $5,436,000 JEWISH FEDERATION RAISES $5,436,000","excerpt":"Sicher Announces Success of Emergency Drive to Complete Annual Fund.REPORTS SET FOR JAN. 26Lehman to Address Meeting WhenExpenditures for the 91 Agencies Are Analyzed."},{"year":"1930","title":"HOLY CROSS SHIFTS MEN.","excerpt":"Sichol Moved From Guard to Tackle Post--Goonan Returns."},{"year":"1996","title":"They have grown from a pet peeve to a major quality-of-life complaint among Upper West Siders.

Although the film achieves a few moments of dramatic interest—chiefly through the performance of the Continental Fritz Kortner—it is in the main a tedious and uninspired biography, scarred by hypodermic injections of stale melodrama.The late Abdul Hamid, as the Armenians have cause to remember, was one of the last pre-war absolute despots. He lived in terror for his life, and his subjects lived in terror for theirs. It is recorded of him that he never slept twice in succession in the same room, such was his fear of assassination. His spies were more active and numerous and deadly than Russia's Cheka. And finally (in April, 1909) there was a revolt, led by the Young Turks, and Abdul the Damned became a palace prisoner and so remained until his death in 1918.Mr. Kortner's portrayal of the cruel, scheming and fear-ridden monarch has the proper depth and shading, but the portrait loses its significance through being placed in a tawdry gallery of stock heroics. The English producers, apparently unwilling to confine themselves to such undramatic matters as massacre, intrigue, rebellion and murder, have attempted to leaven the dull pages of Turkish history with a glamorous plot concerning the Sultan's admiration for a Viennese actress. By threatening the man she loves he forces her to enter his harem and that situation is made the pivotal point upon which Abdul's fortunes turned.While there is no strong objection to a romantic sub-plot, it does seem that the film-makers might have kept a sense of proportion. By treating Miss Adrienne Ames's entrance into the seraglio with as much concern as they recorded the revolt of the Turks and the collapse of the despot, they have deprived the picture of any right to be considered seriously. Similarly, having no dramatic honesty, the film moves with the ridiculous solemnity of a processional at which mischievous small boys are tossing firecrackers. Mr. Kortner is its only asset.The Canzoneri-McLarnin pictures provide twenty whirlwind minutes of action. There are shots from each of the ten rounds, showing McLarnin's magnificent first-round assault and Canzoneri's spirited reprisal in the next round, and thenceforth enough of the battle to indicate that the rugged Italian was the undoubted winner.

And we can also thank his corps of artists, who have so beautifully and tastefully evolved George Gershwin's musical translation of DuBose and Dorothy Heyward's play that we can almost feel the motion picture medium is the one for which it was destined all the time.The great values in this lyric drama of the Negro residents of Catfish Row, an old slum quarter in Charleston, S. C., are colorfulness, vitality and the eloquence in the music that expresses its characters' joys and sorrows. These are the essential values that are handsomely and throbbingly put forth in this film, which opened last night at the Warner Theatre for a road-show run.Considering the obvious essentials of colorfulness and vitality first, it is notable that Mr. Goldwyn has given this picture the strongest benefits of color photography and wide screen. The panel suffused with the action and the pungent atmosphere of the teeming quarters in old Charleston is the wide one of Todd-AO, a system that is almost as expansive and pictorially pervasive as that of Cinerama, which recently occupied this, theatre's screen. And the whole mise en scène of the production, designed by Oliver Smith, has a richness and subtlety of color that are a powerful dynamic in this \\"Porgy and Bess.\\"But more than the physical aspects of it, and the general fitness of the Irene Sharaff costumes, is the full flow of life and human feelings that is made to rush through this film. N. Richard Nash has adapted and Otto Preminger has directed a script that fairly bursts with continuous melodrama and the pregnant pressure of human emotions at absolute peaks.From the moment crap-shooting Robbins is leaped on by bull-tempered Crown and beaten to death at the outset, there is violence or the threat of violence in Catfish Row and on that off shore picnic island to which its residents briefly go. Evil, like that dark, portentous buzzard, hovers in the air. If it isn't Crown who is the spoiler, with his lust and rapaciousness toward Bess, it is Sport-in' Life with his \\"happy dust\\" and his persistence in stirring up strife.These are the threads of vital conflict that have been pulled tight in the script and have been made to vibrate like humming harp strings all the way through the film. Always the pitiful groping of crippled Porgy for Bess and her fitful and frightened reaching for a futile relationship with him are constrained and imperiled by the presence of these evils in their midst. Mr. Preminger, with close and taut direction, keeps you keyed up for disaster all the time.To this structure of pictorial color and dramatic vitality, there is added a musical expression that is possibly the best this fine folk opera has ever had. Under André Previn's direction, the score is magnificently played and sung, with some of the most beautiful communication coming from the choral group. Surpassing, indeed, is the whole sequence of events in the hurricane, with the storm that rages on the giant screen accompanied appropriately by massive orchestral and vocal expressions of agony and defiance.The duets and solos are likewise powerful, for all their familiarity and despite the fact that, in four of the key roles, the singing voices have been dubbed. Sidney Poitier's performance of Porgy is as sensitive and strong as one could wish, but so is the voice of Robert McFerrin doing his musical chores. So, too, Adele Addison's singing for Dorothy Dandridge, who plays Bess, enhances a characterization that could be improved upon.But Sammy Davis Jr. does his own singing as the mischievous Sportin' Life and in every respect he is the sharpest and most insinuating figure in the show. His is the complete expression of the creeping corruption that imperils this little cluster of innocent people. There's nothing funny about him. He's sly and bad.Pearl Bailey's billowing Maria, the cook-shop woman, is, conversely, a pillar of strength and delivers some vocal eloquencies with Miss Bailey's fine and throaty voice. Brock Peters as Crown is thunderingly powerful, dramatically and vocally, and Diahann Carroll beautifully plays the young mother whose haunting \\"Summer-time\\" Loulie Jean Norman sings. Ruth Attaway as Serena (with Inez Matthews' singing voice) and Clarence Muse as Peter, the aged \\"honey man,\\" are excellent, too.To be sure, there are some flaws in this production. Miss Dandridge is too sinuous and sleek and got up to look too much like Kiki to give a fully satisfying portrayal of Bess. A couple of duets are somewhat static. And the climatic incident in the plot—the desertion of Bess—has been covered in a much too mildly allusive scene.But, for the most part, this is a stunning, exciting and moving film, packed with human emotions and cheerful and mournful melodies. It bids fair to be as much a classic on the screen as it is on the stage.
