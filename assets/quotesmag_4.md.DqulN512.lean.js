In the lively and amusing one-hour play, which runs through April 22 at the Westbeth Theater Center, Ms. Mosakowski and Matthew Maguire portray a couple so entranced by legendary figures who have died in car crashes - James Dean, Grace Kelly, Albert Camus, Jackson Pollock and many others - that they work themselves into an ecstatic, suicidal frenzy of fantasized identification.   At its best, the piece recalls \\"The Beard,\\" Michael McClure's 1960's play, which imagines a mythical encounter between Jean Harlow and Billy the Kid. Instead of inventing one pop myth, \\"Cities Out of Print\\" recycles dozens of familiar ones from life and from art, swirling them together into a collage of voices and dialogue that makes them seem interchangeable and cheap.   The re-enactment of a scene from the David Lynch movie \\"Blue Velvet\\" segues abruptly into a soap-opera tableau in which Jackson Pollock and an unidentified woman talk passionately about living on \\"the edge.\\" As the actors keep exhanging characters, accents and wigs, their dialogues seem phony and hyped up and the characters foolishly self-deluded. As such stories have proliferated and been recycled in the age of the video and audio cassette, the play strongly suggests, they have lost their resonance. Both performers obviously relish acting out these games of charade and dress up. Ms. Mosakowski is especially stinging in her moments as a mean, goading gun moll.   Tom Dale Keever's striking set design poses the action between two visual elements. One is the skeleton of the death car the couple dreams of driving into oblivion. The other is a large painting of an empty highway that vanishes into the distance. At the end of the play, the actors fill in that emptiness, fixing themselves to the canvas like hungry flies as Hank Williams's fatalistic hymn to extinction keens in the background.

There is little wonder that Sir James cited the statute because many corporate law experts have called it ''a management entrenchment act.''   Indeed, some experts say the Ohio law gives corporate directors more leeway to resist takeovers than the laws of any other state.   The Ohio statute not only gives the green light to ''poison pills'' - actions intended to make takeovers prohibitively costly - but also contains two other novel, far-reaching provisions. First, while statutes and judicial decisions in most states make clear that corporate directors have only one loyalty - to the corporation and its shareholders -the Ohio statute says otherwise. Under that law, directors weighing takeover offers may also consider the interests of employees, suppliers, creditors, customers, ''the state and national economy,'' and ''community and society considerations.''

TOURIST INFORMATION (800) 33-GUMBO. www.louisianatravel.com . European influences and ethnic diversity distinguish Louisiana from the rest of the nation. When Louisiana entered the Union in 1812, it brought with it a French legal system and a bilingualism that still survive. African-Americans, Cajuns and Creoles have contributed to its distinctive music and cuisine. The state has rich farmland, more oil and gas reserves than any other state but Texas, and in New Orleans an international port that serves the most extensive river system in North America. The “devil's bargain” with the petrochemical industry struck by charismatic populist governor Huey Long (assassinated in 1935) brought needed jobs to the state. But the environmental impact of 100 loosely regulated petrochemical plants on the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge is being assessed only now. The state's reliance on the petroleum industry was felt when a downturn in oil prices in the 1980's led to massive unemployment. Economic diversification is under way, especially in field of tourism.

That's the argument put forth by companies that specialize in limited partnerships - groups that buy producing oil properties for income purposes.

Arguments about finite oil and natural gas resources, running out of natural gas, a nuclear resurgence and the switch to electricity were the popular fads of the day. More realistic wellhead prices, the product of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, have demonstrated that this finite resource mentality is wrong. The gas resource base is for practical purposes finite only for a particular set of economic and technological assumptions.

These efforts, led by Senators Bob Dole, Don Nickles and others, and by Representatives William S. Broomfield, Tom Lantos and others, are wide of the mark.   The resolutions and amendments attempt to deal with the complicated problem of Albanian nationality in the province of Kosovo, which few members of Congress are in a position to judge.    The resolutions and amendments seek to limit United States and International Monetary Fund credits to Yugoslav republics that have held democratic elections (Slovenia and Croatia), ignoring that multiparty elections are scheduled in the other republics in November and December. Ironically, the people of Serbia, the republic that the resolutions are aimed against, have more freedom of speech and the press than the people of the republics where democratic elections have been held. The leader of Croatia has demonstrated little tolerance for dissenting views. The situation is little better in Slovenia, but dissenters are not looked upon by the new leaders with any favor.   With Yugoslavia in crisis, and, as many believe, on the brink of dissolution, many Yugoslavs believe that Congressional acts that take sides in their country's domestic disputes only add to the woes of Yugoslavia's leaders.

My guess is that something on the wallpaper kept the paint from adhering properly - perhaps a wax or plastic coating.

Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc., said in an interview yesterday that, while six months ago the oil companies considered a steep fall in prices highly unlikely, today close to half of them fear a ''chain reaction'' that could drive oil prices down below $20.    Clearly, if that happened, it would play havoc with the profits of the oil companies. A study by Avram Kisselgoff for the National Bureau of Economic Research established the close correlation between the run-up in world oil prices and oil-company profits from 1973 to 1980.

Not entirely unexpectedly, Senator Pete V. Domenici, a long-time supporter of the idea, is expected to introduce a bill this week to levy a $10-a-barrel tax on imported petroleum and refined products.  The only exemption, according to the New Mexico Republican's staff, would be for crude oil that is imported and then refined for immediate export.

Joanna Cotler/HarperCollins. $19.95. (All ages) Here's a second collection of sophisticated (some might say peculiar) comic stories written and illustrated by such eminent practitioners of the art as Maurice Sendak, Richard McGuire, Barbara McClintock, Ian Falconer and Jules Feiffer. It's in the same large format as the first, and similarly suitable for adults as well as older children.    YOU READ TO ME, I'LL READ TO YOU: Very Short Stories to Read Together. By Mary Ann Hoberman. Illustrated by Michael Emberley. Little, Brown. $15.95. (Ages 4 and up) The author, who has written many books for children and worked with Literacy Volunteers of America, offers stories and verses in two voices for reading aloud. The winning illustrations show the speakers and elaborate on the simple texts with wit and affection. The readers can be adult and child, or children together; either way it's fun.    WHAT PETE ATE FROM A TO Z: Where We Explore the English Alphabet (in Its Entirety) in Which a Certain Dog Devours a Myriad of Items Which He Should Not. Written and illustrated by Maira Kalman. Putnam. $15.99. (Ages 4 to 8) The subtitle gives the plot away, but the way Poppy describes her dog, Pete, and his alphabetic adventures, is richly witty in both the text and the illustrations.    LISA IN NEW YORK. By Anne Gutman. Illustrated by Georg Hallensleben. Knopf. $9.95. (Ages 4 to 8) An appealing series of books, originally published in France, about two beguiling friends, Gaspard and Lisa, sets their sophisticated adventures in museums, a hospital, on vacation. The cover illustration of this one, showing Lisa and the Manhattan skyline, was completed before 9/11/01. Never mind. Lisa is a busy tourist who keeps her wits about her at all times. The illustrations in all the stories are both lush and detailed.    STEVEN SPIELBERG: Crazy for Movies. By Susan Goldman Rubin. Abrams. $19.95. (Ages 8 to 12) Here's a straightforward biography of the filmmaker from childhood (he made his first film in high school) through last year's ''A.I.'' The Spielberg family cooperated with the author and provided family pictures as well as anecdotes. In addition to a glossary of filmmaking terms, there are extensive references and resources to guide young cin&#233;astes, the kind who probably have video cameras already, to further information.    I LIVE IN TOKYO. Written and illustrated by Mari Takabayashi. Houghton Mifflin. $16. (Ages 4 to 8) Mimiko, who is 7 years old and lives in a small Western-style house in Tokyo, guides readers through a calendar year of events and activities. The captioned illustrations range from public festivals, school sports and seasonal events to school lunches and uniforms and favorite meals. Charmingly presented and full of things to talk about and imagine.    ARTHUR: The Seeing Stone. By Kevin Crossley-Holland. Arthur A. Levine/Scholastic. $17.95. (Ages 8 and up) This first volume of a richly imagined new version of the story of King Arthur is told in 100 short chapters and ends with the boy's becoming king. There's a helpful word list.
