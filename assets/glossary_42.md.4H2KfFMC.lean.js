(Random House, $12.95.) The author, born on the ''bad side'' of African history, tells of her family's struggle to escape black rule by bouncing around from farm to farm in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia, surrounded perpetually by their dogs, copious amounts of booze and personal tragedy. Her ''engaging and even moving'' account is presented with ''wit and verve and no apologies,'' Stephen Clingman wrote in these pages last year.    THE RETURN OF THE CARAVELS, by Ant&#243","excerpt":"nio Lobo Antunes. (Grove, $13.) Imagine Vasco da Gama and other heroes of Portuguese exploration boozing, whoring and stalking the streets of Lisbon, not in the golden age of colonial conquest but in 1974, when their ships are moored alongside Iraqi oil tankers. That's the premise of this time-bending novel about the fate of imperial ambition. Antunes ''is a warm-blooded writer'' with ''empathy for the contradictions of human feeling,'' Michael Pye wrote here in 2002.    THE RECKONING: Iraq and the Legacy of Saddam Hussein, by Sandra Mackey. (Norton, $16.95.) This accessible history of Iraq is cleareyed in its condemnation of Hussein and the forces that brought him to power, even as it recognizes that the sanctions imposed after the gulf war made it easier for him to maintain his iron grip. ''Mackey is fair-minded: she never loses track of the paralyzing gap between state and society that lies at the root of Iraqi political terror,'' Fouad Ajami said in these pages last year.    TIME TRAVELER: In Search of Dinosaurs and Ancient Mammals From Montana to Mongolia, by Michael Novacek. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15.) The author, curator of paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History, provides an insightful survey of the earth's fossil record while recalling his own professional experiences, including the unearthing of important finds in many countries. His ''engaging book'' gives the reader ''an excellent sense of the way paleontologists have arrived at their world-shaking conclusions,'' David Papineau wrote here in 2002.    DEEP IN THE SHADE OF PARADISE, by John Dufresne. (Plume, $14.) Set in a tiny corner of Louisiana bayou country called Shiver-de-Freeze, this novel is essentially a bunch of interlocked stories about strange coincidences, bizarre fatalities and the comic misadventures of quirky folks who flop in and out of love. The result is a ''rambunctious, ambitious'' tale ''full of engaging characters,'' Robert Kelly said here last year.    SOLDIERS: Fighting Men's Lives, 1901-2001, by Philip Ziegler. (Plume, $14.) A biographer of royalty and celebrity turns his sights to nine enlisted men living in London's Chelsea Royal Hospital, survivors of various campaigns who played small, but telling, parts in the unraveling of the British Empire. ''The effect is such that we come at British history through a sort of side gate, and the view is new and interesting,'' James Buchan said here last year.    AGAINST LOVE POETRY, by Eavan Boland. (Norton, $12.) In her 10th collection, a poet of feminism, domestic joy and her native Ireland argues that the sweet verse associated with traditional love poetry is no such thing at all. Instead, she argues for more complex poetry that celebrates ''the contradictions of a daily love'' and the sacrifices of partnership. Her ''admirably tough-minded'' work seeks to make sense ''of the way the abstractions of time and space play themselves out in human relations,'' Melanie Rehak wrote here in 2001.    SOROS: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire, by Michael T. Kaufman. (Vintage, $15.) A survivor of Nazism and Communism, the amazingly successful investor and philanthropist George Soros is a nest of paradoxes, according to the author (a former writer and editor at The Times who has also edited a magazine for Soros): for one thing, he is personally shy but outspoken in business and in his desire to be ''the conscience of the world.'' Last year our reviewer, Anthony Gottlieb, called this ''a fascinating account of one of the great men of our times.''    NUMBER9DREAM, by David Mitchell. (Random House, $13.95.) The tale of an embittered Japanese youth scouring the streets of Tokyo in search of his father, who abandoned him at birth, this novel is filled with the young man's elaborate, cinematic fantasies, which frequently dominate the narrative and descend into camp. Nonetheless, the result is a ''fitfully brilliant book,'' our reviewer, Daniel Zalewski, wrote here in 2002.   Scott Veale   New & Noteworthy Paperbacks"},{"year":"2002","title":"(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)    A CHILD'S BOOK OF TRUE CRIME, by Chloe Hooper. (Scribner, $24.) An ambitious first novel by an Australian, in which an adulterous affair between a schoolteacher and a student's father runs parallel to an affair that ended in murder 20 years earlier. There is cause to be ill at ease, since the wronged wife in affair A has just published a book about affair B.    IN THE FOREST, by Edna O'Brien. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) Though not wholly lacking in the adulterous impulse so fundamental to the characters in O'Brien's powerful evocations of Irish reality in the past, the principals in this novel are concerned with murder, madness and innocence in the backwoods of their island.    COMPLICATIONS: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science, by Atul Gawande. (Metropolitan/Holt, $24.) Gawande, who is both a surgeon and a staff writer for The New Yorker, looks clearly and coolly at the limits and defects of medicine, which, he says, may be the most complex of human endeavors.    AMERICAN SCOUNDREL: The Life of the Notorious Civil War General Dan Sickles, by Thomas Keneally. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $27.50.) A frequently spellbinding recitation of the career of a totally awful politician, crook, adulterer and murderer who was no good as a general either.    THE RETURN OF THE CARAVELS, by Ant&#243","excerpt":"nio Lobo Antunes. (Grove, $24.) Portugal's history as an imperial power literally comes home in this novel of collective memory set in 1974; Vasco da Gama, Cabral and Francis Xavier are back in Lisbon, raising hell and anchoring their puny vessels alongside tankers.    SPIES, by Michael Frayn. (Metropolitan/Holt, $23.) The 10th novel by this master of the intellectual mystery masquerading as popular entertainment concerns a London suburb where, if memory serves the narrator, the phases of the moon govern events during World War II and an alleged spy's conduct visibly contradicts the everyday space-time continuum.    GOULD'S BOOK OF FISH: A Novel in Twelve Fish, by Richard Flanagan. (Grove, $27.50.) Phantasmagoric energy propels this novel of Tasmanian wonders and horrors whose hero is based on an English convict, the author of a book on the local fish, who died trying to escape from a penal colony in 1831; the original Gould's illustrations appear.    THE HORNED MAN, by James Lasdun. (Norton, $24.95.) A psychological thriller that explores the interior motions of self-policing; the narrator, a dedicated member of his college's sexual harassment committee, finds that sexual desire has become bureaucratic maneuvering and dreads the escape of his thought-crimes into action.    EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED, by Jonathan Safran Foer. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) Alex, a Ukrainian lad whose love for everything American has infected his speech with an amazing thesaurus of near-miss English, narrates this novel about himself and Jonathan Safran Foer, who is visiting ancestral territory and working on a novel about a Ukrainian town where dozens of worthy themes usefully congregate.

If that is true, we suspect Mr. McCarten was not in his customary form. Or else a great deal of cold sobriety has been slapped into it along the way.For this tale of a London accountant who takes it into his head one day to make some important alterations in the books of a dying hosiery firm and thus gets himself precipitated into a complex financial career does not have precisely the afflatus of a whimsy concocted in a bar. It runs more like something created by a couple of clucks in a boiler-room.From the start, it suggests a labored dullness—from the moment David Niven departs from a home in a London suburb with his bowler set squarely on his head and lines up with several similar robots to wait for the morning train. Right away, you see someone's sense of humor is wedded to the cliché. It may be scriptwriter Robert Lewis Taylor's or director Roy Kellino's. Or both.Anyhow, it continues in that fashion. Mr. Niven gets into a taxica. It is occupied by a pert French model. He is embarrassed and dismayed. She generously notes his stock timidity. \\"Why don't you strike a blow for freedom?\\" she says, with her voice and chin rising appropriately. That's the bugle that commands him to rebel.No use to document the details of Mr. Niven's financial forays under the bubbling encouragement of the model, played coquettishly by Genevieve Page. Nor is there much use in explaining why the legal embarrassments that occur when the bookkeeping flaws are discovered are devoid of comical surprise. What does a fellow do when he gets a hot-foot? Would you believe it? He jumps.There is one quick and glittering moment when a suitable flash of humor occurs—the sort of humor that could give this silly fable an appropriate zany quality. It comes when Mr. Niven, having purchased in a shop some proper safe-cracking implements, is urged by the clerk, Miles Malleson—that puffy old English character actor—to buy a few things for the getaway. \\"Now, there's a wonderful pair of snowshoes, a canoe paddle * * *,\\" Mr. Malleson purrs.It would be great if Mr. Niven and the others could have played it in that humor. But they don't.

There, another generation of world leaders -- Nehru, Nasser, Nkrumah, Sukarno, Zhou Enlai -- met at another summit, the 1955 Afro-Asian Conference, a gathering full of post-colonial promise, with dreams of self-sufficiency, solidarity among newly independent nations and commitment to an anti-superpower international policy that became known as nonalignment.   \\"Sisters and brothers!\\" President Sukarno of Indonesia told the delegates. \\"How terrifically dynamic is our time!\\"   The fraternal third world these founders envisioned is dead.

Ms. Zaremba was trained at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and she was an acclaimed teacher herself, serving for a number of years as the chairman of the keyboard department at the Ohio State University School of Music.
