Jan 2 announcement left open question of whether IRS would look at Nixon's ‘69 tax return; statute of limitations has run out on returns filed for that yr and IRS cannot legally assess any delinquent taxes for ‘69 unless it finds fraud was committed; Blech says he promised his questioners that he would not disclose any substantive details of their session; says it is full‐scale audit and there was full‐scale debate on every issue; says he is confident he will be able to defend every aspect of returns; another source who was present says com staff and agents spent more than 2 hrs questioning Blech about Nixon's sale of 23 acres of land in San Clemente, Calif, in ‘70; Blech had decided there was no taxable capital gain on transaction although land was sold at higher per‐acre price than Nixon had paid for it; another item that consumed much of questioning is said to have been arrangements that Nixon made with his daughter, Mrs Patricia Cox, surrounding purchase and subsequent sale of some lots on Fisher's Island, Fla; although Cox put up more than 1/2 money for joint venture with her father, she recd only 40% of profit from resale; reason given by White House was that Nixon promised to pay back his daughter full amount of her investment, even if land was resold at loss; assigning less of profit to Cox saved total tax payments for Nixon family because Pres had enough deductions to offset capital gain on Fla land sale whereas Cox did not and had to pay tax on her portion of profit; it would be illegal for Nixon and Cox to have split profit in any way other than prorating it according to their shares of original investment, in absence of some consideration such as indemnification of Cox against loss; there is no documentary evidence of indemnification agreement and White House has said it was oral; source present at questioning says Blech did not appear to know great deal about Nixon's gift to Natl Archives of his pre‐Pres papers, item which saved Nixon some $300,000 in Fed income tax (L) Accountant Queried by I.R.S. and Congressional Aides on Nixon's Tax Returns"},{"year":"1923","title":"Presence of I Bush, Repr Beedy and others in Moscow held to indicate increased interest in U S AMERICANS' VISITS PLEASE MOSCOW","excerpt":"Presence of Irving Bush and Others Is Held to Indicate Increased Interest Here.

(With Sun it doesn't stop at T-shirts and baseball hats: visitors searching for a piece of musical history can also rent time to record their own piece of Sun vinyl -- nowadays, tape.) But Sun began in 1952 as the dream of Sam Phillips. Mr. Phillips set about building his Memphis record company with one purpose: he wanted to record the rhythm and blues of the South, the people none of the mainstream labels would sign. Along the way he proved he had the talent (many would say the luck) and the wherewithal to sign the recording artists who played such a major role in the direction of pop music. In GOOD ROCKIN' TONIGHT: Sun Records and the Birth of Rock 'n' Roll (St. Martin's, $19.95), the independent British scholars Colin Escott and Martin Hawkins trace Sun's history from its pinnacle to its decline in the mid-60's. Rightly, the blame for the descent is placed on Mr. Phillips and his now-legendary refusal to pay his biggest stars what they deserved. Still, the main focus of the book is what really made Sun Records: the artists, each of whom receives a brief biographical chapter. There are some flaws: too many times twice-told tales are cited as fact, and the authors' reverence for the subject matter can make the reader wince. Still, reverence is appropriate. Who would have recorded Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Howlin' Wolf or Charlie Rich if not for Sun? Not any label that existed at the time.

Adam Morden, an English fisherman's son, is faced with the alternatives of becoming a monk as his mother wishes, or of joining the crew of Harry Paye, a famous freebooter grown rich on the loot taken in raids on the French coast. Attracted by wealth and adventure, Adam picks Paye. One expedition is sufficient to sicken him and, after the death of his best friend in a fight over plunder, he returns to more peaceful pursuits. His moral courage in choosing this new direction in life is greater even than his valor in battle. The combination of excitement and great sensitivity to the deepest human emotions makes this an unusu&#8208;ally satisfying book.

Solzhenitsyn's accusation concerning Stalin's planned pogrom centers on Doctor's Plot--false accusations brought by Stalin that group of physicians, largely Jewish by origin, plotted death of high officials; physicians were alleged to have been carrying out conspiracy in which Joint Distribution Com, Jewish Relief Agency and US and Brit intelligence participated; Soviet press, after announcement of purported plot, carried news items designed to agitate fever against Jewish officials and prominent Jews in Soviet life; wave of arrests was secretly undertaken and rumors had it that enormous new purge trials were in offing, involving Jews and old-line Politburo members, such as Foreign Min V M Molotov and A I Mikoyan; plot was thwarted by Stalin's death in Mar '53; Stalin's intentions were circulated during Khrushchev's regime; Solzhenitsyn version of planned pogrom is that Stalin planned to stage mass execution of Kremlin drs by hanging in Red Square; suggests he has no official confirmation of Stalin s plan; discusses his belief that Stalin was enlisted in Czarist secret police, suspicion held by some old emigre Russian revolutionaries; estimates number of victims of police terror was higher than previously accepted in West; discusses assassination on Dec 1 '34 of Leningrad party leader S M Kirov, estimating that 1/4 of city's population at that time was seized--about 600,000 persons; estimates that total population of Soviet prison camps at any one time did not exceed 12-million, of whom 1/2 were probably so-called pol prisoners;

The Hartford Hospital has given a 35-year, dollar-a-year lease on two properties it owns within the Jefferson-Seymour Historic District, near downtown Hartford, to the CDC Equity Corporation of Farmington, Conn. CDC is using the sale of Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits to finance the development of 30 apartments for families earning less than $28,000 a year. William Crosskey & Associates of Hartford are the architects.   Within one of the properties, a row of four town houses with a common mansard roof at 94-100 Jefferson Street, 10 two-bedroom and two one-bedroom apartments are being created. There also will be two street-level commercial spaces that will rent for about $625 a month.   The other property, at 134-138 Seymour Street, was built as an apartment house in 1924, and has been renovated into 18 one-bedroom apartments. Rents in both projects will be between $390 and $588 per month.   The apartments in both buildings will be managed by the Broad Park Development Corp., a nonprofit neighborhood group. The project got financing from the sale of Federal tax credits for historic renovation and low income housing. They allow investors to save more in taxes than the amount they put into the property over the 10-year life of the credits. The first tenants are expected to move in before the end of the year.

The canister was conceived by Chuck Ellis, director of marketing at Boston's Grill 23 and Bar. Mr. Ellis said he had not been able to preserve wine for more than three weeks. As a result, he said, it was virtually impossible to sell expensive wines by the glass because the remaining wine might not be consumed before its taste and bouquet degraded. Similarly, wine collectors cannot sample a vintage and return the bottle to their collection.   The new device allows a person to pour wine without removing the cork or letting air into the bottle. It consists of a canister filled with a special gas, designed to take the place of liquid leaving the bottle. The gas consists of argon, which does not mix with anything, and a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor that matches the natural percentages in wine.   Protruding from the center of the canister is a hollow tube with a screw-tip that penetrates the cork. By pulling a handle on the canister's side, Mr. Ellis said, the hollow tip opens up and wine can pour through it. At the same time, he said, the aerosol canister pushes the replacement gas into the bottle through a second tube. As a result, outside air has no way of getting into the container. Mr. Ellis said the device made it possible to preserve a wine indefinitely.   Mr. Ellis, Michael Osean, and Nori Hirako received patent 4,984,711.

We are so grateful for his commitment and immense generosity to low income youth in New York City and Long Island. Horace lived by the philosophy of giving back to the earth and its people in need, through sharing the riches he reaped from its soil. His wife, Amy, and his children--Sue, Kate, Jim, Peter, Paul, and Rob, followed suit and have given generously to the long term education and support of youth (The Miracle-Gro Kids College Education Programs at Project Reach Youth in Brooklyn and in Columbus, Ohio among others). Horace and Amy launched our PASE Youth Network, in Long Island with LI Community Foundation, and Amy is a highly valued member on the Boards of PASE in New York and Long Island. Our thoughts and hearts are with Amy, and the entire Hagedorn family. Janet Kelley, Executive Director Alison Overseth, Board Chair   HAGEDORN--Horace. The Institute for Student Achievement mourns the passing of Horace Hagedorn, great friend, longtime board member and life director, generous supporter. A savvy and sweet man who believed ''You have to keep putting something back,'' Horace gave back in so many ways to ISA, offering his wisdom in service as a board member, his generosity by sponsoring ISA's program for underserved students at Roosevelt Jr/Sr High School, his steadfastness through an unwavering support to the Institute's vital mission and programs. His thoughtfulness and optimism will live on in the hundreds of students who graduated thanks to his philanthropy and great spirit. His memory will live on in the sense of honor, vitality and hope he wore so jauntily and shared so selflessly. Our deepest and most heartfelt sympathies go out to his wife Amy and the children.

Hofstra University is profoundly saddened by the death of long-time supporter and philanthropist Horace Hagedorn. Throughout the years, Mr. Hagedorn was a generous and supportive friend to Hofstra and the entire Long Island community. The generosity of Horace and Amy Hagedorn, combined with a grant from New York State, enabled Hofstra to completely renovate the former federal courthouse, named Hagedorn Hall in 2003, which houses the School of Education and Allied Human Services. In tribute to the memory of Horace Hagedorn, all Hofstra University flags have been lowered to half staff. Salvatore F. Sodano Chairman, Board of Trustees Stuart Rabinowitz President Hofstra University   HAGEDORN -- Horace. Project Reach Youth, Inc. salutes the life of a champion and mourns his death. We are deeply saddened that Horace Hagedorn who has given so much to our Brooklyn community has died. It was Horace and his family that fertilized a garden of fifty low-income youth and their families (Miracle Gro Kids Program) to make a college education ''a promise not a dream.'' He did it with the power of kindness, generosity, and conviction. He truly put back into the soil what he took out. He will be truly missed. David Puth, Board Chair Mark Gibbel, Board President Robert Madison, Exec. Dir.   HAGEDORN -- Horace. He brought beauty to our landscape, then enriched it with endless acts of charity. Ever frugal, never flamboyant, he favored charities whose expenses were low, to maximize the impact of his gifts. For us he was special, always testing our skills, but when he called us ''friend'' we knew we had done well. His memory endures in his legacy of giving and through his wonderful family who carry on his tradition of ''always putting back something, not simply taking.'' We will miss him.
