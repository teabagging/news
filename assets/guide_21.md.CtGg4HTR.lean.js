From the fifth to the third century B.C., the city-states of Greece led the world in art, philosophy, political culture, and science. Greece vied with the Persian Empire for control of Asia Minor and competed with the Phoenicians in maritime commerce in the Mediterranean. Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia, spread Greek civilization widely by conquering much of the Middle East and western Asia, but his empire did not long outlast his death in 323 B.C. Greece was absorbed into the Roman Empire during the second and first centuries B.C. In the fourth century A.D., with the division of the Roman Empire, Greece became part of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire. Seven years after the Ottoman Turks captured Constantinople in 1453, they overran Greece and ruled it as part of the Ottoman Empire for 350 years. Under Ottoman rule, much of the administration of Greece was left in local hands, keeping alive a sense of Greek nationhood and a tradition of Greek leadership, particularly through the clergy of the Greek Orthodox church. Inspired by the French Revolution, a romanticized ideal of the classical past, and the tradition of Greek orthodoxy, in 1821 Greece rebelled against Turkish rule. With the support of England, France, and Russia, Greek independence was won in 1827, although the country included only about half of its present territory. The Western powers sponsored a monarchical government in Greece, ruled by a German prince. Deposed in a revolt, he was succeeded by King George I, a Danish prince who ruled from 1863 until his assassination in 1913. In the three Balkan Wars of 1912, 1913, and 1914, Greece expanded its borders to reach approximately its present size. In 1923 a Greek Republic was established, but in 1935 King George II returned to his throne, placing government control in the hands of the patriotic but authoritarian Gen. Ioannis Metaxas. In 1940 Metaxas resisted Italy's attempt to conquer Greece, defeating Mussolini's armies so badly that Hitler sent crack troops to his ally's assistance. The German occupation of Greece was complete by June 1941. The Germans pillaged the country and massacred Jews; their Bulgarian allies colonized Macedonia. During World War II, resistance grew among both Communist and anti-Communist groups. With the German withdrawal in October 1944, resistance groups battled each other; this led to full-scale civil war by 1946. British, and then American assistance (under the Truman Doctrine), enabled the Greek government to defeat the Communist forces when Stalin refused to intervene. King George II died in 1947, succeeded by his brother, King Paul I. Political instability—16 governments during 1946–52—prevailed until, under American pressure, the Greeks adopted a new constitution. Until the postwar period, Greece's economy had been dominated by agriculture and livestock raising. Industry was limited largely to textiles and food processing; shipping was the major service industry. Under policies instituted in 1952 by the government of Marshall Alexander Papagos, the industrial sector led a period of vigorous economic growth lasting into the 1960's. A market-oriented economy, tariff protection for Greek industry, tight internal security, and close ties with the West formed the mainstays of Greek policy. Greece joined NATO in 1951, as did Turkey. Conflict over Cyprus divided the two nominal allies, however. The failure of the government of Constantine Karamanlis to resolve the Cyprus situation eroded his popularity, and he was replaced in 1964 by George Papandreou, who governed at the head of a left-center coalition. King Constantine, who succeeded his father in 1963, forced Papuan to resign in 1964, after he and members of his government were accused of various improprieties. A military coup, led by Col. George Papadopoulos, toppled the government in 1967. A countertop by King Constantine failed, and the king fled the country. A military dictatorship ruled from 1967 to 1974. Its failed attempt to intervene in Cyprus in 1974 provoked a Turkish invasion of the island and led to the military regime's collapse. Karamanlis headed the government once again and a republic was established with the promulgation of a new constitution in 1975. Karamanlis's New Democracy party again received a majority in parliamentary elections in 1977. Greece, an associate member of the EEC since 1961, became a full member in 1981. Full military membership in NATO was restored in 1980. In 1981 the Paneled Socialist Movement under Andreas Papandreou won a parliamentary majority, renewed in 1984. The left-wing Papandreou government was outspokenly anti-NATO, anti-EEC, and anti-American, but its policy was more moderate than its rhetoric, extending even to modest cooperation with Turkey in the Aegean. The Papandreou government was shaken by several pro-Palestinian terrorist incidents in Greece, and by a scandal involving the married Papandreou's relationship with a younger woman. During 1989–90 Greece struggled through three parliamentary elections in less than a year. In the first two, no major party won a clear victory, leading to weak, short-lived coalition governments. The third, in the spring of 1990, resulted in a slim majority for the New Democracy party (headed by Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis) and the apparent decline of Papandreou's stature. But Papandreou strengthened his grip on power in October 1993, leading his PASO party to a landslide (47%) victory over the New Democrats (39%), as Greek voters expressed their displeasure with Intestacies's deficit-cutting “austerity” policies. Papandreou returned to office promising salary and pension increases and a halt to privatization. But serious illness forced him to resign in January 1996. His successor, Costas Simitis, promised to speed up the stalled privatization program, and his new cabinet removed most Papandreou loyalists. Elections later that year gave PASO a smaller majority. Greece's economy failed to meet the E.G.'s criteria for participating in the European Monetary Union in 1998, but the door was kept open for 2002. New tensions with Turkey over Cyprus, however, threatened to erupt into serious conflict during mid-year. Domestic discontent at what appeared to be Greek assistance in the Turks's capture of Kurdish rebel leader Ocala in Nairobi led to a shakeup in the Semitics cabinet in Feb. 1999 but in March, government investigators were recommending trials for 18 Greek officials accused of assisting Ocala's flight from the Turks. In 1999 and 2000 a series of improvements occurred in Greek-Turkish relations: reciprocal earthquake assistance, agreements on sales of electricity (to Turkey) and water (to Cyprus, both Greek and Turkish, from Turkey) and foreign ministers' accords on crime, immigration, commerce, tourism and the Aegean environment. Greece even agreed to support Turkey's admission to the E.G. In April 2000, in Greece's closest parliamentary elections, PASO became the first Greek party to win three consecutive elections. The success of the government's austerity program led the E.G. to approve Greece's joining the A.M. in early 2001.

Filmed in New York, Chicago and Rome, the scenes of much of the Little Nun's work with the Order of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart, the picture traces her charitable and evangelistic activities among New York's impoverished immigrants and in the founding of sixty-seven hospitals, orphanages, schools and convents.Included are re-enactments of her days at Columbus Hospital, which she helped establish here, and Columbus Hospital in Chicago, where she died in 1917. Touched upon as one of the miracles attributed to Mother Cabrini is the healing of the infant, Peter Smith, while another, the miraculous healing of the stricken Sister Delfina, is dramatized at length. Scenes in New York of Cabrini Boulevard and the Chapel of Mother Cabrini High School, where Mother Cabrini's body can be seen, as well as newsreel footage of the Twenty-eighth Eucharistic Congress in Chicago and her beatification in Rome in 1938, also are included.

Well, the answer is: the Kosliks.At least, that is, according to \\"Marketa Lazarova,\\" a Czechoslovak film of epic grasp and butter fingers playing today and tomorrow at noon and midnight at the First Avenue Screening Room.\\"Marketa Lazarova\\" is a colossal—and very nearly interminable—hodgepodge of medieval mayhem and myth, leaden symbolism and bloated piety directed by Frantisek Vlacil and photographed by Bedrich Batka as though they had taken vows to supersede the dictionary as the ultimate source of definition for the word \\"excess.\\"As for the Kosliks, and the pageant of brutish half-wits who people their retinue, they are a 13th-century Bohemian clan of such unmitigated savagery that next to them the Visigoths would resemble a Red Cross mercy mission.For a Koslik, nothing is too bad. Robbery, murder, kidnapping, rape and incest are to the list of Koslik baseness what two handkerchiefs, a couple of undershirts and a pair of socks are to a Sears, Roebuck catalogue.The business of \\"Marketa Lazarova\\" originates from the kidnapping of a young German traveler named Christian, who is destined to become a bishop—if the Kosliks do not gut him first. This leads in turn to the kidnapping and rape of the daughter of the Kosliks' smarmy neighbor, Lazar. The daughter, Marketa, as pious as she is beauteous, is headed for the nun's life, until carried off and ravished by one of the Koslik boys, Nikolas, while Christian yields up his virtue to one of the Koslik girls, Alexandra.All this ruttishness to the neglect of fouler deeds so enrages old man Koslik that he forces its addicts to sleep chained on the ground outside his redoubt during the melty season.The melty season is one of the two seasons during which the action of \\"Marketa Lazarova\\" takes place. The other season is the snowy season, and sometimes the seasons change every five minutes.During the snowy season the camera never misses a chance to show stark figures against the white landscape or the shadow of a horse against the snow. During the melty season, the sun slants through bare branches onto the forest floor. Sometimes it snows during the melty season, mainly when snow will look good on someone's face or hair.During both seasons, the camera likes to peep at everyone through slats or closing doors, and occasionally it wanders down a corridor in search of a good-looking shadow. Sometimes it goes looking for a symbol. Snakes, hawks and stags are favorites.Busy though it is, the camera finds time for other things. The High Sheriff mounts a campaign against the Kosliks","excerpt":"nuns sing; a holy man wanders over the landscape accompanied by a lamb until the lamb encounters the Kosliks and is served for dinner. The holy man then acquires a goat, which wanders off while he is attempting to induce Marketa to wander the world with him.Marketa, by this time, is a pregnant widow, her lover having been skewered while attempting to free old man Koslik from prison. With the old man in attendance, the High Sheriff marries Marketa to Nikolas who thereupon keeps a long overdue date with the local headsman. Christian's love, Alexandra, is also pregnant. Christian is also dead, having been rewarded for searching for Alexandra after her father's capture by having her dash his brains out with a handy rock.A postscript to all this tells us that the children of Marketa and Alexandra were boys, and in them — and in the generations of mankind that followed them—were mixed both love and cruelty.\\"Marketa Lazarova\\" is a lesson to us all.

A sense of incompletion, not to mention evasiveness, pervades the piece.    Nevertheless, there is more than enough here to fascinate not only lovers of dance, but also students of human nature. Relaxing on his own island off Italy, a property once owned by the dancer and choreographer Leonid Massine, Nureyev talks about himself, sometimes candidly, more often warily. Born in 1938, the son of Muslim Tatars, he grew up in Ufa, a small town between Moscow and Siberia. His childhood is recalled in terms of Dickensian poverty. He speaks of having to go to school without shoes and wearing his older sister's clothes.

Something about the underworld, and the seasons changing because she ate some seeds? You'll want to remember the specifics -- and what to do when garnet-red juice splatters all over the kitchen -- once you begin exploring this season's cookbooks. You'll find history and plenty of recipes, but no stain remover.    The publishing event of the year, if not the decade, is the OXFORD COMPANION TO FOOD (Oxford University, $60), 20 years in the writing and 15 years overdue. Alan Davidson, the legendarily learned (and eccentric) former British diplomat and international authority on seafood, a co-founder of the Oxford Food Symposia and godfather to food scholars around the world, has written most of the 2,650 entries, in itself a stupendous feat, and edited the essays of the 50 or so other contributors. Everyone seriously interested in food must own this book, and everyone seriously interested in food will be arguing about it for longer than Davidson took to write it. ''The Oxford Companion to Food'' won't supplant other essential references, like Harold McGee's ''On Food and Cooking'' and the Larousse Gastronomique (in French, of course). There are no recipes or photographs, and only a few line drawings","excerpt":"nutritional information is scanted; you must know the English name to find an entry, even when a foreign name is more commonly used; and Davidson's idiosyncratic interests and style prevent the book from being fully authoritative. The clear bias is British, in choice of information as well as in grammar and style. But, ah, the British glories! They start with meticulous attention to botany, taxonomy and etymology in addition to history and continue with prose that is often delightfully prejudiced and wry; Davidson also generously quotes from other witty and learned scholars. Much as I enjoyed going through the dozens of new fall food books, it was impossible to resist turning back to Davidson whenever my other reading gave me an excuse, and naturally one entry led to another (say, ''pomegranate''). So I didn't make much of a dent in the second edition of the OXFORD COMPANION TO WINE (Oxford University, $65), edited by the sterling Jancis Robinson, also just published and of similar heft. My curiosity was always piqued by Davidson -- and my hackles were frequently raised. ''The Oxford Companion to Food'' is a great achievement.
