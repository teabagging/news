And though the ever-deepening story takes its name from Edith Hahn-Beer's autobiographical 1999 book, &quot;The Nazi Officer's Wife: How One Jewish Woman Survived the Holocaust,'' questions of identity - and the continual submersion of self to stay alive - are the heart of the story. &quot;Edith Hahn willed herself to disappear,'' says the narrator, Susan Sarandon. It is a bewitching and harrowing tale, told by the woman who survived the impostures in which she cloaked herself. The narrative has the engrossing folds and twists of a novel. Hahn-Beer loses her true love to cowardice, her mother to the Nazis. Years later, she gains a family of her own, after assuming the identity of an Aryan she knew years earlier. She burrows so completely into this falsehood that she marries a kind German, who's also a Nazi sympathizer. (By the end of the war, he's drafted and she takes on the absurd and frightening position of the title of her book.) And she so deeply sublimates her feisty, fiery personality in playing the role of a compliant wife that she comes to love her second existence. Finally, what threatens to become a life sentence of self-abnegation is commuted because the man who loved Hahn-Beer and abandoned her earlier persuaded the young woman into hiding her real identity papers in the lining of a book. Despite the dramatic sweep of her life, the actual threat of extermination for Hahn-Beer, a law student in her late 20's who endured in Nazi Germany by secreting away much of herself, gives the movie a grave, transfixing air of real-life existentialism. — Elvis Mitchell A Woman Who Hides in Plain Sight From the Nazis"},{"year":"2002","title":"APPLIED MICROSYSTEMS TO LIQUIDATE ITS ASSETS","excerpt":"IDENTIX WILL MISS FORECAST; SHARES FALL;.

A3    U.S. Cancels Contract in Iraq  The Army Corps of Engineers said it had canceled the work remaining on a $70 million project to restore hospitals in Iraq, deepening a dispute with one of the largest American contractors operating in Baghdad and threatening a United States-led effort to improve Iraqi health care.

A1    A New Press Secretary  Tony Snow, the new White House press secretary, had a rough first morning briefing with the press corps, demonstrating that being a talking head for the Bush administration is quite different from being a talking head for Fox News.   A14    C.I.A.

But there are already clear signs that the dust, smoke and ash that responders breathed in have led to an increase in lung diseases.   A1    Prisoners and Elections  A federal appeals court ruling hinted that counting prisoners as residents of rural districts instead of the urban neighborhoods where they last lived may illegally dilute the votes of downstate New Yorkers. If that argument is pursued and upheld, it could upend the slim Republican majorities in the state legislature and in Washington.   B1    SPORTSSATURDAY   D1-7    New Record in 100 Meters  Justin Gatlin broke the world record in the 100 meters at a Grand Prix meet in Doha, Qatar. Gatlin, a 24-year-old native of Brooklyn, broke the record with a time of 9.76 seconds in the final. That took a hundredth of a second off the mark set by Asafa Powell of Jamaica last June 14 in Athens.

B7    BUSINESS DAY   C1-9    U.S. Spending May Wane  Warmer weather, higher wages and brisk hiring lifted spirits and spending by Americans during the first few months of the year, but that upbeat mood appears clouded lately by rising gasoline prices, a cooling housing market and higher interest rates, economic reports suggested.   C1    Dell's Classic Business Plan  Dell is sharply reducing prices again, as it has done during slowdowns in demand for personal computers. But some think the strategy will not work this time because competitors like Hewlett-Packard, Levono and Acer have made strides in tightening their supply chains and trimming Dell's cost advantage.

Von Freeman, the 71-year-old tenor saxophonist now at the Village Vanguard, is exactly that, idiosyncratic. He has lived in Chicago most of his life, and he sounds like it. His playing clearly has precedents, but in its distinctiveness, it can only have come from a place where jazz orthodoxy wasn't everything, where musicians had the time to experiment.   If the best jazz musicians have generally been able to muster the most resources, to bring the greatest rhetoric to bear on expression, then Mr. Freeman is a master. A solo of his, on up-tempo material, careens. He crams ideas into a short time then stops. The most noticeable element of his style is his manipulation of pitch, and he runs lines that seem to be paraphrasing some otherworldly harmony, dark sounds technically out of tune that slip quietly back into the normalcy of a tune's harmony. He pinches and squeezes notes, and lets them be soft for a minute, or hard for another. Sometimes he has notes run up his horn then lets squeals take over, howls that meander back into the realm of notes. And at times, he seems to be forcing three or four notes through his horn at once, a woolly mass that appears less as a pitch than just plain sound.

On both counts, Judge Posner, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, turned thumbs down on the poison-pill strategy that corporations use to make it punitively expensive for acquisition-minded companies to swallow them. Although Judge Posner did not say all poison pills were illegal, he ordered the CTS Corporation, an electronics manufacturer based in Elkhart, Ind., not to employ its particular version. The judge declared, among other things, that CTS's poison pill would weaken the company by greatly increasing its debt - even risking insolvency - as a way to make CTS unpalatable to its suitor: the Dynamics Corporation of America, a diversified industrial company based in Greenwich, Conn.

DARE's interviewers put this question to hundreds of Americans across the country: ''When you suspect that somebody is trying to deceive you, or that something is going on behind your back, you say, 'There's ...'?'' Twenty-one respondents came up with ''There's a dead cat on the line.''   In speculative explanation, Lexicographic Irregulars told DARE that the phrase originated to describe (1) third party eavesdropping on a party line, (2) a ''line dance,'' when the movements of a stranger were ''dead'' because he did not know the local steps and (3) an abandoned Caterpillar tractor that had been used to lay a gas pipeline.

Part of the reason why lawyers get more out of product liability suits than the injured parties do, at least according to the insurance data, is that the rules of liability vary so widely from state to state, and even from judge to judge, that neither the manufacturers who make the products nor the lawyers who bring the cases know exactly what standards they will be held to.   No two states have the same product liability laws. But in most states, the basic concepts of product liability have in recent years been expanded dramatically, sometimes to the point where the question of fault is eliminated entirely.

We took a stopwatch into the kitchen at Hugo's restaurant in Portland, Me., where a single entree -- rabbit with tripe ravioli, spring-dug parsnips and fava beans -- is seven days in the making (and more than six hours of hands-on cooking).    Make no mistake: Speed is essential in a professional kitchen. Hugo's chef, Rob Evans, can take apart three rabbit carcasses in less than an hour, teasing out the tiny rib chops, thinning the flanks and placing the hind legs in salt for confit with remarkable confidence and delicacy.

Customers elbowed their way up to the cash registers with armfuls of CDs, spending $150 to $200 apiece. So much for any lingering signs of the record industry's sales doldrums.

He feels it gives his clothes the energy of sports, though Ghesquière, the son of a former swimming coach and golf-course manager, isn't athletic himself. He is slight of build, with black hair, fashionable stubble and light-blue eyes that essentially tell you everything, from intense interest to rapid disenchantment. Last March, after his fall show -- a streak of camel coats and jackets piped in fur that put editors in a good mood and announced a more mature sensibility -- Ghesquière was backstage greeting guests. Among the first to arrive was François-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of the French luxury and retail group Pinault-Printemps-Redoute and technically Ghesquière's boss. As a rule, backstage moments yield little information","excerpt":"if anything, they tend to reinforce the impression that the fashion world is insincere, the tepid congratulations offered in exchange for an advertising page. But in the several minutes that Ghesquière and Pinault talked with each other, with Pinault speaking quietly and without gesture, it was apparent that the warmth between the two men was genuine.    Five years ago, Ghesquière had the fashion world in the palm of his hand, his ultrathin pants and romantic high-necked tops defining a generation of sullen waifs as surely as Saint Laurent's pea coat and saharienne projected the battle lines of the late 1960's. ''I do worship his pants,'' gushed the girl of that moment, Chloë Sevigny, in Vogue in March 2001, saying that once she found his pants, ''my life definitely got a lot better.'' That summer Gucci bought Balenciaga, securing, it seemed, the future of the house as well as that of the then-30-year-old Ghesquière. Finally he would have the financial support of a big luxury group and the brand know-how of its chief executive, Domenico de Sole, and creative director, Tom Ford. Then came Sept. 11, transforming everybody's sense of security. Within a year of the Gucci deal, Ghesquière had acquired a reputation for being difficult. It was said he refused to work with certain Gucci Group executives. It was said he snubbed Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, by not showing up at one of her events. It definitely did not help his reputation as fashion's new messiah when he was caught copying, line for line, a patchwork vest by the late Kaisik Wong, a California designer of the 70's.

First, defending champion Monica Seles advanced to her second consecutive final here by administering a 6-4, 6-1 thrashing to Sabatini under a sprinkling sky this afternoon at Roland Garros Stadium. Then, 1989 champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario wreaked even greater havoc on the game and composure of Graf, a two-time champion here, eliminating her by 6-0, 6-2. It was the worst defeat of Graf's professional career, and one for which she had no explanation other than an untimely absence of rapport with her tennis racquet.  Seles Holds the Edge     Seles and Sanchez Vicario will meet Saturday in the final. They have met four times previously, with Seles holding a 4-0 edge. The most recent Seles victory came on clay in straight sets in the semifinals at Hamburg, Germany, this spring.    In the men's semifinals Friday, Andre Agassi will face Boris Becker and Jim Courier opposes Michael Stich. If Agassi and Courier win, they will produce the first all-American final since 1954","excerpt":"if Becker and Stich prevail they will produce the first all-German final ever.   Graf not only appeared disengaged during the match, but behaved similarly after it: she seemed more bewildered and bemused than distressed by a match in which she committed 51 errors and managed to hold her serve only twice.    \\"I couldn't get a ball inside the court,\\" said Graf, whose only previous loss to the 19-year-old Spaniard in 11 meetings came on this same court in the 1989 final. \\"I lost a few games and my confidence went down; everything I did didn't work, and I'd never had that happen before. I tried to keep the ball in play, it didn't work. I tried to hit the ball, it didn't work.\\"    Graf's absolute disassociation from her surroundings was nowhere more evident than the moment late in the second set where, winding up for an overhead smash at netside with Sanchez Vicario far out of position, Graf slammed the ball into the alley.   The loss prevented the 21-year-old German, who had not lost a Grand Slam set by 6-0 since 1983, from immediately recapturing the No. 1 position held by Seles and also extended her streak without a victory in Grand Slam events to five. But by a quirk of the ratings computer, should Sanchez Vicario defeat Seles in the final, Graf will slip back into the top spot.  'Strange to Be No. 1'     \\"It's strange to be No. 1; it's different to be No. 1,\\" said Seles, \\"and if I keep winning my matches I'll stay No. 1, but being No. 1 is not a great excitement like when you win a Grand Slam. I want both, but I don't want all that pressure.\\"    The sour weather caused two interruptions of the match, and after the second rain delay, which occurred with the players caught in a dead heat at 4-4 of the first set, Sabatini appeared to forget to bring her tennis game back onto center court and lost seven quick games in succession.    Sanchez Vicario, who had promised an uninhibited game plan against Graf and delivered it, packed her shots with topspin and aimed for the sidelines right from the first point of the match.   As invisible as Sabatini was in the second set of her match, Graf was even less of a factor in the opening set of hers, and a 43-minute rain delay did not refresh her confidence.   Although Graf was a virtual nonpresence today, her father, Peter, attracted interest in the stands when he scuffled with Jim Levee, an heir to the Annenberg fortune who counts Seles and Sanchez Vicario among the handful of female players he sponsors. Levee's association with the Graf family ended on unfriendly terms several years ago. Levee, who was unhurt, contended that Graf shoved him as both men went up a stadium aisle while Sanchez Vicario served for the first set. Graf said Levee insulted his daughter; Levee said Graf manhandled him, and Levee later exchanged unpleasantries with Pavel Slozil, Graf's coach, vowing to bring bodyguards to Wimbledon for the sake of menacing Graf.    \\"I heard about it from my mother,\\" said Graf, \\"but I have no idea what happened and I really don't care.\\"    MATCH POINTS    None of the four men's semifinalists are averse to serving and volleying, and although ANDRE AGASSI and JIM COURIER prefer the baseline, both have taken pains to rely on more than their blunt groundstrokes.    \\"It's not a power tournament,\\" said BORIS BECKER, who has never advanced beyond the semifinal round. \\"There are always players who can only play well on clay, but if you look at the last 10 years, the winner could always play on other courts. To win here you need more than a high spinning ball.\\" Graf Bewildered; Sabatini Bothered"},{"year":"1929","title":"Secret cabal formed while Lenin lived believed beginning of Trotsky's fall TROTSKY REVEALS ORIGIN OF HIS FALL","excerpt":"If Began With a Secret Cabal Formed by Stalin Even While Lenin Lined, He Says.

If purchased in the United States with an international ticket, the fare is $940 (in United States funds)","excerpt":"if bought in Australia, within two weeks of arrival and on presentation of a passport and international ticket, it is $1,038, but additional stopovers may be included.   Making arrangements before leaving home, the airlines say, means a guaranteed seat and the advantage of being able to alter a reservation, if necessary, after arriving in Australia. Both airlines offer See Australia tickets and the Airpass, which can mean savings of up to 40 per cent, depending on the distance flown within Australia.    An Airpass covers one of eight routes popular with overseas visitors, and it is 30 percent off the regular fare. With See Australia, also 30 percent off, a visitor may choose any sector not covered by the Airpass. Travelers may also buy a combination of both passes.   Since deregulation in November the airlines have discounted some fares, but the Australian Tourism Industry Association has complained that with only a few discounted seats on each flight, the cheaper fares are not available to most passengers. The airlines say that, while limited, discounted seats can be purchased. The cheaper fares are mostly tied to conditions similar to those applying in the United States for discounted flights. Qantas, United, American, Air New Zealand, Canadian Airlines and Continental all fly the South Pacific route to Australia and sell the See Australia tickets and Air Pass in conjunction with the international ticket.

But they are often disappointed because, despite the great promise, most mergers and acquisitions fail to meet expectations. A 1988 study by McKinsey & Company, for instance, found that most companies would have profited more by banking their money instead of buying another company.

(Actually, the ocean to which Strachey referred was the entire Victorian Age, of which his four subjects in ''Eminent Victorians'' were meant to be peculiarly representative.)     I'll admit that my biography of Richard Yates is, let's face it, too damn long, and I can only feel relieved that Atlas never saw my first draft. Talk about a cinder block! Appalled, I spent quite a while whittling away every expendable syllable, as I saw it, and still ended up with a book that was 613 pages (not including notes and index).     ''Yates is not Yeats,'' Atlas writes, meaning Yates is not worthy of the 500-page-plus star treatment. Fair enough. But Atlas commends the earlier English tradition of writing about a subject simply because the subject is interesting to a given author, and for my part I can only insist that Yates -- a canonical if neglected fiction writer, and also Robert Kennedy's speechwriter at the height of the civil rights movement, a pioneering consumer of psychotropic drugs, as well as the subject of a hilarious ''Seinfeld'' episode -- is endlessly fascinating to me. And though I may have trawled the old net a bit, I don't think I fail to convey this fascination in my book, or so the reviewers for the daily and Sunday New York Times would have me believe, God bless them.     Finally, I disagree that it's necessarily helpful to have known one's subject personally. Yes, Boswell followed Dr. Johnson up and down London and the Hebrides and got all those nice details about his lopsided wig and so forth","excerpt":"if I'd done the same with Yates, I'd be dead of drink and secondhand smoke by now.     But really my point is this: In person, Yates probably would have shown me his charming, courtly side -- he was a gentleman, after all, and knew how to comport himself around shifty biographer types -- and hence I might have underestimated his loutishness, and yes, his decency too. In short, I preferred to sift objectively through the evidence, in all its vast contrariness, and let the chips fall as they may.

Petruchio is oft Doug and Katherina is not seldom mindful of the pursed-lipped Mary of years gone by on the screen. Yet if it be entertainment one seeks, here it is","excerpt":"if it be that one desires merriment to help the digestion, one cannot do better than hie himself with his company to look at and listen to these voluble shadows, who mix it up occasionally in a way that is like modern slapstickers.But it should be borne in mind that this story, written by the Bard near the Avon and transcribed to the screen somewhere in the vicinity of the Los Angeles River, is mounted with little thought as to expense. It is a jovial affair, shortened, 'tis true, because duplication of action might be tedious in a film and also because too much footage of film would be necessary to give every speech of the Shakespearean characters.Katherina here in the early scenes is more mad then she was ever intended to be. She not only wields a mighty whip and hurls furniture at those who arouse her ire (which, be it known, is not difficult to do), but she shatters mirrors, windows and what not. And, arrayed in a black velvet gown of considerable length, this Katherina looks almost equal to the tempestuous acts. It is no small wonder that her father, the good-natured and fearful Baptista of Padua, should desire first to get rid of the ill-natured Katherina as a wife to some man before he consents to his meek daughter, Bianca, being betrothed!The cheery Petruchio and his servant, Grumio, arrive, unsuspecting, at the Padua home of Baptista. Grumio has heard much, too much, of the shrew Katherina and his gentle warnings to his master are like whispers in a tornado, for soon Petruchio, with the spirit of deviltry, enters into the bargain to marry Katherina. He soon knows that she has a temper, but it encourages him to continue his suit, aye, even to cuddle and embrace her on the wide flight of steps in her home. And this to Katherina's evident annoyance.The wedding day is pictured with fine fun. Katherina is taking matters seriously, having arrayed herself as a bride for the ceremony. They wait, but no word or sign of Petruchio. Finally, word comes, to the relief of all present, that he is in the offing. He is then seen on his spavined nag, an animal bent, broad and big. As a headgear Petruchio, to exasperate the shrewish bride-to-be, wears a jack-boot, and he is otherwise oddly clad. He does not even then hasten to the altar; instead he leans against a wall munching an apple with strange delight. Katherina's eyes fix him, but he merely gives her a cheery wave of the hand and continues biting his apple to the core. Then, as he approaches the woman who is to be his wedded wife \\"until death do them part,\\" he hands the apple core to Gremio, who knows not what to do with it. The minister is timid, only too glad that the Veronese jokester is at last ready to kneel for the ceremony.It is on his \\"hipped horse\\" that Petruchio insists on carrying his bride that night through a Hollywood deluge of rain to his abode in Verona. And at the gates, with hogs feeding in the mud, the hitherto fiery Kate is tossed into a water puddle find slimy mud. Petruchio persists in calling her Kate and soon the festive board before a fire is decorated with viands and fruit, Kate eagerly waiting to be pressed to eat a bite. But no such suggestion comes from the artful Petruchio. He bends over a bowl of food and grabbing with his hands, he gollops down meat and a liver. Trembling with the cold and the wetness, Kate stands obdurate. Eventually she comes to the table and would likewise satisfy the cravings of as fine an appetite as any woman ever had after keeping to the eighteen-day diet of Hollywood. Petruchio wills, however, that his noted shrew shall not only go to bed hungry but that she shall also suffer the torments of a sleepless night. So far as food is concerned, he cannot permit Kate to partake of burned mutton, for that is conducive of choler!One hears and sees the determined master of the house telling his plans for keeping Kate awake to his huge dog; but here Petruchio has not counted upon the ravenous Kate listening atop the stairs. Hence, when Petruchio blusters into the bed-chamber, his rowdy conduct has no effect upon the woman. Subsequently, however, Kate is forced to admit that she's awake and she goes her husband one better at every turn. When he opens a window, she pretends to be delighted and opens another window. When he pulls the cover and the bolster from the bed, Kate pulls off the mattress.And so this film goes on until the erstwhile shrew becomes even more docile than her sister Bianca, harkening to the beck and call of her spouse and enjoying it.Edwin Maxwell is capital as Baptista and Joseph Cawthorn is equally good as Gremio. Clyde Cook, the clown of old, does very well as the timid Grumio.Mr. Fairbanks does not permit any Shakespearean vehicle to stay him from vaulting here and there and also demonstrating what he can do on horseback. He is likeable and well-spoken. Miss Pickford is delightful in her fits of fury and also in those moments when she hankers after food and trembles at Petruchio's wrath.It is a film that makes for a thoroughly happy evening or afternoon.

His 15-year-old partner in crime is daring him to climb an immense ladder to nowhere, taunting him with scornful clucking.

That tension -- entangling and implicating the audience -- is sustained throughout this burning one-hour show, which was inspired by the 1994 trial of two Melbourne teenagers who killed a passing motorist by kicking rocks off a freeway overpass. Working like street clowns with the sparest of means, the two performers (never given names) abuse each other with a foul, funny ''South Park'' patois and jam -- expertly -- on electric guitars, pumping themselves up for trouble, providing a thrilling soundtrack for rebellion.

So far as we know, it is the first foreign film dealing with American history and, although the deal is off the bottom, with the cards marked in Sweden's favor, the important thing is the deal itself. We have grown so used to our cinematic glorifications of foreign triumphs that it comes as a blessed shock to find ourselves on the receiving end for once.At the Fifth Avenue Playhouse you will discover, among other things, that Sweden won the Civil War for the North. John Ericsson, you see, invented the Monitor and Karl Petterson, another Swede, put the double charges into its guns that drove the Merrimac to cover. Hence, although you might have been led to believe that a fellow named U. S. Grant had something to do with it, the evidence here I??? points to a two-man Swedish ???victory.

Q. E. D. and Skaal! (or is that an exclusively Norwegian toast?)Directed by Victor Seastrom, who used to ply his trade in Hollywood, and with Mr. Seastrom in the title role, the picture has certain fascinating attributes. Not the least of them is that every one talks Swedish, a language of hill and dale intonation, which flows hilariously from the lips of Southern darkies, General Lee, a company of Union naval officers and such Irish-American miscellany as Lieutenant Ker???gam, Mr. Mallory, Miss Mallory ???and Mrs. Cassidy. When Abraham ???coln appeared, we held our ???breath, but Honest Abe wasn't talking, not in Svensk.Technically, the picture is well up to the Hollywood standards, and the mayers—barring the natural incongruities which occasionally arise—are first-rate. But it's the principle, ???not the principal, of the product that counts. As a good-will gesture, inspired by the tercentenary of the first Swede's landing in this country, it is wholeheartedly welcomed. After all, it doesn't matter much new who won the Civil War: we are ???all being reconstructed these days.

Along with \\"The Hills of Ireland,\\" a fifty-six-minute travelogue, which has Pat O'Brien as its narrator and the beauty of Ireland as its theme, there is an exquisite little picture of the Sligo country, commemorating W. B. Yeats, and a humorous snatch of conversation with that great Irish spectacle, the late George Bernard Shaw.Of the three Irish items, the most colorful, from a purely chromatic point of view, is \\"The Hills of Ireland,\\" which is got out in straight picture-postcard hues. And the sentiments toward the rambling vistas of lakes, castles, waterfalls, stone ruins and bustling cities of Ireland it generously presents are just about equal to the sentiments that usually flow on postcards.Christopher Lynch, whose musical recordings of such numbers as \\"Killarney\\" and \\"Hills of Donegal\\" are cut in from time to time, has nothing in the way of vocal affection on Mr. O'Brien as he describes the successive magnificence of such scenic spots as the Killarney Lakes and the Vale of Avoca, the Antrim Glens and Dingle Bay. Mr. O'Brien has the attitude of someone you wouldn't want to contradict.And, indeed, the scenery is lovely, the Irish cities are interesting and the endless ruins of holy places merit a bit of chauvinist pride. But the most lively parts of the picture have to do with the natives on the Aran Isles, the Dublin Horse Show (where there is, at least, some action) and even the shots of tourists kissing the Blarney Stone. Like most travelogues, this one suffers from the dead hand of magic-lantern style. Harry Dugan, the gentleman who produced it, should know that snapshot film photography is dull.More evocative in its combination of scenery, music and words is the little film on Yeats which was turned out by the Irish National Film Institute. Mirroring the restless Sligo country in mood-heavy blacks and whites, with the bare and forbidding Ben Bulben dominating the landscape for miles, this picture blends visual beauty with the fervid and melancholy poetry of Yeats, which is eloquently read by Siobhan McKenna and Michael MacLiammoir. Eamonn O. Gallchobhair's music, made with woodwinds in the main, is thoroughly apt.As for the little conversation with Shaw, it has been seen here before, but we mention it mainly because it is humorous, an item we consider essential in a program of films of Ireland.

Unfortunately, Miss Kakutani does not answer this question with any thoughtful evaluation of Mr. Abbott's writings, insisting instead that his early release from prison be viewed within the tradition of the writer's fascination with the man outside the law. I do not dispute Miss Kakutani's analysis of the violence in Norman Mailer's works, or her contention that Mailer and others were subject to a certain romanticism in their desire to set Abbott free from prison. But her selection of quotes from Abbott's book and her analysis of Abbott's life up to the murder of Richard Adan completely ignore the major issue of ''In the Belly of the Beast'': that the American prison system breeds violence in men.Comparing Abbott's life to those of fictitious characters in literature is absurd and off the point","excerpt":"if Miss Kakutani had looked at Abbott's intelligent and heartfelt plea for massive prison reform instead of writing him off as a mere ''hardened criminal,'' she would have seen that Abbott was fully aware and terrified of his own violence.

Bayer came to the Summer Olympics trying to ignore the hopes of his team and his federation that come with winning two World Cup titles in the last year and of being the 12th-ranked foilist in the world. He wanted to prove that an American fencer was the equal of his foreign competition and that he was better than the anxious 19-year-old who lost his first bout at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Bayer had never faced Kim before but was wary of the resilience he had seen when Kim came back from an eight point deficit to win a world championship match. \`\`He was the one guy I really didn't want to face,'' Bayer said. \`\`When I saw him in my bracket, I was nervous. He's smart, really smart.'' In their match today, the second for each man, Bayer was cruising, up 11-7, 13-10, then 14-13. But Kim knotted the bout, then ducked under an attack by Bayer and countered with the final touch. \`\`I'll be seeing that for a long time,'' said Bayer, who works out of the New York Athletic Club and is on a sabbatical from attending the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. \`\`I just missed. It's a heartbreaker.'' Kim, 29, inflicted heartache on three more opponents to win a gold medal, staging riveting, methodical comebacks against Dmitri Chevtchenko in the semifinal and Ralf Bissdorf of Germany in the final. Three of Kim's victories came by 15-14 scores. \`\`I didn't want it that way,'' Kim said through an interpreter. \`\`I want to win from the beginning.'' In fencing, the first to 15 points wins","excerpt":"if no one hits 15, the most touches after three three-minute rounds wins. Athletes are frequently better at executing a strategy rather than explaining it. Throughout his bout with Bissdorf, Kim stalled frequently, doing nothing, avoiding contact while pointing his foil at Bissdorf across the strip, measuring, or maybe, lulling the German. The ploy seemed to give each man a respite, but Kim could only describe it as a defense against a Bissdorf attack. Later, he said his ability to come back against Bayer, Chevtchenko and Bissdorf was by means of a \`\`a skill, where I have to stretch my arm if I'm not as tall as he is. I practiced it for three months. It's an attack. . .a stretch.'' Kim is 5-foot-11, Bissdorf stands 6-2. Whatever it was, it worked, and Bissdorf understood. \`\`He likes to attack and he attacks very well. I do, too,'' he said. \`\`But we didn't attack each other as much because our defenses were so good. Today we had a real good fight. At 14-14, my strategy was not enough. His was excellent.'' Kim may have succeeded because he adapted his style to suit his foe. Against Chevtchenko, he was a Joe Frazier-like plodder, a tough guy repelling the 6-foot-4-inch Russian's trademark running charge, like an irate bull, down the strip. Their bout had all the wondrous excitement of a late-in-the National Basketball Association game Hack-a-Shaq strategy. Against the lean Bissdorf, he seemed to mimick the German's style, as they stretched their scoring into early in the third period. Bissdorf seemed to be in command at 9-6, but Kim rallied with five unanswered touches and stretched the lead to 13-10, before Bissdorf tied Kim at 14. When Kim won the decisive point, his coach rushed onto the stage at the Sydney Exhibition Center and tackled him, while Bissdorf stood to the side, waiting to congratulate him. \`\`I didn't know if I was dreaming,'' Kim said. \`\`I didn't know if it was reality. I thought about my wife, my mother, my son. History was being made. This is the first gold for Korea in the men's individual foil.'' Kim, whose wife fenced until giving birth to their son, had one request to make of the Korean Fencing Association, now that he has a little leverage. Fencing is not widely popular in Korea, and Kim rarely had enough good partners to work with. He's had to travel around Korea from his home in Taejun to stay sharp. In victory, he said, \`\`I ask for more opponents.''

E.L. Souder."},{"year":"1933","title":"IF one had to choose the film star above all others who was France's favorite, it would be fairly safe to pick out Georges Milton. It would also be a fairly safe prediction to make that outside of France's frontiers not one film enthusiast in a million ever heard of M. Milton. In his case one is inclined to accept the obvious deduction that his talent is peculiarly Gallic and that truly to appreciate it one should be French. Certainly, his popularity with the French public does not extend deeply into Paris's American colony.Milton is a comedian, and there is a type of comedy which is not universal. Just as there is something which can be defined as an American sense of humor, so there is a French equivalent. There are jokes that a New Yorker will laugh at heartily but which will bewilder a Frenchman. It is all in the point of view. There was one misguided French critic recently who took Mae West's \\"Lady Lou, She Done Him Wrong,\\" as a perfectly serious melodrama. He roundly denounced it as childish and unbelievable, and held it up as an example of the crudity of Hollywood.Not Limited to Humor.But it seems as if one must be Anglo-Saxon to appreciate such things. It is not always confined to humor either. Not so long ago \\"Rain,\\" with Joan Crawford, played here in the original version, with French subtitles. On the strength of the latter the management of the cinema sought to attract a certain number of French cinemagoers into his audience. In practice it turned out to be a rather unfortunate experience for two reasons. In the first place, \\"Rain\\" is primarily a play with much talking and little action. For a Frenchman who did not understand English there were interminable stretches that must have been sheer boredom. But even more striking than that was the French reaction to what might be called the psychology of the plot. Without going into an extended analysis of the different attitudes of the French and Americans toward the relationship of the two sexes, the fact that there is a profound difference is a truism. The French as a race take a realistic, matter-of-fact attitude which is certainly more natural and probably more mature than the American point of view.It was perfectly obvious that the audiences simply did not understand either Sadie Thompson's sudden conversion or the missionary's bitter struggle with himself against temptation. They did not believe either in Sadie's suddenly acquired virtue or in the sincerity of the clergyman. For them it was a distortion of simple values, and as a result (at least in the performance your correspondent attended) the film was spoiled for every one by hisses, boos and whistling on the part of a dozen or so disgruntled Frenchmen.Knowing the Audience.In the international marketing of talking pictures these racial differences should play a great part. It does seem as if an adviser who knew French audiences could have warned against presenting a picture like \\"Rain\\" to them.All of which brings us back to Georges Milton and his latest film. It would be an exaggeration to say that no American would enjoy it, but there is certainly no denying the fact that no American could possibly enjoy it one-tenth as much as French audiences are doing. The roars and gales of laughter which follow him from beginning to end of the picture are too obviously heartfelt not to be genuine.The title is gorgeous—\\"Nu comme un ver\\" (\\"Naked as a Worm\\")—and is enough in itself to predispose any one to the film. The story was especially written for Milton and he dominates it from beginning to end.It is about a rich young man, Gustave Adam, who stepped into his father's jam factory, became its owner and, as the picture opens, is being decorated by the government as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor for his services to the State. All his friends consider him a lucky man, and tell him so, much to his annoyance. His answer is that it takes talent to keep a jam factory successful and that no matter what circumstance he had started in he would make good. When he is laughed at he makes a bet that he will go into the middle of a field outside of Paris, \\"naked as a worm,\\" and start life all over again and prove that he can win wealth and honors without any help.Adam at Large.So the next morning his friends take him to a field and leave him there, wrapped in a blanket for warmth and with a screen for modesty. The first result of his escapade is that several gendarmes walking along the road come upon him and quite naturally consider him a lunatic, particularly when he tells them he is Adam. Off they take him to an asylum, where despite all his protests he fails to convince any one of his sanity. He regrets his foolishness by then, but it is too late, particularly as he has commanded his servants and friends to make believe they do not know him any more.There is nothing to do but try to escape, and this he manages. After some more vicissitudes, including falling into the hands of the same pair of gendarmes again, he gets a job as waiter in a café. It is there that he finally demonstrates he has a genius for business, saving the proprietor from ruin and gradually building up the establishment until it is phenomenally successful, then going on to bigger and better things, including winning a beautiful baroness as his wife.It is not an unusually original plot, obviously, and everything depends upon Milton. If you like him you will consider the picture excruciatingly funny","excerpt":"if not, it is unfortunate.A Boisterous Farce.The difficulty of putting one's finger down and saying such and such is the reason why this film won't appeal to Americans and that others will, becomes even more obvious in the case of \\"Théodore et Cie\\" (\\"Theodore & Co.\\"), another French film farce which Paris is enjoying. Nothing could be more typically French and yet there is something about it which gives it a wider appeal than \\"Nu comme un ver.\\"It is a broad, boisterous farce, side-splitting, utterly ridiculous and, from an American point of view, frequently risqué, though that side of it wouldn't be noticed here.The plot is altogether too involved to be detailed. Roughly, it is about a scapegrace nephew of a rich merchant, and his rascally partner. This pair is splendidly played by Albert Préjean and Raimu, one of France's \\"grands comiques.\\" They live by their wits, in this story.These were the outstanding pictures in Paris during May and June. There were others that could be written about, but none of them was distinguished. Parisian film houses are showing more and more foreign pictures, particularly American ones, as French production falls off due to the crisis. There has been no improvement in the financial end of the business since the first of the year, and it is showing itself both in the quantity and in the quality of the recent films.

(A female friend of Gregor's actually spits at Jeremiah rather than take his money.) Gregor, an idealist who keeps bees in a car engine and dreams of creating an urban farming project with a community of friends, eventually so overpowers Jeremiah that Jeremiah's car is filled with hay and turned into a chicken coop.

We did not describe this act as censorship because it was not an act of censorship. It was a breach of contract.   Simon & Schuster's contract with Mr. Ellis obligated it to publish his book. Simon & Schuster had at least two opportunities under the contract to decide whether or not the book met its standards of taste:    When the editors read Mr. Ellis's proposal and offered him a contract, and when the manuscript came in, was reviewed and accepted for publication.    Thereafter, Simon & Schuster had no more right to cancel than Mr. Ellis had to announce that he was canceling because he had found another publisher willing to triple his advance.    Book contracts overwhelmingly favor publishers","excerpt":"if publishers begin refusing to honor them, there is little incentive for writers to do so. Mr. Ellis could have sued for breach of contract. Had he done so, there is little doubt he would have won.   The Authors Guild's other concern in this matter was who at Simon & Schuster or Paramount Inc. made the decision to cancel. We fear that it was not Richard Snyder of Simon & Schuster, but Martin Davis of Paramount, which owns Simon & Schuster. This is part of our larger fear that, increasingly, publishing decisions are being made not by publishers, but by corporate managers.   Neither of these issues has anything to do with the content of Mr. Ellis's book. The Authors Guild does not rule on matters of taste and we do not judge which books are fit for publication.

The tale is beyond simple summary and often strains the faith even of the devout, but it is loaded with the weight of symbols and allusions.

(Some critics called the television version a space soap opera","excerpt":"if so, what better confirmation that space flight is being assimilated into everyday life?) And last month, Walter A. McDougal, a Berkeley historian, published ''The Heavens and the Earth,'' the first definitive political history of the space age.   Now, the Public Broadcasting Service has moved to the launching pad a documentary, ''Spaceflight,'' covering the history of space exploration from the early theorists, visionaries and rocket pioneers through the dramatic moon landings to the flights of the space shuttle and the prospects of star wars. The first of the four hour-long segments will be shown Wednesday evening at 8 on Channel 13.

For now, to their considerable list of celebrated screen biographies, which have reported upon the careers of such renowned men as Louis Pasteur, Emile Zola, Dr. Ehrlich and Juarez, they have added the life story of an American football coach. And in \\"Knute Rockne—All American,\\" which opened yesterday at the Strand, they have demonstrated their universality, too, by regarding the subject with as much reverential respect and intimations of immortality as was accorded their previous biographees.This unstinted estimation of Mr. Rockne—this generous inclination to make, for instance, the development of his famous backfield shift appear as historically momentous on the screen as the discovery of salvarsan—may seem a slight extravagance to some. But for dyed-in-the-wool football fans and alumni of Notre Dame, whether they be of the genuine or just plain \\"subway\\" variety, this glowing, heroic account of the great coach's life and noble works will be much more than entertainment. It will be an effective inspiration.For the Warners and Director Lloyd Bacon have packed into it a wealth of excitement and that familiar old spirit of do-or-die. It reels off with the snap and persuasibility of a fight talk from \\"Rock\\" himself. If some of it is largely sentimental and on the mock-heroic side—such as the scene in which the famous George Gipp, on his deathbed, whispers to Rockne, \\"Some day, when things are tough, maybe you can ask the boys to go in there and win just once for the Gipper\\"","excerpt":"if some of it is slightly juvenile, that's all a part of the sport. And that also makes it one of the best pictures for boys in years.Apparently the story follows the facts of Mr. Rockne's life explicitly, beginning with his arrival in this country from Norway as a lad and continuing through his early struggle for an education, his start in football as a running-mate of Gus Dorais, his brief career as a chemistry teacher, his inauguration of the Rockne system at Notre Dame, his gridiron triumphs and disappointments and then his untimely death in an airplane accident in 1931. We hadn't time to check on the accuracy of the many games and scores reported briefly but excitingly in the film. But, completely accurate or not, they concur with the Rockne legend.Neither are we able to say whether Pat O'Brien draws a faithful portrait of the great coach in the title role. But he does convey a valid impression of an iron-willed, dynamic and cryptic fellow who could very well be \\"Rock.\\" As a memorial to a fine and inspiring molder of character in young men, this picture ranks high. But, like the Carnegie Foundation has done on previous occasions, we are inclined to question its overemphasis of the pigskin sport.

TODAY'S TOP STORIES    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  The \\"Civil G8\\" forum opened in Moscow Monday ahead of the Group of Eight summit. Nearly 600 non-governmental organizations, half of which are internationally based, are set to discuss questions of global civil society. Ella A. Pamfilova, the presidential civil society and human rights advisor, called the summit unique in that such a forum has \\"not taken place anywhere before.\\"      The participants will likewise have the opportunity to pass along recommendations to President Vladimir V. Putin when he visits the forum today. Also convening in Moscow next week is an opposition conference led by Gary Kasparov's United Civil Front in cooperation with Andrei N. Illarionov, former presidential advisor and head of a the Institute for Economic Analysis. \\"A Different Russia\\" intends to heavily criticize what it contends are the current administration's human rights violations. Sergei A. Markov, member of the Public Chamber, said comparing \\"Civil G8\\" to \\"A Different Russia\\" is like comparing \\"a Mercedes and a wooden horse.\\" The Putin Administration has discouraged Group of Eight member states from taking part in the opposition conference.    IZVESTIA  COMRADE, HAVE FAITH!: Monday saw the opening of the Worldwide Summit of Religious Leaders in Moscow. Over 400 delegates from 40 countries met to discuss ways to protect and defend moral and spiritual ideals in the secular world. President Vladimir V. Putin opened the summit with calls not to \\"drive a wedge\\" between Christian and Islamic civilization while issuing a warning to extremists who \\"cynically use believers' feelings\\" to further their cause. The summit was notable for the absence of both Pope Benedict XVI and the Dalai Lama. The Russian Orthodox Church explained that where a visit by the pope must take place under more notable circumstances, a visit by the Dalai Lama to Russia would \\"complicate the situation\\" with China. Izvestia cites likely areas of unity between the leaders to be on questions regarding human rights, the spread of religious knowledge, and denunciation of \\"perversion, debauchery, and violence\\" in the media.    VEDOMOSTI  PATRIOTS FOR A THIRD TERM: An obscure group called \\"Patriots of Petersburg\\" began collecting signatures for those in favor of a third term for Vladimir V. Putin. This initiative followed an interview of Valentina Matvenko, governor of St. Petersburg, by \\"Moskovskie Novosti\\" on Friday where she stated her support for allowing Mr. Putin to run for a third term for the sake of \\"continued stability.\\" This is not, however, the first of such movements. Earlier third term initiatives were put forth by regional legislatures in the Magadan and Ivanovski regions. Experts attribute the flurry of third term supporters to anxiety on the part of the regional elite. This stems from Vladislav Y. Surkov's recent statement that \\"when new people come to power, the management of such companies will change.\\" They therefore want Mr. Putin to remain head of Russia's blooming state corporation.

The changes would allow the president to use special forces troops \\"against terrorists and/or their bases located outside the territory of the Russian Federation for the elimination of threats to national security.\\" The proposed changes are expected to be signed into law and ready for implementation within the next two weeks. While some United Russia deputies want to spell out the criteria for the law's implementation, Kommersant notes that most of the party \\"will not bother to pay attention to such trivial matters.\\"    VREMYA NOVOSTEI  MILITARY SALES FALL UNDER CIVILIAN CONTROL: The military industrial commission held its meeting Monday announcing plans to create a federal agency responsible for the sale of military technology abroad.

The civilian agency will represent not only the interests of the Ministry of Defense in foreign sales, but all other state security agencies as well.

Stephen N. Marris of the Institute of International Economics finds a soft landing highly implausible as a matter of ''simple arithmetic.''   In the current issue of Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Mr. Marris calculates that if the dollar were to depreciate by 5 percent a year, it would take 14 years to eliminate the United States current account deficit, by which time the American external indebtedness would have risen to more than $2.3 trillion.   Such an external debt, he suggests, is nonsensical. But even if one could conceive of borrowing that much money, the real interest rates in this country would have to be so high - at least 5 percent above the potential United States growth rate - as to stifle economic growth. Alternatively, he calculates, real interest rates in other countries would have to be so low - 5 percent below their potential growth rates - as to breed virulent inflation.

Four years ago I received a beautiful bromeliad (Aechmea). After its flower faded, it never flowered again, but several offspring were successfully repotted. These have grown nicely, but they have never flowered. What can I do? Mrs. Z.J.K., Mohegan Lake, N.Y.     A. After the parent bromeliad flowers, it dies and potting up the offspring was the correct thing to do. This particular species of Bromeliad is an epiphyte and goes through a dormant period now through late winter. Keep the bromeliads at room temperature and the potting medium (well-drained) suitably moist. Roots serve mainly as anchors. To encourage flowering, a    light    feeding with a suitable water-soluble fertilizer could begin, biweekly, when the growing season starts in late winter. Since the nutrients can be absorbed by the leaves, the fertilizer can be poured into the center of the plants and drain down to the root zones. Datura     Q.    I have seen a plant with large, white trumpet flowers and have been told it is a datura. But I can find no reference to it or any cultural directions or seed source? N-J. W., Concord, Mass.     A.

One species, Datura stramonium, is a common weed of waste places. Those who do cultivate datura usually cut off the large flowers, after they fade, to prevent formation of the prickly seed pods, which are often attractive to children. Stump Remover     Q.

Sebastien Maure, this resourceful hero, may perhaps inspire ideas in the minds of other authors whose hearts are bowed with affection. Sebastien is not a saint. He stays up late at night and the next morning is apt to be conscious of more than a mere suspicion of a headache. He even goes so far as to swallow a pick-me-up—in this case a spoonful of old brandy in a large glass—before indulging in any breakfast. He is able to live well, has uniformed servants and all that sort of thing.It was Anne Bellamy, the charming girl in the case, who was canonized by Sebastien. He wrote a book about her and in it alludes to Anne as \\"The Blonde Saint.\\" Unfortunately, Sebastien discovers, after a rapturous kissing scene, that Anne is bound from Italy for England where she is to be married to a Vincent Pamforth. Sebastien makes mental note of the vessel aboard which she is to leave, and one night just before it sails he sends a note to Anne's cabin. Anne has more than a slight admiration for Sebastien, and, consequently, she goes up on the boat deck to see the author. Sebastien thereupon coolly takes her in his arms, goes to the rail and leaps overboard with her.After a fairly long swim they are picked up by a fishing smack, Anne being wild with anger when she recovers consciousness. The next morning they are put ashore on a colorful Sicilian spot known as the \\"Isle of Life.\\" Anne's hair dries and her permanent wave is not spoiled by her experience in the water. Nevertheless, she is in no forgiving mood.This picture has been most adroitly directed by Svend Gade, the Danish producer, who before he came to this country attained no little fame through his picturization of \\"Hamlet.\\" Among the films he made in Hollywood was \\"Into Her Kingdom,\\" in which Corinne Griffith was featured. \\"The Blonde Saint,\\" however, despite the farfetched narrative, is a much better criterion of his talent, for he has obtained wonderfully competent performances from all the players in the cast.On the island the author and Anne have a number of thrilling experiences, including an agonizing period with a species of plague that spreads death throughout the little community.

To separate various symptoms of the malaise it is necessary to distinguish between symphonic activity in Europe and in America. In this endeavor my limited credentials are: personal working acquaintance with 50 orchestras, of which 13 are located in the United States, 34 in Europe and the others in South America and Canada.   But my main concern is with the domestic situation. Taking a tally of the American Symphony Orchestra League at face value, we count 34 ''major'' orchestras with full yearly employment of players and staff. I calculate that the annual total seating capacity for the concerts of these orchestras must come to well over 6 million.   Here is the arithmetic I used: 34 orchestras with a minimum of 40 weeks' activities in their home regions must schedule a grand total of 1,360 weeks of concerts per annum","excerpt":"if there are three weekly performances, which is necessary to balance earned and raised income, we get to 4,080 concerts each season.

''It's disturbing,'' said Baird Eaton, president of the Westchester County Hotel Association and manager of the 444-room Westchester Marriott Hotel in Tarrytown. ''Westchester hotels rely on the corporate visitor as their mainstay, but corporations have cut back on meetings this year and consequently hotels are not getting as many business-generated bookings.

The disappearance of some corporations, such as Avon and AMF; the financial problems of others, such as Texaco; the acquisition of General Foods by Greenwich-based Philip Morris and the tightening of the corporate belt at International Business Machines, Mr. Eaton said, have contributed to the cutback in conferences and meetings and the softening of area hotel business.

Skeptics were quick to say that for complicated statistical reasons, the progress reported by the Labor Department last week was almost surely overstated, and financial markets shrugged it off. But with any kind of faith, what you see is a stunning number -- the biggest improvement in a decade, and a compelling sign that this on-again, off-again economy is at last performing its most basic function: creating jobs. Employers added jobs from California to Florida to New York, and most places in between -- and they were more likely to be full-time jobs, too. As those of you with jobs well know, companies have been putting off hiring and leaning on existing workers, uncertain about things like medical costs, but this news may show that they just couldn't hold out any longer. An Economy on a Spree It's more than jobs. The economic engine keeps gaining speed as it barrels toward that year-end blowout -- which long ago, rumor has it, was some sort of religious celebration. But once Christmas is past, will the vigor survive? Economists are cautious. Last week, though, the numbers were strong: income, construction spending, and factory orders all up, the purchasing managers' index showing the fastest growth since last winter. There were some blips: new-home sales were off, but that followed a surge the month before, so housing still looks good. And retail sales rose just slightly -- but of course any shoppers worth their credit cards would not dream of going wild till it's almost Christmas. Tired of Waiting for S.& L. Job  It's clearly liberating to be nominated for a Government job and then decide it isn't worth jumping through all the hoops. Stanley Tate, named in July to head the Resolution Trust Corporation, but still awaiting a confirmation hearing, didn't mince words last week when he called it quits. \\"Washington,\\" he said, \\"is a vicious city, with all kinds of hidden agendas. It is a city full of rumors, allegations and accusations.\\" And why did his nomination die? Because he's a Republican? Because Bill Clinton didn't back him fully? Or because there was something to the \\"serious questions\\" that Donald Riegle, Senate Banking chairman, had about Mr. Tate? Mr. Tate's version: bureaucrats were afraid he'd root out mismanagement. Whatever the reason, Mr. Tate, a Florida developer, said he felt \\"disposable and dispensable.\\" And the bailout agency just keeps on drifting. Mending Hubble, Mending NASA  If NASA were a corporation, it would long since have become an obscure Wal-Mart subsidiary. It's made one cosmic gaffe after another: the Challenger disaster, the flawed Hubble Space Telescope, the apparent kidnapping of the Mars Observer by little green spacepersons. It's no understatement to say, as one space expert did last week, \\"NASA can't afford another highly visible failure.\\" So the pressure's on the astronauts on the shuttle Endeavour, which lifted off on Thursday. The astronauts' mission: to fix Hubble in mid-space, essentially by putting a pair of eyeglasses on it. If they succeed, secrets of the universe could snap into focus","excerpt":"if they fail, the focus will be on NASA's jugular. But as one Hubble scientist put it, \\"This is not like going to Grandma's to fix a leaky faucet.\\"  OPEC, Where Is Thy Sting?  Twenty years ago, OPEC seemed sure to strangle America with ever-higher oil prices. But last week it was clear just how times had changed. After slipping all year, oil prices plunged to a five-year low after OPEC failed to agree to cut output. So gasoline, steadily cheaper in 1973 dollars, seems likely to get cheaper still, which would help the economy. But everything has a cost, and cheaper gas means auto makers are less likely to put their efforts into making more efficient cars. Victor Posner Is Out of Play  It was an unusual penalty, but the judge said the scope of the violations justified it. Saying they \\"have had a long and notorious history of engaging in self-dealing and corporate waste,\\" a Federal judge last week banned Victor Posner and his son, Steven, from serving as officers or directors of any public company. The order came in a civil suit brought by the S.E.C. as part of a broader case against Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky, and it involved charges that the Posners made secret stock deals with Mr. Boesky. In light of past abuses, the judge said, another warning \\"would serve little purpose.\\"  COMPANIES Paying a Price for Family Values  Family values. So simple a term, yet so laden with subtext. On the surface, it means apple pie, caring, a cozy hearth; but it can also be a code phrase for excluding, condemning, even denying the existence of anything but cookie-cutter Americans. Normally, to cry \\"family values\\" is just free speech, but in Texas last week, the price was high. Apple Computer planned to build an $80 million office complex north of Austin, creating 1,500 jobs. But county officials rejected a $750,000 tax abatement, citing Apple's policy of granting health benefits to employees' unmarried partners, and Apple took its blueprints and hit the road.  Sony's Pain, And the World's In 1946, in a bombed-out Tokyo department store, a young man named Akio Morita helped found the Sony Corporation. Since then, as both Sony and Japan grew mighty, Mr. Morita became, in one American's words, the world's \\"leading Japanese business statesman.\\" So it is symbolic that as Japan's phenomenal half-century shows distinct wear and tear, Sony's chairman falters. Last week Mr. Morita, 72, underwent brain surgery, and he may have to retire. That would be bad news for Sony, where, even removed from day-to-day operations, he remained the \\"psychological backbone.\\" And it would be bad news abroad, for Mr. Morita has played a leading role in smoothing trade tensions with America. Volvo Vants to Be Alone  The planned Volvo-Renault merger created serious friction at Volvo. Many executives wanted to back out, loath to let Sweden lose one of its corporate stars. But the chairman, Pehr Gyllenhammar, stuck to the plan, seeing strength in having a European partner. Last week Mr. Gyllenhammar lost his fight: The merger was called off, and he quickly resigned, saying that Volvo's managers had \\"turned their backs on Europe.\\" Job Cuts: A Weekly Ritual  It almost stops being news, squarely in a class with \\"Dog Bites Man.\\" Another week, and more corporate giants cut thousands of jobs. Last week was no exception. A. T.& T. may cut as many as 4,500 jobs as the long-distance wars take their toll. And airline woes continue to seep through to Boeing, which will cut production, meaning a loss of up to 3,000 jobs. Even the beer industry is pulling in its belly, as Miller said it would close a plant in upstate New York, eliminating 900 jobs.  G.M. Downsizes Its Data  Saturated with economic numbers? Good news: Detroit is going to spare you some. Much as eager-beaver pundits crave the latest word, General Motors decided last week that 10-day sales reports were overkill and would scrap them in January; Ford will probably follow suit. Chrysler went to monthly figures a couple of years ago, but then some helpful souls started estimating 10-day sales. While some analysts found the figures useful, most were relieved. \\"About time,\\" said one. INTERNATIONAL Again, Hope for World Trade  Your eyes glaze over at the words \\"Uruguay Round\\"? You're forgiven: these trade talks have long since taken on a Dickensian dimension. Begun seven years ago to lower tariffs worldwide, the talks have hit more snags than \\"Bleak House\\" has characters. But yet again last week the tireless negotiators, including Mickey Kantor of the United States, cried, \\"Breakthrough!\\" One snag has been French objections to cutting farm subsidies, but a resolution may be at hand. If there is an accord, it could do much for the world economy. But that's still a big \\"if.\\" Trade progress is possible, though: last week Canada's new Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, dropped his opposition to Nafta. The pact now goes into effect on Jan. 1, and the vigil will begin to see which side was right about jobs.   Tokyo Sweet-Talks the Market    All the Japanese stock market was waiting for, it seems, were some rosy words from the Government; last week it got them. Stock prices had been sliding for weeks. But after the Government finally promised to do what it could, the Nikkei index surged more than 4 percent in a day, then 2 percent the next. Prices are still depressed, though, and they are likely to stay that way until Government actions follow words. \\"Jawboning,\\" one analyst said, \\"won't work for too long.\\" Business Diary: November 26 - December 3"},{"year":"1996","title":"The urge to venture afar] arises from the threefold nature of man. One motive is fame, for it is the nature of man to journey where there is great danger, and thus win honor and praise. A second motive is curiosity, for it is also man's nature to see the things he has heard about, and thus learn whether they are as he has been told or not. The third is the desire for gain, for men seek wealth wherever they have heard that gain is to be gotten. -- FROM \\"THE KING'S MIRROR,\\" A 13TH-CENTURY NORSE TREATISE     WHEN HUMANS FINALLY ACQUIRED the technology to travel to another planet, it  occurred to them that they didn't really want to go. A manned mission to Mars, the fantasy that had paid the mortgage for generations of science-fiction writers, lost its appeal as soon as NASA plotted the itinerary. The $400 billion price tag seemed absurdly high to a nation bored with the sight of astronauts lumbering around craters. We already had enough extraterrestrial rocks, thank you.          Recently, though, an intriguing modification to NASA's Mars plan has been suggested: ditch NASA. Let private explorers, modern Vikings inspired by the Norsemen's third desire, seek wealth on Mars. The basics of the expedition have  been worked out by Robert M. Zubrin, who has his own research and development company, Pioneer Astronautics, in Denver. Since devising the technology for a simple and cheap mission to Mars, Zubrin has been traveling the globe giving passionate lectures about \\"our generation's New World.\\" He tells audiences of the prizes offered by 15th-century Portuguese and Spanish rulers to entrepreneurs for venturing down the African coast and across the Atlantic. (Columbus's expedition was financed not only by Queen Isabella but also by private merchants who stood to gain trading concessions.) Zubrin thinks that if  the United States Government were to offer a Mars Prize of $20 billion -- four times what he estimates a private mission would cost -- entrepreneurs would take the bait.

Those have been wisely avoided. Instead, Mr. Zanuck and his cohorts have given out with a simple and natural tale about a cocky young American flier who ferries a bomber to England for the cash, meets an old girl friend who is dancing in a floor show of a London night club, joins up with the Royal Air Force just to be near her and then participates in that \\"flap\\" over Dunkerque when the R. A. F. fledged its wings. It is a lusty and youthful yarn about a fellow who fights to love in a robust, healthy way—a motive which we suspect any R. A. F. lad would applaud. It makes better sense, anyhow, than some of the reasons sometimes heard in films.And Tyrone Power and Betty Grable play the lovers with becoming gusto. Mr. Power is a clean-cut youngster who looks and behaves as you think an American would under the circumstances and for a similar reason. Miss Grable is plenty of reason, too, and acts as though she knows what she's about. Both are as good as they've ever been in this.

At the film's beginning, a young man arrives in town to begin his apprenticeship with a local baker, whose durable, family-run business is being threatened by the prosperity of a nearby supermarket and the prospect of a new shopping center. From then on, we watch the baker and his assistants worry about automation and begin to question the economic system that has made their kind of craftsmanship obsolete. We also watch the young newcomer evolve into a family member of sorts, and then become the gruff, blustery, lovable boss's right-hand man.Erwin Keusch, whose low-keyed but often compelling film is being shown as part of the Museum of Modern Art's New Films/New Directors series, occasionally jeopardizes the engaging plainness of his story to bring one character or another to the figurative podium, so that the obligatory speeches about the evils of modernization can he made. But for the most part the film proceeds as swiftly as a day in the bakery might go. Mr. Keusch's gift for being most communicative when his film seems to be saying the least is nothing to sneeze at, and his work is effective in eccentric, nicely unexpected ways.Mr. Keusch is the son of a baker","excerpt":"if you didn't know that before seeing his film, you would surely surmise it from the loving attentiveness with which he sketches bakery life. This is an absolutely spellbinding movie for anyone who likes watching dough rise, and even those who prefer to be on the eating end of the baking process may enjoy learning a thing or two. Werner (Bernd Tauber) the assistant, graduates during the course of the movie from simple kneading and sifting to inventing his own recipes. The camera doesn't dwell unnecessarily on his handiwork, but it follows his progress closely, as he takes ever-increasing pride in his work.Another baker, Kurt (Manfred Siepold), is meanwhile seen in the background, knotting pretzels in a split-second and performing other similarly magical feats. Mr. Siepold is a handsome fellow and a good actor, but if he doesn't actually bake for a living, it's a shame.When he isn't working or dragging himself out of bed hours before dawn, young Werner is pitching woo, but this aspect of his hero's life leaves Mr. Keusch strangely ill-at-ease. One affair, with a rich girl Werner meets when he delivers her birthday cake, seems present in the film solely to make a point about the class system, and the portion of the story that involves her has the feeling of an unexpected and unwelcome lecture. When Werner falls in love for real, the baking and spooning episodes are so clumsily integrated that the romance once again seems tacked-on.In another episode, a most disturbing one, Werner is pounced upon by a very attractive older woman who works in the shop. After they spend one night together, he becomes unaccountably hurtful and rude; she, even more unaccountably, decides life without Werner just isn't worth living. At times like this, Mr. Keusch's presentation of his young hero as a man of few words becomes problematic, and his trick of cutting away from tender moments almost before they happen makes his story hard to follow.\\"The Baker's Bread\\" is being billed as a West German comedy, but viewers expecting belly laughs would be well advised to try to recall the last West German film they deemed even remotely amusing. In this case, let's just say that nobody dies, all ends reasonably well and—here's the funny part—the bakery crew one day confounds the manager of the supermarket by buying up all his breakfast rolls.

It has some features that are not ordinarily found in pictures of its type. One of them is that it appears occasionally to be \\"kidding\\" \\"Western pictures. At the outset Betty Foster (Ethel Shannon) is shown to have romantic ideas about what a man with a gun can do and is considerably disgusted with Pete Grainger (Harry Carey) when she finds him being held up by three road agents and surrendering the money he carries without a struggle. She tells him she hadn't expected to see that sort of thing—and these are her own words—\\"out where men are men.\\" Later, when she finds Grainger arrayed in the limit of cowhand finery, and remarks that he is a beautiful thing, he replies that as to those clothes he had \\"lifted them off our Catalogue Cowboy.\\" Furthermore, they dress Harry Carey up in women's clothes. Things like that imply a commendably light-hearted spirit in a picture whose type is generally oppressed by the sense that life is very real and earnest.There is no use worrying too much about the story of the picture, which concerns the theft of $10.000 in cash in a hold-up, the recovery sending various people dashing about the countryside on horseback, and chasing each other up and down hills and all that sort of thing. That comes toward the end of the film, but is quite in the orthodox manner, as is the fight on the brink of the cliff.Harry Carey is as always one of the most agreeable exponents of this kind of material. One of his excellences is that he doesn't trouble himself about \\"acting.\\" but just walks through what he has to do—when he is not riding.

You may well be left wondering how far the work of such a writer really calls for an extended introduction, and in many ways it undoubtedly speaks for itself. But that still leaves room for a survey like the one Mr. Castronovo has undertaken, an account that attempts to set Wilson's career in perspective and sort out its dominant themes.   By and large the attempt is highly successful. Mr. Castronovo, who is a professor of English at Pace University, writes with intelligence and verve. While properly respectful of Wilson's great (though uneven) achievements, he doesn't allow himself to be overawed by them.

The 37-year-old Mr. Buscemi (pronounced boo-SHEM-ee), is also known for playing out-of-control directors (\\"In the Soup,\\" \\"Living in Oblivion\\"), and is now preparing to direct a film of his own. His first feature, \\"Trees Lounge,\\" is a working-class tale set in his hometown, Valley Stream, L.I. Naturally, he hopes he fares better than the directors he has portrayed.   As the edgy, exhausted-looking Nick in \\"Living in Oblivion,\\" he nervously tries to direct a feature on a very low budget while just about everything goes wrong. The vain leading man is involved with his co-star; the female assistant director is eying the leading man, to the chagrin of her boyfriend, the cinematographer; the boom keeps getting in the shots; rap music interrupts the sound in the middle of a take, and during a dream sequence the smoke machine explodes. To make the nightmare complete, in the middle of it all Nick's mother suddenly appears on the set.   \\"I'm shooting a dream sequence without a smoke machine!\\" Nick screams. \\"I've got my mother inside thinking she's at a circus wedding!\\"    Mr. Buscemi's own film, which is scheduled to begin shooting in August, takes its title from the name of his longtime favorite bar, Trees Lounge, in Valley Stream and is in some ways autobiographical. As Mr. Buscemi did in real life, the main character drives an ice cream truck. \\"I tried to imagine what it would be like had I never left Valley Stream,\\" he said. Everything goes wrong in that imagined world of modest dreams. The main character, played by Mr. Buscemi, hangs out in faded bars, is fired from his job as a mechanic and loses his girlfriend, who may be carrying his child, to his former boss.   As a child, Mr. Buscemi lived in East New York. His father, John, is a retired New York City Sanitation Department worker. Mr. Buscemi grew up in a large, close-knit Italian-Irish family. When he was 8, the family moved to Valley Stream, where despite his slender physical appearance -- \\"I have a lot of strength for my weight,\\" he said -- he was a jock.In Mr. Buscemi's high school class, you were either a jock or a nerd. Still, when he tried out for a high school play, he got a sudden rush. \\"I liked the reaction from the audience,\\" he said. \\"I liked the attention.\\" Mr. Buscemi knew no one who had ever been an actor except for his \\"Uncle Pete,\\" the actor Peter Miller, a childhood friend of his father's, who played a student in \\"Blackboard Jungle.\\"    At his father's suggestion, he took the test for the New York City Fire Department. \\"My father wanted all his sons to take the Civil Service test,\\" he said. \\"It was a nice, secure job.\\" Today, one of Mr. Buscemi's brothers works for a cable television company, another for the Transit Authority. A third is an actor.   When Mr. Buscemi took the Civil Service test, there were no jobs available as a fireman. So he drove an ice cream truck and worked for a moving company. One day his father suggested he go into New York and look into acting classes. He ended up studying at the Lee Strasberg Institute, paying for the lessons with money from a settlement for a childhood accident.   He tried to get auditions, faking his resume. He did comedy acts. Then he moved to the East Village and became part of the late 70's downtown performance scene. During this time, he met his future wife, Jo Anders, a performance artist, choreographer and film maker. They have a 4-year-old son, Lucian.   Then, in 1980, Mr. Buscemi's name came up at the Fire Department. He went to work with Engine Company No. 55 on Broome Street in Manhattan. At first he told no one of his secret life as an actor. Most of the men in his company lived in places like Valley Stream. \\"You didn't have firefighters living in the East Village,\\" he said.   Finally, he told his secret to another actor-fireman, who introduced him to a theater group at Westbeth, the artists' housing complex. The film director Bill Sherwood saw Mr. Buscemi in a play at Westbeth and gave him his first film role, as an AIDS victim in \\"Parting Glances.\\" Mr. Buscemi took a leave of absence to be in the movie. When he saw himself on film, he began to believe he could get steady work as an actor, and in 1985 he quit the Fire Department.    He went on to win roles in \\"Miami Vice\\" and in Jim Jarmusch's \\"Mystery Train.\\" Mr. Tarantino saw him on film and offered him the part in \\"Reservoir Dogs.\\" In 1992 he appeared in \\"In the Soup\\" as a young movie director trying to find financing for a 500-page script. The director becomes involved with a con man (Seymour Cassel), who actually decides that he wants to produce it. When Alexandre Rockwell, the director of \\"In the Soup,\\" needed a film within a film for his project, he suggested that Mr. Buscemi make one himself. His wife showed him how to shoot it.   For the last three years, Mr. Buscemi has been trying to raise the $1 million he needs to make \\"Trees Lounge.\\" \\"There were always conditions,\\" he said. \\"They would say it would be easier to raise money if you have a more positive ending. I had no interest in making a movie just to get it made. But if your film doesn't have a strong point of view, you end up alienating all audiences.\\" Recently, he was able to find backing through Live Entertainment. Starring with him in the film will be his brother Michael, Chloe Sevigny from \\"Kids,\\" Carol Kane, Mr. Cassel and Mark Boone Junior, his partner from his theater days.   \\"It's scary going into a burning building,\\" Mr. Buscemi said, thinking back to his life as a fire fighter. \\"The only feeling I ever got that compares to it is acting. There's the nervousness before you go in, but once you're there, there's no time to be nervous. It's critical to your job.

Her essay \\"Of Love and Art\\" is included in \\"The Confidence Woman: 26 Women Writers at Work,\\" edited by Eve Shelnutt (Longstreet Press).     If as an author you successfully and compellingly write about venereal disease, you are treated as if you had one","excerpt":"if you write about child abuse or murder, you are considered to have had firsthand knowledge of these matters. Thus, the strange consequence of your imaginative re-creation of these horrors will be that you as a Person, a Self, an Identity, are soon being treated as if you were quite another Person from what you know yourself to be. Your \\"public\\" -- that is to say, the society of    un   self-conscious, confiding, amiable, friendly, and above all so-called \\"normal\\" people -- begins now to distance itself from what it believes to be the writer's real Persona. . . . And at the very split-second during which you-as-Author become aware of this distancing, you are catalyzed into becoming Someone who, only seconds before, you were not: before your own eyes you have been transformed into someone, something else -- at best an intrusive, symbiotic presence making honey (and, as it is commonly believed, money) off other people's private lives -- or at worst a betrayer of tales told in confidence. In Pursuit of the Essential      When we travel, Albert Camus argues in this passage from his journal, we are seeking, more than pleasure, the chance to find through the strangeness and challenges of the journey some fresh connection to the eternal. This is from \\"Notebooks 1935-1942\\" (Paragon, paper).     What gives value to travel is fear. It is the fact that, at a certain moment, when we are so far from our own country . . . we are seized by a vague fear, and an instinctive desire to go back to the protection of old habits. This is the most obvious benefit of travel. At that moment we are feverish but also porous, so that the slightest touch makes us quiver to the depths of our being. We come across a cascade of light, and there is eternity. This is why we should not say that we travel for pleasure. There is no pleasure in traveling, and I look upon it more as an occasion for spiritual testing. If we understand by culture the exercise of our most intimate sense -- that of eternity -- then we travel for culture. Pleasure takes us away from ourselves in the same way as distraction, in Pascal's use of the word, takes us away from God. Travel, which is like a greater and a graver science, brings us back to ourselves. The Idyllic, Endangered Past      Jed Perl contrasts the frank, robust delights of the vanished aristocratic world celebrated in the Babar stories for children with the far more pallid image of an elegant past currently in evidence. This is from \\"Gallery Going: Four Seasons in the Art World\\" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich).      The Babar stories, with their crystal-clear views of an idyllic pre-World War I world -- a world of refined manners and pretty tea parties and amusing outings that have their bad twists but always turn out fine -- fit right into the yuppie yen for old-fashioned family living. Some people are offended by what they see as the commercialization of Babar; but I'm not so sure that Babar's aura is diluted by commercialization. . . . So much of what the current back-to-tradition nostalgia boom presents is faceless stuff. The Ralph Lauren outfits and the bleached-pine furniture give a chilly, hollowed-out view of earlier times. And the advertisements for many of these products suggest that it's not the pleasures but the repressions that people are really nostalgic for. Babar carries us into a different past, a past that's not only privileged and refined, but also full-bodied, a past that hasn't had the blood leeched out of it. Fortune's Wheel      Classical Sanskrit poetry, produced between the 4th and 12th centuries A.D., is distinguished by its terse grace and ironic celebration of time's passage. This untitled poem attributed to Kalidasa is included in \\"Dropping the Bow: Poems From Ancient India,\\" translated by Andrew Schelling (Broken Moon Press, paper).   Considering many  things in my heart  I hang onto life.  Don't you succumb to  bewilderment now,  lovely one. Whose  lot is just  joy or just sorrow?  Fortune goes down  and goes up like a  cartwheel revolving.  Risky, Necessary Behavior      Melvin Konner reminds us that we are a reckless species, we have evolved in part because of risk taking, and we cannot even now entirely dispense with the need to take rash chances. This is from \\"Why the Reckless Survive: . . . and Other Secrets of Human Nature\\" (Penguin, paper).     As for me, when I avoid . . . risks, I feel safe and virtuous but perhaps a little cramped. And I suspect that, like many people who watch their diet carefully -- despite the lapses -- and exercise more or less scrupulously and buckle up religiously, I am a little obsessed with immortality, with the prospect of controlling that which cannot be controlled. I know I am doing the sensible thing -- my behavior matches, most of the time, the spectrum of real possibilities. But against what scale of value? I sometimes think that the more reckless among us may have something to teach the careful about the sort of immortality that comes from living fully every day.

On its unspoiled beaches, the only footprints are probably your own, and the clear Atlantic waters that feed them dance before you like a kaleidoscope of jades, purples and blues. It is also a place where street addresses are nonexistent and where you will have to slow down in spite of yourself: there is regular time, and there is Bahamian time, and the more you try to hurry, the longer it will take you to get there.   ABBOTT COMBES    Friday    6 p.m.  1 -- Into the Drink    If you're staying at the Club Peace and Plenty hotel in George Town (800-525-2210), attend the manager's Friday-night reception","excerpt":"if you're not staying there, crash it. Crashing is O.K.; you just should forgo the complimentary rum punch and pay for your own drinks, served up with plenty of gusto by Lermon Rolle (poolside) and Glen Munroe (in the former slave quarters that are the main bar). There are two reasons you want to be there. One is the allure of tropical libations with names like Reef Wrecker and Goombay Smash (both $6.50; Bahamian and U.S. currencies are an even exchange). The other is to meet Chad Florence, a Michigan artist who spends half the year in Exuma, and to see his paintings, which send you right into the middle of island life.    7 p.m.  2 -- Bahamian Shuffle    Walk down the street to the Two Turtles Inn (242-336-2545) for the Friday-night barbecue. Go native with the grilled grouper for $18, served with peas and rice (as is almost everything you eat in the Bahamas), macaroni and cheese, cole slaw and potato salad. Don't worry about the pounds, because at 8 o'clock or thereabouts the band starts playing its mix of calypso, rock, reggae, soul and whatever else it can think of, the amps loud enough to wake the dead and set the most leaden feet to twitching. Ask someone how to do the Bahamian shuffle. Don't be shy; the Bahamians won't.    Saturday    8 a.m.  3 -- Grouper Breakfast    Join the locals for a Bahamian breakfast at one of the ''shacks'' on the old United States Navy base a half-mile west of town. Tino's is where you'll see the most cars; a meal of ''stew fish'' (a k a grouper), grits and bread is about $10.    9:30 a.m.  4 -- Roads Less Traveled    Technically, Exuma is an archipelago of 365 cays and islands that uncoils for 150 miles or so southeast of Nassau, but for the purposes of this weekend, it's just two islands -- one named Great and the other Little, linked by a single road (the Queen's Highway) and one bridge. To begin a morning of scattershot exploration, grab a map and head east to Little Exuma. Keep your eyes open along the way. Exuma has a rich history of shipwrecking, blockade-breaking, rum-running and drug-trafficking, and you never know when you'll happen upon a secluded cove where Captain Kidd once anchored or even a brick of marijuana washed up on the shore, as I did once. After you cross the bridge into Little Exuma, find the Tropic of Cancer Beach (so called because it's practically on it) between Forbes Hill and Williams Town and loll awhile. Or be impulsive: take an unmarked road (street signs on the island are as rare as neckties) left toward the water and see what you find. Beaches in the Bahamas are public property up to the high-tide mark, but you should respect private property in reaching them.    11:30 a.m.  5 -- Cotton Picking    Return to the Queen's Highway, drive into Williams Town and meander through the ruins of the Hermitage Plantation, a reminder of how British loyalists tried -- and eventually failed -- to establish a plantation economy on the island after the American Revolution. Another reminder, incidentally, is the wild cotton you see the entire length (about 60 miles) and breadth (about 7 miles) of Great and Little Exuma. For lunch, stop at Santanna's roadside stand in Williams Town (242-345-4102) and chat with Dee Rolle-Styles as she fixes you a plate of cracked lobster ($18). On your way back to George Town, take a right in the middle of the big bend leading into Forbes Hill and put some more sand between your toes at the sweeping beach there.    1:30 p.m.  6 -- To Market, to Market    Back in the middle of George Town, under the spreading ficus tree, survey the intricate weaving and other handicrafts of the women of the straw market, whose salesmanship, by the way, can be fierce. And up the road, Diane Polley-Minns's shop, Sandpiper (242-336-2084), features Bahamian artwork and a smart selection of clothing, jewelry, books, toys and souvenirs.    2 p.m.  7 -- Nature's A.T.M. Machine    Westward! Back on the Queen's Highway, the 22-mile jaunt to Cocoplums Beach is a pleasant drive through small towns and postcard-pretty ocean vistas. But avert your eyes when you pass the sprawling Four Seasons Resort, which is to the real Exuma as a fluorescent light is to a Bahamian sunset (and where a guest can indulge himself to the unimaginable tune of $6,800 a night, should he so desire). About five miles beyond this reservation of ostentation, after Steventon but before Rolleville, turn right at a sign that says Cocoplums Beach Club (242-554-3358, open 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., closed Tuesdays; cash only), drive to the end of the road and park. Say hello to Dana and Dee Thompson-Wilkinson, the club's chef-proprietors, and prepare to eat the best food on the island -- lobster fritters ($12), jade curry shrimp ($20), blackened grouper ($22) and tropical bread pudding ($8) -- before or after you stroll the beach and withdraw a few sand dollars.    8 p.m.  8 -- Let Them Eat Turtle    Convince yourself you're still hungry and have the turtle steak ($18) at Eddie's Edgewater on Lake Victoria in the center of George Town (242-336-2050). The kitchen defines Bahamian time, and you will undoubtedly be hungry by the time the meal arrives. After dinner, ask around about where the Saturday-night action is: there's usually a band playing at one of the hotels or bar-restaurants or, shades of culture implosion, a karaoke machine. Or maybe opt for the sounds of silence and let a slow boat ride around the starlit harbor be your good-night serenade.    Sunday    8 a.m.  9 -- Soused    Breakfast on the second-floor deck at Sam's Place (242-336-2579), Sam Gray's restaurant overlooking his marina in George Town, will put you in the mood for a day on and in the water. Order the sheep's tongue or chicken souse, bolstered by grits and johnnycake, all for about $10.    9 a.m.  10 -- Sporting Life    Take to the sea for an adventurous morning of scuba diving, snorkeling, fishing and/or boating, but don't wait until Sunday to make the arrangements: Dive Exuma (242-336-2893, www.dive-exuma.com); Starfish (800-893-8622; in Exuma, 242-336-3033, www.kayakbahamas.com); Minns Water Sports (242-336-3483, www.mwsboats.com). Drop anchor almost anywhere, jump in the water and you'll think you're swimming in the pages of National Geographic, surrounded by chromatic tropical fish and flowerlike coral reefs. The island is a magnet for bonefishermen (many of whom swear by the flats just before the bridge to Little Exuma), though some anglers prefer going after barracuda, tarpon, grouper or even sharks.    10 a.m.  11 -- Take a Hike    As an alternative to participatory sport, take a water taxi across the harbor to Stocking Island from the Club Peace and Plenty dock (free for guests; $10 round trip otherwise). Stocking Island's trails, blue holes, hidden cave and beaches, particularly on the unprotected Atlantic side,can bring out the nature lover in even the slickest of city slickers. Before returning to George Town, have one of Doralee Roache's sandwiches at the Peace and Plenty Beach Club. While her hamburgers ($8) and cheeseburgers ($8.50) are justly famed -- it's called Hamburger Beach, after all -- her conchburgers ($9) are even better.    Where Sand Dollars Are Local Currency       There are daily nonstop flights to Exuma from Miami (American Eagle), Fort Lauderdale (Lynx Air International, Continental Connection) and Nassau (Bahamasair). You'll want a rental car. Better yet, contact Prestige Scooter Rental in George Town (242-357-0066, $50 a day), and spend the weekend taking a ride on the mild side. Whichever, remember to ask for a map. And to drive on the left side of the road.     You can arrive in style, by sail -- or motor, if you must -- and moor in Elizabeth Harbour, right off George Town; call Customs for regulations and fees (242-336-2072). No matter how you get there, you will have to produce a valid photo ID and proof of citizenship, though a passport is not mandatory (but is expected to be next year). More information is online at www.exuma.bahamas.com.     In season (through April), rooms at Club Peace and Plenty (800-525-2210; www.peaceandplenty.com), a onetime sponge warehouse, start at $170. (The Peace and Plenty also operates the Beach Inn outside of town.) At the few-frills Two Turtles Inn (242-336-2545), a room is $126 a night, double occupancy. A mile west of George Town, Coconut Cove Hotel is an intimate beachfront getaway built from scratch by Pam and Tom Chimento (242-336-2659, www.coconutcoveexumabahamas.com). Rooms start at $152; the food is excellent, though decidedly not Bahamian.
