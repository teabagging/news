Stein's carefully researched exhibition catalogue takes a judicious approach to providing an answer for the work of Horace Pippin (1888-1946). A self-taught painter and resident of West Chester, Pa., Pippin came to prominence in the late 1930's and 40's through the efforts of a number of white critics, curators and patrons, including the Philadelphia collector Albert C. Barnes. In his catalogue essay for Pippin's first solo show in 1940, Barnes called Pippin \\"the first important Negro painter to appear on the American scene.\\" Included in the \\"Masters of Popular Painting\\" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1938, Pippin became a key figure at the intersection of two important trends in the history of modern art in the United States: scene painting and primitivism. Pippin's bold, simplified domestic scenes, landscapes, portraits and history paintings synthesized the two, making his work highly marketable to an audience eager to prove its own sophistication through its very modern appreciation of so-called primitive art. A particular strength of \\"I Tell My Heart\\" is its attention to the relations between Pippin and the nexus of dealers, patrons, critics and curators who promoted and collected his work. For as Judith Wilson, who teaches art history at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, points out in another essay, Pippin's example \\"refutes a stereotype -- that of the self-taught artist as a socio-cultural isolate.\\" Ms. Stein, an adjunct curator at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, has assembled a catalogue that offers great insight not only into Pippin's work, but also into the American art world of the 1930's and 40's.\\nMIGNON NIXON IN SHORT: NONFICTION","excerpt":"POPULAR MASTER"},{"year":"1997","title":"Houston voters turn back proposal to ban affirmative action in city's contracting and hiring","excerpt":"popular Mayor Bob Lanier campaigned tirelessly against proposition; that controversy and mayoral candidacy of Lee P Brown draw large black turnout; Brown will face Rob Mosbacher in runoff (S) Voters Turn Back Affirmative Action Ban Much Like the One in California"},{"year":"1952","title":"Wholesale butter prices here hit the highest peak this week since the spring of 1948.

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising","excerpt":"Popular Science"},{"year":"1996","title":"Henry Holt & Company, in its series \\"Scientific American Focus,\\" has the rather interesting goal of taking areas of science that are likely to be in the  news or are generating controversy and making them clear to the average newspaper reader. The first three volumes, all written by science journalists and each costing $22.50, are written in simple, straightforward language and are embellished with numerous photographs and diagrams. MEDICATION OF THE MIND, by Scott Veggeberg, grapples with one of the many deep and difficult problems uncovered by our new understanding that life depends, at bottom, on chemistry. Specialized molecules in the brain, called receptors, seem to govern our moods and general feelings, and drugs like Prozac, which affect molecular chemistry, are the first fruits of this new understanding. But as more and more illnesses are dealt with by manipulating the brain's chemistry, traditional mental health  practitioners find themselves fighting a rear-guard action. COSMIC COLLISIONS, by Dana Desonie, takes on the bombardment of the earth by pieces of debris from  interplanetary space. Starting with the Big Bang and the formation of the solar  system, the book describes the historical process by which humans came to realize that large stones occasionally fall from the sky. My only problem was a  sense that Ms. Desonie was trying too hard to make the subject relevant, perhaps underestimating its inherent interest and her own ability to spin a good story.  THE LANGUAGE OF ANIMALS, by Stephen Hart, is full of interesting tidbits about the communication inherent in the feather displays of peacocks, the mechanisms for sound production in dolphins, and modern experiments on the language capabilities of chimpanzees. What is missing is a single coherent theme, or at least some direction as to which topics are sidelights and which bear on deep scientific questions. If these books are any indication of what is to come, I look forward to the next volumes with great anticipation.
