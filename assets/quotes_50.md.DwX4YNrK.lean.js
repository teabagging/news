For a change, in a season that must be setting records for cancellations, program changes and other disruptions, stability reigned. Neeme Jarvi, the Estonian-born conductor who conducted the Philharmonic 11 years ago after emigrating to the United States, returned for the first time since then. Though far from a colorful or obviously galvanic leader, he left a good impression this time as a solid musical citizen who was willing to let a score speak for itself.   To say Mr. Jarvi returned to the Avery Fisher Hall podium would be true only in a symbolic sense: he conducted all evening from stage level, without the usual platform. This is a tactic sometimes adopted by conductors when the orchestra is reduced, as it was in all three pieces on this program. There is less need for elevation when all the musicians can see the leader. Furthermore, by placing himself literally on the same level as his players, the conductor may hope to arouse in them latent feelings of collegiality.

Then Christoph Perick, who was scheduled to conduct the subscription concerts in Avery Fisher Hall, suddenly withdrew to deal with a family emergency. As it happened, a replacement was at hand: the Finnish conductor Paavo Berglund, who had made his Philharmonic debut the week before, filling in for an indisposed Klaus Tennstedt.   Unfortunately, the substitution entailed a dislocation in a particularly felicitous Mozart program. The planned opening work, the little G-minor Symphony (No. 25), would have been a superb foil for the closing D-major \\"Prague\\" Symphony (No. 38), since each makes distinctive use of a characteristic Mozartean syncopation in its principal first-movement theme. Instead, the Symphony No. 33 in B flat opened the program, not only destroying the symmetry but also leaving the central Andante of the Piano Concerto No. 22 in E flat the evening's lone movement in the minor mode.

They were alert for United States military. They had two of them that they tied up at separate times and brought forward and put them in the cockpit. They beat on them quite severely. They wrenched one of the arms off Mr. Zimmermann's flight-engineer's chair and used that as a club to beat these young men.

On the face of it, Mr. Glass's two-act piece is an interpretation of an interpretation, a gloss on a gloss. And indeed, there are places in it -- Orphee's pursuit of the Princess on the streets of Paris is one -- that mean little without the corresponding images created on film 43 years ago. Condensing here, implying there, \\"Orphee\\" the opera follows the train of Cocteau's thoughts on a very ancient myth. It uses much of his dialogue verbatim.   Yet in another sense, Mr. Glass's piece is closer to Gluck than to Cocteau. Gluck's \\"Orfeo ed Euridice,\\" written in 1762, is opera's most prominent hommage to the Orpheus myth. Although the new opera's reference to an old one is brief and fleeting, the flute solo with orchestra that announces the Princess's entrance from the Underworld seems, intentionally or not, more a comment on the music around it then a passing bow to history. Review/Opera","excerpt":"Philip Glass Looks Back at Cocteau's 'Orphee'"},{"year":"1992","title":"When the Metropolitan Opera takes the step of commissioning an opera to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the New World, it is not offering an invitation to modesty and caution. So it should be no surprise that Philip Glass's opera \\"The Voyage,\\" which received its world premiere at the Met on Monday night, can be accused of neither. It lasts nearly three and a half hours, cost more than $2 million and has something for everybody: a mixture of comforting cliche and aggressive pretense, some bombastic insistence and some tender, lyrical music that is among Mr. Glass's best. The production also has enough in it to keep the eyes occupied when the mind is not.   It has a 21st-century Coke machine and a crash landing by an alien space ship 15,000 years ago. It includes men in Victorian top hats asphyxiating in their gas masks and a mass assassination at the Statue of Liberty as a rocket blasts out of its gigantic crown. It has a scientist, resembling Stephen Hawking, floating in a wheelchair and asking about black holes. It is influenced by Doris Lessing's novels and by science fiction tales like \\"2001.\\" It includes a New Ageish invocation of magic crystals and avant-gardish satires of Americana. And sandwiched among all of these fantastical conceits, there is Christopher Columbus sailing to the New World.

The occasion was the unveiling of a new stylistic persona for Mr. Glass, heard in the haunting and enchanting strains of his \\"Low\\" Symphony in its American premiere -- a work based on themes that Mr. Bowie and Brian Eno used in their 1977 album, \\"Low.\\" The symphony's title was also surely meant as a contrast to the notion of the symphony as \\"high.\\" It signaled another turn in the confluence of musical streams, blending vernacular forms with the aspirations of art music.   This was a piquant and often lovely hybrid, given an impassioned performance, with Dennis Russell Davies leading the orchestra. It was a result of decades of mutual influence. Mr. Bowie has clearly been attracted to the rhythmic experiments of Mr. Glass (\\"Weeping Wall\\" on \\"Low\\" is almost Glassy in its percussive patter). Some of Mr. Glass's music (notably the score to the film \\"The Thin Blue Line\\") also seems indebted to Mr. Eno's use of electronics to create a state of anxious attentiveness.

Gandhi's early life and named for Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent resistance was sold out for all five performances of its New York premiere run.   Mr. Glass also explained how he had become disenchanted with conventional forms of composition even -perhaps especially - the 12-tone and other modern ''systems,'' and began exploring other musical esthetics. He studied Eastern styles and instruments, worked intensively with Ravi Shankar, and gradually evolved his own ideas of time, space and harmonic structure.   ''I'm coming out of a nonliterary theater tradition,'' Mr. Glass said, ''and I don't tell stories in the usual way. At bottom, music is not really a narrative structure, and I think we're coming to understand that. My music is more like a painting than a story.''

His politics have also shifted, including a notorious period of Fascist leanings in the late 1930's. Mr. Johnson has called this phase a mistake, in much the way that he once called himself a \\"whore\\" with regard to the often garish skyscrapers he designed in the 1980's.         But Mr. Johnson's devotion to the Modern -- which spans nearly its entire life and has included stints as department head, official architect and, since 1957, trustee -- has been relatively consistent and pure.

Telecartes are disposable phone cards that look like credit cards and are sold, in plastic wrappers, in cafes, at tobacconists and at post offices. Although using one costs slightly more than calling from a residential phone, the cards are cheaper than calling from a hotel or using an American telephone credit card. Public phones that accept coins or tokens are being replaced with telecarte machines. France-Telecom, the French telephone company, says that the system is available at about 25 percent of public telephones in France. Similar system are in place in Japan, Britain and Germany.    Each telecarte has a built-in golden microchip that acts as an electronic purse when inserted in a public telephone. A digital display allows callers to know how much time is available. Telecartes come in 50 or 120 units. One unit is worth 73 centimes (about 15 cents) and can be used for a six-minute conversation to anyone in France. Americans calling home should invest in the 40-franc (about $8.25), 50-unit card for at least a five-minute call or the 96-franc ($20), 120-unit for 12 minute. When the card is about to run out, both parties hear a beep.
