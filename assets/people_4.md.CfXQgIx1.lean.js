A1    In private conversations, American officials are beginning to acknowledge that a judgment about when withdrawals from Iraq can begin is driven by two political calendars -- one in Iraq and one in the United States -- as much as by military assessments.

Since the end of 1987, as industry after industry stumbled and private employment waned, jobs in govern ment rose by 23,000. That brought the total increase in government jobs for the 1980's to 95,000, or one of every four jobs created in the city's most prosperous decade since World War II. All of this increase was generated locally, because the small rise in the number of state workers was more than offset by a decline in Federal employment in the city.   No government can long continue to hire in the face of a declining economy, and Mayor David N. Dinkins said last week that he would eliminate about 5,000 positions this fiscal year and perhaps 20,000 more next year. But New York City still plans to spend nearly $4 billion a year on long-term projects, much of it on dilapidated public works.    In addition, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is spending huge sums. By 1992, it will have spent $16 billion in a 10-year effort to rehabilitate the commuter rail lines and the subways. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is spending $1 billion or so a year on its bridges, tunnels and airports. And the School Construction Authority will spend $4.3 billion over the next five years. Powerful Stimulus for New York    All this spending is a powerful stimulus even to an economy as big as New York's. The transportation authority's spending alone, for example, would keep more than 200,000 people employed for a year. And it is partially self-perpetuating, because it will generate $700 million in state and local taxes.   The drawback is that for decades, residents and businesses will be paying for this work in taxes and fees and fares. Mindful of the strain, the Citizens Budget Commission recommended somewhat regretfully that the city cut long-term spending, and the Dinkins administration has pushed back some projects and reduced others.   But Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority, said she believes that now is not the time to make large cuts in such spending, in part because it helps the economy but also because the work is necessary. \\"Everything needs patching and repairing,\\" she said.

critics of Govt assert in private that situation is urgent; problem is exacerbated by uncertain state of world oil mkt, Oman's strategic position at mouth of Persian Gulf and because of reputation for extravagance that various Arab aristocrats have earned in past; Qabus reptdly has no weaknesses more unseemly than a passion for collecting phonograph records, but has at times been spectacularly generous since he seized power in ′70 from arch‐conservative father, Sultan Said bin Taimur; has embarked on vast construction program, ranging from scores of new schools and other public bldgs, to huge multicolored palace that has been rising over Muscat waterfront; has been spending funds on police and 12,000‐man armed forces at rate reptdly of $500‐million annually; critics charge too much is being spent on mil establishment that currently is fighting nothing more than band of several hundred Marxist‐led rebels near southern frontier; Sultan's supporters, including former mil commander Maj Gen T M Creasy, contend that Oman needs arsenal of modern weapons to cope with many eventualities, and that high outlays can be credited with Oman's recent successes in curbing revolt; say bankers have been visiting Oman in recent days, to suggest means for controlling spending and to work on econ plans for remainder of decade, at Sultan's invitation; say ′74 oil revenues were between $900‐million and $1‐billion, not including amount, said to be less than $10%, that Sultan took for himself; Govt expenditures were trifle less, leaving surplus for yr of less than $30‐million; ‘75 expenditures are expected to range between $1.2‐billion and $1.3‐billion, and oil revenues are expected to be $1.2‐billion, assuming that Oman's oil production and world oil prices are not reduced; current softness on oil mkt has made some Omani planners fearful that one or both may occur; nation currently has $200‐million in reserves, half of which is in gold, SDRs, dollars and other foreign currencies; remaining half is invested in fairly safe securities, including bonds guaranteed by Ger Govt; Oman also has between $50‐million and $100‐million in short‐term debts; Govt also has availed itself fully of its overdrawing privileges at Brit Bank of the Middle East to amount of $5‐million worth of Omani currency;

Unfortunately for the Afghan people, the opposite is true.    The rebel offensive in Afghanistan is the brainchild of Pakistani military intelligence, the Inter-Services Intelligence, known by the initials I.S.I., which has no interest in any political settlement short of putting the extremist rebel leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar into power. The cost of that effort will be countless civilian lives. Support for the fighting from the United States will not lead to peace, but will only prolong Afghanistan's civil war.    Congress is poised to cut aid to the Afghan resistance, at least partly because of the failure of the mujahedeen guerrillas to achieve a military victory. What should be of greater concern is the I.S.I.'s strategy of indiscriminately attacking civilians.    Since the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan, the I.S.I. has pressured guerrilla commanders to attack government-controlled cities with rockets as their main military activity.

After three days of talks, their foreign ministers agreed to make Kashmir a separate topic for discussion within broader negotiations aimed at achieving detente. The dispute has been the biggest irritant between the two countries for much of the last 50 years. A6     France Debates Arrests   The French Justice Minister, Elisabeth Guigou, wondered aloud if gendarmes had gone too far in a huge sweep against pedophiles after four of those arrested apparently committed suicide. Some 800 people were picked up, but only 24 remained under arrest. Human rights groups charged that defendants' rights were trampled, and relatives of one man believed to have killed himself said they would sue.  A6    U.S. Decried as Polluter  European leaders came before the United Nations and singled out the United States for failing to take forceful action on environmental issues, like reducing emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. They had gathered to review how the world has fallen short of the ambitious goals set at a conference five years ago in Rio de Janeiro.  A9    Intrigue Surrounds Pol Pot  The enemies of Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader, are likely to kill him rather than let him testify at a trial where he could implicate them, Cambodia's First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh said. He did not identify any country or person in particular, but China was once a Khmer Rouge patron and various Thai interests continue to have close links to the guerrillas.  A10    Canadian officials, meanwhile, expressed doubt that their genocide law could be used to seek extradition of Pol Pot, as the United States has suggested. The suspect would have to be present in Canada, officials noted, and Canada has no extradition treaty with Cambodia. A10    Effort to Revive Tories  William Hague, the new Tory leader, pledged to turn Britain's battered Conservatives into a ''party of the future,'' but decided to reinstall a party chairman from the Thatcher era. The choice was considered surprising because Mr. Hague has made a commitment to eliminating scandal, and the new chairman, Cecil Parkinson, 65, was once forced to leave government after his parliamentary secretary revealed she was pregnant with his child.  A11    U.N. Opens Effort on Cyprus  In a letter to the Security Council, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has called for a ''sustained process of direct negotiations'' to reach a comprehensive settlement in Cyprus. He notified the council that the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities would hold face-to-face talks in July. (Reuters)    NATIONAL A12-17, B10-11    In Reversal, Court Allows Aid in Religious Schools  The Supreme Court overturned one of its own precedents to declare that the Constitution permits public school systems to send teachers into parochial schools to teach remedial and supplemental classes to needy children. The 5-to-4 decision ends a 12-year period during which public school systems, obliged by Federal law to provide the special services to all students who qualified but barred by the Court from delivering them on parochial school premises, had to use expensive alternatives. A1    President Clinton suffered a setback in the Whitewater investigation when the Court refused to review a subpoena that orders White House lawyers to surrender notes they had taken of conversations with Hillary Rodham Clinton. A1    The Court also ruled that states may confine violent sex offenders in mental hospitals after they have served their criminal sentences, even if the offenders are not so mentally ill as to meet a state's ordinary criteria for civil commitment against their will. B11    Army Hearing Is Opened  Civilian judges on the military's highest court ordered the Army to open to the public a hearing involving sexual misconduct charges against the Army's most senior enlisted soldier. Lawyers said they could not recall any instance in which the court, which has jurisdiction over the entire military justice system, had ordered one of the military services to open a hearing that the service wanted closed. A17    Senate Alters Health Plan  Leaders of the Senate Finance Committee said they had agreed to revise their proposal to make affluent elderly people pay more for Medicare. The change would retain the idea of such a ''means test,'' but would make it easier for the Government to administer. A13    Tobacco Pact Under Attack  Critics began a concerted attack on the proposed $368 billion tobacco liability settlement, citing numerous provisions they consider too favorable to cigarette makers and demanding that major portions of the agreement be rewritten. Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General and longtime anti-tobacco crusader, called the deal ''deeply flawed.'' A17    A lawyer for the Liggett Group, the first tobacco company to negotiate a deal with government officials, said that the settlement reached with other leading tobacco companies last week could force it into bankruptcy. A16    Hubbell Faulted in Audit  Former Associate Attorney General Webster L. Hubbell overstated the amount of work he performed as a lobbyist for the Los Angeles Department of Airports in 1994 and the city should seek to recover $24,750 in fees, an inquiry by the city controller's office concluded. B11    NEW YORK/REGION  B1-9    Railway Workers Lose Asbestos Exposure Case  The Supreme Court ruled that 140 pipe fitters and underground workers from Grand Central Terminal exposed to cancer-causing asbestos dust are not entitled to seek damages from Metro North Commuter Railroad for emotional distress before the onset of actual disease. The ruling noted that the lead plaintiff, Michael Buckley, had ''suffered wrong at the hands of a negligent employer,'' but with no signs of disease or emotional distress he could not seek recourse. B1    Mayor Gains Union Support  The largest firefighters union plans to endorse the re-election effort of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who so far is faring better in the battle for union support than Republicans typically do in New York City. B1    SPORTS  B13-19    SCIENCE TIMES  C1-8    Diabetes Threshold Moved  Levels of blood sugar that have long been accepted as normal are actually too high and should be considered a sign of diabetes, according to new guidelines issued by the American Diabetes Association and endorsed by Federal health authorities. A1    Obesity Linked to Genetics  Human obesity, a condition affecting a third of Americans, has for the first time been found to have a genetic cause, at least in some cases. The condition, a defect in a gene that controls body weight, has been found in two cousins studied by scientists in England. C3    ARTS  C9-19    Insects Invade Hollywood  At least a half-dozen scripts involving insects are in various stages of development and production in Hollywood, turning them into a formidable screen presence. The last wave of insect films took place at the outset of the atomic age, exemplified by ''Them!,'' the 1954 classic about giant ants running wild in the Southwest after an atomic test. C9    BUSINESS DAY  D1-19    Gates Creates Foundation  William H. Gates, the software entrepreneur sometimes criticized for being too slow to give away his billions, is creating a new foundation that intends to spend $200 million over five years to bring new computers and the Internet into the nation's public libraries. D1    Dow Plummets at Close  The stock market plunged in a late wave of selling that turned what seemed to be a routine session into the worst of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 192.25 points, or 2.47 percent, to 7,604.26. D1    Compaq to Buy Tandem  The Compaq Computer Corporation agreed to acquire Tandem Computers in a stock swap valued around $3 billion.

As it happens, public television is having a very interesting season, although, as is often the case in public television, our attention is deflected by other things. ''The Africans'' attracts attention because it is denounced by the National Endowment for the Humanities. A literacy campaign on public television attracts attention through its own self-promotion. At the same time, observers note, public television has no smashing new dramatic series. Where is this season's ''Jewel in the Crown''? Public television seems to be off to an abysmal year.   In fact, this is not so; the season would be a success if it offered nothing more than ''The Story of English.'' The nine-part series is public television at its best, a reflection of the original reasons the system was conceived. In 1967, the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television issued the report that led to the establishment of public broadcasting as we now know it. In those early days, confidence was unbounded; the future had no limit. The commission had declared that television should, and easily could, be enlisted in the service of all good things. Public television, the commission declared, ''will be, in short, a civilized voice in a civilized community.''

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would then go to the region and seek to establish a buffer zone in southern Lebanon.   A1    The peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, known as Unifil, have been seen as ineffective, offering a sober reminder of the grueling realities of peacekeeping to politicians hoping that a new United Nations force might be the solution in Lebanon.   A10    The power and sophistication of the missile and rocket arsenal that Hezbollah has used in recent days has caught the United States and Israel off guard, and officials in both countries are just now learning the extent to which the militant group has succeeded in getting weapons from Iran and Syria.   A12    100 Civilians a Day Killed in Iraq  An average of more than 100 civilians per day were killed in Iraq last month, the United Nations reported, registering what appears to be the highest and most precise official monthly tally of violent deaths since the fall of Baghdad.   A1    Little Warning of Tsunami  Many survivors of the tsunami in Indonesia that killed more than 300 people and injured hundreds more said they had barely felt the quake and were taken by surprise when the wall of water leveled houses and hotels up to a quarter of a mile from the shore.   A12    A Potential Comeback in Ukraine  Viktor Yushchenko, the pro-West president of Ukraine, said his party would not join a broad governing coalition, opening the way for Viktor Yanukovich, above, the Russia-backed Ukrainian politician vanquished by the Orange Revolution of 2004, to make a comeback as prime minister.   A6    India Curtails Access to Blogs  The Indian government has directed local Internet service providers to block access to some Web sites that are hosts to blogs, according to government officials. The move has angered Indian bloggers, who accuse the government of censorship.   A6    NATO Hopefuls Face Obstacle  Months before NATO leaders meet for the first time in two years, strong differences are emerging within the alliance over how fast and far it should enlarge, providing an obstacle to four nations hoping to join.

A1    Vote on Stem Cell Research  The Senate defied a veto threat by President Bush and approved legislation that would expand federal support of medical research using embryonic stem cells.   A1    Ethics Inquiry Was Blocked  Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales told the Senate Judiciary Committee that President Bush had personally decided to block the Justice Department ethics unit from examining the role played by government lawyers in approving the National Security Agency's domestic eavesdropping program. A14    Reed Defeated in Georgia  Ralph Reed, the former director of the Christian Coalition and a former Republican lobbyist involved in the Jack Abramoff scandal, suffered an embarrassing defeat in his effort to win the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor of Georgia.

A1    Impact of Atlantic Yards  A study of the proposed Atlantic Yards development project in Brooklyn finds that it would clog traffic, impose new demands on the city's sewage system, require the contstruction of new schools and cost around $1.7 billion more than originally expected.

Nixon will receive some measure of honor from the university: Duke Law School, from which he graduated third in his class in 1937, will publish in the commencement program a tribute by Dean Pamela Gann.   The memorial salute, which Dean Gann wrote on April 26 to send to Mr. Nixon's family, will serve as an alternative to the moment of silence that was sought in a petition from 105 (not counting the prankster who signed Henry Kissinger's name) of the 190 students graduating from the law school this weekend. An Uneasy History    Four decades ago, shortly after he became Vice President, the university offered Mr. Nixon an honorary degree, then rescinded the gesture because of an uprising by faculty members angered at what they saw as his history of nasty campaigning. Then, in 1961, Mr. Nixon turned the tables, rejecting a degree when the offer was renewed.   And in 1981, seven years after he was forced from the Presidency by the Watergate scandal, the university decided against allowing his Presidential library to be built on campus.    Against that backdrop of strain, the law school's faculty met yesterday to discuss whether to honor the school's most famous alumnus and, if so, how. There was no vote, Dean Gann said in a statement issued later","excerpt":"publication of the tribute was her decision.    \\"The law school does not recognize the deaths of faculty, alumni or friends of the law school at its graduation,\\" the dean said. \\"An exception was made in this case because of the students' request and because President Nixon's death occurred so close in time to the graduation weekend. This particular method was chosen because the in memoriam statement provides a useful summary of Mr. Nixon's associations with the law school and his particular interest in foreign affairs in China, including the special efforts of the Duke Law School in the last 10 years to educate Chinese students about law and legal institutions.\\"   Although the issue had not been the hottest one on the Duke campus, Kate Bartlett, senior associate dean of the law school, said some opposition to honoring Mr. Nixon had remained. \\"It puts the law school in an awkward position,\\" she said, \\"where the failures of his life bear directly on our mission: the rule of law and the highest standards of ethics and accountability.\\" In a Salute, Duke Law School Will Make Peace With Nixon"},{"year":"1993","title":"A report in the Postings column on Jan. 31 about a new ornamental pergola for the New York Yacht Club identified the architects of Grand Central Terminal incompletely.

The cyber-future can wait.    The medium is a new quarterly magazine -- a print magazine -- called In Formation. Pitched as a hype buster for these high-tech times, the premiere issue, just out, announces its intentions with the acutely paranoid tag line, ''Every day, computers are making people easier to use.'' Whether that spirit takes the form of an article on the draconian implications of a nationwide student database or on the loss of privacy in a cashless society, the subtext remains the same: ''Be afraid. Be very afraid.'' Which is not to say the magazine is humorless. In a parody, ''The Internet Watch,'' the first issue cleverly skewers the hagiographic new-media profile, tracking the rise of the edgy, youthful genius behind a portable Internet device that can, on command, tell you what time it is.

The first is Isabelle Holland, formerly of Lippincott, who has a new novel coming out called &#8220;Kilgaren,&#8221; to be published by McKay. Not only that but she has another slated for the fall called &#8220;Trelawney.&#8221; Then there is Lynn Caine, who is still publicity woman with Little, Brown, and who has written, &#8220;Widow,&#8221; an account of her own life after her husband's death. Ironically, Mrs. Caine's book came about because of one of those TV shows she's always hustling to get her authors on. She appeared on a Barbara Walters &#8220;Not for Women Only&#8221; show and received offers from four publishers to write a book. One of the watchers was Sherry Arden, publicity woman at Mdrrow, who wooed Mrs. Caine at lunch, along with Joni Evans, an editor there; the book went to Morrow. Mrs. Caine says she feels schizophrenic these days, promoting other authors&#8217; books as&#8208;well as her own (when an author asks her about her book she firmly says, &#8220;No let's talk about your book&#8221;).
