The guilty parties are Michael Lobell, the producer, formerly of the garment industry, and Barry Siegel, the writer, who, between them, cooked up this frail melodrama and then hired Mr. Willis to direct it, instead of placing it decently in a garbage disposal unit.Everything about \\"Windows\\" is ridiculous","excerpt":"including the performances of Talia Shire as Emily, a young woman who is viciously attacked one night by an intruder in her Brooklyn Heights apartment, and Elizabeth Ashley as Andrea, the very rich, very psychotic lesbian poet who has hired the thug to do the deed. Andrea, madly in love with the colorless Emily, gets her thrills by listening to a tape recording of Emily's screams and groans.Before anyone rushes to his feather pen to write that I've ruined the movie by reporting too much of the plot, let me say that nothing could ruin this movie and that Andrea's part in the attack is revealed to the audience at the beginning. The movie attempts to generate suspense by making us wonder how Andrea will eventually lure Emily to a fate worse than death, plus maybe death, too. Unfortunately for us, Emily is so stupid that all Andrea has to do is call her up and ask her over, but then Emily has had a terrible shock, having just found her cat flash frozen in the fridge.How does Andrea keep up with Emily's comings and goings, her moods, her choice of television shows? Very simple. She buys a telescope, only slightly less powerful than the one at the Mount Wilson Observatory, through which she peers into Emily's uncurtained windows on the other side of the East River. The telescope is an important prop. It is, of course, a phallic symbol and it allows Andrea to watch Emily as Emily is watching \\"Now Voyager.\\"\\"Windows\\" has remarkably little pace of any kind, partly because anything of any interest happens off-screen and what happens off-screen is consistently, nuttily irrelevant. The camera-work, which Mr. Willis did for himself, is technically O.K. though it tends to rely on the kind of fancy lighting and camera angles that a less desperate director might have avoided.The supporting cast includes Kay Medford, who plays a lady next door, and Joseph Cortese as the cop who investigates Emily's attack and, for no comprehensible reason, falls in love with her. Though he's a couple of minutes too late to prevent Emily from keeping her possibly fatal rendezvous with Andrea, he does arrive before Emily's cat has defrosted.

His primary concern seems an effective and equitable tax system.   Such a system is, I would suggest, on an order of complexity similar to, perhaps beyond, what would be required to make \\"Star Wars\\" work or to make accurate long-range weather predictions. However, let us grant a technology able to generate, collate, coordinate and instantaneously update such a staggering data base. Let us also grant that corruption, inefficiencies, down-time and plain old-fashioned glitches can all be overcome. A critical issue remains.   Dr. Wachsman notes that \\"Some people might be concerned about possible abuses of civil liberties.\\" More than some, more than might, more than concerned and more than possible. Many of us are terrified of inevitable abuses.   How do we get an equitable and efficient tax system? An answer was best stated in a column in The New Republic many years ago:   Throw out virtually all the exemptions, explanations, loopholes, subsections and other detritus cluttering up the tax code, and agree that a dollar of income is a dollar of income, no matter where it comes from. Wages, tips, capital gains, bond interest, all would be taxed the same. To those of us mired in the lower reaches of the economy this plan has an endearing charm.

The excerpt indicates Lenin's desire to rid the country of any potential political opponents.                         July 17, 1922       Comrade Stalin!   On the matter of deporting Mensheviks, National Socialists, Kadets, etc. from Russia, I would like to ask a few questions, since this operation, which was started before my leave, still has not been completed.   Has the decision been made to \\"eradicate\\" all the NS's? Peshekhonov, Myakotin, Gornfeld, Petrishchev, et al.?    As far as I'm concerned, deport them all.  [ They are ]  more harmful than any SR  [ Socialist Revolutionary ]  -- because  [ they are ]  more clever.   Also A. N. Potresov, Izgoyev and all the \\"Ekonomist\\" contributors (Ozerov and many, many others). The Mensheviks, Rozanov (a physician, cunning), Vigdorchik, (Migulov or something like that), Liubov Nikolayevna Radchenko and her young daughter (rumor has it they're the vilest enemies of Bolshevism), N. A. Rozhkov (he has to be deported","excerpt":"incorrigible); S. A. Frank (author of \\"Metodologiya\\"). The commission supervised by Mantsev, Messing, et al. should present lists and several hundred such ladies and gentlemen must be deported without mercy. Let's purge Russia for a long while!                    . . .         This must be done at once. Before the end of the SRs' trial, no later. Arrest a few hundred and without a declaration of motives -- get out, ladies and gentlemen! . . .    With a communist greeting, -- LENIN  WARNING ABOUT FAMINE IN SIBERIA      A confidential      report in April 1932 illustrated the devastating effects of farm collectivization in Siberia. At the time, the Soviet authorities went to great lengths to keep the widespread famine secret from the outside world. The following is from a physician's report sent to Grigory K. Ordzhonikidze, a confidant of Stalin.   Filipp Borodin has earned 650 work-days, has a wife and 5 children ranging from one and a half to nine years of age. The wife lies ill on the oven, 3 children sit on the oven; they are as pale as wax with swollen faces. . . . Filipp Borodin himself sits on a bench and continuously smokes cigarettes made of repulsively pungent tobacco, cries like a babe, asks death for his children.    In tears he asks Comrade Sukhanov: \\"Give us at least one kilo of potatoes, give us at least one liter of milk, after all, I worked all summer and even now I work unceasingly. . . . According to the statement by Comrade Sukhanov and the brigadier of the kolkhoz \\"Red Partisan,\\" Borodin was a noncomplaining worker.   Borodin does not even have food substitutes for nourishment; two days ago he and his family ate two sickly piglets thrown out of the common farmyard. In the Borodin home there is unbelievable filth, dampness, and stench, mixed with the smell of tobacco. Borodin swears at the children: \\"The devils don't die. I wish I didn't have to look at you!\\" Having objectively investigated the condition of Borodin himself, I ascertain that he (Borodin) is starting to slip into psychosis due to starvation, which can lead to his eating his own children. . . . March 25, 1932 Regional Health Inspector Dr. KISELEV  BUKHARIN PROCLAIMS INNOCENCE    Nikolai V. Bukharin, a leading Bolshevik theorist and a friend as well as a frequent intellectual opponent of Lenin, led the so-called \\"right opposition\\" to Stalin in 1928-29 and was perhaps the most prominent victim of his purges. Here is his protestation of innocence in a February 1937 letter to Soviet leaders just before his arrest, and his plea for mercy after his conviction in a show trial on March 13, 1938, the presumed day of his execution.                         February 20, 1937       Dear Comrades!   I have sent to the Plenum of the Central Committee a two-part \\"Deposition\\" of nearly 100 pages, responding to the cloud of slander contained in the testimony. . . .    As a result of all this, I am a nervous wreck. The death of Sergo  [ Ordzhonikidze ] , whom I loved as deeply as a member of my family, was the final blow. The position in which this slander has put me, when I can neither rejoice together with my Party comrades, together with the whole country (Pushkin Days), nor grieve and mourn over the body of Sergo is an insufferable position and I cannot endure it any more.   I swear to you once again on the last breath of Ilich  [ Lenin ] , who died in my arms; on my deep love for Sergo, and on all that I hold sacred that associating me with all these acts of terrorism, sabotage, Trotskyite pacts, etc. is unheard-of base slander.                     . . .         In this most extraordinary situation, from tomorrow I will go on a full hunger strike until the charges of treason, sabotage and terrorism against me are removed. I will not live with these accusations. . . . Farewell.  Be victorious.  Yours,  N. BUKHARIN  A Plea for Mercy    I beg the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. for mercy. I consider the verdict of the court to be just punishment for my most grave transgressions against the socialist motherland, its people, party, and government. There is not a single word of protest in my soul. I should be shot ten times for my crimes. . . .    If I allow myself to petition the highest government organ in our land, before which I appear on my knees, it is only because I believe that through a pardon I can be of value to my country; I do not say -- and I am not able to say -- that I can expiate my guilt; the crimes I committed are so monstrous, so enormous, that I cannot atone for the guilt -- no matter what I may do for the rest of my life. But I assure the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet that my stay of more than a year in prison has forced me to do a great deal of thinking and to reconsider much from my criminal past. . . .    Step by step, I have re-examined my past life. The former Bukharin has already died; he no longer lives on this earth.                     . . .         Let a new, second Bukharin grow -- let him even be  [ called ]  Petrov -- this new man will be the complete antithesis of the one who has died. He has already been born -- give him the opportunity of any kind of work at all. . . . I shall strive to prove to you, with every fiber of my being, that this gesture of proletarian generosity was justified.  Nikolai Bukharin. Moscow, March 13, 1938. Internal N.K.V.D. prison. ANDROPOV NAMES HIS ENEMIES      A memorandum written by the head of the K.G.B., Yuri V. Andropov, on Nov. 15, 1976, gives details on the activities of leading dissidents and steps taken against them. Mr. Andropov later succeeded Leonid I. Brezhnev as Soviet leader, holding power from 1982 until his death in February 1984.      In recent years our adversary's special services and propaganda bureaus have attempted to give the impression that a so-called \\"internal opposition\\" exists in the U.S.S.R., rendering support to those who inspire antisocial and anti-Soviet activities and promote the banding together of participants in a variety of anti-Soviet activities.   Accordingly, in 1969 antisocial elements headed by Yakir and Krasin founded an \\"initiative group\\" in order to form an organization made up of participants of the so-called \\"movement for democratization.\\"   In 1970, in order to activate the antisocial efforts of individuals with hostile leanings, Chalidze established the so-called \\"Committee for the Protection of Human Rights\\" which, in addition to himself, includes among its members Academician Sakharov and Shafarevich, a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.   In 1973 the so-called \\"Russian Section\\" of Amnesty International, headed by Turchin and Tverdokhlebov, assumed organizational responsibilities for individuals with anti-Soviet leanings.                     . . .         As a result of measures taken by the Committee for State Security, the \\"initiative group\\" and the \\"Committee for the Protection of Human Rights\\" have been completely compromised and have virtually ceased to exist. The activities of the \\"Russian Section\\" have been curtailed.   Nevertheless, despite the failure to create an \\"internal opposition\\" in the U.S.S.R., our adversary has not abandoned this idea.   On May 12 of this year, on the initiative of Yuri F. Orlov, born in 1924, unemployed, corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian S.S.R., the antisocial elements announced the formation of a \\"Group for Implementation of the Helsinki Accords in the U.S.S.R.\\"   This \\"group\\" includes the following individuals: Ginzburg, A. I., has on numerous occasions been brought to criminal accountability, born 1936, Jew, unemployed; Grigorenko, P. G., born 1907, Ukrainian, retiree; the professional criminal Marchenko, A. T., born 1938, Russian, in exile in Irkutsk Oblast;  [ also ]  the Jewish extremists: Rubin, V. A., born 1913, Jew, emigrated to Israel; Shcharansky, A. D., born 1948, Jew, unemployed; and Slepak, V. S., born 1927, Jew, unemployed;  [ also ]  participants in various hostile activities: Sakharov's wife Bonner, Ye. G., born 1922, Jew, retiree; Bernshtam, M. S., born 1949, Jew, emigrated to Israel; Landa, M. N., born 1918, Jew, retiree, unemployed; Alekseyeva, L. M., born 1927, Russian, unemployed, and Korchak, A. A., born 1922, Ukrainian, fellow at the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Transmission, Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.                    . . .         The Committee for State Security is taking measures to compromise and put an end to the \\"group's\\" hostile activities.   Reported by way of information. Chairman of the Committee on State Security  ANDROPOV  K.G.B. WARNING ON CHERNOBYL      More than seven years before the Cherno     byl nuclear disaster, the K.G.B., led by An     dropov, had reported to the Central Committee of the Soviet Union that there were serious design and construction problems at the power station.                         February 21, 1979         According to data in the possession of the K.G.B. of the U.S.S.R., design deviations and violations of construction and assembly technology are occurring at various places in the construction of the second generating unit of the Chernobyl A.E.S. and these could lead to mishaps and accidents.   The structural pillars of the generator room were erected with a deviation of up to 100 mm. from the reference axes, and horizontal connections between the pillars are absent in places.    Wall panels have been installed with a deviation of up to 150 mm. from the axes. The placement of roof plates does not conform to the designer's specifications. Crane tracks and stopways have vertical drops of up to 100 mm. and in places a slope of up to 8  .   Deputy head of the Construction Directorate, Comrade V. T. Gora, gave instructions for backfilling the foundation in many places where vertical waterproofing was damaged. Similar violations were permitted in other sections with the knowledge of Comrade V. T. Gora and the head of the construction group, Comrade Yu. L. Matveyev. Damage to the waterproofing can lead to ground water seepage into the station and radioactive contamination of the environment.   The leadership of the Directorate is not devoting proper attention to the foundation, on which the quality of the construction largely depends.
