But in &#8220;The Return of the Fly,&#8221; Mr. Price took over everything (I still carry around with me a troubling if somewhat vague memory of Mr. Price's staring in horror at a friend who has just been turned into a giant bunny &#8208; rabbit)&#8212;and the result was dreadful, or, as Myra Breckinridge might put it, de trop. And so it goes with Gore Vidal's two novels. The first seemed original, surprising, a classic of its kind (since it was the only one of its kind, it could hardly avoid being such), and its only flaw was its somewhat too clever ending, in which Myra is hit by a car and transformed back to masculine Myron by the resulting surgery. But in &#8220;Myron,&#8221; Mr. Vidal's cleverness takes over everything, and if the result is not so bad as to be dreadful, it is certainly a shade too much.

It is screen entertainment for the few, but for those few it should be a treasure trove. In seeking out the sculptural oddities with which medieval man directed that utilitarian architectural lines be dissimulated, the camera occasionally allows brief glimpses, through a cross-hatching of flying buttresses, of surrounding Paris. These are a relief from the minutiae with which the rest of the flim concerns itself, as too are the sweeping shots of the vaulted nave, its Gothic gloom pierced by shafts of clerestory light and of the side aisles dimly illumined through the tracery of the stained windows.In the main, however, \\"Mysteries of Notre Dame\\" is a close examination of the sculptural and architectural treasures of the cathedral, in full and in detail, to a palling, if musically magnificent, score played on the great Notre Dame organ. Cathedrals have fallen in war, and should Nôtre Dame de Paris ever be laid waste, however unthinkable that may be, this film, conceived and executed by men who choose to remain anonymous, will remain as a record of the sort of effort and genius men expend to provide proper earthly abodes for their gods.

But this summer, through Aug. 29, there is an exemplary Balthus show at the Musee des Beaux-Arts in Lausanne. Switzerland is the country where Balthus now lives and works (he was born in Paris of Polish parents) and where he spent some of the most inspired moments of his youth. The earliest work in the show is \\"Mitsou,\\" a small volume of 40 drawings he made in Geneva at the age of 11, depicting the saga of a missing cat. The German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, an intimate of Balthus's mother, wrote the introduction to the book, which attracted the attention of numerous literary figures and artists -- Bonnard among them -- who regarded Balthus as a prodigy of artistic invention.

Pursuing this strange and fleeting creature, he finds himself rather dangerously aware of a project of surreptitious commerce in which his lady appears to be involved. And being possessed of such knowledge and a love for his lady, none the less, he goes on until he discovers the villain, et cetera.It is not that the story is so potent or the drama so breathlessly intense. Winston Graham's little plot is only average and the telling breaks down toward the end. But there's something about the casual manner in which the picture initially unfolds that captivates moderate interest and excites a favorable respect. And then, as the romance develops, under the direction of Anthony Pelissier, and the force of Mr. Farrar emerges, the attraction gains stature and strength.Credit not only Mr. Farrar. His acting of the solemn, almost sightless man is matched, in the build-up of the romance, by that of Nadia Gray, a very lovely and interesting creature who suggests intrigue and mystery. And some good solid minor performances are delivered by a bilingual cast, jabbering away in French and English, which includes Maurice Teynac, Gerard Landry and Ina de la Haye. The air of the Riviera is strangely enchanting, too, as it floats out from real French streets and bistros.Put this down as a likely one to see.

He's right to argue that in the former Yugoslavia the myth makers are also the murderers. But let's not forget whose myths have caused the most murders.   When the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, wanted to shut down the autonomous region of Kosovo, he harked back to Serbia's defeat there in 1389. When the Slovenes and Croats, fearing for their own status in a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, chose independence, Mr. Milosevic's regime resurrected the ghosts of World War II collaboration with the Nazis.

Maybe it was the price -- half that of high-grade Japanese rice. Maybe it was the shortage of domestic rice, which is why the foreign stuff is being allowed in. In any event, it was the shattering of another myth about Japanese consumers. Who said they would never eat foreign rice?

I hear from legislators who complain that the liberal arts are out of step with the times: a luxury education appropriate to periods of prosperity.  The future of the nation rests with the new technologies.  I speak with students who ask if it wouldn't be wiser to study engineering, medical technology or welding.

In pairing these works, Mr. Crutchfield is saluting Verdi in his anniversary year by honoring the Bel Canto heritage from which he emerged, which Rossini epitomized.

Though the Caramoor Festival has never paid much attention to contemporary music, tonight it will present the acclaimed contemporary music ensemble Eighth Blackbird in a program of works by Michael Torke, Daniel Kellogg and Frederic Rzewski. And on Sunday the pianist Mitsuko Uchida, who plays Schubert exquisitely, presents three works of Schubert (Sonata in E flat, D. 568, Sonata in A, D. 664, Six ''Moments Musicaux'') as well as Webern's Variations, Op. 27, to add a jostling 20th-century jolt to the program.

First, Espada's work bears witness to the sufferings of Hispanics or Latinos, not ''Latin Americans,'' since these people live (and suffer) in the United States. Second, Espada's father wasn't ''a Puerto Rican immigrant'' -- Puerto Ricans are United States citizens. Third, it is incorrect to say that a deserter from the Salvadoran Army ''escapes to America,'' since El Salvador is in America -- Central America.    Beyond these common errors is the slightly dismissive and rather grudging appreciation of Espada's work: from the comment that his titles sound like ''wry magic realist novels'' to the observation that he gives Native Americans and the Irish ''their due'' (which suggests that he has a Checklist of Oppressed People rather than that he responds to universal human hardships, including racism, famine and genocide). And finally, the comment about his ''occasional righteous rant'' reduces Espada to the cultural stereotype of the political firebrand; to my mind, his poetry is in the tradition of Neruda and Hikmet -- two poets for whom the suffering of the ''marginalized'' is frequently addressed.

Mr. R&#237;os Montt is a former general and evangelical minister, and 22 years ago he seized power in a coup. His brief rule was vicious; tens of thousands of peasants were killed and hundreds of villages razed as the army carried out a scorched-earth war against a small band of leftist guerrillas. Guatemala today is riven by criminal gangs -- many of them former soldiers -- and Mr. R&#237;os Montt promises an iron hand against them.   Tim Weiner   The Week Ahead; IN GUATEMALA, A RETURN?"},{"year":"2003","title":"SERVANTS OF THE MAP: Stories, by Andrea Barrett. (Norton, $13.95.) Though these tales are complete in themselves and span nearly two centuries, they are linked by threads of family, neighborhood or sexual involvement, and the characters share a longing for the restoration of the past and a questing scientific spirit -- a wonder at the workings of the universe. Last year in the Book Review, Barry Unsworth praised the author's ''originality and wit'' and called this ''a most distinguished collection.''    THE DRESSING STATION: A Surgeon's Chronicle of War and Medicine, by Jonathan Kaplan. (Grove, $14.) A South African surgeon tells of his peripatetic career on the battlefields of hot zones like Kurdistan, Eritrea, Myanmar and Mozambique, as well as on the deck of a cruise ship and in a London stress clinic. ''Kaplan's sense of adventure, his humanity, his willingness to take great personal risks are admirable,'' Abraham Verghese said here last year. '' 'The Dressing Station' is an important chronicle of the life of an uncommon surgeon.''    THE HAUNTING OF L., by Howard Norman. (Picador, $14.) In this Gothic novel, a young man makes a mistake when he accepts a job in 1920's Manitoba assisting a photographer who specializes in causing train wrecks and other disasters, which he is then on hand to record. His second mistake is sleeping with his employer's wife. ''Love, death and photography collide in the climactic final pages,'' Stacey D'Erasmo wrote here in 2002.    AT SWIM, TWO BOYS, by Jamie O'Neill. (Scribner, $15.) Accidental heroes and ramshackle future soldiers (including two boys who discover their love for each other) fill this novel about the hazards of romantic desire, heroism and tenderness in Dublin during the time of the Easter Rising in 1916. The result is a tale ''in which free Ireland rubs shoulders with the notion of a free gay nation,'' Michael Pye said here last year. ''O'Neill has written a dangerous, glorious book: the kind that is likely to make absolutely anyone cry and laugh in public places.''    LINCOLN'S GREATEST SPEECH: The Second Inaugural, by Ronald C. White Jr. (Simon & Schuster, $14.) In this study, a professor of American religious history animates the time, setting and meaning of the Second Inaugural, Abraham Lincoln's sermon on the origins and paradoxes of the Civil War. ''White is very good on Lincoln's rhetorical techniques,'' Max Byrd said here in 2002. ''He also has a good eye for the vivid quotation.'' Lincoln's Virtues: An Ethical Biography, by William Lee Miller (Vintage, $15), focuses on Lincoln's moral and intellectual development up to the Civil War, arguing that he was not just an astute politician but ''an extraordinary thinker.'' ''Is it possible to say something new about Lincoln?'' Eric Foner asked here last year. ''The somewhat surprising answer . . . is yes.''    HOOP ROOTS, by John Edgar Wideman. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) The author, an accomplished writer, professor and playground basketball player, uses his decision to abandon his beloved game at the age of 59 as an opportunity to reflect on his life, his career and his sorrows: among them, a failed marriage, a son in prison and the injuries of racism. His memoir, which ''comes across as truest when he rhapsodizes and when he tells stories,'' displays ''considerable power as an act of furious compensation,'' Will Blythe wrote in these pages in 2001.    FOR YOUR EYE ALONE, by Robertson Davies. Edited by Judith Skelton Grant. (Penguin, $16.) As prolific in his correspondence as he was in other literary genres, the Canadian novelist and playwright reveals both his warmer and his feistier, politically incorrect sides in this selection of letters from his final decades (1976-95). The volume provides ''a candid and sometimes poignant view of an aging master determined to write as many books as his failing body will allow,'' Diane Cole said here in 2001.    MONSTRUARY, by Juli&#225","excerpt":"n R&#237;os. (Northwestern University, $19.95.) The premise of this phantasmagoric Spanish novel about a fictional painter named Victor Mons is that artists are possessed by the devil. The narrative swirls with literary wordplay and allusions to well-known artists, and ''presents idiosyncratic but entertaining thought sequences that reflect a rare blend of erudition and gut impulse,'' Nicholas Fox Weber wrote here in 2001.

Dynastic rule in the North China Plain began around 2000 B.C. The unifying Qin (221 B.C.) and Han (206 B.C.) dynasties greatly expanded the territory of the empire and established the basic pattern of imperial bureaucratic government that would endure until the beginning of the 20th century. Major dynasties during that period include the Han (206 B.C.—A.D. 220), Tang (618–907), Song (960–1279), Yuan or Mongol (1279–1368), Ming (1368–1644), and Qing (1644–1911). By the late 18th century, the Qing dynasty faced increasingly dangerous problems of explosive population growth, bureaucratic stagnation, and trade pressure from the West. Opium—introduced by Great Britain to balance its trade in tea, silk, porcelain, and other goods—created severe social problems. Western demands for free trade resulted in the Opium War (1839–42), in which China was humiliatingly defeated by the British. The treaties of Nanjing (1842) and Tianjin (1858) opened China to Western merchants and missionaries and created foreign-ruled enclaves on Chinese soil. At the same time, the Taiping Rebellion and other popular uprisings led to the deaths of at least 20 million Chinese between 1850 and 1870. Such reform efforts as the Self-Strengthening Movement (1870's) and the 1898 Reform Movement proved inadequate to the task of strengthening and modernizing China's dynastic government. Japan, modernizing rapidly after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, joined the race for commercial access to China, decisively winning the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95. The antiforeign Boxer Uprising of 1900 was put down by a joint foreign military force, dealing a mortal blow to Qing rule. On Oct. 10, 1911, the dynasty fell to a coalition of forces led by the veteran revolutionary nationalist Sun Yat-sen. China's first attempt at republican government, under Pres. Yuan Shikai and subsequent presidents, quickly degenerated into factionalism and warlord control in the provinces. In 1915 Japan successfully demanded further concessions, provoking public outcries. When news reached China on May 4, 1919, that the Treaty of Versailles granted Japan all of Germany's former concessions in China, students rioted throughout the country, demanding reforms and modernization (the May Fourth Movement). Sun Yat-sen's Nationalist party (Kuomintang, or KMT) and the Chinese Communist party (CCP, founded in 1921 by Mao Zedong) joined forces in 1922 in an attempt to create a second republican revolution. Sun Yat-sen died in 1925. His successor, Chiang Kai-shek, consolidated KMT forces in Guangzhou and mounted the Northern Expedition (1927–29) to defeat or co-opt the various provincial warlords and reunify the country. In the course of this successful effort, Chiang turned on his Communist allies. A series of failed Communist uprisings and KMT anti-Communist extermination campaigns between 1927 and 1934 nearly wiped out the CCP. Remnants of the party broke out of encirclement in Jiangxi Province in 1934 and undertook the 6,000-mile Long March to a secure base in Yan'an, Shanxi Province. There, under Mao, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De, the CCP recovered its strength. In the Xi'an Incident of December 1936, Chiang was kidnapped by mutinous KMT allies and forced at gunpoint to agree to forming a United Front with the CCP against Japan. Meanwhile Japan continued its penetration of China, with the assassination of Manchurian warlord and KMT ally Jiang Zuolin in 1928, the invasion of Manchuria on Sept. 18, 1931, and the establishment of the puppet state of Manchuguo in 1934. On July 7, 1937, fighting erupted between Japanese and Chinese troops near Beijing. The Japanese rapidly moved south to the Yangtse Valley, bombing and capturing Shanghai. The Nationalist capital at Nanjing fell in November 1937, amid widespread atrocities against civilians. The KMT army and government retreated to a wartime capital at Chongqing. The remainder of World War II in China was largely a stalemate, with Japan occupying most of the country. KMT-held areas opposed the Japanese with conventional forces (supported, after 1941, by the Americans), while the Communists harassed the Japanese with guerrilla tactics. At the end of World War II, American forces ensured that the KMT would receive Japan's surrender throughout most of China, giving the Nationalists a commanding position while U.S. general George Marshall attempted to mediate the creation of a KMT-CCP coalition government. That effort failed, and civil war broke out. The KMT advantage was dissipated by ruinous inflation, corruption, mismanagement, and military ineffectiveness. At the end of 1947, with the Communist forces making continual advances, the United States pulled out of China. After losing several major battles throughout 1948–49, KMT forces retreated to Taiwan; in Beijing, Mao Zedong proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) on Oct. 1, 1949. With U.S. backing, the Republic of China established a temporary capital at Taipei and continued to claim sovereignty over all of China, retaining China's seat in the U.N. The PRC was quickly granted diplomatic recognition by Soviet bloc nations and some Western nations, notably Great Britain, but was effectively isolated in most international affairs by American support for Nationalist China. Chinese troops entered the Korean War in November 1950, as U.N. forces approached the Sino-Korean border at the Yalu River. This direct confrontation between China and the United States forestalled any possibility of normal contacts for more than two decades. Within China the CCP rapidly consolidated its control of the country and began rebuilding the nation after decades of warfare. Priority was given to land reform. Land was confiscated from landlords and returned to peasant ownership; landlords and other “class enemies” were tried and condemned by People's Courts set up under party auspices. Under the first five-year plan (1953), peasants were urged to set up rural cooperatives, while industrial recovery began with Soviet assistance. Artists, writers, and intellectuals were ordered to devote themselves to the service of the party and the nation. In 1956 Mao announced a policy of “let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend,” inviting criticism of the party and government. He was shocked by the vigor of the criticism; many critics were sent to labor camps in the ensuing Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957. Angered by the arrogance of Soviet advisers and by Soviet refusal to share nuclear weapons technology with China, Mao broke with the Soviet Union and expelled all Soviet personnel in 1958. At the same time, he announced the policy of the Great Leap Forward, under which China was to make progress on all fronts without outside aid. Huge rural communes took the place of peasant smallholdings and cooperatives, and agriculture was placed under the direction of centralized planning. In industry, labor and enthusiasm were expected to make up for a shortage of capital and technical expertise. The Great Leap was a catastrophic failure, causing widespread famine and social dislocation, as Mao admitted in a forced self-criticism in 1960. Mao withdrew into the background as a group of party pragmatists led by Liu Shaoqi assumed power in the early 1960's. In foreign affairs Chinese shelling of the Nationalist-held offshore islands of Quemoy and Matsu in 1958 led to a crisis in the Taiwan Straits, patrolled by the U.S. Seventh Fleet to prevent a recurrence of China's civil war. A rebellion in Tibet in 1959 was suppressed with much bloodshed, and the dalai lama fled to India. Chinese troop movements into Tibet contributed to the outbreak in 1960 of a border war with India. Throughout the 1960's China worried about being drawn into the Vietnam War. In late 1965 Mao made a bid to return to full power. His vehicle was the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, formally launched in 1966. Shock troops of teenage Red Guards were used to attack the entrenched party bureaucracy; Liu Shaoqi was placed under house arrest, and other prominent officials, including Deng Xiaoping, were exiled to rural areas. By 1968 internal disorder was so great that the military intervened to restore control in many areas. Most established organs of power were replaced under the Cultural Revolution by Revolutionary Committees; intellectuals, technical workers, and bureaucrats were severely persecuted. In 1971 Mao's second-in-command, Marshal Lin Biao, staged an abortive coup and died while attempting to flee the country. With Mao increasingly old and ill, most of his power was exercised by his wife, Jiang Qing, and her associates. Her rival, Premier Zhou Enlai, attempted to maintain orderly government functions in the face of this turmoil. The 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia convinced Mao that the U.S.S.R. was a greater threat to China than America, and he quietly encouraged the growth of better relations with the U.S. With tacit American approval, the PRC replaced the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the U.N. on Oct. 25, 1971. During Feb. 21–28, 1972, U.S. president Richard Nixon visited China. The Shanghai Communiqué, issued at the end of that visit, clarified the positions of both sides and paved the way for the resumption of U.S.-China relations short of formal diplomatic recognition. Zhou Enlai died in January 1976, and Deng Xiaoping became acting premier. In April 1976 a rally in Beijing commemorating Zhou's birthday was dispersed by police on orders from Jiang Qing, and a riot ensued. Deng was dismissed from office. But when Mao died on Sept. 9, 1976, Deng reemerged as China's paramount leader, behind the new acting premier and acting party chairman, figurehead Hua Guofeng. Jiang Qing and three associates were arrested along with many of their allies. Labeled the Gang of Four, Jiang Qing's clique was blamed for all the ills of the Cultural Revolution; they were tried and convicted for crimes against the state in 1981. China's post-Mao transformation took a decisive turn in 1978, with the announcement of the policy of the Four Modernizations (agriculture, industry, science and technology, and defense). Foreign investment and technology transfer were encouraged, and thousands of students were sent to study abroad. In the winter of 1978–79, the authorities tolerated the public posting of written critiques of the government (“Democracy Wall”). Deng consolidated power in his own hands, still acting behind the scenes; Hua Guofeng was dismissed from office, while Deng's allies Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang were promoted to leadership of the party and government in 1982. On Jan. 1, 1979, China and the United States entered into formal diplomatic relations; the United States rescinded its recognition of the Republic of China as China's legal government but maintained separate nongovernmental relations with the ROC under the Taiwan Relations Act. China's relations with Vietnam deteriorated in 1978 following Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia. In February 1979, China attempted, with little success, to “teach Vietnam a lesson” in a brief but violent border war. A conflict with Great Britain was resolved in 1984 as both sides agreed that Hong Kong would be returned to Chinese sovereignty, but with considerable local autonomy, in 1997. Relations with the Soviet Union remained strained, China insisting that no improvement could come before the U.S.S.R. reduced its troop concentrations on the Sino-Soviet border, withdrew from Afghanistan, and pressured Vietnam into withdrawing from Cambodia. China's overall foreign-policy stance in the post-Mao era has been low-key and nonconfrontational. In the 1980's, China achieved spectacular improvements in agricultural production through dismantling rural communes and returning land to individual peasant holdings under long-term leases. Small-scale private enterprise has been encouraged in both rural and urban areas. Reform in industry and in the centrally controlled price structure has been harder to achieve and has led to such side effects as inflation and increased corruption. Within the overall context of reform, factions of relatively more conservative and reformist leaders have coexisted uneasily. A conservative drive against “spiritual pollution” in 1986 was quickly blunted by Deng, but in January 1987, the reformist party-secretary Hu Yaobang was ousted after student demonstrations calling for more democracy. The CCP 12th Party Congress in October 1987 forced the retirement of some older conservatives, named the reformist Zhao Ziyang as party secretary, and elevated the conservative pragmatist Li Peng as premier. In April 1989 student demonstrators in Beijing mourning the death of Hu Yaobang launched a general movement for greater democracy. Demonstrators began a hunger strike and disrupted a summit visit by Soviet president Gorbachev. Martial law was proclaimed in May as demonstrations spread to other cities. Troops opened fire in Tienanmen Square on June 3–4, killing hundreds of demonstrators. In the aftermath, Zhao Ziyang was replaced as party secretary by Jiang Zemin, thousands of protesters and suspected dissidents were arrested (and an unknown number executed), and hard-liners in the government took firm control of the country. World opinion was outraged by the Tienanmen incident; the United States and many other countries instituted sanctions against China, tourism plummeted, and the economy went into general decline. International trade resumed during 1989–90, and the U.S. renewed China's most-favored-nation status in June 1990 after several hundred dissidents were released from prison. China strove to put Tienanmen Square behind it by holding speedy trials of those charged in connection with demonstrations. The government also made overtures to the former U.S.S.R., and from its permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council supported coalition efforts against Iraq in the Persian Gulf conflict. Economic sanctions were lifted by Western governments in 1991. China continued to pursue its economic reform policies while repressing all signs of political dissent. While national politics, dominated by an aging leadership, seemed torpid and adrift, the private-sector economy continued to grow vigorously. In 1992–93 runaway growth made China's economy the world's fourth-largest by some standards of measurement. This resulted in higher wages and increased consumer spending, but also widening income disparities, increased corruption, smuggling, theft, etc. Deng's long-expected death, in 1997, produced little immediate effect on the Chinese leadership, except for a new crackdown as leaders competed to seem tough on dissent. But the transition of power to Jiang Zemin, 71, went smoothly. Domestic affairs in general were overshadowed by national jubilation over the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovreignty on July 1, 1997. (Macao would follow, in December 1999, after 442 years as a Portuguese colony.) In June 1997, America's Congress voted to renew China's most-favored-nation trade status despite misgivings about its dismal human-rights record. Pres. Clinton made a long state visit in 1998 and appeared on Chinese TV criticizing China for human rights abuses and urged Mr. Jiang to open Chinese society. Undismayed, the Chinese government proceeded to crush the fledgling China Democracy Party, sentencing three of its leaders to long prison terms for subversion. In Feb. 1999, new missiles menaced Taiwan; tensions grew worse in July when Taiwan's president said publicly that his country was a separate Chinese state. When the U.S. accused China of nuclear spying in the U.S., China's response was: “typical racial prejudice”. In the face of not only these issues but also the newer “human rights” issue of China's ban on and persecution of the Falun Gong religious movement, the U.S. reached a trade agreement with China at the end of 1999 (as had Japan in July). In 2001 China signed a 20-year Friendship Treaty with Russia, the first since the end of the Cold War; short on details, it pledged peaceful settlement of border disputes and coordination against threats of aggression. In Nov. 2002 the 16th Communist Party Congress named Hu Jintao as Party Secretary, replacing Jiang Zemin, and the National People's Congress formally ratified the Party decisions. Jiang remains as chairman of the Central Military Commission and unofficial eminence grise. China"},{"year":"1930","title":"N.L.
