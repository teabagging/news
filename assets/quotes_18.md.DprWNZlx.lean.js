The issue is urgent because of the closer economic integration the European Community is to adopt at the end of the year. The sale has revived a drive to establish a list of national treasures that may not be removed from the country, a procedure similar to those in other countries, like France.    Experts say the painting could bring a record auction price for a Holbein, about $25 million. It is a 21-by-15-inch portrait of an Englishwoman painted during Holbein's first stay in England, from 1526 to 1528. Directors of England's national museums say that it is a national treasure and that they were not given a chance to buy it before it was consigned to Christie's.    Meanwhile, the Marquess of Cholmondeley, who is selling the Holbein, maintains that the price is way beyond any of the English museums' budgets anyway. Lord Cholmondeley inherited a fortune estimated at more than $170 million in 1990, but he says his income is not enough to maintain his two estates, Cholmondeley in Cheshire and Houghton Hall in Norfolk, where the painting has hung since 1780. He says the proceeds from the sale will be used for that purpose.   In last week's announcement, Christie's also said that in the same auction it would sell \\"The Old Horse Guards From St. James's Park,\\" by Canaletto, which is estimated to bring about $5 million, and \\"Daniel and Cyrus Before the Idol of Bel,\\" dated 1633, by Rembrandt, which may fetch about $13 million. These rare artworks coming up for sale simultaneously has only increased the outcry by people in the English art world who are worried that owners of stately homes are rushing to sell their prized possessions before the Government can issue a list of works that may not be exported.   \\"There's a certain nervousness,\\" said Lord Gowrie, a former Arts Minister who is the chairman of Sotheby's in London. \\"The changing of the European Community rules, the upcoming elections and a big drop in agricultural income are all reasons people are thinking of selling art right now. It's only natural they want to sell before any changes are announced.\\"   What the British art world fears most is that the rich J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., or a private collector from outside Britain will buy the Holbein. Museum experts in the United States refused to talk for attribution, saying only that bidding on the painting might be more trouble than the work is worth. They fear that the British Government's review Committee on Export Works of Art would prevent the painting from leaving London and that if the Holbein does leave England, the bad publicity could bring changes in Britain's export laws.    Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery in London, refused to talk to the press about the Holbein but issued a statement calling it \\"one of the greatest of Holbein's works of this kind\\" and saying, \\"Its retention in this country is therefore of great importance.\\" Mr. MacGregor went on to write that Lord Cholmondeley made clear that unless $25 million \\"could be produced at once, the sale would go ahead in April.\\" The sum is well beyond the museum's annual purchase grant from the Government, which is less than $5 million.   While Lord Cholmondeley refused to be interviewed, he wrote a letter published last week in The Daily Telegraph in response to Mr. MacGregor. In it he said: \\"We did discuss with Neil MacGregor and the Director of the National Heritage Memorial Fund the possibility of a private treaty sale. They agreed that even the minimum figure required would be out of reach of their combined purses.  However, the door remains open.\\" He added that \\"while I deplore the lack of Government funding for museums, I feel that owners of works of art should not be blamed for trying to achieve fair prices, especially, as in our case, when the proceeds will be used to preserve another, undoubtedly more vital part of the national heritage: one of the greatest historic houses, Houghton Hall in Norfolk and its collection of furniture and paintings.\\"   Timothy Clifford, director of the National Gallery in Edinburgh, said: \\"In the end I don't think the British will let it out of the country. But I can understand Lord Cholmondeley's point of view. He wants as much money as possible.\\" The National Gallery in Edinburgh has an unparalleled collection of works by Titian and Poussin on loan from the Duke of Sutherland, and Mr. Clifford is concerned that what happens to the Holbein may set a precedent for what could happen to the Duke's paintings if the Duke ever considers selling them.   Mr. Clifford suggested that several national museums in Britain buy the painting together and share it.   Christie's was prepared for the uproar. Predictably, it is trying to divorce itself from the debate. \\"We knew it would attract a lot of attention,\\" said Noel Annesley, deputy chairman of Christie's International \\"The auction house is only acting as agents not advisers. Lord Cholmondeley has been debating about the sale of the Holbein for two years and decided to push the button now.\\"   Lord Gowrie said: \\"It's important that the Government should step in. But as a nation we're prone to crying wolf, to say that everything's important and a national treasure. The only problem is that this time I think it's true.\\"  Fakes Are Everywhere    \\"Of course we have fakes: every museum does,\\" said Marian Burleigh-Motley, who runs the education division at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \\"People should be more aware of what fakes mean and know what to look for.\\" As a result, Ms. Burleigh-Motley has organized a series of eight lectures on Tuesday nights using fakes from the Metropolitan's collections. The series, called \\"Understanding Fakes,\\" runs from March 10 to April 28. Each week different members of the museum's curatorial and conservation staff will explore such subjects as the definition of a fake, motives for producing fakes and changing tastes in fakery.   \\"We will also be showing new techniques for determining that things are not original,\\" Ms. Burleigh-Motley said. The series costs $70","excerpt":"individual lectures are $10. Information: (212) 570-3949.  Recession in London    London art dealers have been as hard hit by the recession as those in New York City.

The Odette Gilbert, a gallery that has been on Cork Street nine years, has already closed.

There are so many classic riffs, exquisite harmonies and memorable melodies already in circulation, a personal vision can easily get lost. On Saturday night at the Academy, Matthew Sweet performed a captivating balancing act. The Nebraska-born singer sounded like a graduate of the academy of pop songwriting, with a major in Lennon-McCartney and a minor in Neil Young. He also sounded like a passionate and introspective soul, with a gift for turning songs into tugs-of-war between desire and apathy.   On lead guitar, Richard Lloyd, a veteran of the late-1970's New York band Television, strove for understatement. Between verses, his guitar squealed but never screamed. Mr. Sweet played rhythm guitar as if he was searching for the perfect strum. Will Rigby, former drummer for the dB's, maintained a light and consistent drumbeat, rarely breaking into a solo. Tony Marsico kept his bass to a minimal throb. The restrained music pressed at the seams of each song, threatening to burst into abrasive noise at any moment. This tension heightened the effect of \\"Someone to Pull the Trigger\\" and \\"Devil With the Green Eyes,\\" songs delivered from the point of view of someone two steps from the edge.

Although Indonesian sculpture has its share of disruptive figures, including the fanged, four-armed, skull-crowned Bhairava mounted on his jackal, most of the figures in this show are serene. This is very much the art of an essentially peaceful nation that was for an extended period at ease with itself.   The objects in this show are in metal and stone. Most are statues and statuettes, but some are bells, finials and lamps. Some of the metal sculptures are tiny, and a couple of the four-inch-tall seated bronze figures could probably make an entire room seem like a shrine. The stone sculptures are virtually all single figures, couples or narrative reliefs. Throughout the show, the blend of informality and formality, opulence and simplicity generates a sense of haunting wholeness. Many of the sculptures in this show seem to have the capacity to see, some of them with gold and silver eyes.

But when Mr. Gusmao sought to read his own 27-page defense, he was silenced by the court.    That was unusual even by Indonesia's authoritarian standards.

Insects Everywhere    Summer brings out the worst in some gardens - the winged and crawling beasties that can make short work of planting efforts if not brought under control. Many of the pests can be destroyed quite simply either by handpicking and a quick stomp of the foot (great for caterpillars) or swift water sprays from the hose. At last resort, chemicals can be used. But try the easiest methods first. Here are some pests to be alert for: Caterpillars: If big holes are appearing on geraniums, tomatoes, petunias, groundcovers and some ornamental shrubs, be suspect and look under leaves, along stems and near the soil. The damage just could be caused by one or two or three caterpillars. The quickest way to stop the trouble is to collect the caterpillars and stomp them under foot. Quite often this ends the feeding. Snap off the badly damaged leaves, give the plants a good soaking with a quick-acting water-soluble fertilizer and everything should grow along nicely.

To prepare them for city and suburban living, many suppliers &#8220;housebreak&#8221; these trees by giving them a few weeks&#8217; acclimatization a greenhouse.
