Population losses were most severe in the farm belt of the Middle West, because of the depressed agricultural economy, and in some old industrial cities that have not recovered from plant closings.   The Middle Atlantic region, composed of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, showed a marked improvement from the 1970's. New York, which lost 683,000 people in the 1970's, showed a gain of 119,000 people since 1980, to 17.7 million, virtually all outside New York City, which remained static.

While inflation has eroded their purchasing power, many retirees have received pension increases to compensate. And those improvements along with Social Security increases mean that they are often no worse off - and sometimes better off - than active workers whose real incomes have also shrunk because of inflation. In general, retirees with modest pensions have suffered the least loss of purchasing power, partly because companies tend to give them larger increases than their more affluent peers.   Those are the conclusions of a new study by Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby, an employee benefit consulting firm that tracked the impact of recent pension increases by 95 major companies. The increases were ad hoc in nature, and were granted either unilaterally at the behest of the company or as a result of collective bargaining.

But this \\"paternalistic\\" approach to retirement, in which companies assumed the burden for lower-paid workers, was out of synch with the free-wheeling spirit of the 1980's. With new Federal rules, employers began adopting a new type of pension plan, the section 401(k) plan, which gave tax breaks to employees who agreed to contribute part of their salaries to the plan. Affluent employees, looking for tax shelters, flocked to these plans. But moderate- and low-income workers, struggling with rent, car payments and utility bills, did not.
