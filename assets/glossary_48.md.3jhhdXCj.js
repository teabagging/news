Today, it is a pilgrimage site, both sacred and secular, and the architectural center of the city.   John Hutton, the design director of Donghia Furniture and Textiles in New York, vividly recalled his first visit to the Dom in 1991. When he saw the cast-bronze handles on the 12-foot-high doors, he stopped in his tracks. The handles, designed by Hugo Schneider in the late 19th century, depict an enigmatic angel with deep-set eyes, an enormous feathered wing and wind-blown hair (above right).

But where do artists' ideas come from? This is the question implicitly addressed in \\"Incognito,\\" a fascinating and often funny show, organized by Carole Ann Klonarides, at the Curt Marcus Gallery in SoHo. What unites the work here, which includes painting, photography, architecture and installations, is that all the artists say they get their ideas from distinctly unusual sources.   Certainly the artist here whose ideas came from the strangest place was Richard S. Shaver, a popular writer for science-fiction magazines like Amazing Stories and Mystic in the 1940's and 50's, who later took up painting. Shaver, who died in 1975, said he had discovered a land called Lumeria, situated in the center of the earth and populated by a race of creatures who controlled human affairs. He described this land in great detail in magazine articles and books, and when he turned to painting, he tried to depict the creatures he had seen there. He based his paintings on what he called \\"rock books,\\" rocks that suggest various figures and scenes through their natural patterns of stratification and color. The two examples of his painting here both feature clusters of women, perhaps some of the 50-foot-tall women he said were among the denizens of Lumeria.

Moliere, after all, is Moliere, one of the great figures of European literature, and this performance -- in French with English subtitles -- sparkles with his intelligence, is visually striking and at times extremely intense.         This Don Juan, most conspicuously, is no joyous, irrepressible bon vivant who just can't keep his hands off the girls. As played by the Polish-born Andrzej Seweryn (who speaks French with just the touch of a foreign accent), he is more  a sneaky, snakelike fop than a lusty lover, a cynical sensualist whose purpose is not so much to experience love or even to make romantic conquests as it is to achieve psychological mastery over all others, men as well as women.

Pick your way through the prickly, oddly truncated prose in Mary Hood's novel and you're deep in a small coastal town where Cuban exiles are torn between the old life and the new one and a girl can fall in love and marry and lose everything before she turns 20.

As if that weren't enough, a car wreck wipes Faye's slate completely clean, leaving her with amnesia.

It is the supporting characters who bring Faye's story to life: the wifty priest, the compulsive ex-mother-in-law intent on reviving the marriage. There's more: Vic's affair. Brother Tom's sacred, secret mission. Faye's doomed admirer. Fireworks. Oh yes, and a hurricane.

At one side of the canvas a man rests his elbow on the table to support the weight of his head. At the opposite end of the table another man jabs an accusatory finger at an older man halted in midappeal. Around them, other figures despair, contemplate, glare.

If this painting and its painter do not immediately strike a chord of recognition, it is not because the painter is not renowned, but rather because the painter is not renowned as a painter. For nearly 20 years, Alexander Lerner was the de facto patriarch of the Soviet refusenik movement. An internationally recognized expert in the field of cybernetics, Lerner was one of the first -- if not the first -- high-profile Soviet citizen to reject the dubious privileges of Soviet life for an opportunity to emigrate to the West. In 1971, disgusted with Soviet anti-Semitism and inspired by Israel's victory in the Six-Day War, Lerner and his family applied for emigration.

Of course, these fans do use electricity, but only a small fraction of the amount that air-conditioners do.   A good fan, strategically placed, can provide pleasantly cool artifical breezes that can go a long way toward making the inside more comfortable without air-conditioning.

Having been directed by James Cruze, this story emerges from the studio as a thoroughly human document, a sound entertainment likely to make one feel better for having seen it. The simple way in which the narrative is unfolded is quite stirring. One becomes intensely interested in the characters and what happens to them. You find yourself hoping that the younger son won't lie and that the old grandmother will lend a helping hand to Mr. and Mrs. Ingals. A lump rises in one's throat when misfortune occurs, but in the end one leaves the theatre relieved and happy that the children turned up trumps.Myrtle Stedman is capable and efficient as Eunice Ingals, the mother of three grown children. She may seem a little young for the part, but as she is a modern mother this is to be overlooked. Miss Stedman is sincere and restrained, in fact almost as effective as she was in the title rôle of the film version of \\"The Famous Mrs. Fair.\\" The rôle of Bernard Ingals, the husband, is splendidly played by George Irving, who is natural in all the scenes in which he figures.In the first stretch on Christmas Eve the two sons and the flapper daughter are portrayed as a self-centred trio. After greeting their parents they all have to go elsewhere, a disappointment to Mrs. Ingals because she has dinner ready for them. The father is worried owing to an insolent city councilman's conduct toward him, and he decides to resign his position, as he can't endure the insults heaped upon him by the vulgar political boss. Bradley, the younger son, returns for a few moments to get a portfolio and is asked to mail the letter of resignation. No sooner has the boy disappeared in the snow than the father regrets his impulsiveness.Bernard tells his wife about the matter, and she calls up the home at which her son is being entertained. Has he posted the letter? He replies that he has not. Mrs. Ingals then instructs him to do so. Bradley forgets to mail the missive, and he, his brother Hugh and their sister Lois open the letter. They read and understand","excerpt":"instead of tearing up the letter or giving it back to their father they decide to put it back into a new envelope and send it on its way.Ingals on Christmas morning goes to the council chamber, where a few of the members are discussing his resignation. A stanch, upright man tells Ingals that by his vote they have decided not to accept his resignation. Then one has another surprise when Ingals returns to his home and his wife insists on Ingals telephoning the councilmen that he will not withdraw his written decision. The children, once so selfish, stand back of their parents, and before the Christmas dinner joy and happiness reign in the family.There are one or two minor ideas which are a little exaggerated, one of them being the ease with which Bradley manages to punch and knock down the 200-pound politician. Kimberly, Constance Bennett, who impersonates the daughter, Lois, is much too giddy even for such a flapper. Miss Bennett is pretty, but she is so much on the move that one hardly gets an opportunity to study her face. She is a strange contrast to the Victorian grandmother. Now and again Mr. Cruze makes a mistake of repeating his action for fear that it might have been missed in the first instance.The subtitles are informing and at times amusing. It is a picture which is bound to have a strong appeal, as there is nothing extravagant about the settings and the action is plausible. It is also quite unusual to see a production in which the action covers less than forty-eight hours.

For where the previous films were lusty, three-dimensional portraits of fiery men in action, directors Pudovkin and Doller have made no more than an album of heroicized stills each as stiff, stilted and undramatic as a tintype. Instead of the career we are given the apotheosis","excerpt":"instead of the battle we are given the homage of victory, achieved with no more sweat than it takes to write a subtitle.The more's the pity, too, because heaven knows there was plenty of swirling excitement in the life of the choleric old eighteenth century general.

But if he was an urgent fellow who rared the disfavor of Czar Paul because of the monarch's fanciful ideas of what constituted an army, little emerges in the film. In crowning their hero with the laurel, the directors have asked him to stand still, and the result is a wordy, static film in which the actors can do no more than posture and declaim.But the fault lies with Pudovkin rather than with the performers. He has put the general in a straitjacket when he should have given him elbow room to awing his sword.

Motoring right through expected breaks at bar divisions, it gives a feeling of perpetual motion; it can define tempo and warp it, become a sort of mantra or fade into the background to become just a murmuring color.    In a set by Reid Anderson's quartet on Wednesday night at Smalls, long lines proliferated, laid over subdivided rhythms; sometimes the music sounded inspired by Indian classical music. Mr. Anderson is a young bassist who doesn't do anything roughly. His time is precise and intonation impeccable, and he often plays short, swinging phrases that carefully prod the rhythm section. But he likes the effect of lead instruments stretching out and intertwining around him, and in this band he's surrounded himself with two players who can make audiences swoon in the way they patiently surge ahead, barely pausing for breath -- the pianist Ethan Iverson and the saxophonist Mark Turner.

The result is a healthier fresh-tasting dish. Air-fried broccoli, zucchini and battered cauliflower are also available ($1.80 each). The real treat at Weight/trimmers isn't the lunch specials or the sandwich wraps. It's the low-fat ice cream, which comprises 40 percent of the restaurant's business. ''It's just the best ice cream around,'' boasted Mrs. Fehr. And she's right. Just try to resist the German chocolate cake-flavor soft ice cream topped with fat-free hot caramel all adding up to only 143 calories ($2.35 for a small). (By contract a McDonald's caramel sundae has 360 calories.) Even Weight/trimmers' hot apple cobbler coupled with vanilla ice cream (203 calories, $3.05) can fit into a dieter's regime.

Rejoining his friends on a stoop across the street, he lifts the fat bottle trumpet-like to his lips and gulps down the brew in loud, foamy swallows.   \\"It gets you nice,\\" he says, passing the bottle to an eager friend.    \\"It gets you pumped up,\\" adds the next boy. \\"I feel more comfortable when I'm drinking a 40.\\"   Malt liquor -- essentially beer brewed with sugar for an extra alcoholic kick -- has long been popular with black and Hispanic drinkers. But in the outsize 40-ounce bottle, introduced in the late 1980's with aggressive marketing campaigns aimed at minority drinkers, it is fast becoming the intoxicant of choice for black and Hispanic youths in New York and other American cities.    Some teen-agers call malt liquor \\"liquid crack\\" in tribute to its potency. And to the dismay of drug counselors, social workers and ministers who see malt liquor as a dangerous drug in sheep's clothing, the 40-ounce bottles with brand names like King Cobra, Crazy Horse, Colt 45 and St. Ides have become an accessory to the youth-culture ensemble of baggy clothes, expensive work boots and street-hardened attitudes. \\"Tap the Bottle,\\" a new song celebrating the consumption of 40-ounce malt liquor, has become a hit on the rap charts.   The essence of the 40 is its combination of size, power and price. At between $1.25 and $2.50, essentially the same as a quart bottle, and with an alcohol content of 5.6 to 8 percent, compared with 3.5 percent for regular beer, the 40-ounce malt liquor offers more punch for the money.   The brewing companies -- which have long been criticized for marketing campaigns that target minority communities -- argue that in selling and promoting the 40-ounce malt liquors, they are simply trying to maintain what has always been a crucial market. But to a chorus of critics, the creation and targeted marketing of the 40 is a cynical attempt to take advantage of poor youngsters in search of a cheap high. The results, they say, can be dangerous and occasionally disastrous, not least because of a misimpression that malt liquor is a relatively harmless pleasure.    \\"They are becoming alcoholics and don't even know it,\\" said Eric Brent, a recovering cocaine addict who is the founder of Rescue, an anti-addiction program in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx. \\"Denial is such a monster in their lives.\\"   The precise dimensions of the phenomenon are unknowable. But industry analysts say that in the last few years, malt liquor has become the fastest-growing segment of the beer market. And drug counselors and health officials say that while they know of no studies of malt-liquor consumption by young people in the inner city, they see signs of increasing underage drinking linked to the availability of the large bottles.  Seen as Alternative to Drugs    The popularity of the 40's comes as drug-treatment experts and the police are reporting modest drops in teen-age drug use. Some teen-agers in poor neighborhoods now see malt liquor as an alternative to drugs, according to Makani Thaemba, a public policy specialist for the Marin Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems in San Rafael, Calif.   At the same time, some substance abuse authorities say they have been seeing growing numbers of young people seeking treatment for twin addictions. Increasingly, one of the substances is alcohol, many say, and often that alcohol came by way of malt liquor sold in a 40-ounce bottle.   Some say, too, that they have noticed a growing association between drinking 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor and smoking marijuana. The combination, one teen-ager said, goes together like \\"cookies and milk.\\"   The Bronx teen-ager who bought the Olde English 800 returned to the grocery store minutes later to purchase a 35-cent Philly Blunt cigar and, as street fad dictates, he hollowed it out and packed it with marijuana to smoke with the malt liquor. Hoisting a 40 for Breakfast    Drinking a 40-ounce bottle of malt liquor for breakfast en route to school is not unusual, said a Bronx teen-ager who said he used to do just that. Guzzling 40 ounces to intoxication, others added, is a major attraction at \\"hooky parties.\\"   \\"It is just a thing we did,\\" said Clifton W., a 16-year-old Bronx boy who is in treatment for substance abuse. \\"It just made me feel good.\\"   Fakri A., a 17-year-old from the Bronx who is now in treatment, recalled that he was once so drunk after drinking six 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor that he staggered obliviously through a firefight between drug dealers. \\"I guess God was looking out for me that day,\\" he mused.   Darryl McDaniels, a 28-year-old member of the rap group Run-DMC, recently told a rap magazine that he had been hospitalized for alcoholic pancreatitis, the result of years of drinking as many as eight 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor a day. 'Pack a Lot of Punch'    The 40-ounce bottle was introduced beginning in the mid-80's as a \\"retailer and consumer convenience,\\" according to Ron Richards, a spokesman for the Miller Brewing Company, maker of the Magnum brand of malt liquor. Store owners like them, he said, because they take up far less shelf space than six-packs.   And in the wake of their introduction, national malt liquor consumption has increased to 82.9 million 2.5-gallon cases in 1992 from 73.6 million in 1989, according to the Jobson Publishing Corporation's Beer Handbook, which predicts sales of 97.8 million cases this year.   The reason for such sales, market researchers say, is the promise of more alcohol for less money.   \\"If you measure your serving size by 40 ounces,\\" said Peter Reid, editor of Modern Brewery Age, \\"it's going to pack a lot of punch.\\"   In a comparative analysis, the Marin Institute found that 40 ounces of St. Ides, which at 8 percent alcohol is one of the most powerful malt liquors, has more alcohol than a six-pack of standard beer, and roughly the same amount as five 5-ounce glasses of wine.   Brewery officials deny that their pursuit of a small but lucrative segment of the American liquor market is an effort to entice underage or irresponsible drinking, and they insist that they are not unduly targeting young minority drinkers. Noting that malt liquor sales have always been the highest among minority drinkers, they say they are simply following the dictates of maintaining a market they want to continue to serve.   \\"You obviously gear the advertising of any products to groups that tend to prefer them,\\" said Randy Smith, a vice president of the G. Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse, Wis., the maker of Colt 45.   He and officials of other breweries say they regularly advertise against irresponsible and underage drinking. And they say they also sponsor a variety of service activities in minority neighborhoods, from concerts, to literacy programs, to scholarships.   \\"The industry is very sensitive and spends a lot of money to be responsible,\\" said Frank Walters, director of research for M. Shanken Communications in New York, publishers of Impact and Market Watch, leading trade publications.   Two years ago, Heileman Brewing came under fire from black consumer groups and civil rights organizations after introducing Power Master, its most powerful malt liquor at 5.9 percent alcohol, and marketing it specifically to black drinkers. Regulators ordered it off the market, saying the word \\"power\\" on the label violated a law against using brand names to promote alcohol content. Linking Success With Liquor    Heileman now faces criticism over an advertising campaign for Colt 45 that is aimed at a younger black consumer than before. Gone is a middle-aged black actor, Billy Dee Williams","excerpt":"instead, a polished, soft-spoken younger black man talks of commitment, giving back and success. As he does, he reaches for a can of Colt 45.   Linking black success with malt liquor is cynical and exploitative, critics of the ads say.   \\"All this speaks of a slick marketing campaign that has tremendous impact on African-Americans,\\" said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. Mr. Butts has led a campaign to stem the advertising of alcohol and tobacco products in poor neighborhoods. Popular at Hooky Parties    Judy Corman, a spokeswoman for Phoenix House, a drug-rehabilitation organization, said she was surprised by the response when she asked a roomful of Manhattan teen-agers recently if they had drunk 40-ounce malt liquor.   \\"You should have seen the hands go up,\\" she said. \\"Nearly everyone raised their hands.\\"   Jennifer O. was one of them.   The 15-year-old Bronx high school student said she seldom went to classes last year, preferring instead to attend hooky parties at friends' houses, in basements and on rooftops. \\"As long as there was music and people,\\" recalled Jennifer, who is Puerto Rican.   \\"When I went to hooky parties, we used to have boxes and boxes and boxes of 40 ounces in the refrigerator, and we would go crazy,\\" she said. She drank to impress her friends, she said, and her ability to drink two bottles of malt liquor back-to-back earned her the nickname, \\"Shorty Two Forties.\\"   \\"The most I drank was three and a half bottles and I was drunk out of my mind,\\" Jennifer said.    When asked if there was anything she regretted about her days of drunken malt liquor binges, she paused, and nodded.   \\"I lost my virginity,\\" she said, \\"when I was drunk on 40's.\\" For Minority Youths, 40 Ounces of Trouble"},{"year":"1993","title":"WHEN a boxing buff was reminded of tonight's heavyweight title fight, he asked, \\"When's Tyson getting out?\\"   Not a word or a thought or an opinion about who will be here in the ring at Caesars Palace tonight","excerpt":"instead, a question about the future of Mike Tyson, who won't be here.

Unlike his predecessors, he didn't do it by force of personal style, the way Charlie Parker or John Coltrane, for example, did it","excerpt":"instead, he became a cultural politician.    Through ceaseless proselytizing, commercial success and access to the news media, he helped make it possible for young musicians to shun the forum of pop culture and sustain a career in jazz, hardly a negligible achievement. The 32-year-old Mr. Marsalis has brought jazz a visiblity it hasn't had since Coltrane led his great quartet, and without him there's a good chance that jazz's current renaissance would not exist.

His historical importance, as a song-delivery stylist and rhythmic innovator who helped turn rhythm-and-blues into rock-and-roll, is undeniable. But his 67 years and decades of traveling from show to show seem to  have taken their toll, and on Wednesday he seemed damaged by all the moving and shuffling around. He slipped a disk in his back last fall, and had to remain seated throughout the show, moving on and off stage only with difficulty. Mr. Diddley's five-piece band performed like museum curators, so in awe of the masterpiece in their presence that they spent most of their time concerned with  how to please and take care of it.

His face stays frozen in a grouchy grimace while a voice-over drones on about his miserable situation. He's tired of his wife. He's sick of his children. He's thinking of shooting them all this very evening, after dinner. Will he or won't he? The film, which supposedly spans one day but feels like years, has long since dissipated its suspense by the time the moment of truth arrives. The characters seem to have talked one another to death long ago.\\"Natural Enemies,\\" which opens today at Cinema 2, was written and directed by Jeff Kanew, who has had a long career making movie trailers and commercials, a line of work that would seemingly require some verve.

All too soon, it becomes unmistakable that Mr. Kanew is not about to let anything brighten Paul Steward's day, and the mood turns into one of painful repetition.The film's only real surprise comes when Paul visits a brothel, where five decorous prostitutes listen to yet another dreary chapter of his story. He has already been glimpsed on the commuter train, making the obvious complaints, and in his office, gazing sadly at his pretty secretary, and enough would seem to be enough. But Paul leaves the brothel and heads back to his office, because his day isn't over yet — in fact, it's only lunchtime. Only lunchtime!\\"Natural Enemies,\\" which is adapted from a novel by Julius Horwitz, is full of material that must surely read better than it plays. \\"No one can really understand what happens between a man and his wife — we communicate silently, like cockroaches have for 50 million years . . .,\\" Paul intones.

It is hardly necessary to sit in judgment upon such delicate matters of public interest, inasmuch as the film decisively condemns itself by shoddy workmanship. Miss Garbo's current attempt to trip the light fantastic is one of the awkward exhibitions of the season, George Cukor's direction is static and labored, and the script is a stale joke, repeated at length. Considering the several talents that have combined to create this dismal jape, put down \\"Two-Faced Woman\\" as one of the more costly disappointments of the year.To begin with, even the erstwhile gossamer touch of S. N. Behrman, as one of the scenarists, has failed to brighten this ancient fable of the wife who parades as her own gaudy twin sister to get her husband back. Apparently the unsavory aspects of this intra-marital seduction have been improved to the satisfaction of the Legion of Decency by the insertion of a telephone call wherein the husband learns in advance of his wife's intended deception. Thus the romps of Melvyn Douglas and the wispily clad Miss Garbo across all sorts of upholstered furniture become a be-wildering and pointless charade, with Mr. Douglas alternately acting as though deceived and, again, with a back-of-the-hand smirk, letting the audience know it's all in fun.As for Miss Garbo, this is clearly one of the less propitious assignments of her career. Though she is her cool and immaculate self in the role of the clean-limbed ski instructress, she is as gauche and stilted as the script when playing the lady of profane love. No doubt her obvious posturings, her appallingly unflattering clothes and make-up were intended as a satire on the vamps of history","excerpt":"instead, her performance misses the satire and looks like something straight out of the movies of 1922.

Clutching some clues from \\"Hamlet,\\" he tries to expose them by shouting accusations at meals, pretending to be crazy, and by making a short movie about an incestuous crime. Obsessed with seeming and being, denouncing humanity at large, he trots about in the woods in a business suit and tie, hugging his divine discontentMeanwhile, he attempts to force a young woman (Juliette Mayniel) into the role of his Ophelia. Their relationship mainly consists of his murmuring claptrap about the beauties of nature into her ear, while she laughs skittishly and favors him with somber or demure smiles. Eventually, her father — who is of course labeled Polonius — dies in a tree after one of the funniest heart attacks I've seen in years.

This two-act monologue, revived at the Irish Arts Center, is a tour de force that charts one man's personal journey from an unexamined life as a bigoted Protestant in Belfast to an all-out embrace of Irish heritage and brotherhood -- even with Catholics.      It could be preachy","excerpt":"instead, it's joyful. The play was written by Marie Jones (''Stones in His Pockets'') in 1994 and has since been performed everywhere from Edinburgh to Los Angeles. It has already played in New York, so its opening on, of course, St. Patrick's Day represented a surefire reprise rather than an experiment. All you need is an actor who can inhabit a wide range of characters: the protagonist Kenneth, a welfare clerk; his bloated, cigarette-reeking father-in-law, who drags him to a North-South soccer match where the bigotry and hate prompt his change of heart; his snippy wife; his easy-going Catholic boss; a planeful of Irish revelers.

His work can be seen at the Film Forum, at 256 West 88th Street, through Sunday and Jan. 24-27. Don't miss it.Within the slaughterhouse, the preparations are quite ritualistic, as the men carefully wash the floor and sharpen knives that aren't intended for carving cooked meat—but for cutting into live flesh. Suspense builds up to the carnage that we know will come. The animals' slaughter isn't shown","excerpt":"instead, thick blood oozes and swirls toward the gutters, and the evocation is more powerful than seeing the act itself. The men's serious, intent faces imply that there are no jokes on this job. At first, they seem like soldiers getting ready for battle — later, as though they're in the middle of a war.\\"One Day More\\" centers on a murky stream outside a small Yugoslav town, where the mudbaths are said to cure even deadly diseases. Old and young sink to their chins in the dark liquid, some rub parts of their bodies with jetty slime. Heads seem to float on the water, while mist rises in a shot that Fellini might envy. The atmosphere is dense with concentration and bleak hope. You feel that these people are terribly worried and fearful about their bodies. They wait as though for a miracle. Finally, they shower, cheer up and chat noisily—in contrast to the anguished hush that held while they were in the stream.Deep concentration and preparation — while waiting for something to happen — are themes that recur in Mr. Gilic's work, whether his subjects are profoundly absorbed in butchery or in trying to regain lost health or—as in \\"'To Love\\"—in one another. This film begins with a piece of machinery slowly moving in space: You can't tell what it is, but it's fascinating to watch it reach its destination. Again, there's suspense, which mounts to the satisfaction of seeing something accomplished. Eventually, we learn that two sides of a bridge are meeting in mid-air, and that we've been watching the key piece going into place. The mystery is solved in one shot, which also suggests the peril of working at great heights.One of the construction workers climbs to the ground, where his wife waits with a picnic. All their feelings are conveyed through their expressions; there are almost no words. While waiting, she looks both eager and apprehensive: Clearly, she's anxious about his safety. She spreads a white cloth in the wilderness and sets forth a feast with as much care and deliberation as the men give to working on the bridge. Affection surges through brief gestures: She pats his knee, he pushes a strand of hair out of her eyes while she beams at him. Mainly, they gaze at each other and eat, and that simple act reveals an extraordinary sense of intimacy.\\"Power\\" shows a hypnotist giving his disciples — six young men with ultra-white skin and dead black hair — a lesson in dominating the will of others. They follow the master's wordless instructions like zombies, repeating many of his actions. They also direct one another's behavior. He slides a giant black needle through both his cheeks without apparent pain; they do the same, but some can't help wincing. A hand moves in front of eyes that look momentarily terrified — as though watching something hideous that we can't see. There's some groveling and hand-kissing and also some ecstasy afoot. The portrayal of the master's control of his followers is repellent — as it's obviously meant to be. But \\"Power\\" hasn't the same brilliance as the first three films, partly because the subjects seem self-conscious.Mr. Gilic's films are called documentaries. But he's superb at finding the astonishing images that lurk in the ordinary world. It's as if he'd nabbed some magic from the air and wedded it to facts. And it's a privilege to see through his eyes: Whatever interests him assumes a contagious excitement for us. It's evident that a major talent is already well developed, and since Mr. Gilic is in his mid-30's, we have a lot to look forward to. Screen:Shorts by Vlatko Gilic, Yugoslav, at Forum"},{"year":"2003","title":"COMPLICATIONS: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science, by Atul Gawande. (Picador, $13.) The author, both a surgeon and a staff writer for The New Yorker, examines the realms of the medically unexplained and uncertain, as well as the fallibility of a pursuit that ''may well be more complex than just about any other field of human endeavor.'' Last year in these pages, F. Gonzalez-Crussi praised ''Complications'' for its ''truth and authenticity'' and Gawande for ''his power to conjure the reality of the ward, the thrill of the moment-by-moment medical or surgical drama.''    THE SEASON OF LILLIAN DAWES, by Katherine Mosby. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $12.95.) Set in the 1950's in Manhattan and its upscale suburbs, this novel explores the lives of a circle of young aristocrats and the stir caused by the arrival of the wildly beautiful and mysterious title character in their midst. ''Mosby writes good social comedy,'' Brooke Allen wrote here in 2002. ''The period color, the depiction of a long-vanished New York, is exquisite.''    POBBY AND DINGAN, by Ben Rice. (Vintage, $10.) In a desolate Australian mining town, an 8-year-old girl is devastated when her father, an opal miner, gets drunk one night and loses her two imaginary friends. Worse, his attempt to recover them threatens to land him in prison. Luckily, the girl's scrappy older brother hatches a plan to convince the locals that Pobby and Dingan really exist. In 2000 our reviewer, Jeff Giles, called this ''an enormously touching, imaginative and unexpected novel.''    LAZY B: Growing Up on a Cattle Ranch in the American Southwest, by Sandra Day O'Connor and H. Alan Day. (Random House, $13.95.) The Supreme Court justice and her brother recall their rough-and-tumble childhood on their family's vast ranch on the Arizona-New Mexico border, and the self-reliance needed to live without electricity or running water while meeting the expectations of their demanding and austere father. The result is ''a loving but cleareyed portrait of a distinctive and vanished American way of life,'' Linda Greenhouse said in the Book Review last year.    LONDON: The Biography, by Peter Ackroyd. (Anchor, $18.95.) Don't expect a standard history, with a stately procession of people and events","excerpt":"instead, this vibrant, street-level portrait turns on recurring themes and topics, from noise and waste disposal practices to the city's ghosts and sin trades. It ''succeeds in animating on the page the lived life of one of the oldest and greatest . . . cities in the world,'' Patrick McGrath wrote here in 2001. According to THE VICTORIAN VISITORS: Culture Shock in Nineteenth-Century Britain, by Rupert Christiansen (Grove, $14), the cultural elite of America and Europe (think Emerson and Wagner), not to mention speculators, sportsmen and fortunetellers, flocked to cosmopolitan London in the early 19th century, despite the wretched weather. In 2001 our reviewer, Ben Macintyre, found this an ''eloquent and witty'' account of Victorian Britain.    THE DIVE FROM CLAUSEN'S PIER, by Ann Packer. (Vintage Contemporaries, $14.) In this first novel about the relationship between love and loyalty, and about how people handle the pressures of calamity and shifting friendships, a young woman in Madison, Wis., who is on the verge of leaving her fianc&#233;, is faced with an awful quandary after he is paralyzed in a diving accident. She escapes to Manhattan to find her bearings, and the book becomes ''a resonant meditation on the way the particularities of a place can nurture, limit and sometimes strangle the selves and loves we are allowed,'' Rob Nixon said here last year.    REVENGE: A Story of Hope, by Laura Blumenfeld. (Washington Square, $14.) Twelve years after her father, an American rabbi, was wounded in Jerusalem by a young Palestinian, the author returned to study how other cultures approach revenge and to pursue her own revenge fantasies by ingratiating herself with the gunman's family. Blumenfeld is ''ever resourceful,'' Blake Eskin wrote here in 2002, and her encounters are full of ''audacity.''    THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT, by Walter Tevis. (Vintage Contemporaries, $12.) This 1983 novel by the author of ''The Hustler'' revolves around an orphan girl who becomes a chess prodigy (and unhappy adult), eventually hitting the international circuit and facing off with the Russian world champion in a tournament in Moscow. ''Tevis reveals a great deal about American chess . . . and it is an exceptionally accurate picture that he draws,'' Harold C. Schonberg wrote in the Book Review.

On cue from the Speaker - who had seen the advance text and arranged the demonstration - they rose up with a derisive ovation and delightedly accepted the President's surrender.

More precisely, you know it when you smell it -- smell onion-laced hash browns sizzling on the grill and opaque coffee that flows like Niagara Falls and perfumes the air with the zest of caffeine. You know a diner by its sounds: the clatter of thick china behind the counter, the hiss of Naugahyde upholstery when you ease down into a booth, the rumble of trucks highballing past on the highway just outside.

Jerry O'Mahony of Elizabeth, Silk City Diners of Paterson, Swingle Diners of Middlesex, Mountain View Diners of Singac: These are names that resonate in hash-house history as profoundly as do Mies van der Rohe and Frank Lloyd Wright in conventional building design. To this day, New Jersey (and especially its northern half) is a roadside archeologist's wonderland, its highways, byways and city neighborhoods gleaming with chrome-banded beaneries that hark back to an age of streamlined high style and three squares a day. To savor Eggs-in-the-Skillet, house specialty of the pint-size Short Stop Diner of Bloomfield, or a wedge of mile-high pie at the exuberant Tick Tock of Clifton (where the motto is \\"Eat Heavy\\") is to partake of a vintage national optimism that knew nothing of cholesterol and craved plenty of calories to grow healthy and strong.

UNIVERSAL COVERAGE   A range of services would be covered, including hospital care, emergency services, doctors and other health professionals, pregnancy-related services, hospice and home health care, ambulances, outpatient laboratory tests and prescription drugs. The Administration describes the coverage as equal to that offered by the nation's largest companies.    A new long-term care program would be created for disabled people that would provide expanded home care services.    Coverage of dental, eye and mental health care would be initially limited, but be expanded in the year 2000. Items considered not medically necessary, like cosmetic surgery, would not be covered.   Free preventive care, including periodic medical exams, immunizations and screening procedures like mammograms, pap smears and readings of cholesterol levels would be provided in accordance with a schedule set by the Government.    A Medicare benefit for prescription drugs would be created. Beneficiaries would pay 25 percent of the program through their Part B premium, a $250 deductible and 20 percent of the costs beyond that to an annual maximum of $1,000.    A choice would be offered between enrollment in a traditional fee-for-service plan, a health maintenance organization or a plan that combines elements of each.   Employers would be allowed to provide benefits that are more generous than the standard package, although after the year 2000 the extra benefits would be treated as taxable income for employees.    Illegal immigrants would not be covered, although they would continue to be eligible for emergency and other services","excerpt":"institutions that serve many uncovered patients would continue to receive Federal reimbursement. HOW IT WOULD WORK    Most Americans would be enrolled in regional entities called health alliances, which would negotiate the price of coverage with health plans, offer a range of plans to members and collect premiums from employers and individuals.    States would insure that alliances exist in areas where coverage would otherwise be insufficient.    Companies with more than 5,000 employees would have the option of providing care to their workers by creating a corporate alliance and contracting directly with a health-care provider.    People now enrolled in Medicare would continue in that program, but could later join the regional alliances. States would have the option of integrating Medicare recipients into their alliances so long as their coverage is as good or better.    Medicaid recipients would be enrolled in regional alliances and receive the standared package of benefits, as well as supplementary services.    All Americans would be issued a national health identification card that would guarantee them access to needed services. WHO WOULD PAY    The average premium for the standard package would be $1,800 a year for individuals and $4,200 for families. Businesses would be required to pay 80 percent of the average premium. Families and individuals would pay the difference between that amount and the full cost of the plan they select, meaning that those enrolled in cheaper plans would pay less, or more for plans more expensive than the average. Employers would have the option of paying more than 80 percent. The plan also suggests that a worker would be able to buy an average health policy for just $360 a year and a family policy for $840. The employer would pay four times that much.    No business in a regional alliance would have to pay more than 7.9 percent of its payroll. Companies with fewer than 50 employees and those with many low-wage workers would be eligible for Government subsidies and for caps ranging from 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent of payroll, depending on their average wages.    Families and individuals could pay their share of the premium directly or through withholding; alliances may require withholding to avoid bad debt.    The self-employed and unemployed would be responsible for the entire amount of the premium, unless they were eligible for assistance based on income.    Retired workers under 65 would be responsible for 20 percent of the premium.    Employers would pay for part-time workers on a pro-rated basis.   Out-of-pocket costs would depend on the kind of service chosen. Alliances would be required to offer high-cost, low-cost and combination plans. The terms appear to refer respectively to traditional fee-for-service coverage, HMO's, and preferred provider networks.    A high-cost plan would allow the use of any doctor but calls for deductibles of $200 an individual and $400 a family and 20 percent co-payment after that.    In a low cost plan, the patient would see only doctors approved by the plan, but pay no deductible besides a $10-a-visit fee for outpatient services.    In the combination plan, the patient would agree to pay 20 percent of the cost whenever using a doctor outside the plan.    Out-of-pocket expenses are capped annually at $1,500 for each person and $3,000 for a family under all three plans. CONTROLLING COSTS    A National Health Board would be created to oversee the system and set a national health budget with the goal of limiting the rate of increase of health care spending to that of the general rate of inflation by 1999. Health care expenses are now growing at more than twice the inflation rate.    If the competitive process does not reduce growth to that level, the board would impose mandatory limits on the growth of annual premiums, forcing health plans to spend less.    Upon introducing the plan, the President would urge all sectors of the health care industry to limit price and spending increases to a specific amount not yet disclosed. Prices and spending would be monitored by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.    The National Health Board would make public declarations about the costs of new drugs and could investigate the costs of existing drugs it considers overpriced. It would have no authority to set drug prices.    The rate of increase of Medicare and Medicaid would be reduced. WORKERS COMPENSATION    The separate insurance systems that now exist to cover the costs of injuries suffered at work or in automobile accidents would be continued. But the care would be provided through the health alliances created under the plan through contracts between them and the insurers. TAKING EFFECT    States could begin implementing the system by Jan. 1, 1995, and would be required to have it in place by Jan. 1, 1997.
