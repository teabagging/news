The company publishes magazines for doctors' waiting rooms and operates \\"Channel One,\\" which broadcasts sponsored news programs to high schools. Just about two years ago, Whittle announced that it had signed up nine big name authors, including David Halberstam, who would each be paid an average of $60,000 to write short, 100-page books. Each copy would carry advertising from Federal Express, which would deliver the books free of charge to 150,000 business leaders, politicians and other so-called opinion leaders. Today Mr. Halberstam's book \\"The Next Century,\\" which is about geopolitical life after the cold war, appears in the No. 4 position on The New York Times best-seller list, but the publisher is not Whittle. Last week Mr. Halberstam said he took the book to William Morrow after Whittle said the manuscript was too long and needed more reporting.
