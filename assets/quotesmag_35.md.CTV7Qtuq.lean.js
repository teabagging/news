Its five white petals are traced with pink, its center is flecked with gold and it is called Spring Beauty.   Though wildflower guides refer to it as \\"demure,\\" it's a relative of purslane, the baneful weed of flower beds. It also shares its kin's tendency to spread . Only botanists know Spring Beauty by its proper name, Claytonia Virginica. And few know its namesake: John Clayton, a Virginia farmer and one of an extraordinary band of colonial amateurs who taught themselves the natural history of the New World and taught it to Europe. His Flora Virginica was the first scientific work published (in 1739) on American botany and was the reason the wildflower was named for him. As far as popular immortality is concerned, he did not do as well as his contemporary, Dr. Alexander Garden of Charleston, whose name is familiar to everybody because it was given to the gardenia.    That may seem unfair, but Clayton was a philosophical man. He could not, a friend wrote, look into a flower without seeing a \\"display of infinite power and contrivances.\\" So he would probably not feel put out that people today who know his flower don't know him.

S. Korzybski and popularized by Stuart Chase. Their point: the name is not the thing. A word is only a word, a label, a symbol, and we should not endow that symbol with the reverence we would pay the object, or referent, itself.   People who get paid to name perfumes sniff at that semantic notion. To them, the name is part of the package, along with the bottle and the logo, and all the symbolism has a measurable effect on the way the customer thinks the perfume smells. In that ambiance-chasing world, the name fuses with the thing and takes on a reality of its own.   Time was, the names of perfumes were often descriptive of the odor, usually innocently floral: Lily of the Valley, Hyacinth or Jasmine. Then came the names that described feelings, like Joy, Hope and Moment Supreme. Femininity was emphasized in Femme and Jolie Madame and, later, Miss Dior.

Sullivan (Aug. 24), there is a misconception that has pervaded musical literature","excerpt":"namely, that Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier'' was written to celebrate equal temperament. It is true that meantone, the method of tuning before Bach, limited composers with respect to usable key signatures and modulations, and Bach wanted to transcend this limitation. Equal temperament was well known to Bach and many others long before him, but was rejected because of two serious defects: (1) no interval was perfectly tuned (free of beats) and (2) corresponding intervals of every key had the same frequency ratio as that of every other key (all keys sounded the same). Well temperament, on the other hand, was free of both these defects, but, like equal temperament, permitted one to play in every key. In well temperament, every key has its own individual character, and that is exactly why Bach wrote a prelude and fugue in each key - to exploit the unique coloration of each key. Bach was a great genius, and he would not have gone to the trouble to write a prelude and fugue in each key to demonstrate the monotonously strident sound of equal temperament. To play ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'' on an instrument tuned in equal temperament deprives this music of the very dimension that Bach intended to emphasize. Fortunately many present-day keyboard musicians are aware of this, and are able to tune their instruments in well temperament, meantone and other historical temperaments.
