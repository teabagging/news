She has powerful evidence in the words of Esmeralda Simmons, the commission's vice chairman. The city may owe this incumbent a fairer shot at re-election in a redrawn district.    Ms. Alter, a council member since 1977, has won re-election in a district increasingly populated by minorities, but the commission has thrown her into a white-majority district where another incumbent, Noach Dear, has far stronger white support. On the local WNET-TV program \\"Thirteen Live,\\" Ms. Alter charged Ms. Simmons and other commissioners with denying her the chance to continue serving minority neighborhoods -- simply because she's white.    Officials rarely admit to such activity, but Ms. Simmons did -- and blamed the Justice Department. She said the department, which is reviewing the new Council lines under the Voting Rights Act, \\"frowns\\" on plans that produce white winners in black districts. That's dangerously close to saying that black voters aren't adequately represented unless they elect council members of their own race, a stereotype that finds no support in the Constitution or the Federal voting law.    The commission could end this embarrassment by straightening out some of the curliest lines in the annals of gerrymandering around Ms. Alter's Brooklyn base. If it won't, the Justice Department or the courts should make clear, as the law plainly states, that citizens are enfranchised when they elect representatives of their choice, not when they elect members of their own race.

For when a gang leader loses his grip on his lawless band his chief lieutenant has little compunction in having his master riddled with bullets and then slipping into the dead man's shoes.Although cinema patrons may be surfeited with underworld tales, this particular effusion has the distinct advantage of being endowed with originality and suspense and also of being exceedingly well directed and ably acted. In several sequences the ways of the lawless crew in forcing the hands of business men are depicted and in the end there is a meeting at which the District Attorney takes the business men to task for yielding to the demands of the racketeers.In this story, which is an adaptation of one written by Courtenay Terrett and Rowland Brown, there is at times a tendency to glorify the chief crook, \\"Bugs\\" Raymond, and there is also too much footage given to this individual's sneering at the law and lawyers. In the closing episode there is the novel idea of Raymond and his band setting forth in morning suits and silk hats and guns on their hips to kidnap a bride, a plot which is stayed by the shooting of the racketeering chieftain.While some of the scenes are not a little extravagant, there is an underlying truth in most of them. The moral is that the way of the racketeer is hard, that the thugs and murderers are foes at heart, held together only by fear of the man in power ordering their demise and, as Raymond declares, without the cost of a $75,000 trial.Spencer Tracy appears as Raymond, who is a quick-witted truck driver in the opening scenes and through his racketeering threats rises to be the silent partner of a wealthy building contractor. Mr. Tracy's performance is forceful and he succeeds in impressing one with his characterization. Through his gait and the angle at which he wears his hat, the conception of the truck driver is always in evidence, despite his expensive clothes. Yet one can appreciate that by his personality he might win favor in the eyes of Dorothy Stone, the daughter of the millionaire contractor. He refers to himself as a man with a ton of brain, too nervous to steal and too lazy to work. He is the treacherous head of a treacherous gang. Murder is ordered to get the murderer, a companion of Raymond's, out of the way. The slain man in this instance is merely referred to as \\"the loudspeaker.\\"Mr. Brown, who besides being coauthor of the story is responsible for the film's direction, has used his camera effectively, but occasionally the voices of one or two of the players are a trifle too resonant. There are glimpses of the racketeers playing water on cement, blowing up buildings and puncturing milk cans with bullets.Warner Richmond, who years ago played in Thomas Dixon's film, \\"The Beast,\\" figures as \\"Nails\\" Markey, the gangster who takes Raymond \\"for a ride.\\" Mr. Richmond's acting is quite good. Marguerite Churchill does well as Miss Stone. Sally Eilers reveals ability in the rôle of Raymond's callous mistress. John Wray, who wrote some of the dialogue, also serves with distinction as the rather weak-kneed building contractor.On the surrounding program is an effective number called \\"Land of Laces,\\" which is shrewdly staged but rather too long.

Mindful of the great Greek's axioms, they are radically reshuffling the geometry of record players.   After years of making turntables with S-shaped arms, audio designers have suddenly switched to arms as straight as a ruler.  They cite the Euclidian argument that a straight arm represents the shortest distance between pivot point and stylus tip. Consequently, straight arms can be made a lot lighter than arms shaped as a circuitous S. And lightness in a tone arm is an indubitable virtue, for it lessens the arm's inertial resistance to motion. This is an advantage in playing warped records, for the lighter arms more easly swing up and down with the sway of the undulating disk.

Jaque, for your information, is the husband of lovely Martine Carol, whom he often directs in chummy items, such as \\"Nana,\\" at the Little Carnegie.But M. Jaque is taking a vacation from sex in this latest film, which was delivered yesterday, under the auspices of Walt Disney's distributing company, to the Trans-Lux Normandie. Rather than beautiful women, he is buzzing about radio \\"hams\\" who sit at their sets in the dark of nighttime and flash urgent messages all over the world.His heroes in this particular instance are some far-flung fellows who diligently combine to speed some serum to a Breton trawler that has broadcast an appeal from the lonely North Sea. The flickering plea from the trawler is picked up by a \\"ham\\" in Togoland, who gathers the medical predicament and relays it to a stalwart Paris friend.This fellow hops on his scooter, chases over to the Pasteur Institute and scoops up some antibotulism serum which he eventually gets aboard a Berlin-bound plane. Then he reaches another \\"ham\\" in Munich who virtually drools at the long-awaited chance to get in on something exciting and passes the word to Berlin.One thing leads to another. Even the Russians get in on the act. And the first thing you know, a Norwegian plane is dropping the package of serum to the illness-ridden trawler at sea, while \\"hams\\" from Togoland to Munich beam with pride in a job well done.But for all their panting excitement, there is not much of same in this film. Once you've heard FD8AM call F8YT (\\"Come in, F8YT! Come in, F8YT!\\"), you've pretty well heard the plot. And the presentation of it is not up to M. Jaque's usual style. It is simply the ancient business of getting the serum through to Nome, modernized a bit with squawking radios, airplanes and the East Berlin zone.As for the acting, it is routine. André Valmy as the captain of the boat and J. L. Trintignant as the \\"ham\\" in Paris seem the most intense. Only once does M. Jaque let his forte intrude in his largely masculine tale. That is when he has a busty charmer tickling the ears of the \\"ham\\" in Togoland. She's the plump little doll from \\"Rififi\\" and she tries hard to throw a monkey-wrench. But radio \\"hams\\" are dedicated.Now, if all the guys in the world . . .
