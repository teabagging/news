The Corn Dance is a daylong ritual in which the Indians of the pueblo pray for rain, and by extension, a bountiful harvest. It is one of several seasonal ceremonies that take place during the year, each with a different purpose and form. Under the blazing desert sun, about 1,000 dancers filled the pueblo's large central plaza, and nearly as many onlookers watched from roofs and balconies of the surrounding adobe houses and from every available bit of standing room at the plaza's entrance.

And the dancers' vibrant individual presences brought extra life to works by Ailey and Ulysses Dove that were performed that night.   Both Ailey's \\"Hidden Rites\\" and Mr. Dove's \\"Episodes\\" are charged rituals. Streamlined and stylized, each sends taut, coiled dancers across the stage in one long self-regenerating processional. \\"Hidden Rites,\\" set to a gently clangorous score by Patrice Sciortino, evokes a world of tribal spirits and ritualized life changes.

POSTINGS: Somerset Office Center","excerpt":"Rivalry in Jersey's Watchung Range"},{"year":"1931","title":"An expertly produced melodrama of the air and the South Pole is now on view at the Central Theatre. It is known as \\"Dirigible\\" and is dedicated to the United States Navy. Besides the adventures supposed to take place in the Antarctic there is the theme of the rivalry between the pilots of heavier-than-air and lighter-than-air craft.Although it is perhaps a little bulky in the matter of material, most of the action is exciting and it is directed with considerable skill. Some of the happenings were evidently inspired by flashes from that sterling film, \\"With Byrd at the South Pole.\\" This current work, which was pictured with the cooperation of Uncle Sam's Navy, makes the most of the glimpses of the Los Angeles and naval planes at Lakehurst. During one episode one of the characters is presumed to hook his airplane to the giant airship and then release it. It is done in this instance to show that it would be feasible for a dirigible to travel to the South Pole with an airplane attached to it. This is all very well in moderate weather, but in a high wind or blizzard it would undoubtedly prove quite impracticable, which one appreciates when there are depicted thrilling flashes of a dirigible wrecked at sea in a mighty thunderstorm.Frank Capra, the director of this subject, gives many illustrations of his ability in handling his scenes, but there is one gruesome incident at the South Pole which might have been left untold. It is where one of the three survivors of the airplane crash, on the polar plateau is supposed to have his leg amputated. The sufferings of the persons involved are recited most impressively. There is the howling wind, the daredevil pilot who is partly responsible for the airplane coming to grief and the trudging over the snows of the last two of the party.Jack Bradon, impersonated by Jack Holt, is the Lieutenant Commander who is proud of the feats of dirigibles. Lieutenant Pearce (known as Frisky Pearce), who is played by Ralph Graves, is the champion of airplanes. He refers to the Los Angeles as a \\"gas bag,\\" but when Bradon asks for him to go on a South Pole expedition on the dirigible, Pearce is thoroughly satisfied. He is, however, given to being foolhardy, and Helen, his wife, pleads with him not to accompany Bradon on the Antarctic journey. Helen appeals to Bradon and he promises that Pearce shall not go. When he broaches the matter to Pearce, he is finally forced to say that it is because the airplane pilot is a grandstand player that he does not wish to take him on the dirigible. This infuriates Pearce, who does not know that his wife was responsible for Bradon's decision.Louis Rondelle, a polar explorer, is the head of the dirigible polar expedition. There are scenes of the airship leaving for the bottom of the world and stirring stretches depicting the buckling of the leviathan in the storm. The persons aboard are rescued and they return. It is then Frisky Pearce's chance to show what can be done with an airplane, and Rondelle agrees to use a plane like Admiral Byrd did.There are the doings aboard the plane when it starts its flight for the South Pole, the throwing out of material to lighten the plane and then the proud moment when Rondelle gets ready to drop the Stars and Stripes. Rondelle yearns to land, and he has no difficulty in prevailing upon Pearce to do so. The machine glides over the snow, but suddenly it turns over, and, after the passengers have extricated themselves, the wreckage bursts into flames.The dirigible has its day when Bradon succeeds in piloting one to the South Pole, and then comes the idea of Bradon, on the big lighter-than-air craft, spotting the two survivors of the airplane polar flight.Mr. Holt gives a zealous portrayal. Mr. Graves also appears to advantage in his part. Fay Wray is Helen, who, when her husband leaves for the expedition, gives him a letter which is to be opened when he reaches the Pole. In the letter it is set forth that Helen is going to seek a divorce in Paris. But the storytellers here have fathomed a way whereby Pearce never knows the contents of the missive. Hobart Bosworth is capital as Rondelle, the explorer.
