Soon this joy of a ride will be available to citizens throughout China, as the country closes in on its goal of putting a million cars a year on the road by 2010. Toward that end,  the People's Republic has asked manufacturers around the world to submit designs to kick-start its own auto industry. Among those who have is Porsche, but what the venerable German company is offering is a horsepower of a different color from the low-down, zillion-dollar road eaters that the Hamptons lovers drive. No airfoils, ostrich-skin seats and radar detectors on these babies. The potential Chinese model is a sedate $6,000 sedan, code-named C88 and intended as much for cargo as passengers.

But because the subsidies are given out by local housing authorities and community-development offices, the families have been required to stay in the area in which they live, even though the breadwinner might have a job waiting in another area. There are few apartments in the county with rents low enough to come under the Federal ceiling.   Mr. Kimels is working on a two-part approach to try to solve the problems.

The BBC producers managed to interview Boris N. Yeltsin, Eduard A. Shevardnadze and lesser-known but very well-informed players and observers of the upheaval in what used to be the Soviet Union.    Tomorrow's program, which includes the first two sections, begins with a 1978 visit to Baku by Leonid I. Brezhnev, then the Soviet leader. There he was impressed enough with Mr. Gorbachev, the region's agricultural innovator, to call him to Moscow to become the Central Committee's agricultural chief and a central figure in an incipient movement for change. Brezhnev's death in November 1982 set off a high-level struggle between the old guardniks and the Gorbachevians.

Three originally separate hours are being run consecutively, and somewhat overwhelmingly.    The producers for Thames Television and Thirteen/WNET are Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, the British team whose previous and widely acclaimed credits include essays on Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. While working more than 10 years ago on \\"Hollywood,\\" a 13-part documentary series on silent films, they amassed an archive of interviews with major figures from the early years of film history.

Vadim Vadimovitch is a Russian emigr&#233; writer and a mirror image or &#8220;double&#8221; of Nabokov as man and writer; but unlike Proust or Joyce, Nabokov never uses this version of himself as a way of questioning the authenticity of his own identity. The fictional self never challenges the &#8220;real&#8221; or authorial self. Nabokov and his works hover on the margins of the text, so to speak, as a static reality against which Vadim is to be measured. So that while the style of the novel is characteristically brilliant when it comes to erotic comedy or setting a scene or sketching in minor figures, it is deficient in another and far more important way. It lacks the dramatic intensifications, the exploratory feeling that in Joyce and Proust&#8212;and in our own time very often in Mailer&#8212;is a consequence of their wonderfully vital, vulnerable, intimidated (and not simply intimidating) relationship to fictional copies of themselves.

Toward the end of the 18th century the Connecticut Valley, with its prosperous farms, was a fertile artistic ground for a number of painters, many of whom traveled its reaches in search of commissions. In style and level of accomplishment, they were a varied lot - ranging from the assured polish acquired in Europe of John Trumbull, one of the finest artists of 18th-century America, through Ralph Earl, who, though he also studied in Europe, often reverted to the flat, two-dimensional style usually termed folk art, to Steward's pupil John Brewster, a deaf and mute artist whose folk or country style, though devoid of the niceties of conventional practices, was, we now know, one of the most extraordinary artistic achievements of his day.

One might feel there is too much air-filled acreage in his landscapes, but in the portraits everything is purposeful and concentrated.

It consists of 34 black-and-white photographs taken by the author for herself when she toured Mississippi in the early 1930's as a publicity agent for the state office of the Federal Work Projects Administration.   This was before Miss Welty became a writer, or at least before she had developed the subject matter and style for which she is so widely known and admired today. In fact, the experience was a kind of catalyst, because the young woman was evident ly at loose ends. She had returned to Jackson at the start of the D epression, having completed her education at the Columbia Unive rsity School of Businessand having made an abortive attempt to earn a living in advertising in New York City. Always a very visual person , she was able with the W.P.A. job to see her home state as if for th e first time and, in taking pictures of it, discovered the similar ity between photographing people and telling stories abou t them.

For more than half a century they've been staring into nothingness and finding a beautiful nothing.\\" In JAMES JOYCE: Reflections of Ireland (Macmillan, $35), the Irish literary critic Bernard McCabe expertly combines excerpts from Joyce's books with images from the British photographer Alain Le Garsmeur to convey that \\"beautiful nothing,\\" the special blend of the real and the imaginary that was characteristic of the Joycean universe. Mr. Le Garsmeur's images -- at once remote yet immediate -- evoke the paralysis of the lives portrayed in \\"Dubliners,\\" the quiet irony that makes the characters so sympathetic in \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" and so oddly heroic in their ordinariness in \\"Ulysses\\" and \\"Finnegans Wake.\\" The Bog of Allen, through Mr. Le Garsmeur's lens, is a barren, wind-swept expanse of loneliness -- the burial place of Michael Bodkin, the model for Michael Furey in \\"The Dead\\" and the inspiration for the beautiful poem \\"She Weeps Over Rahoon.\\" Fittingly, Mr. McCabe reprints both the poem and the ending of \\"The Dead,\\" Joyce's greatest short story. In the combination of the text and two photographs of the bog -- a wide-angled image of beach and sky, and a close-up shot of broken bits of seashells and sand -- Mr. McCabe and Mr. Le Garsmeur fix the meaning of Stephen Dedalus's question in \\"Ulysses\\": \\"Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?\\" The juxtaposition suggests the Joycean insight that the simplest occurrence has cosmic implications. \\nJOELLE ZOIS IN SHORT: NONFICTION","excerpt":"Portraits of the Artist's Homeland"},{"year":"2000","title":"Duane Michals' photo Lives","excerpt":"Portraits of the Artists"},{"year":"1927","title":"Feature article by H G Scheffauer, Mystery of Sistine Madonna is solved (on identification of models as Pope Julius II and Duchess of Urbino), researches of M Stuebel","excerpt":"portraits of the characters MYSTERY OF SISTINE MADONNA IS SOLVED; Identity of Models for Masterpiece Revealed as Pope Julius II and His Ward"},{"year":"1947","title":"RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 31 -- All Brazil seemed tonight to be preparing to welcome President Truman as warmly as this country welcomed his predecessor, Franklin D.

And though the show is billed as an assessment of contemporary portraiture, some of the work included is not portraiture even by rather elastic standards.\\n\\nThe two large composite black-and-white photographs by Cosimo di Leo Ricatto are figure studies, not portraits, and so are the most striking photographs by Bruce Weber, for though faces are shown, the emphasis is on nude or semi-nude bodies. Arthur Elgort and Nan Goldin contribute fashion illustrations in which the emphasis is not on faces but on clothes and glamorous settings.

Scavullo's celebrities, dramatically posed, lighted and cropped to catch the eye, are presented in large prints, including one floor-to-ceiling blowup. Nixon's 8-by-10-inch contact prints are no larger than is usual nowadays in museum and gallery exhibitions, and his otherwise unknown old people, photographed apparently unposed in the settings of their everyday lives, are shown in a neutral light that seems to do no more (or perhaps I should say no less) than reveal them as they actually are. Scavullo seems to have created out of public figures a flamboyant world of his own imagination. Nixon seems to have retreated so far from his obscure subjects that their pictures seem to be taken by camera and chemistry alone, without any interpretation by the photographer.

Through the medium of a beloved classic story, each one displays the current fashion in what groups of girls in movies should be like. The 1933 version had the Sweetheart and the Siren trumped by the Enthusiast, with Mother an aging character part. The 1949 version had the Girl Next Door take precedence over two types of Prom Queen, and Mother was Still Lovely. And the current version offers a range of Self-Realized Women of all ages -- today, nobody is old. We could even guess that the lost silent-film versions -- an American one in 1918 and an earlier British one -- had Madcap Hoydens balanced with Submissive Damsels, and that Mother had the correct silver hair.\\n\\nBut fashion in movie girls really means specific ones, the popular stars of the moment in their characteristic personae. The 26-year-old Katharine Hepburn played Jo March in 1933 with her usual refined recklessness, backed up by the ripely sullen Joan Bennett, who then seemed fine as the selfish child Amy, despite being 24 and pregnant. The child part would prefigure the yummy blonde Amy would later become. In 1949, it was bouncy, hoarse-voiced June Allyson, then 32, as Jo, set off against the lush 17-year-old Elizabeth Taylor as Amy, another precocious bombshell, and Janet Leigh in her usual brittle and bosomy style as Meg.

But as the show (organized by the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston) travels around the country, and Mr. Biggers's work is seen and discussed by a wider audience, that omission should be taken care of.

To the people of Lisbon, the Tras-os-Montes (literally Beyond the Mountains) is the back of beyond. Yet there, in the otherwise unremarkable town of Mogadouro, is a splendid bacalhau - in fact, two different dishes - in the restaurant A Lareira (The Fireplace). One is bacalhau a brasa, a fish steak charcoal grilled. The other, the house specialty, is bacalhau flaked into a shallow pan of finely chipped potatoes lightly fried in olive oil and served with softened onions. Each costs a little less than $3.
