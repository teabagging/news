Dismayed by the recalcitrance of the police in offering her information about the killing, she undertakes a private investigation of the crime. With a kind of forceful naivete, she is led deeper and deeper into a world of criminality and violence. Wisely, the playwright and his director, Andre Ernotte, do not offer the audience time for contemplation, moving briskly, without intermission, from twist to twist and from murder to solution.

Doesn't it though? The frequency of passages like this make the prospect of another screen adaptation of the novel -- the first, directed by Robert Rossen, won three Oscars, including best picture, in 1950 -- a welcome one, since a screenwriter is free to omit them and concentrate on a sweaty, sinewy tale of corrupted idealism and moral decay. It is not hard to see why Steve Zaillian, whose writing credits include ''Schindler's List'' and ''Gangs of New York'' and who directed ''Searching for Bobby Fischer'' and ''A Civil Action,'' was drawn to the material.

The underlayment will prevent irregularities in the old surface from showing through the new one.   Flooring manufacturers usually specify the type of underlayment recommended for their product. Most old resilient flooring can generally be covered by new flooring.   Underlayment for covering wood floors generally consists of quarter-inch-thick, underlayment-grade plywood or hardboard, a paneling that is made of processed wood particles. Masonite is one brand. Half-inch-thick, underlayment-grade plywood or particleboard, a paneling made from sawdust, is usually used over floorboards wider than three inches.   All underlayment materials are available at lumber yards. When buying hardboard, specify untempered material, which is more resilient and easier to nail than tempered hardboard. Tempered hardboard has been heat treated and one surface is extremely smooth and hard, which accounts for the greater difficulty.   Installing underlayment is easiest if panels are precut to measure four feet by four feet. Hardboard is often available in this size","excerpt":"plywood is usually available only in four-by-eight-foot sheets and must be cut in half. Most lumber yards will cut for a small fee, usually about $1.50 a cut. Cutting also makes it easier to carry the wood home.   Before installing underlayment, allow it to adjust to room temperature and humidity by standing it on edge for 48 hours in the room where it will go. During this time, prepare the old flooring by driving any protruding nails below the surface and by filling pronounced gaps or cracks in the boards with crack-filling putty.   Fasten large splinters in the floor with glue or flooring nails. Sand badly hollowed floorboards, bumps or warped areas with a power sander to level them.   A belt sander is best for this purpose; they are usually available at tool rental stores. Low areas can be filled with liquid floor leveler, available from flooring suppliers. Follow the directions on the container.    Before installing the underlayment, round the edges of each panel with a file or medium-grit sandpaper. Then sweep and vacuum the floor thoroughly and make sure it is clean and completely dry. If dirt is not all removed, a new floor will sometimes squeak.    It is usually easiest to arrange underlayment panels beginning in the center of the room. Start by placing the first panel at or near the center, square with the joists supporting the floor.   Joists run lengthwise or across a room and are usually perpendicular to the floorboards. On ground floors they are generally visible from underneath, for example, from an unfinished basement.   Fasten panels with ring-shank underlayment nails or power-driven staples spaced at three-inch intervals around the panel's four sides and at six-inch intervals over the entire panel area. Begin fastening in the center of a panel and work outward. The fasteners must be long enough to pass through the old flooring and penetrate the subfloor.   After fastening the first panel, install others adjacent to it to form a row parallel to the joists. Leave a gap about the thickness of a dime between panels to allow them to expand when it is humid.   Install as many four-by-four-foot panels as needed between opposite walls of the room before beginning a second row of panels.    Make sure to avoid having four corners meet. Start the second row by attaching a panel adjacent to the first one but positioned two feet to the right or left of its center, so that the panel edges running perpendicular to the joists are staggered. Continue until as many full-size panels as possible have been installed.   Cut panels to fit the perimeter of the room. To do this, place a panel where it is supposed to go, but overlapping the edges of panels previously installed. Push the panel against the wall and adjust it so that it is square with the seams of the panels it rests on.   If adjusting the panel produces a gap wider than half an inch next to the wall, spread the arms of a drawing compass so they span the gap at its widest point. Place the compass's pointed arm against the wall and the arm containing the pencil on the panel's surface, then move the compass along the length of the panel to transfer the contour of the wall onto it.   Remove the scribed panel from the floor and saw along the line with a power saber saw, a keyhole saw or a coping saw.   File away or sand off any splinters. Then place the panel so the cut edge lies flush against the wall. Carefully mark the point at which the panel overlaps those underneath it, then saw off the overlapping portion, keeping the saw on the side of the cutting line nearest the wall. File or sand this edge smooth.   The cut panel should now fit its space precisely. By placing the saw as described, a gap of the required width will be formed between the adjacent panels. Nail or staple the cut panel in place, then repeat the process with the others.   At doorways where molding touches the floor, scribing the underlayment for cutting is more difficult. A compass can be used, but a profile gauge is easier.   Most hardware stores carry this tool, which consists of many needlelike blades bound side by side to form a rectangle. Each blade slides back and forth; pressing the tool against a contoured surface like molding repositions the blades to duplicate the contour.   Then the gauge can simply be placed on the panel and the profile traced onto the surface for sawing.   After the underlayment has been installed, inspect it for protruding fasteners and rough edges. Before the final floor covering is applied, fasteners must be driven flush with or below the surface of the panels, and rough edges must be smoothed by sanding. Finish flooring can be installed immediately.

Melani, who died in 1985 at the age of 78, lived nearly all his life in his family home in Pistoia, Italy, a small city southwest of Florence. Largely self-taught but widely read, this somewhat hermetic artist remained aloof from the Italian art scene: most of his exhibitions were held in Pistoia. He was born to a wealthy family that lost its fortune, an event that he later said caused him to read Marx and become a Communist.

''The Night of the Iguana,'' which was first seen in 1961, is a reiteration of the Williams themes already familiar by then: the endurance (herein phrased as ''any trick panicky people use to outwit and outtrick their panic'') and the resilience of displaced souls who have ''to fight and howl for decency.''   The first two acts build gracefully to a third-act windup that is fast, forced and furious.

Like poetry, tennis has strict rules, requires technical skill and is played to win.\\n\\nPlayed in elegant whites on grass courts, it is individual yet social, esthetically pleasing, intellectual, at times erotic. Even the weak E. M. Forster, who fled from team games at school, boasted: ''I play tennis with much energy.''\\n\\nTennis provided three generations of American poets with an outlet for aggression. They carried their inflated egos from the study to the court and competed as ruthlessly in sporting as in literary life. Robert Frost, who had a lifelong passion for the game, remarked in his attack on Carl Sandburg's defense of modernistic poetry that writing free verse was like playing tennis with the net down. And he told an interviewer: ''I've always thought of poetry as something to win or lose - a kind of prowess in the world of letters played with the most subtle and lethal of weapons.'' At the Bread Loaf School in Vermont, young writers were expected to defer to the vanity of the aging bard and gracefully accept defeat on the court.

If you are using a film rated at ISO 50 to 80 (ISO ratings are the same as the former ASA ratings) set your camera to 1/60 second at f/2. With films rated ISO 100 to 160, expose at 1/60 second at f/2.8, or 1/125 second at f/2. Use a higher shutter speed (such as 1/125) if you have difficulty holding the camera steady at slower speeds.

So the first step in improving your techniques is to shoot local events where you are permitted to stand near the field of play. This might include Little League baseball, high school sports and local playgrounds or sandlots.

In dealing with children the photographer must approach his subject with a much different attitude than he might use with older people - which is why it is better to think of children as ''little people.'' You must relate to them on their level, and treat them with respect and consideration if you want to insure satisfactory results.\\n\\nVery often a child will be apprehensive about being photographed because most small children don't really understand what the camera equipment is all about or what the photographer is really trying to do. In some cases the camera gear might prove to be a source of curiosity which can help catch the little one's interest, but in other cases it could be very frightening to the youngster.

Reflections on a river, fog pierced by car lights, faces illuminated by a single streetlamp or partly hidden in shadow - all these played a role as Brassai wove his photographic portrait of Paris at night in the 1930's. Indeed, many other photographers have found the setting of the sun no barrier to exploring the oftenignored creative possibilities of shooting at dusk or after dark.   Illumination during these hours can range from relatively bright street lights to faint moonlight, so most of the obstacles posed by night photography involve technical problems such as selecting the right film, processing, exposure, camera steadiness, and adjusting for the amount and quality of light available. In additional to all this there is the most important consideration of all: What creative effect or mood does one want to express in the final photograph?
