In addition to the art museum, it has its own historical museum, the Crane House, built in 1796, and a memorial rock, complete with plaque, which denotes the spot - at the intersection of what are now Valley Road and Claremont Avenue -where George Washington once stopped over.   The town's large well-kept homes record graphically virtually every historical architectural turn. Columned Georgians that would not be out of place offshore of a Louisiana bayou plantation rise alongside traditional brick Colonials; gingerbread country Victorians have dandified Italianates and barn-roofed Dutch Colonials for neighbors.

Published in 1610, when the composer was laboring unhappily at the court of the Gonzaga in Mantua, the work was dedicated to Pope Paul V and evidently intended to impress him or another potential patron. At any rate, it was instrumental in Monteverdi's hiring in 1613 as maestro di cappella at the Basilica of St. Mark in Venice.   That may in fact have been the job he wanted all along, for the work drew heavily on the antiphonal, quasi-theatrical style then in vogue at the basilica, and makes its best effect in such a spacious and reverberant setting. Unfortunately, the long, narrow Church of the Ascension in Manhattan, for all its glories, gives relatively little scope for antiphonal effects, and this limitation was the only serious drawback in a solid performance of the Vespers on Tuesday evening by the Ascension Music Chorus and Orchestra under Dennis Keene.

Or at least they were at the second performance, on Saturday evening. Mr. Vernon, who shared the extensive harpsichord accompaniments with Connie Prener, spent much of the remaining time sitting idle, with his head buried in the score, as stoical as the onstage Seneca.

State Representative Dorothy Bradley is the apparent front-runner in a six-person Democratic race, while state Auditor Andrea Bennett is the underdog for the Republican nomination. Gov. Stan Stephens, a first-term Republican, withdrew from the race in January because of poor health. If either woman wins in the fall, she will become the state's first female Governor.

They stand out on their terraces, shaking the dust from rugs. There's nothing particularly bizarre about the flapping of a rug. After all, it is spring. And an activity that rids a yearlong supply of dust from rugs should not provoke ridicule. But rug shaking does have its detractors, including the recipients of the dust and lint, which trickles down and settle on the terraces below.   As for myself, I admire the shakers. They signal the arrival of spring. The mere sight of a rug flapping takes my breath away. I'm charmed to the point of inspiration. I'm happy. It isn't a rug anymore. It's a cause, a celebration.   Spring blooms with all rugs, inexpensive as well as exotic. Persian, Oriental, East Indian, Navajo, camel's hair, mohair, bathroom mats. Rich mingling with poor. Reds, greens, yellows, blues leaping in midair, ends curled up, middles dancing wildly, joyously. Sunlight striking them like a gong.   Suddenly, with a snap of the wrists, the rugs straighten out, flat and smooth. The sudden jerking motions cause each rug to produce a giggle, an ouch. A crisp flapping sound. Quip, quip, quipple. Sounds like spring to me. -- ERNEST SLYMAN Dear Diary:   If anyone is interested in whatever became of the Brooklyn Jewish Hospital, it is now Interfaith Medical Center and it served \\"Filter Fish\\" for Passover. -- JANET WEISBERG   Last week's Metropolitan Diary included an entry from Merv Goldstein of Manhattan. Mr. Goldstein, a movie fan and would-be writer, related his delight at discovering that some United States Government Copyright Forms, for registration of published or unpublished works of the performing arts, use the name of film characters to illustrate how the forms should be filled out.   Mr. Goldstein also included a plea to other film buffs: Could anyone tell him in what movie the names Henry Leek and Priam Farll (used as examples on recent forms) turn up? Could they ever! Cut to montage of movie fans rising to the challenge -- phoning, faxing, writing (favorite stamp: Abbott and Costello).   The answer(s): \\"Holy Matrimony,\\" (1943), or its lesser-known 1933 version, \\"His Double Life.\\" Based on Arnold Bennett's novel \\"Buried Alive,\\" the story concerns a famous but reclusive British painter (Priam Farll), who assumes the identity of his dead valet (Henry Leek). Roland Young and Lillian Gish starred in the 1933 film","excerpt":"Monty Wooley and Gracie Fields in the better-known \\"Holy Matrimony,\\" with Eric Blore as the valet.   First respondents: Marty Rabinowitz, Roger Sturtevant, Frank M. Shanbacker. The three New Yorkers were among the many who added that Bennett adapted his novel for the stage as \\"The Great Adventure,\\" which inspired \\"Darling of the Day,\\" a 1968 musical with Vincent Price, Patricia Routledge and Mitchell Jason. Mr. Jason played Duncan Farll, Priam's cousin, in the musical.   Others deserving of thanks: Ring Lardner Jr., John Springer, Joe Lobel, Miriam Pellman, Helen Merber, Dorothy M.

On the other hand, if you'd like these legendary landmarks to be around for the benefit of future generations, perhaps the best thing you could do is stay home. The major peril faced by nearly a third of the sites is tourism: the damage inflicted by feet, hands, and body heat, and the air pollution emitted by the planes, cars, boats and buses that convey travelers to their dream destinations.         World Monuments Watch is a new venture of the World Monuments Fund, a private organization founded in 1965 that sponsors restoration projects internationally. They range in scale from the lions outside the New York Public Library to more than 20 water-damaged buildings in Venice. World Monuments Watch, established with a $5 million grant from American Express, is designed to heighten public awareness of the damage inflicted on many of the world's architectural treasures.

Listening to Cassandra Wilson's astonishing new album \\"New Moon Rising\\" (Blue Note), one has the pleasure not only of stumbling into an intensely aromatic musical environment but also of hearing a gifted vocalist exult in her continuing self-discovery.         The album's 12 songs, five of them Wilson originals, form a suite of passionate reveries linked by their southern ambiance. Hank Williams (\\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\") comfortably coexists with Hoagy Carmichael (\\"Skylark\\"), Neil Young (\\"Harvest Moon\\") and Son House (\\"Death Letter\\").
