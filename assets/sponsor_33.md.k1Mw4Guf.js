Even at the height of his career, Van Alen never approached the fame of Frank Lloyd Wright or Le Corbusier, but he was a major architectural figure and had been a star in the making since his student days. Soon after the Chrysler Building was finished in 1930, though, his professional standing began to slide, and he watched helplessly as his career unraveled, a victim, ultimately, of its greatest achievement.    Van Alen, who was born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 1882, grew up in a New York of low, flat-topped buildings and trained as a draftsman for a Manhattan row house developer. By 20, he had studied at the Pratt Institute and apprenticed with some of the city's best architects","excerpt":"six years later he won the Paris Prize, a scholarship that allowed him to study architecture -- and develop a fresh eye for it -- at the École des Beaux-Arts. When he returned to New York in 1910, ''he tingled with the touch of approaching modernism,'' Kenneth Murchison, an architect and critic, wrote years later. Murchison went on to characterize the young Van Alen's thoughts: ''No old stuff for me! No bestial copyings of arches and colyums and cornishes! Me, I'm new! Avanti!''

The sweater is still the epitome of chic, whether it is a sweet, sexy, seductive affair awash with little ties that are meant to be left untied or a rugged, burly style that looks as if it were knitted on broomsticks. The newest skirt anchors negligently at the hips and opens at the side, the better to show tights or panty hose. Despite all this, the fashion message for fall from the French ready&#8208;to&#8208;wear collections is not revolutionary. After all, there's no big brouhaha over hemlines, which have neither risen nor descended by a yard or so. They have, in fact, settled on a reasonable level, somewhere between just below the knee and midcalf. No yardstick is required to decide precisely where: Designers vary among themselves and presumably will extend the same privilege to their clients. The approaching the&#8208;ankle length so prevalent in the spring collections has receded, along with the mountainous bulk that led scores of plumper&#8208;than&#8208;the&#8208;norm and shorter&#8208;than&#8208;the&#8208;norm women to cry &#8220;not for me.&#8221; While clothes are slimmer, they are rarely skintight, resulting in a comfortable ease that is also modern. Designers who sought vainly to pry women out of their pants uniforms have given up the fight. In the current collections, pants have been accorded separate&#8208;but&#8208;equal status with skirts, which means you pay your money and you take your choice. This laissez&#8208;faire attitude doesn't mean that there's nothing to startle. After all, the French ready&#8208;to&#8208;wear practitioners are, collectively, the gadflies of the fashion world. Clothes that seem impossible at first glance (such as winter shorts, skirts that hang from the hips, giant serapes, short sweaters over longer ones) have a habit of passing into the public domain. If the styles seem a bit subdued this season, it may be because of the economy, no cheerier in France than it is elsewhere in the world, or because designers themselves feel a need for a breather. Perhaps the most significant development is the new way of constructing clothes, with no linings, no turned&#8208;under hemlines and a minimum of seams. Karl Lagerfeld of Chloe is the big pioneer in this area, supported by such prestigious designers as Sonia Rykiel and Kenzo. The weightless, and bulkless, construction technique makes possible the layering of clothes. Lagerfeld's tunic over a dress is the simplest manifestation. Multiple sweaters, vests and even coats are other possibilities. Each layer is in itself light and supple. Altogether, they make it possible to face an Arctic winter. The only problem is, when you check your wrap, how many layers do you part with?

A collaboration of the Mosfilm Studios and New Albania Productions, this whopping Artkino release holds almost overwhelming grandeur and a human drama that, sadly, doesn't commence vibrating till the halfway mark.The Russians have not spared the horses, costumes, castles—or the armies, which comb the vast, stunningly hued landscapes like possessed locusts. And it seems natural for a biography of a warrior to reach its peak in three magnificently staged battle sequences. These, indeed, may set the Stanley patron clawing at the back wall.However, the quieter interludes are something else, particularly in the first portion, being ponderously slow, broad and simplified in both incident and interpretation. The formative years of the hero, salvaged by a sultan from an Albanian massacre, are given short shrift, oddly.In no time flat (and a brief, worded passage), we see a matured Skanderbeg deserting for his babyhood homeland. And here, for a dull half hour or so, we watch him organize the mountainous Albanians against the Byzantine raiders. This portion also dutifully injects a budding young romance and a treacherous clansman on the sidelines—and, as it turns out, logically.The remainder of the scenario, credited to Mikhail Papava, stalks the aging leader behind the front, with some heavy-handed views of hostile Serbian and Venetian courts and a succession of sultans.In the title role, Akaki Khrava's redundant utterances against the Turks rumblingly match a strong profile and strapping physique. Both his performance and the film attain real stature in the abruptly perceptive and original final scene.But Mr. Khrava, the huge supporting cast and a trio of directors (including one hardy lady) remain most impressive in full combat. And the thunderous clamor of the Valikarna Valley foray, the bloody siege of Skanderbeg's Kruje citadel and the climactic routing of his betrayer assuredly leave no Turk unturned. As far as filling the eye, the Russians have succeeded.
