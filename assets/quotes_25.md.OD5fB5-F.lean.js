And that is the group that Gary Puckrein, 31-year-old publisher and editor in chief, would like to see making up most of his permanent subscriber list.

American Visions is being published by the Visions Foundation, and is benefiting from the cooperation and financial support of the Smithsonian Institution, the Philip Graham Fund of the Washington Post Company and Rutgers University, where Dr. Puckrein is on the history faculty.

The magazines are seen by a total of 160 million people each month.

IN THE KITCHEN","excerpt":"Magic of a Mere Hint, Or More, of Garlic"},{"year":"1956","title":"ANYONE with a tendency to air-sickness is hereby warned to beware of the third and latest Cinerama feature, \\"Seven Wonders of the World.\\" For this hodgepodge of scenic observations in color is not only caught in large part from the air, but the screen images also are so often tilted at radical angles, as the camera planes bank over the places being viewed, that the customer is likely to find himself clutching for seat straps and feeling a distinct discomfort of vertigo.This stunt of sight-seeing from an airplane, which was good for some of the most delicious thrills and provided some of the most spectacular vistas at the conclusion of the first Cinerama show, is greatly overdone in this new one. And it is, alas, but one of the several disappointing aspects of the picture that opened last night at the Warner Theatre.What Lowell Thomas, the producer and narrator, means to suggest by the title is that the world's scenic wonders are far-flung and manifold and that one can make one's own choices of them outside the classic seven of the ancient world. Indeed, he begins the picture with a preface, shown on a standard-size screen, in which he explains that of the seven ancient \\"wonders,\\" only one still exists. That is the Pyramid of Cheops and the Sphinx at Gizeh, Egypt. Whereupon the curtains of the Cinerama screen are pulled back and we are looking down upon those mighty monuments from the air.The view is striking but unsettling. It is more comfortable to look at these wonders from the ground. But that is only briefly permitted. In a flash, we are again in the air, taking off from a New York airport and roaring down the East River in a dizzy, low-flying sweep.Thus Mr. Thomas embarks us on his haphazard tour of the world.First stop—or rather, first passage—is over the great Iguazu Falls in the southern Brazilian jungles, then on for another dizzying sweep over the rooftops of Rio de Janeiro—which is one of the picture's happiest thrills. But then, for no orderly reason, the scene shifts to Japan and there's a bit of conventional sight-seeing of cherry-tree gardens, a Buddha temple and kimonoed dancing girls.From here, the jump is to Cambodia and a tantalizingly brief glimpse of the famous ruin of Angkor Wat, then on to India for a quick look at Benares and the handsome Taj Mahal.So it goes. There is a glimpse of a monkey temple, an automobile ride through a street clogged with sacred cows and a contrived but diverting trip on a narrow-gauge railroad that climbs the mountains to Darjeeling. (The run-away train coming back down the mountain duplicates the thrills of Cinerama's previous roller-coaster and bobsled rides.)Then, as the tour continues, on to the Holy Land and (after an intermission) to central Africa, Arabia. Greece and Rome, it finally becomes apparent that it is not only lacking in point or form but that the sights being seen, with few exceptions, are such as have been seen many times before. They are the usual conventional \\"pretty pictures\\" of the old-fashioned, non-interpretative travelogue. The only technical difference between this and one of Mr. Thomas' old Magic Carpet subjects is that this is being shown on the Cinerama screen.Even that has negative features, because of the heavier assault upon the optic nerves caused by those vast topsy-turvy shots from the banking airplane and the constant flow of stuff coming at you on the screen. There is a monotonous movement of the camera toward the subjects much of the time. There is also a surprising unevenness in the quality of the different sequences.Toward the end, there is a colorful show of pageantry in St. Peter's Square in Rome, with a parade of Cardinals and the Pope giving his blessing to the throngs of onlookers in the square. The solemnity of this ceremony is frequently interrupted with a silly running gag of a comical storekeeper and his family trying to get there in time to be blessed.Mr. Thomas concludes the picture with a quick turn through the American West and a little chat with a mother, who points to her seven children and says they are her seven wonders of the world. That is about the extent of the imagination shown in this two-hour film. The musical score and Mr. Thomas' narration are equally mawkish and banal.

While in France, she had married a British fighter pilot. Later, when the marriage broke up, she became a painter and went to live in Italy. When World War II began, she returned to England and bought an 800-year-old house near Cambridge. She then spent many years returning it to its original 12th-century state.

He had dropped out of Harvard to write plays, having already written one while still an undergraduate, a play so successful that he lived for some time on the royalties. When he turned out not to be a major playwright, he drifted into the then-new world of television and discovered he had a talent for adapting grand operas, so as to make them sufficiently ungrand for small screens. He married, became a father and grew passionately fond of reading aloud to his son. While doing so, he first encountered the classic children's writer E. Nesbit. That encounter led to his book.

EVE ARNOLD: In Retrospect (Knopf, $50) is a chronological memoir of Ms. Arnold's professional life along with the photographs by which she wants to be remembered. From images of Malcolm X, Marilyn Monroe and Margaret Thatcher to those of anonymous veiled Afghan women and of toddlers in a Chinese nursery, the shots she has chosen show not only the high points but also the broad sweep of her undertakings. Throughout her career, she has worked for Magnum, the photographers' cooperative founded by Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, George Rodger and David Seymour, usually on assignment for publications like Life and London's Sunday Times. Her style, despite her confession to \\"dithering and nerves,\\" is authoritative and humanist -- energized, as she says, by the unfamiliar. Being there is paramount to a photojournalist's success, and Ms. Arnold gives a lively account of the obstacles she surmounted -- rough terrain,  illness, intractable bureaucrats. Although few of the book's images hold the transcendent power of her color picture of an old Chinese woman whose beautifully lined face emerges from the textured black of her clothes and the surrounding shadow, all attest to her enterprise and tenacity, along with her ability to establish rapport with her subjects. As Ms. Arnold looks back, she seems justifiably pleased with her accomplishments and wonders about her next project. Now that she has achieved order, she might try another kind of memoir,  a distillation of her memories that brings more of the woman herself into focus.

There are hints of the melancholy and fatalism that the composer seems to inspire in choreographers. But Mr. Smuin has created a playful, lyrically romantic romp that, drawing on the song texts for its moods, demands a high standard of academic dancing, unfailing clarity and a sensitivity to dramatic texture. The work also uses most of the company's stars and many of its most promising newer performers. Review/Dance","excerpt":"Mahler In Motion: (Surprise!)

Yusuf, a reminder of the life Mahmut has left behind &#151; they're both from the same village &#151; has plans to find a job on a ship, something that never quite happens. &quot;Distant&quot; is almost like a droll take on &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;; can two men live together without driving each other crazy? The take-and-take &#151;  rather than give-and-take &#151;  of their existence seems to be set on the head of a pin, since &quot;Distant&quot; is so minutely observed. There are a few chuckles initially, especially watching Mahmut's awful, crass attempts to pick up women, and his obsession with pornographic movies. It's soon revealed that domestic events have led to his flight into crassness, and his loss will deepen over the span of &quot;Distant.&quot; Perhaps deepen isn't exactly the word, since Mahmut and Yusuf spend an enormous amount of time watching television, perching on chairs like vultures while a procession of dreary shows moves slowly past them. &quot;Distant&quot; sometimes feels like being trapped in a hotel room on a weekday afternoon. The caginess of the performers, and the personality added by the evocative cinematography, both go a long way in adding weight to &quot;Distant.&quot;   But the self-imposed dreariness prevails: eventually, the problem is the material itself. Such an accurate depiction of cramped spirits, small-mindedness and men unable to make changes in their lives takes its toll. &quot;Distant&quot; feels as if it's going nowhere in no particular hurry, and finally leaves us distant from its characters. &#151; Elvis Mitchell Not Exactly Felix and Oscar, but an Odd Couple All the Same"},{"year":"1999","title":"Correction of Feb 6 article about Scheherazade as feminist icon for Muslim women","excerpt":"Mahnaz Afkhami was co-founder of Sisterhood Is Global Institute; group addresses women's issues in all cultures Corrections"},{"year":"1944","title":"Segre, A","excerpt":"Mahogany A Picturesque Novel of West Africa; MAHOGANY.
