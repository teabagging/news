It soon becomes obvious that the lady not only will fall for Henreid's ingratiating approach but will also change her mind about evicting the motley crew who have been blithely making her dream a nightmare.The supporting cast, who are French (some French dialogue also is used) are given little to do with the exception of Marina, a youngster who is both touching and self-sufficient as the oldest of Henreid's five motherless kids. As we were saying, the Riviera is a lovely area and an occasional scene such as the one in which a chorus of the children sweetly sing a Gallic tune to Henreid's piano accompaniment, is flavorful and fitting The remainder of \\"Pardon My French\\" is merely pallid play acting.

A1    Political and spiritual world leaders urged support for victims of the tsunamis as relief agencies and governments girded to offer technical help and aid. The United States said assistance was already on its way to some of the most stricken areas. The speed and scale of the disaster left some relief specialists struggling to keep pace with events.   A10    The violent earthquake that struck northwest of Sumatra, Indonesia, was a perfect wave-making machine, and the lack of a tsunami warning system in the Indian Ocean essentially guaranteed the devastation that swept coastal communities around southern Asia.   A10    Ukraine Opposition Gaining  Viktor A. Yushchenko, the opposition leader, appeared headed for a strong victory in Ukraine's bitter presidential race, based on early vote counts and surveys of voters at the polls.   A1    Mr. Yushchenko has recovered enough from poisoning with the chemical dioxin that he should be able to serve as Ukraine's president, but he will continue to need treatment for months if not years. It is difficult to predict with great certainty the course of his recovery, and most of the treatment he will need is somewhat experimental.   A12    Astronauts Get Vital Supplies  An American and a Russian astronaut got some vital supplies when an unmanned cargo ship docked at the international space station, ending a shortage that had alarmed officials at home and forced the two men to ration supplies. The cargo included Christmas and New Year's gifts for the crew from relatives and friends, and turkey for a belated Christmas dinner.   A12    Video of Mosul Attack Surfaces  The militant group Ansar al-Sunna posted a video on the Internet claiming to show the explosion at a military mess tent in Mosul. The group, which earlier took credit for the attack, said its suicide bomber had spent a long time observing the camp and had slipped inside during a change of the guards. The authenticity of the video could not be determined.   A8    It has been less than a week since the bombing in Mosul that killed 22 people. It was the worst single attack on American soldiers since the transfer of sovereignty in June, and the forces at the base there are defensive, grieving and on edge, but determined to carry on.   A8    Jewish Settlement Withdrawal  Peat Sadeh, a small Jewish settlement in the southwest of the Gaza Strip has become the first in which all the residents have agreed to leave under the Israeli government's Gaza withdrawal plan. The collective decision is significant because Jewish settlers in Gaza have sought to present a united front against the plan to uproot them.   A4    NATIONAL   A12-15    Airlines Look Ahead To Deeper Cuts in 2005  Passengers who got caught up in the airlines' troubles this weekend got a glimpse of what might await them in the coming year. The winter storms and computer malfunctions may have been unavoidable, experts say. But the signs of labor unrest that cropped up could be a harbinger of things to come in an industry already buffeted by bankruptcies and structural change.   A1    Many Treatments, Small Gains  Desperate parents of autistic children have tried almost everything -- hormone injections, exotic diets, faith healing -- in the hope of a cure. But more than 60 years after it was first identified, autism remains stubbornly difficult to treat.   A1    Suing for a Silent Night  Each year Chris Birkett turns his modest Scottsdale, Ariz., house and yard into a 150,000-light ''Winter Wonderland,'' complete with artificial snow, Disney music and narration. The couple next door wish he would just shut up. They filed malicious noise-making charges that now threaten Mr. Birkett with $2,500 in fines and six months in jail.   A13    Doctors Try Labor Tactics  Doctors around the country are increasingly using methods popularized by labor unions to gain leverage in their fight against rising premiums for malpractice coverage. Over the past few years, their tactics have included large-scale marches, limiting treatment to emergencies or suspending service altogether. The doctors have not always been successful in gaining insurance changes, but experts say the pressure has helped move the issue up on the political agenda.   A13    Last Mass for Boston Parish  A protest vigil at a parish scheduled to be closed by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston ended when the police sealed off the 114-year-old church after its final Mass and ordered parishioners to leave. The closing is part of a reorganization developed to address declining attendance, a shortage of priests and financial pressure caused in part by the priest sexual abuse scandal.

B1    Youths Charged With Murder  Two 13-year-old cousins have been charged as juveniles with murder, the city's Law Department said.

Plaintiffs' lawyers said the plumbing tended to develop leaks after contact with the chlorine in tap water.

The lawyer, Joe Bill Campbell, declined to reveal details of the settlement but Casey, in an interview with WKYT-TV, described it as \\"healthy.\\" Emery officials could not be reached for comment. The case was scheduled to go to trial Nov. 6. The agreement must be approved by United States District Court Judge Karl S. Forester.   Casey sued Emery over its handling of an envelope that allegedly popped open at an Emery terminal in Los Angeles. Emery employees have said they discovered $1,000 in cash and a videotape inside the envelope, which had been sent to the father of a Kentucky basketball recruit in Los Angeles. The envelope bore Casey's name where the return address was listed. The Emery claim sparked an investigation of the Kentucky basketball program by the National Collegiate Athletic Association and led to both the school and Casey being placed on probation. Casey has said he did not put money into the package, and has contended that Emery defamed his character and invaded his privacy.

Martin Bucksbaum and Max Karl knew better. Each had an impact on the American landscape that was more transforming, in its way, than that of nearly any architect or city planner practicing today. Focusing on the aspirations of the middle class,  Bucksbaum and Karl helped to shape the world of suburbia -- changing the nature of the American town and proving that the physical form communities take  does not just happen but is brought into being by conscious decisions.         It's not quite right to say that Martin Bucksbaum invented suburban sprawl, either in his native Iowa or anywhere else. But when Martin and his brothers, Matthew and Maurice, decided in the early 1950's that, instead of putting their  family's fourth supermarket in someone else's building, they would become landlords themselves, it marked a turning point in the growth and development of the Middle West. The Bucksbaums' first shopping center, the Town and Country, opened in Cedar Rapids in 1956, and they went on from there to become one of the largest builders of shopping malls in the United States. They shed their family's grocery business before the Cedar Rapids center even opened, decisively staking their future on erecting what Matthew Bucksbaum would later call \\"the new downtowns.\\"    The Lives They Lived: Martin Bucksbaum and Max H.

A minor fault is that its running time is about fifteen minutes too long.The plot, briefly, is melodramatic. It seems that in London there is running around some one who, disobeying Anita Loos's injunction, has a passionate hatred of blondes. When the picture opens he has just murdered the seventh \\"fair-haired girl,\\" and presumably is waiting until Tuesday to tap off the eighth.There now enters Mr. Novello, looking pale and drawn and with a manner plainly saying that he very likely doesn't care for blondes at all. He rents a room from the parents of a light-haired girl, locks his traveling bag in the closet and settles down for a period of overacting. Beneath him, in the basement residence of the house's owner, the girl is in love with a policeman. To cut matters short, which the play doesn't do, Mr. Novello and the girl begin to look at each other with more than passing interest, and the policeman begins to look at the former with professional longing. Finally Mr. Novello is arrested, charged with multiple homicide. He explains, agreeably enough, that, instead of being the criminal, he is out to catch the murderer—because his sister was Blonde No. 1. What is even worse, he is right.The excellent portion of the picture is the delayed lead, where a series of photographic snapshots show the discovery of the seventh murder and set the scene for the horror that is to follow. After an auspicious beginning, however, the play merely trudges along the beaten path, unlivened and unimpressive. All of the characters are prone to overact—Mr. Novello especially, he having more opportunity.

Each week there are more choices, even more farmers. As you plow through the crowds and rustle through the greens, you might want a little help focusing. Here it is. These purveyors at local farmers' markets are among the best. Most bring crops to market month after month. But each has a specialty worth trying at the peak of its season. For each, the tale of what brought them to market is slightly different. Exact market locations and times are at www.cenyc.org, www.nyfarmersmarket.com and www.communitymarkets.biz.    An Orchard-Tending Family That Found a Calling    The Toigo family used to just scrape by on their 350-acre farm in Shippensburg, Pa. ''It was a real 'Green Acres' experience: run-down and tired with no cash flow,'' said Mark Toigo, who runs Toigo Orchards now with his parents and his brother.     After Mr. Toigo graduated from college in the mid-1980's he started driving berries down to a farm market in Alexandria, Va. ''It didn't take long to see how hungry people were for these kinds of things,'' he said.    The family has since leased 250 more acres. ''These farmers' markets were, without question, our salvation,'' Mr. Toigo said.    The Toigos are known for their dozens of varieties of stone fruit, including 17 different kinds of peaches -- white, yellow, cling and freestone","excerpt":"seven each of nectarines, cherries and plums; and five of apricots.    AVAILABLE -- Peaches, nectarines and plums from early July to the end of September; cherries and apricots in July.    SELECTING -- Look for peaches and nectarines that have a fragrance and yield lightly to pressure when you put your finger on top of the fruit. Apricots should be velvety soft and slightly yielding, and have a light fragrance and aroma, as should plums. When cherries color they are fairly ripe; the ripest Bing cherries are the darker ones; white Royal Ann cherries should have a red blush. If there is any greenery in the box, the leaves should be fresh.    STORING -- Don't refrigerate the fruit unless extremely ripe. Don't wash it until ready to eat.    KITCHEN TIP -- Halve and pit peaches, then grill for a few minutes; pour some brandy or rum over them.    FIND THEM -- Sundays at Tompkins Square; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 57th Street and Ninth Avenue; Saturdays in Fort Greene and Sunset Park, Brooklyn; Thursdays in Borough Park, Brooklyn.

The first of Boetticher's westerns to be released on DVD, ''Seven Men'' is a superb example of the director's compact construction and feel for landscape. It's also a fine setting for Scott, playing a former sheriff who heads out to find the seven men responsible for a Wells Fargo office holdup in which his wife was shot. She had to find work there after he lost his badge -- his inability to provide for her cost her her life.      The great 50's westerns, like those made by Boetticher and Anthony Mann, cover much more than bare-bones notions of masculine pride and honor: they tread into the more complex territory of responsibility, hinting that the great promise of postwar America -- the idea that you could provide for your family, live in a nice house and maybe even buy an Oldsmobile, if you just did your job as a man -- wouldn't guarantee happiness. And while the heroes are often thought of as stoic, their faces -- Scott's in particular -- often look weathered less by wind or sun than by the knowledge of their own limitations.

The ceremony, however, was a bittersweet event","excerpt":"seven months earlier, the undefeated filly had broken down during a nationally televised match race against Foolish Pleasure and had had to be destroyed.   When this year's Eclipse Awards are announced on Saturday, there will be an eerie echo of that moment. Without question, the 3-year-old filly champion will be Go for Wand. She is even one of three finalists for the overall title of Horse of the Year. Unfortunately, any award she receives will have to be handed out posthumously, a grim reminder of how painful and unpredictable the racing world can be.   The whole year was marked by various losses in the sport. Several major horses were simply forced into early retirement: Sunday Silence, Easy Goer, and the late-blooming Criminal Type suffered career-ending injuries, as did the stakes-winning filly Gorgeous and the promising 2-year-old colt Eastern Echo.   In November, two great stallions died within 24 hours of each other. Alydar, still a top-ranking stud at 15, broke a hind leg and had to be destroyed. Northern Dancer, at 29 no longer active in the breeding shed, finally succumbed to the infirmities of old age. Only two months earlier, the deaths of Fappiano, at age 13, and The Minstrel, 16, had been announced.    Much of this we can understand as part of the (more or less) natural order of things. The losses that are harder to accept, that continue to haunt us, are those like Go for Wand's, whose death resulted from a sudden breakdown in the middle of a race.   Few moments in sports are more wrenching than the sight of a finely tuned thoroughbred, fully extended, at the height of its powers, crashing to the track. Last year, on what was supposed to be racing's brightest afternoon, the Breeders' Cup, Oct. 27, disaster struck not once but three times.   During the Sprint, a 4-year-old colt named Mr. Nickerson collapsed and died of what was later determined to be a massive pulmonary hemorrhage. Shaker Knit fell over him and suffered such severe spinal damage that he had to be destroyed that night.   An hour later, in the Distaff, the most widely anticipated duel of the day began unfolding like a dream. The 5-year-old mare Bayakoa, who won the event last year, and the brilliant Go for Wand, who had swept five consecutive Grade I stakes, hooked up after the first quarter mile and easily outdistanced the rest of the field.   While the crowd rose to its feet, screaming encouragement, these two raced as one around the far turn and into the stretch. They were driving toward the wire, only a sixteenth of a mile away, when Go for Wand, who was leading by a head, shattered her ankle and went down. She managed to scramble to her feet but as she staggered off all she had under her were three legs and a gaping stalk of bone. While the stunned and silenced crowd wept or turned away, the filly was put down near the finish line she had been fighting so bravely to attain.   In the wake of such tragedy, the sport was assailed with criticism. Although much of it did not apply to the specific situations at hand, the questions that were raised deserve serious consideration by both the industry and the public that supports it. At its best, racing is an exercise in devotion to the running horse; each animal is a respected individual cared for and trained to achieve its fullest potential. At its worst, the game is rife with greed and exploitation and mismanagement.   But even if every issue could be magically resolved -- conditions of the track surfaces, length of the racing season, use of medications on race days, etc. -- there would still be tragedies at the race track. Thoroughbreds weigh 1,000 pounds and run at speeds up to 40 miles an hour; all that force slams down on one slender leg at a time. On occasion, even the soundest bone will snap.   I hope we never get used to it. I hope men and women will always cry when a horse like Go for Wand breaks down, when any horse breaks down, because that sorrow reflects how much these horses mean to us. We wouldn't feel such loss, such anger and emptiness, if they didn't occupy some large emotional space.   What that space is varies from person to person, but in general I think the thoroughbred fulfills a hunger for something grand and noble in our lives.   We respond almost instinctively to their beauty. They are majestic animals, massive yet elegant, a combination of power and wild grace. We respond to them as athletes, swift and hard-muscled, driving and determined, but uniquely vulnerable in the sporting world because, as animals, they are totally dependent on us for every aspect of their care and development.   We respond most strongly to the quality in them that we call \\"heart.\\" Certain horses always battle back, dig in, and somehow find reserves of sheer desire to propel them past the finish. Any trainer will tell you that the best ones know exactly what they're doing: they want to win. We admire such heroic efforts. Too often in our everyday lives, we settle for half, content just to get by. These thoroughbreds remind us of the exhilaration that comes from giving everything, from pushing ourselves to the limit.   This is why we celebrate great horses: this brief intensity, this courage, when horse and rider put everything on the line and by so doing, enlarge our sense of possibility. We race vicariously on their backs, so whether we bet on them or not the outcome matters.   But no outcome is ever guaranteed. Once the starting gates open, the routine and the unexpected often collide. The result can be Secretariat's breathtaking 31-length victory in the 1973 Belmont Stakes or the horror of Go for Wand lurching helplessly toward the stands. Greatness and tragedy are two sides of the same coin, for horses as well as human beings.   Frank Whiteley, who trained the extraordinary Ruffian, once told me that even though he knew early on that Ruffian was very fast, he could never tell for sure if any horse was really good until it had been tested in a race. I asked him why that was. \\"Because you can't see inside them,\\" he explained. \\"You can't see how big their heart is.\\"   Sometimes, when we do see, it leaves us dazed and proud to know that something so glorious still exists in the world.   Sometimes, it makes our own -- smaller -- hearts break.
