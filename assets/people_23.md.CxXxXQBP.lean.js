The Shiites' principal demand has been the release by Israel of 735 detainees, most of them Shiites.

Barely a third of them now have health benefits, and though many are young and healthy, the work they do puts them at the mercy of the microbial free-for-all that is the immature immune system. Colds and flus are endemic, as are back problems from hefting and carting young children all day. Under the Clinton plan, workers would get benefits from their employers, who would probably qualify for an expense cap of from 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent of payroll. Self-employed family day-care providers would buy their own insurance but qualify for the 100 percent health insurance tax deduction. Making health care a fact of workers' lives would almost certainly improve quality by reducing turnover.    But child care is a peculiar economic institution. Technically, it is a small business, but one lacking many of the market options of other small businesses. \\"Over all, the change is going to be a good thing, but we have to pay attention to consequences for child care,\\" said Barbara Reisman, executive director of the Child Care Action Campaign in New York.

Her clergyman brother Henry prefaced the two posthumous novels, ''Persuasion'' and ''Northanger Abbey,'' with a hype appropriate for a secular saint.

Then members of the family's wealthy landowning branches took over, issuing guarded reminiscences and some carefully selected papers, and not letting in the professional editor R. W. Chapman until the 1920's.

Even his elegant color photographs of cut flowers have the potential to shock; the clinical austerity of his vision denies their organic nature. His style is akin to what William Gass, author of ''On Being Blue,'' observed of the ''Rubaiyat'': ''Like a pair of polished shoes, (with) just the right world-weariness and erotic sheen.''   And yet there is no denying Mr. Mapplethorpe's considerable talent as a photographer and considerable ambition as an artist. His pictures are frequently striking on formal terms alone. He seems to have an innate sense of flawlessly balanced composition, and his command of the subtleties of the black and white tonal scale is masterful. This curious disjunction - between the visual appeal of his photographs as pictures and the discomforting nature of his subject matter - is the source of great confusion even among his admirers. Given that most recent claims for photography's status as an art rest on the notion of selectivity - on the photographer's choice of what to show us - how can we in good conscience call Mr.  Mapplethorpe what he by some terms seems to be: a good photographer?

While a state law requires municipalities to find alternative space for any commercial tenant displaced by public urban renewal projects, companies forced from their quarters by private projects have no such protection.

(Scribner, $14.) In his unusually candid memoir, a former Marine sniper tells of the hilarity, tedium and loneliness of the long desert deployment before the 1991 Persian Gulf war, and of the nightmarish experience of combat. The result is ''some kind of classic . . . that will go down with the best books ever written about military life,'' Mark Bowden wrote in the Book Review earlier this year. ''Swofford writes with humor, anger and great skill. His prose is alive with ideas and feeling.''    BEHINDLINGS, by Nicola Barker. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $13.95.) Wesley is a ''celebrity troublemaker,'' a grumpy shaman who wanders about small-town England researching a walking guide to the British Isles while shadowed by a ragtag mob of acolytes called behindlings, who are forever absorbed in debating their man's boozing habits and pickup techniques. ''Sheer wit and energy . . . make 'Behindlings' an excellent candidate for a cult novel -- and not just a very good novel about a cult,'' Michael Pye said here last year.    MEMOIRS, by David Rockefeller. (Random House, $17.95.) The author recounts his coming-of-age among the East Coast elite, and his eventful career at Chase, where he excelled at networking with the great and the good while transforming himself into the leading corporate statesman of his day and a paragon of the Protestant Establishment. Last year in these pages, David Brooks found this a ''calm yet revealing memoir.''    THE EYE OF THE LYNX: Galileo, His Friends, and the Beginnings of Modern Natural History, by David Freedberg. (University of Chicago, $30.) The author turned up an amazing trove of 17th-century watercolors after getting a tip from the disgraced spy and art critic Anthony Blunt. The richly detailed drawings of everything from frog anatomy to broccoli were the product of a group known as the ''Linceans'' (its most famous member was Galileo), whose mission was to record all of nature. Last year our reviewer, Christopher Benfey, said this ''enthralling'' book ''uncovers a buried chapter in the history of science and art, when the two were closely allied, and Galileo's friends turned his telescope around to view the microscopic intricacies of nature.''    REREADING SEX: Battles Over Sexual Knowledge and Suppression in Nineteenth-Century America, by Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz. (Vintage, $16.) In a corrective study that rejects the notion that there was a monolithic ''Victorian sexuality,'' a curious but sober-minded historian draws on books, periodicals and court records to examine what Americans wrote and read about sex in the 1800's -- and what they believed others should be allowed to write and read. ''Horowitz is a rigorous and supple thinker on inflammatory issues,'' Maria Russo wrote here in 2002.    DECEMBER 6, by Martin Cruz Smith. (Pocket Star, $7.99.) The picaresque hero of this novel by a polished practitioner of the international thriller is Harry Niles, a Zelig-like American con man living in Tokyo on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack","excerpt":"reluctantly, he cooks up a quixotic disinformation scheme to undermine Japan's war plans. The author's ''extraordinary story-telling talent, along with a mastery of color, period and the sights, sounds, manners and passions of prewar Japan, allows Harry's run to hold us in a state of disbelief,'' Richard Eder wrote here in 2002.    DOWN AND OUT IN THE MAGIC KINGDOM, by Cory Doctorow. (Tor/Tom Doherty, $12.95.) Set in a futuristic Florida, this novel features a 100-year-young hero who works at a Disney World run by an ''ad-hocracy'' of ''castmembers'' with cellphones implanted in their ears. The plot has something to do with warring ad-hocracies, but much of the tale is given over to gentle satire and culturally astute riffs on transhumans, ''decaf'' crack and the like. ''The impressively imagined world of the novel is tricked out in lively prose,'' Taylor Antrim said here earlier this year.    GAUD&#205;: A Biography, by Gijs Van Hensbergen. (Perennial/ HarperCollins, $19.95.) The idiosyncratic Catalan architect Antonio Gaud&#237; is portrayed as a religious archconservative who dreamed of unifying the restoration of Catalan culture with the establishment of Barcelona as the center of Christendom. This ''terrifically stirring biography'' provides ''a gripping firsthand account of Gaud&#237;'s power to melt the mind,'' Herbert Muschamp wrote in The Times in 2001.

For a brief moment this winter, it seemed that the Dutch still held sway over this tiny, as yet untamed New World island.         Too bad New York hasn't staked its claim on Koolhaas. A week after the publication of his new book, MCA, the media giant, announced that it had given Koolhaas his first American commission. As master planner for Universal City, MCA's Los Angeles headquarters, Koolhaas will supervise future development on a  415-acre site that already includes offices, production studios and a popular theme park.

Back then, Ms. Cook, now 78, was the quintessential Broadway ingénue, a demure honey blonde with a high, sweet soprano that gave only a few hints of the artist who would emerge over the next four decades. The fact that Ms. Cook will make her Metropolitan Opera solo concert debut this evening, and that the occasion is the first time in the company's 123-year history that it has presented a female pop singer in solo concert, speaks for itself. Since her ingénue days, Ms. Cook's artistry has steadily deepened, in a process that accelerated after she teamed up with the pianist and musical director Wally Harper, who died in 2004. Together they explored contemporary pop as well as theater songs and even ventured into soft rock and light swing. But in recent years she has refocused her attention on Broadway and become a definitive interpreter of Stephen Sondheim, treating his songs (especially his ballads) as the ultimate flowering of the great American songbook. If the days are long gone when Ms. Cook could toss off the high notes of Leonard Bernstein's coloratura parody, ''Glitter and Be Gay,'' from ''Candide,'' what has taken root in place of those frills is a musicianship and profound understanding of how to live inside and outside a song at the same time. Ms. Cook's blend of acting and piercing romantic lyricism achieves an overview of life, music and theater that is something to behold. Accompanying her is a quintet led by her new musical director, Eric Stern. Expect surprise guests.
