The foreign crime boss Alex Martel (Olivier Martinez) is about to be extradited after leaving a trail of corpses and misery. Following a failed jailbreak —  after which Martel inexplicably gets to speak to the television cameras —  he offers &quot","excerpt":"one hundred million dollars to whoever gets me out to here.&quot; And law and order in Los Angeles suddenly evaporates, with all of the city's thugs, gang-bangers and semi-employed, dangerous-looking actors marshalling their forces to spring Martel.

The S.W.A.T. team members —  LL Cool J, Michelle Rodriguez, Josh Charles and Brian Van Holt —  are so gung ho that in any other city they'd be subjected to steroid testing. Samuel L.

And Colin Farrell, employing a wobbly American accent that makes him sound like an international criminal a step ahead of the authorities, stars as the S.W.A.T. officer Jim Street. Much of the by-the-yard martial choreography is strictly by-the-book, as Hondo's martinet captain might say.

Persons dash in and out of rooms without ever taking time to think. If there is somebody in one room another character wants to find, he or she is bound not to see any more than the director, Frank Tuttle, wishes. It is a story that might be told in a quarter its present length or, if the fancy took a producer, it might be continued for days. Mr. Tuttle, however, rings down curtain on the hectic doings after a little more than an hour, and at this juncture one is assured that Norma Martin (Miss Bow), a motion picture star, and Larry Charters (Ralph Forbes), a music composer, are to enjoy a happy and peaceful existence, which one feels they have earned.The funniest bits in this film are those in which Charles Ruggles figures. Mr. Ruggles, as Bertie Bird, appears to be desirous chiefly of having a good sleep, but, apparently, he is prevented from indulging in a snooze until the final fade-out. Bertie is therefore an unwilling participant in the exploits, but he has plenty of time reserved to show how comic he can be.Norma Martin is supposed to be somewhat tired of the attentions of mere men. She is first seen in Paris, but soon she boards a train for the Italian Riviera. It happens that Larry Charters is on the same train with his friend, Bob Talmadge (Skeets Gallagher), who, to add to the muddle, is engaged to Norma's chum, Gloria Marshall. Charters is worried by the fair sex who want him to autograph copies of his songs. So, to please Charters, Bob poses as the song writer. He gives an interview on the train to a woman reporter and eventually gets left on the platform of a small town station. Norma also is in the same predicament. They ask about a hotel and are told that there is none in the place and they are told to put up at the Mayor's home.The Mayor looks as if he had imbibed at least three bottles of Burgundy. His speech is thick","excerpt":"one is not sure whether he is talking Monegasque or Arabic. After a few peremptory questions, which they don't understand, Bob and Norma are asked to sign papers and a little later it dawns upon them that they are married, or to confuse matters still more, Norma and Larry are married, as Bob has signed the composer's name! Marriage by proxy is all the rage in this town.Things might have been straightened out quite easily if Larry were not so popular with certain young women who have been told by him that they inspired his songs. For Norma evidently does not dislike Larry.Miss Bow does fairly well as Norma. Mr. Forbes gives a sympathetic portrayal of Larry and Skeets Gallagher is capital as Bob Talmadge. Mr. Ruggles is worthy of a more rational part than the one he has here.

The contestants were transvestites from all over the country—some of them winners in regional contests—judged for walking, talking, bathing suit, makeup, hairdo and, of course, beauty. The star and the winner was Harlow, a frail, blond, pouting young man, formerly Miss Philadelphia. The director was Frank Simon (his first feature film), and the movie itself is funny—not tactless—and inspired the way \\"The Endless Summer,\\" of surfing, was inspired. It shows us another America.It is good to watch for about an hour these colorful human beings whose entire self-image is a put-on, in their Atlantic City of Genet, in their Forest Hills of drag. The drag queens are, of course, perfectly aware that they are not women, and even their mannerisms—the flatted vowels, the relaxed wrist, the gait of the homosexual who wants it known—are not female imitations at all, but parodies. Very witty, detailed parodies at that. The question of invasion of privacy does not arise","excerpt":"one is watching actors, very conscious actors, at work.

The cosmetic idea was bound to spill over a bit. So here are all these gentlemen in bras, diaphanous gowns, lipstick, hairfalls and huffs—discussing their husbands in the military in Japan, or describing their own problems with the draft. One grows fond of all of them. They are much more entertaining than the conventional Miss This or Miss That.Two shorts opened at the Kips Bay Theater yesterday with \\"The Queen.\\" One, French, about a factory where plaster mannequins are molded, filed, hammered and repaired, is about the most extreme, laconic anti-female movie since Dean Martin last starred in anything, and the other, called \\"2\\" and spoken in American-accented Italian, is hilarious.Written by Renee Taylor, it is about a couple of people about to make love on the beach, who start confessing to each other.

Palestinians identified the dead youth as 18-year-old Adli al-Bargouthi, from the West Bank village of Deir Rassaneh, near Ramallah. They said he was shot twice in the chest in a military raid. The army said the youth was shot after soldiers were attacked with rocks by Arabs who ignored orders to disperse.   The stone-throwing, street demonstrations and clashes with soldiers that characterized the 39-month-old Arab uprising halted when the Persian Gulf war began. This was partly because of a harsh military curfew on the 1.75 million Arabs in the occupied areas, and partly because the Israeli Army warned that any Palestinian upheaval would be dealt with as if it were an act of war.    But Palestinian leaders also cautioned Arabs in the territories to avoid goading Israeli troops by violating the curfew to stage demonstrations, something that happened often in the past.

But handicapped by strident sound recording, unimpressive performance and shoddy editing, the new photoplay at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse finds itself struggling hopelessly to become the artistic, moving and forceful photoplay that its Swiss producers meant it to be.The story of the Swiss uprising against Austrian tyranny in the fourteenth century, when the freedom-loving peasants forgot their regional difference to unite and surge through the hillsides against the oppressor, demanded a more vigorous treatment than it has received in the picture. Nowhere have the producers achieved the acceleration of tempo that a kindling rebellion requires","excerpt":"one leaves the theatre with the impression that the film-makers were so overawed by the towering mountains about them that they could not make their human drama significant.If this be the right explanation, then the producers need offer no other apology. Rarely has the camera found such magnificent backgrounds for its puppet shows: sheer peaks rising into the skies, sweeping slopes and plains, feathered waterfalls, boiling torrents, rivers rolling serenely between rugged canyon walls—it is no wonder that the players could not compete with these in gaining audience attention. But, important as this may be visually, it has not helped a drama that advances haltingly where it should race.The Tell legend is too well known after these 600-odd years to require a synopsis, but the film's use of it may be interesting. Beginning with the rule of the arrogant Gessler, the Austrian bailiff sent to govern the Swiss peoples, the picture carries along with a series of episodes showing his cruelty and the resultant smoldering of the flame of revolt among the Swiss. The blinding of one man for his refusal to betray his son and public indignation over Gessler's order to Tell to shoot the traditional apple from his son's head finally lead to open revolution, to Gessler's death and the birth of a free Swiss confederacy.Conrad Veidt, best-known member of the cast on this side of the Atlantic, has little opportunity to make of Gessler anything more than a rubber-stamp despot. Hans Marr is soberly heroic as Tell and Emmy Sonnemann and young Detlef Willecke perform capably as the wife and son. But it is the photography, not the drama or the acting, that rates the applause.

The villains in this case are some cool coves, with a woman leading them, who specialize in doing away with people who are well but not wisely insured. By rigging himself out as a Hindu and by exposing himself to the villains' trap, old Sherlock discovers that the damage is being done in a most extraordinary way: spiders are being turned loose on the victims, who, once bitten, go mad with pain and kill themselves.\\"It is a quaint but not especially frightening method, as demonstrated in this film, so that the singular recommendation of \\"Spider Woman\\" is its Holmesian suavity. Basil Rathbone plays the versatile detective with his usual serene elegance, while Nigel Bruce and Dennis Hoey are his old reliable thickskulled running mates.

On Sundays after the service he would show movies, generally Swedish ones.Predestination is hardly necessary with a background like that. Bergman's films are modern sermons, plotted in an empty church and shaped—more than most of us realize—by the shadow and light, the bleak revelry, the sense of ghosts in the land and the mind contained the early Swedish films shown on those Sunday afternoons.This weekend, and lasting until early April, the Museum of Modern Art will be showing some of Bergman's Sunday afternoons: a collection of the best surviving examples of the Swedish silent film.Not that the program is set up that way. The show, organized by the Museum's Film Department with the help of the Swedish Film Institute (which is supplying the prints), sets out to present a body of work with a value of its own","excerpt":"one little known in this country. The show centers mainly around the work of two major directors, Victor Sjostrom and Mauritz Stiller.Yet take Sjostrom's \\"The Phantom Chariot,\\" (March 5 and 7). It is framed in blackness, as if the light were dark and the highlights were fugitive shadows. It starts with a wild drunken brawl in a churchyard. The protagonist, played by Sjostrom himself—who so many years later would play the old rememberer in Bergman's \\"Wild Strawberries\\"—is knocked on the head. The rest of the picture is a mixture of delusion and reality: fantasies about a chariot sent to collect the souls of the dead, interwoven with flashbacks of the protagonist's own life and loves.Complex, savage and with a half-fraudulent mystery. Coarse, half-rustic figures propelled or led on by a ghostly illumination. It is a film Bergman particularly remembered being impressed by; and it is impossible to see it now without getting a new perspective upon the harsh originality of \\"The Seventh Seal.\\"Sjostrom organized his films with the entrances and exits, the playing to a motionless camera, that is clearly derived from the theater. The plays, furthermore, are melodramas, and the acting has all the eye-rolling and underlined gesture common to films made between 1910 and 1920.The figures scurry and posture in a fashion that is too obsolete to be interesting. But there is something more. In \\"Terje Vigen,\\" which is playing on Sunday, the movement is more poetic than dramatic. It is, in fact, the recreation of a poem by Ibsen; the legend of a man who lives by the sea and loses wife and child in a famine.The reality in this still and moving film is not the plot, but the landscapes. The landscape of rock and water, and of the gray unchanging sky. The landscape of Terje Vigen's face. Suffering is as unmovable on that face as the seams on the rocks or the waves—which move but are replaced—on the sea. The motionless camera stretches out time in such a fashion that none of these things are static but simply proceed at the speed of the earth.In contrast with the work of Sjostrom is the more agile and witty style of Mauritz Stiller, a director who inspired Lubitsch, for example. In \\"Love and Journalism,\\" also playing Sunday, the plot cavorts suitably as farce. A handsome explorer returns home. A woman reporter, barred from an interview, gets a job as a pretty incompetent maid. Pretty and incompetent, that is. Love strikes, etc., etc.The real movement is not in the plot, though, but in the faces and stances of the lovers. It is a dialogue of gesture; Karin Molander as the journalist has a face that is an epigram, a body—relaxing and going taut—that is a retort.Another Stiller comedy, considerably more sophisticated, is his \\"Erotikon, (March 3 and 5); a witty, perhaps ambiguous mockery of the rich, it tells of a series of shifting relationships, among a professor, his wife, a sculptor who loves her, and others. Temptation is a game more than a reality. The mind dabbles in it; what the bodies do is almost beside the point.The more dramatic side of Stiller's work is also shown. \\"The Treasure of Arne\\" (Feb. 20 and 22) is an elaborate epic tragedy, taking place in the 16th century, and based on a novel by Selma Lagerlof. Snowbound landscapes and the sea are used to frame the small figures and their struggles.The balance of the program includes other works by Sjostrom and Stiller, and some by lesser-known directors. In particular, there is \\"The Prisoner of Karlsten's Fortress,\\" which was shown yesterday. It is a knotty and silly melodrama about a man who steals a scientist's secret formula for making explosives, and hides the professor's daughter in a castle. The film—appropriately, by the Hasselblad Studios, which in those days made films as well as cameras—is mainly about deep focus.One short film, \\"Peter the Tramp,\\" (March 12 and 18) used Greta Garbo when she was still known as Greta Gustaffson.At every conceivable opportunity people are photographed through doorways, down passages and on the other side of windows, in order to show off the technique. It is an early example of technological folly—we have the movie for the sake of the camera instead of vice versa.For programs and times on the day of a show, call 956-7078.

Dodd of Connecticut made the nominating speech at the Democratic National Convention, saying that he would not question the reputation of Bob Dole, the Republican candidate, but rather his ''flawed ideas,'' and stating that ''President Clinton has put our economic house in order.'' $(Page A1.$)    Many delegates, particularly New York City's, say they have been inundated with angry calls about the new welfare law. $(B9.$)    NEW YORK     Class Spills Outside Classroom    New York City's public schools are so crowded that thousands of the 1.06 million schoolchildren will report to class next week at such unlikely places as a converted World War II torpedo factory in Brooklyn, a renovated department store in Queens, the Town Hall theater in midtown Manhattan and dozens of temporary aluminum trailers scattered in schoolyards across the city. $(A1.$)    Crazy, No. Facing Trial, Yes.    Vincent Gigante, considered the most powerful Mafia boss in America but perhaps best known for walking through his neighborhood in a bathrobe and pajamas, was declared mentally competent to stand trial on murder and racketeering charges by a judge who called his odd behavior an ''elaborate deception.'' $(B1.$)   The Genovese crime family has suffered three severe blows, capped by the ruling on Mr. Gigante. $(B6.$)   The judge in the case, Eugene H. Nickerson, does not shrink from making tough decisions. $(B6.$)    Giuliani's Second-in-Command    Tightening his inner circle of top aides, Mayor Giuliani promoted his chief of staff, Randy M. Mastro, to the position of Deputy Mayor for Operations, effectively making him the second-in-command at City Hall. Mr. Mastro replaces Peter J. Powers but will not receive Mr. Powers's former title of First Deputy Mayor. $(B1.$)    From Depths, Artifacts of Life    To an archeologist and her students, history is an outhouse in SoHo. The group dug into the foundation of the privy and found items either dropped in accidentally or used to fill in the hole when inside plumbing arrived about 120 years ago. What is emerging from those pieces is a picture of middle-class Irish life. $(B1.$)    When a Race Is All-Out War    A battle between Democrats is under way in Manhattan Surrogate's Court, where Judge Renee R. Roth is seeking another term. To her chagrin, the judge finds herself in a primary fight with Karen S. Burstein, the former Family Court judge. The race has riled tempers, split loyalties and turned into something of a morality play for feminists. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick. $(B1.$)    Rethinking Stadiums and Funds    Months after speculation that the Yankees would abandon their South Bronx home subsided, the stadium debate resurfaced when city officials announced that they had hired a financial consultant to help the city devise ways to pay for new or renovated stadiums for both the Yankees and the Mets. $(B3.$)    Facing More Accusations    Adelphi's former internal auditor told a state panel reviewing charges of mismanagement at the university that Peter Diamandopoulos, Adelphi's president, promoted an employee to a key managerial post even after the employee was found to be stealing on the job. $(B5.$)    Mass Rabies Alert Issued    Since last week, when a goat being exhibited at a county fair in Owego was killed after it was found to have rabies, health officials have been conducting the largest rabies vaccination effort in New York State history.

For this sturdy drama is forthright and adult in its approach to one man's problems. But despite expert acting and direction and a subtle fusing of realism and symbolism, this generally tenebrous tale of a tugboat captain torn between loves and responsibility only fitfully projects more than its craftsmanship. \\"Stormy Waters\\" is a sensitive, philosophic and sometimes moving story, but it is rarely as tumultuous as its title.As in \\"Port of Shadows,\\" Jean Gabin and Michele Morgan are teamed and set near the sea. This time the scene is Brest, and in this adaptation of \\"Remorques,\\" a Goncourt Prize novel, Gabin is a simple, honest, seaman, happily married for a decade, whose only other love is his ship with its crew. This placid existence is disturbed when he attempts to salvage a freighter foundering in a savage storm, and Michele Morgan, the freighter captain's wife, who is among the rescued, comes into his life. Embittered by her hate of her husband, she is drawn to her rescurer. And, though the latter struggles steadfastly against this involvement, he ultimately succumbs. The three principals' unhappiness, while unrelieved, is plausible, and the final denouement, in which the triangle is broken tragically, is a most realistic conclusion to a dolorous affair.Jean Gabin's excellent performance as the strong, tight-lipped and humble man, whose convictions clash with his emotions, gives all the dimensions to the character he portrays. Michele Morgan lends restraint and nobility to her delineation of the girl, while Madeleine Renaud, makes a truly fragile and pitiful figure of Gabin's wife. A convincing supporting cast, authentic maritime backgrounds and fine English subtitles, which make the narrative eminently lucid, add to the artistry of this Metro importation. And while this artistry is a welcome change from that in less eloquent films, this study is not of the stature of the great French dramas.

The same report states that traumatic brain injury is the leading killer and cause of disability in children and young adults.   While deaths are down from accidents, which is good news, the need for rehabilitation and appropriate education of people with head injury is greater than ever. As more children and adults with severe-to-profound head injury are saved, the need for community-based care grows. Of those who survive each year, approximately 70,000 to 90,000 endure lifelong debilitating loss of function. An additional 2,000 will exist in a persistent vegetative state.

The almanac assembled contributions from leading exponents of Dada, an international cultural movement centered in Berlin with satellites in Zurich, Paris, Cologne, Barcelona and New York, among other cities. Contributors included Hugo Ball (who with his wife, the singer Emmy Hennings, launched Dada in Zurich in 1916 by opening the Cabaret Voltaire), the Romanian poet and Dada propagandist Tristan Tzara, the artists Francis Picabia and Hans Arp, and the architect, performance artist and agent provocateur Johannes Baader, among many others. Not represented in the almanac was the more politically active contingent of Berlin Dada, including George Grosz, John Heartfield and Wieland Herzfelde, an omission that points to the fractures in the ever-volatile movement that was born of the disgust of European artists and intellectuals with the carnage produced by the nationalist fever of World War I. This annotated edition of the almanac, the first to appear in English, includes an introduction in the form of a survey of the history of Dada by the editor and translator Malcolm Green, capsule biographies of Dada figures, and supplementary documents and photographs. This is a somewhat rough and ready edition with an agitprop quality, but it is nevertheless a crucial document for anyone interested in the history of the 20th-century avant-garde.\\nMIGNON NIXON IN SHORT: NONFICTION;\\nDada Dearest"},{"year":"1930","title":"log Dream of His Life Realized, Von Gronau Says in His Story","excerpt":"One Must have Some Daring if One Is to Live Dreams, So I Just Went,' He Writes--'Wunderbar,' He Exclaims at Sight of New York's Towers.

And any reviewer who attempts to decide the issue between them is likely to find himself \\"dreaming true\\" on a bed of rocks that have bounced off his reckless head. These sentimental people are the most violent of all when some matter-of-fact individual tries to step in and tell them what's what.So there are to be no comparisons here. \\"Valor's best part is discretion,\\" and the issue isn't of prime importance, anyhow. It would take precedence over everything else only if the novel and the play had been butchered, which, honestly, they haven't been—that much may be risked at any rate—and what is offered at the Criterion is a motion picture, for New York's benefit called \\"Peter Ibbetson\\" and, apparently, to be rechristened \\"Forever\\" when it starts its round of the provinces, where its originals and John Barrymore are not so well known.It's a motion picture, then, that is to be reported on. And it may be said in the beginning that it is a sentimental romance about a youth and a girl whose childhood is of such happiness as weather-beaten adults can know only in dreams and who, after years in which they find real life all ugly, claim in dreams the mature happiness they have missed. How persuasive the story on the screen is will depend for each individual upon how much his or her loyalty to the book or the play is satisfied or offended, or upon how much he or she likes extremely sentimental romances. Even if the spectator is a little hard-shelled, the picture will probably get him at times, for it has many charming moments.For one thing, the photography is beautiful. George Fitzmaurice, who directed the production, is a director of pure pictures. His scenes are gracefully composed, effectively lighted and softly toned, without sacrifice of clearness. Many of the sets of \\"Peter Ibbetson\\" are a treat to the eye, and some of them are dramatically expressive, too. The story is largely verbal, but whenever it does get into moving pictures it is alluring.The effect is strengthened by the players. Though only a few of them do any noteworthy acting, George Fawcett, as old Major Duquesnois, being among those emphatically worthy of note, they all look their parts. Elsie Ferguson as the Duchess of Towers is lovely, quite explaining Peter's enduring devotion to her. Wallace Reid, as Peter, is esthetic enough, almost, to banish rude memories of his irresistibly risible farcing in other pictures. Montagu Love gives a self-conscious performance as Colonel Ibbetson, but as Colonel Ibbetson was such a self-conscious person this doesn't hurt much, unless you remember Lionel Barrymore too acutely, and the others in the cast, Dolores Cassinelli. Elliott Dexter, Barbara Dean, Paul McAllister and the two children, Nell Roy Buck and Charles Eaton, are all satisfactory.The Criterion program begins with a musical number, \\"The Enchanted Forest,\\" which becomes, in a sense, pictorial because of the use of Nicholas de Lipsky's ingenious method of changing scenes by merely changing lights. Also on the program are a thrilling picture of Kaiteur Fails, British Guiana","excerpt":"one of Charles Urban's amusing studies of young animals, and another of Max Fleischer's exceedingly clever diverting \\"Out of the Inkwell\\" cartoons. There is an elaborate singing and dancing prologue to the photoplay, too.Marshall Neilan gives impetus to a good idea in his \\"Bits of Life,\\" at the Capitol this week.One of the chief complaints against many photoplays is that they are too long. They are padded until everything in them that might be of interest is smothered. This is due in part to the fact that exhibitors demand footage. Programs, you know, are as unchangeable in their form as the laws of the Medes and Persians. Give the average exhibitor the finest photodramatic work in the world and if it is only two, three of four reels long he doesn't know what to do with it. It's not a comedy, so he can't tag it on to the end of his bill. It's not a travel picture or a scenic, so he can't run it in as a filler somewhere. It's a feature in everything but length, but that means to him that it's lacking in the most important characteristic of all. A feature simply has to be at least five reels long, and preferably six, or it doesn't consume the time allotted to it in all well-regulated programs. Obviously, the exhibitor can't run a three or four feel feature and then tell his audience to sit and gossip or play toddle-top for fifteen minutes or half an hour, until the time that would have been occupied by a regular feature has expired. So what can the poor fellow do? Of course, he might fill up his program with other interesting short stuff, but that would be asking him to get out of his comfortable rut and go scouting for things that do not come to him in the ordinary flow of films through exchanges. It's easier to say that every feature must be five or six reels in length and nothing shorter will be accepted.It's up to the directors, then, to supply footage. So they pad. They find a fairly good story that can be best told in two or three reels, and they industriously go to work to make it fill five or six. That is, they do so almost invariably. And, of course, tiresome photoplays are the result.But Marshall Neilan has done something different. He has made a feature of prescribed length, but he has told four stories in it, instead of one. The first person to do this, according to the records, was Charles J. Brabin, who made \\"While New York Sleeps,\\" which, you may remember, gave you a set of separate thrillers in one film. And now Mr. Neilan offers you his four in \\"Bits of Life.\\" Who's the next? Let somebody else carry on the good work.For the idea has another advantage. It has been said about a vaudeville entertainment that it is always encouraging because, no matter how bad the act you are seeing is, you always feel that the next one will be better. So with one of these variety features. If one of the stories bores you, you live in hope that the next one will prove interesting.As a matter of fact, however, Mr. Neilan's stories are not tiresome. In the first place, they are so short and snappy you don't have time to become tired. And two or three of them are pretty good stories, anyhow. They are adapted from yarns by Hugh Wiley, Thomas McMorrow, Walter Trumbull and Mr. Neilan himself. The first is a colorful crook play with a pleasingly unmovielike ironic twist at the end, the second is about a deaf man who lives in ignorant bliss of the real world until he gets an instrument that enables him to hear, the third relates the villainous life and timely death of a Chinese lord of the underworld, and the fourth is a wild dream of a persecuted Princess and foreign devils.Although without any particular cinenatographic quality, all of the pictures are well made, as animated photographs, and the acting is above the average. Lon Chaney as the Chinese of the third story gives a striking performance. Others in the different casts are John Bowers, Noah Beery, Teddy Sampson, Dorothy Mackail, Harriet Hammond, Anna May Wong, Rockliffe Fellows, James Bradbury Jr., Frederick Burton, James Neil, Tammany Young and Wesey Barry.Also on the Capitol program is a ???harming Pathecolor work, \\"The City of the Lake Como, Italy,\\" and an interesting picture of snow in Japan, from he Pathe Review.\\"Camille,\\" with Mme. Nazimova, and Tony Sarg's \\"The Vamp\\" are the principal offerings at the Rivoli this week: \\"Woman's Place,\\" with Constance Talnadge, by John Emerson and Anita Loos, is at the Strand, and \\"Under the Lash,\\" with Gloria Swanson, is at the Rialto. \\"Nobody's Fool,\\" with Marie Prevost, is remaining for a second week at the Central.

AN OIL TOWN LOOKS FOR A NEW MEANS OF SUPPORT"},{"year":"1995","title":"A writer pressing the case of the neglected hero gone before has a difficult role: part night nurse, part hit man. Tenderly we protect the wounded one, aggressively we search for someone we can blame. We are, of course, thinking about ourselves. The neglected writer of the past is our own feared specter, our double, thrust into the darkness of the future, the ghost of what we tell ourselves will never happen but know is to come.   A kind of love grows up between these writers, one living, one dead. This can be trying if the writer you love is probably not a person you would have liked. I am in the situation of thinking that Katherine Anne Porter wrote like an angel, but is someone I'm glad I didn't have to know.   She was almost certainly not a nice person. She was a great beauty, but all her young photographs have a self-conscious, self-dramatizing quality that makes them difficult to approach. She lied brilliantly on a variety of subjects, from her place of birth to her age. She was born in west Texas in 1890, but often suggested she was a daughter of the Old South, and a younger one at that. She lied about rather crucial things to two of her four husbands, neglecting to tell one she had had a hysterectomy and revealing her true age to another only on their wedding day. She was slippery in business dealings","excerpt":"one of her favorite words -- \\"shady\\" -- could not inaptly be applied to her. She also loved the word \\"bitter,\\" and both shadows and bitterness contributed to her difficulties in working and to the vexed nature of her relationships.   She was an anti-Semite, although she produced devastating portraits of anti-Semites, and she was a racist who believed that darkies were happy on the old plantation, although she wrote a story full of understanding of the buried longings of former slaves. She dated Hermann Goring at least once, and was disappointed when he didn't call back, but later said she was the first among her friends to grasp the horrors of Nazism. She betrayed one of her best friends, Josephine Herbst, to the F.B.I., which suspected Herbst of being a Communist. It was done casually, alcoholically, on a \\"date\\" with an agent set up to get her drunk and make her talk. Porter forgot having \\"talked,\\" then resented Herbst for her political recklessness, which she saw as a danger to herself.   But none of this has to do, really, with why Katherine Anne Porter is not more widely read. Being read has not, thank God, rested on good behavior, loyalty to friends, sobriety or straight dealings with publishers. Think of the case of Ernest Hemingway, like Porter a beauty, a poseur, a betrayer and a drunk -- but certainly not unread.   The image of Hemingway inevitably comes to my mind when I think of Porter. They were the reverse sides of each other -- one so traditionally masculine, one so traditionally feminine. Both were deeply American yet ill at ease in America, both wrote with a passionate eye and a reckless insistence on getting things said. But it was Porter's bad luck to be a near-contemporary of Hemingway's. His spare, stripped-down style set a tone for what it was to write as an American. The problem was that it set the tone, so that others were drowned out or considered deficient, improper, overdone.   Now I must admit here that I enjoy blaming Hemingway for things. On a bad day, I lay at his feet overpopulation, air pollution and harmful additives in foods. On a good day, I admire his descriptive powers and the integrity of his plain style. But let us, however reluctantly, put blame aside and consider that Hemingway was surrounded or enveloped or covered by a historical cultural accident outside his control. He precisely fit the bill of American fantasy after World War I. Partly it was his war record, partly it was his looks -- what Edmund Wilson is said to have called his Clark Gable smile. And then there was the athleticism, the sexual adventurism and being in Paris at the right time.   Certainly, he added to American prose a needed and on the whole healthful styptic touch. There was, beginning in the age of Victoria, a kind of sickly overabundance that affected everything from furniture to the poetic line. It was also an age of increased female power and feminization of culture. Perhaps for that reason, the choking fustiness that characterized the taste of the age became associated with the female -- the maternal, unsexual female, that is. And she was the one who, in the provincial towns of America, ran culture. How exhilarating Hemingway's sentences must have seemed to a claque of young men who feared death by antimacassar.   The novel -- all prose fiction for that matter -- is the love child of two deeply incompatible parents. It has journalism for a father, poetry for a mother. For Hemingway and all his sons, the goal was to make of prose an Athena: sprung full blown from the head of the father, the mother swallowed up and kept from sight. \\"Good\\" prose was to have the sharp, telegraphic punch of newspaper language; \\"bad\\" prose was ornamented, gilded as the Gilded Age. This determination became the boot that flattened the face of American prose. It had many victims, including, perhaps most notably, F. Scott Fitzgerald, who died virtually unread, most of his books out of print. Later, other voices, particularly William Faulkner's, swelled the American chorus. But Porter's combination of cold realism and an unmistakably female point of view made her an uncomfortable passenger on what Flannery O'Connor called Faulkner's \\"Dixie Express\\" at the same time that she was marginalized as a \\"Southern writer.\\"   ADDED to these accidents affecting Porter's status is the formal prejudice that insists that the novel is the real thing and shorter forms only pathetic country cousins. So for many years, Porter took her place as a writer of perfect short stories, admirable but somehow outside the big picture. She had no traceable ancestors and spawned no followers. Her stories resisted easy categorization. Their finished shape belied their originality. They combined ferocity and tenderness, opulence and precision, voluptuousness and chastity. It was easier to treat her as a curiosity, a fragile and perhaps overwrought china doll, than to acknowledge the importance of what she had produced. And she produced very little -- three collections of stories, \\"Flowering Judas\\" (1930), \\"Pale Horse, Pale Rider\\" (1939) and \\"The Leaning Tower\\" (1944). Her collected stories, published in 1965, are only 495 pages long: in a career of nearly 50 years, that's 10 pages a year.   Publishers kept asking for the novel, and she put her mind to it, adopting a course that was both personally and formally a torment to her. She began \\"Ship of Fools\\" in 1941, and worked over it, seized by reluctance and boredom and self-hatred, for more than 20 years. When it finally appeared, in 1962, it brought her a fame and a financial success her stories had never achieved; it became, for younger readers, the way that they knew Katherine Anne Porter. Which meant they did not know her at her best, as a writer of stories. And if they knew her only as the author of the book a much-hyped movie was based on, they would wonder what any shouting had ever been about.   \\"SHIP OF FOOLS\\" has a kind of greatness, but it is not the kind associated with the traditional greatness of the novel. We expect that in a novel characters will move and grow, and the characters of \\"Ship of Fools\\" appear in a series of static snapshots. There is an overlay of melodrama: a drug-addicted \\"Condesa,\\" a saintly doctor, an alcoholic aging belle, a dwarf. But the novel is fearless in its facing of the possibility that the true nature of human beings is malign. To act with malignity would seem, in Porter's mind, to be as natural to humans as drawing breath. There is the thick malignity of the Germans, the careless, coarse malignity of the Americans. But most frightening of all is the troupe of Spanish dancers who are utterly outside the web of moral consideration. They will do anything for profit, to get their way or to experience the joy of humiliating. There are two children in the troupe, twins from hell called Ric and Rac after two dogs in a comic strip, who live only to cause harm, and one night they throw the beloved white bulldog of a childless German couple overboard, simply out of boredom.   We see over and over again in \\"Ship of Fools\\" a technique of which Porter is a master: the ability to describe gesture and manners, to use them as a nest in which to enclose a statement of general, even metaphysical, significance. This is evident in her description of a scene in which a drunken husband beats his wife in the same room in which their child is supposedly asleep. Then in a fit of morose mutual lust, the parents make love in the bunk above their son's head. In the morning, another passenger sees them bowing and holding the door for each other and remarks:   \\"That sad, dull display of high manners after they had behaved no doubt disgracefully to each other and their child was intended no doubt to prove that they were not so base as they had caused each other to seem. That dreadful little door-holding bowing scene had meant to say, You can see, can't you, that in another time or place, or another society, I might have been very different, much better than you have ever seen me. . . . What they were saying to each other was only, Love me, love me in spite of all! Whether or not I love you, whether I am fit to love, whether you are able to love, even if there is so such thing as love, love me!\\"   Lost in the bitterness and cynicism with which Porter wrote \\"Ship of Fools\\" is the joy in nature and in simple living that marks her greatest short stories. This pleasure suffused the breathtaking \\"Holiday\\" (1960), which took her more than 30 years to write. It is the story of a suffering young woman's vacation with a family of German immigrant farmers. The center of the story is a hideously afflicted young serving girl, whom the narrator only gradually realizes is one of the children of the family. She sees that the forgetfulness, the brutal using of this girl is not a cruelty but a down-to-earth understanding that a dreadful tragedy has occurred, that something must be done with it and life must go on. Ottilie, the damaged girl, is portrayed in all her grotesqueness, surrounded by her family's intensely healthful and fecund business. But around these two aspects, like a shimmering envelope, is the narrator's enchantment with the land and the coming of spring. She describes one of her first rides across the property:   \\"There was nothing beautiful in those woods now except the promise of spring, for I detested bleakness, but it gave me pleasure to think that beyond this there might be something else beautiful in its own being, a river shaped and contained by its banks, or a field stripped down to its true meaning, plowed and ready for the seed. . . . The leaves were budding in tiny cones of watery green.\\"    After a disastrous thunderstorm, in which everybody in the family works to the utmost to try to save what is being ruined by the overwhelming waters, the mother (whom Porter has described, with one of her delicious aphorisms, as \\"a matriarch in men's shoes\\") simply takes to her bed and dies. The family goes off in a caravan of wagons for the funeral; only the narrator and Ottilie are left at home. Ottilie begins to weep, to howl with weeping. The narrator assumes that she is grieving because she hasn't been included in the funeral procession, and she takes her in a rickety wagon to try to catch up with the others. She discovers that what Ottilie wants is not to join the others but just to go for a ride. What she wants is a holiday. In her realization, the narrator is shocked into a deep understanding:   \\"Ottilie, now silent, was doubled upon herself, slipping loosely on the edge of the seat. I caught hold of her stout belt with my free hand, and my fingers slipped between her clothes and bare flesh, ribbed and gaunt and dry against my knuckles. My sense of her realness, her humanity, this shattered being that was a woman, was so shocking to me that a howl as doglike and despairing as her own rose in me unuttered and died again, to be a perpetual ghost. Ottilie slanted her eyes and peered at me, and I gazed back. The knotted wrinkles of her face were grotesquely changed, she gave a choked little whimper, and suddenly she laughed out, a kind of yelp but unmistakably laughter. . . . The feel of the hot sun on her back, the bright air, the jolly senseless staggering of the wheels, the peacock green of the heavens: something of these had reached her. She was happy and gay, and she gurgled and rocked in her seat, leaning upon me and waving loosely around her as if to show me what wonders she saw.\\"   Porter earns her right to speak about humanity, about life and death, because she has so firmly rooted her perceptions in the soil of the particular. The mention of Ottillie's stout belt, the touch of the narrator's fingers on her dry flesh, makes us understand that the voice of the narrator is entirely trustworthy; if she says this is the nature of life, we will believe it.   And we believe Porter when she takes us in \\"Pale Horse, Pale Rider\\" into the territory not only of death, but of dying. The strength of our belief is connected to the fact that we are not reading just a story about dying. We learn, as well, about sexual love, the war at home, pleasure in weather and clothing and animal aliveness, the manners of people who work at a minor newspaper in a minor American town, the precarious position of a woman who must earn her way with no one behind her to break her fall.   THE lovers in the story are named Adam and Miranda: the first man, the untainted daughter of Prospero. He is a soldier about to leave for World War I. Adam expects not to return, so the few days he has with Miranda have a great preciousness. But she can't take time off from work on the newspaper to spend the day with him. So we see her in her rather cheerful office, with the colleagues who sit on her desk and let their feet dangle. There is a brilliant set piece about a hoofer to whom Miranda has given a bad review. He insists on confronting her and insists that she tell him why she doesn't think he's any good. \\"I've been called the best in the business by the best in the business and I wanta know what you think is wrong with me,\\" he says in an agonizing display of bravado that ends in tears.   In the course of Miranda's daily rounds, we meet types who are caught on the exhilarating hook of Porter's aphoristic wit. A thuggish Liberty Bond salesman is introduced:: \\"He might be anything at all . . . advance agent for a road show, promoter of a wildcat oil company, a former saloon keeper announcing the opening of a new cabaret, an automobile salesman -- any follower of any one of the crafty, haphazard callings.\\" Another patriotic fund raiser is said to have a face \\"in which nothing could be read save the inept sensual record of 50 years.\\"   Miranda's attraction for Adam is recorded in a prose that is oddly arousing in spite of its formal strictness. His uniform, his shoes, his watch, his hands are all the locus of a tremendous masculine force. And yet, when Miranda falls sick, he nurses her with the tenderness of the mother she still yearns for. It is not, after all, the war that cuts into their time together, it is the influenza epidemic, which brings Miranda to the brink of death.   And it is at this moment that Katherine Anne Porter performs one of the riskiest feats in American literature. She dares to use the language of transcendence and of dream to describe what is supposed to be indescribable: the experience of dying. She approaches it breakneck, on the back of a horse that is always on the verge of bolting. But it does not, even for a moment, resist her control. Then, the heart-stopping fence is taken, with the inevitable arc of perfect flight:   \\"There it is at last, it is very simple. . . . Granite walls, whirlpools, stars are things. . . . None of them is death, nor the image of it. Death is death . . . and for the dead it has no attributes. Silenced she sank easily through deeps under deeps of darkness until she lay like a stone at the farthest bottom of life, knowing herself to be blind, deaf, speechless, no longer aware of the members of her own body, entirely withdrawn from all human concerns, yet alive with a peculiar lucidity and coherence; all notions of the mind, the reasonable inquiries of doubt, all ties of blood and the desires of the heart, dissolved and fell away from her, and there remained of her only a minute fiercely burning particle of being that knew itself alone, that relied upon nothing beyond itself for its strength; not susceptible to any appeal or inducement, being itself composed entirely of one single motive, the stubborn will to live.\\"    Grammatically, this last sentence is a matchless piece of virtuosity: 12 clauses that rise, fall, meander, rise again, then crash. The sentence is followed by a much quieter diction: we learn that Miranda will live but that Adam has died -- not of a German bullet but of the influenza he caught from her. Reluctantly, Miranda understands that she must go on living. She plans her resurrection in a traditionally feminine way: she makes a shopping list. \\"One lipstick, medium, one ounce flask Bois d'Hiver perfume, one pair of gray suede gauntlets without straps, two pairs gray sheer stockings without clocks. . . . A jar of cold cream. . . . No one need pity this corpse if we look properly to the art of the thing.\\"   Katherine Anne Porter was heroic in her commitment to looking properly to the art of the thing. This commitment allowed her to look in the face of such unimaginables as evil, death, the irreparable blows of fate, and force them to turn themselves beautiful. It was an exhausting and perilous enterprise, one that made it almost impossible to live. She reached 90, but for many of the years of her long life she produced no writing. What she did produce has the clarity and inclusiveness of the art we have proclaimed great. She once sent a message to the sophomore class of Thomas A. Edison High School in Tulsa, Okla. It said: \\"Practice an art for love and the happiness of your life -- you will find it outlasts almost everything but breath.\\" Rediscoveries; The Angel of Malignity: The Cold Beauty of Katherine Anne Porter"},{"year":"2005","title":"You can find the highly entertaining master pie baker Liz Schillinger brandishing her frozen marble rolling pin inside the Victorian house festooned with a flag of a basset hound hanging from the porch.

Heilmeier, for an invention made nearly 25 years ago: a flat, lightweight video screen on which images can be formed by applying electric current to an organic material called liquid crystal.   At the time of his discovery, Dr. Heilmeier was a young researcher at RCA. But the company quickly gave up efforts to commercialize his invention after determining that it was \\"more a threat to its existing business than an opportunity,\\" he recalled as he accepted the award.    The Japanese engineers filling the auditorium nodded in silent understanding. Two decades ago many of them had recognized the potential of Dr. Heilmeier's invention. They have built upon it to turn the manufacturing of the video screens, known as flat-panel displays or flat panels, into the cornerstone of a multibillion-dollar Japanese strategy to greatly increase the country's share of the world market for computers and to introduce a host of products.  An Article of Faith     Today it is an article of faith among Japanese manufacturers that by the late 1990's flat panels, barely thicker than a heavy plate of glass, will replace the bulky cathode-ray tube now used in desktop computers. If they are right, Japan will control another essential link in the food chain of high technology. And as the cost of producing the newest of the screens decreases, the biggest names in Japanese electronics are betting that they will be positioned to exploit the technology into everything from high-definition televisions that hang on the wall, to operating-room screens that show surgeons where to cut, to automobile navigation systems that, set into the dashboard, guide drivers to a restaurant or display a shortcut.    The story of how Japan came to dominate what almost every electronics expert agrees is one of the critical computer and video technologies of the 1990's has many familiar elements, and a few surprises. There was patience and persistence, several false starts and years of money-losing research. But the most important may have been Japan's early recognition that learning how to manufacture the screens -- and to manufacture them in enormous volume, for commercial use rather than specialized government and military applications -- was as critical to the future of the technology as the initial breakthrough itself. Marketplace Experiments     If the technology for all this was born at RCA Laboratories, it grew up in places like the Sharp Corporation's manufacturing plants in this ancient Japanese capital. After only three years of tinkering, Sharp decided that the place to experiment was in the marketplace. It installed the first, primitive screens in battery-operated pocket calculators, then in digital wristwatches, clocks and tiny television sets. Now, in much refined form, flat panels are omnipotent not only in those products but also in portable computers, video cameras, compact disk players and medical equipment. \\"There was such keen competition in calculators that it forced improvements in ways that laboratory research never could,\\" said Atsushi Asada, Sharp's senior executive vice president and its head of research. \\"We had to make the screens thinner and thinner, more and more compact. This was research by industrialization.\\"   But only in recent years has the work begun to pay off. Liquid crystal's chief advantage is that it requires relatively little electric power, meaning that it can run on batteries. It has taken years, however, to improve sharpness and contrast -- and, most recently, the ability to display thousands of brilliant colors. Now, the big challenges are to make the screens larger, to reduce their power requirements and to manufacture them without defects in enormous volume.  An Ulterior Motive     If the Japanese makers seemed single-minded in their dedication to the technology, they had an ulterior motive. Early on, they intuited that the technology could be parlayed into a huge lead into a new generation of small notebook computers. Those five- to seven-pound machines are Japan's first big hit in the computer business. And while some parts of those systems, including the microprocessors, are made by foreign companies, the panels are the single most expensive component. Not surprisingly in a country that has learned to hoard the highest value-added work for itself, the screens are virtually all produced in Japan.   Sharp alone has made 20 million small liquid-crystal screens this year, and 600,000 large units, including its new color panels. And in the past year the field has exploded here: Matsushita, Hitachi, NEC and a host of lesser-known Japanese companies are in a race to build new plants, all spending at least $100 million a year, in some cases far more. Even a giant American player like the International Business Machines Corporation has been so daunted by the costs and risks of manufacturing large color panels that it created a rare joint venture with a Japanese competitor, Toshiba. The venture is planning to begin production of a color screen next spring. American Entries Unlikely     \\"Except for some research, almost all of the advanced work is now here,\\" Dr. Heilmeier, now the chief technical officer of Texas Instruments in Dallas, said in Japan. \\"And the cost of building facilities to produce them is so high that I doubt we are going to see any serious American entries.\\"   Flat panels, of course, are hardly the first critical component to high-technology appliances that Americans invented and then failed to manufacture in high volume. Much the same happened with a critical type of chip, called the charged-couple device or C.C.D., that converts light images into electronic impulses. Developed by Bell Laboratories, it is the key component in video cameras and facsimile machines.   Nor is it the first time Americans have cried foul as Japan virtually overwhelmed the market. A number of small American companies with advanced technology -- many of them developed under contract to the military -- are now foundering in their attempts to manufacture on a large scale. A sense among many investors that the Japanese are too far ahead has thwarted efforts to raise enough money to go into mass production. Unfair Trade Complaint     Several months ago a group of the companies filed a complaint with the United States Government that Japanese makers were selling the screens at artificially low prices to intimidate would-be competitors. But Japanese companies deny the accusation, and they seem likely to find an ally among American computer makers, which depend on Japanese suppliers.   But to those who still view Japanese industry as monolithic, with manufacturers working hand-in-glove with each other and the Government, flat panels are a case study in how much Japanese industry has changed in recent years. While there is one Government-led project to industrialize large-screen displays, thus far it has played little role in the main developments.   Moreover, there has been far more competition than collusion: Japanese companies spent much of the 1970's and 1980's battling each other with competing technologies to build the panels, some betting on tiny light-emitting diodes and others on screens that use electroluminescent gases. But in the past two or three years, that has begun to change. Some makers surged ahead with a technology called active-matrix displays, in which the liquid crystal is placed atop what is essentially a single large computer chip with upward of 1.6 million transistors. Each transistor controls a specific point on the screen, allowing precise images and a huge range of colors. A Huge Scramble     The development has caused a huge scramble, in which companies have all but abandoned years of work to catch up in liquid crystal. \\"Basically, we are in a panic,\\" said a researcher at a large Japanese company that only recently began pouring money and talent into liquid crystal.   Even those who bet correctly early on, like Sharp and Hitachi, say they still face enormous problems. Chief among them is the disappointing level of their \\"yields,\\" the number of usable screens that emerge from the processes of manufacturing the giant chips that underlay active-matrix screens. While all companies guard their yield figures zealously, engineers say that for the most complex color screens, only 10 to 20 percent are good enough to sell.    Companies like Toshiba, Hitachi and Matsushita are becoming their own biggest customer for the technology, installing their fanciest screens in a series of luxury products.    The evidence is in towns like Ome, on the outskirts of Tokyo, where Toshiba is making its first laptop computers to use its newly developed, brilliant-color liquid-crystal screens. The computer costs nearly $13,000 in Japan","excerpt":"one of the company's top engineers estimates that $5,000 of that is the price of the screen alone. But the company is betting that, just as it learned how to solve yield and cost problems with memory chips, it will solve them again. From Octopus and Squid     Liquid crystal's existence has been known for more than 100 years. In nature, liquid crystal is produced by octopus and squid, and scientists have toyed with it for decades. But it was 1964 before Dr. Heilmeier and other researchers began to experiment with one of the material's stranger characteristics: By applying an electric current, liquid crystal could be transformed into a type of camera shutter, letting in light when its molecules are standing on end, blocking it when they are twisted horizontally.   That discovery permitted the first liquid crystal displays, with their giant, blocky displays of numbers.

This can be a bit maddening for those whose understanding is in a rush, or those who have only a short time in the country each year. We'd like, say, warblers to jump out of the pines in their brightest colors, give a quick identifying whistle, pose long enough for pictures, build a nest, lay some eggs, turn an aerial somersault, then do all these again in slow motion. In the real country such sightings tend to come scattered and slow, like a jigsaw puzzle only one piece of which is issued you each year. Luckily, there are places where these pieces are collected for us, identified, displayed and interpreted: first-class science museums. Here in north-central New England we're fortunate to have four excellent museums spaced within the radius of an easy half-day's drive, and there's no better way to deepen your understanding of regional flora, fauna and landscape (and sky scape!) than by spending some time at any or all, hiking their trails, studying the exhibits, listening to their resident naturalists explain what nature is up to in these hills. Vermont Institute of Natural Science, Vermont Raptor Center High on a meadow above Woodstock is the Vermont Institute of Natural Science, with barnlike headquarters, nature trails and a quiet beaver pond. These are interesting in their own right (there's no better place to study nature than an  old hill farm reverting back to forest), but the big attraction here is the Vermont Raptor Center, where hawks and owls and other birds of prey that have been wounded by accidents are rehabilitated so that they may be sent back to live in the wild. Birds that can't be released, those that are permanently disabled by car accidents or gunshots, are enclosed in spacious flight habitats connected by a gravel path. Bald eagles, great horned owls, the tiny three-ounce saw-whet owl (Vermont's smallest raptor), peregrine falcons, a plump snowy owl -- there are more than 26 species here, sent to the center from as far away as Alaska. Since  raptors tend to be among the most elusive species to spot in the wilds, particularly those that are nocturnal (in a lifetime of hiking these woods, I've only spotted an owl three or four times), such a venue provides a priceless opportunity to get to know these birds better. The remarkable thing about raptors, of course, is their eyes, their visual acuity. Walking from the enclosure, stopping to read at the helpful interpretative stations, glancing back up, you have the uncanny sense you're not watching the raptors at all, but that they are watching you, and not only that,  but watching you more intensely than you've ever been watched. Montshire Museum of Science Just over 20 miles to the east off I-91 is the Montshire Museum of Science in Norwich, Vt. This is my family's favorite -- not only is it our rainy day old-reliable, but it provides the best learning tools we've found to help us understand the environment we live in. The museum itself is a striking, modern structure that sits on a promontory of land between the Connecticut River and the marshy bay at the mouth of Bloody Brook","excerpt":"one of the gentlest, most interesting nature trails leads down through tall white pines to the bay's shady banks. Inside the museum is what must surely be one of the greatest assemblages of hands-on, child-friendly exhibits ever gathered in one place, all of which, in a most entertaining way, introduce children to the basics of the natural world --  physics, optics, electricity, gravity, biology. The enchanting physics of the bubble, for example, comes to life in a play area where children explore bubbles with a variety of tanks, hoops and wands. There's a special museum called Andy's Place, which has exhibits for pre-schoolers, from crawl-through dens to animal puppets and exploratory mazes. Even the building's interior contributes to the lessons; a color-coded ventilation system, the see-through elevator shaft and exposed trusses all quietly demonstrate how a building \\"works.\\" My children love the freshwater aquariums the best, finding the bass, perch, trout and frogs much more relevant to their own experience than the exotic tropicals most aquariums feature. We also enjoy the brand-new Hazen Trail, which leads a mile and a half along the banks of the Connecticut, and gives many insights into this unique riverine environment. (Pick up a coded guide at the desk for explanations of what you're seeing.) Unlike some children's museums, the Montshire (whose name comes from the last syllables of Vermont and New Hampshire) offers plenty of interest for adults, from star-watching nights to lectures on the environment to courses on the natural history of the nearby river. Save a long morning or afternoon for this museum, to explore it right. Christa McAuliffe Planetarium Both the Vermont Institute of Natural Science and the Montshire got started through the efforts of dedicated bands of local volunteers. The planetarium in Concord, N.H., had a quite different origin: a national outpouring of grief. Almost immediately after the Challenger disaster of Jan. 26, 1986, some kind of  memorial was planned to honor the New Hampshire school teacher Christa McAuliffe, who taught in Concord and was one of the astronauts killed (indeed, letters and donations began pouring in before there was even any kind of foundation to accept them). The Christa McAuliffe Planetarium, an hour's drive east of the Montshire off I-393, was the outcome. The planetarium, quite literally, is a bright triangle of light, with its modern pyramidlike structure rising skyward above the nondescript suburban plain. Inside are displays not only about the night sky but also about Christa McAuliffe's life, including examples of those cards and letters sent after her death from children around the world. The atmosphere, with this background, could be gloomy, but it's anything but, and seems to tap into some of Christa McAuliffe's own vivacity and enthusiasm. The centerpiece attraction is the planetarium's comfortable 92-seat theater, where sky shows that use a state-of-the-art sound system, vivid animation, computer graphics and hand-held \\"voting\\" machines (which let the audience vote on such things as which planet they'd like to explore next) combine to produce a realistic, entertaining and, yes, educational science experience, this time centered on the glories and mysteries of the night sky. The planetarium is a rainy-day backup when it's too soggy to explore the outdoor museums, but it's more than that, too, and since it's right on one of the main routes to the White Mountains, it makes a great place to break up the long drive north. The schedule of shows changes fairly often here, so more than in most places, it's best to call ahead to find out what's up. Science Center Of New Hampshire An hour's drive up I-93 to Route 3 is the Science Center of New Hampshire, set on 200 acres of gently rising upland on the western shore of Squam Lake (of \\"On  Golden Pond\\" fame) in the busy resort center of Holderness. Here the shopworn notion of a \\"nature trail\\" has been taken in new and creative  directions. Called the Gephart Exhibit Trail, it's a beautifully designed walkway three quarters of a mile long, linking live animal displays (wounded or orphaned animals including bobcats, bears, otters and raptors), and hands-on  children's activities in a huge cedar barn, including games, puzzles and interpretative displays. This is supplemented by two other linked trails: the Ectome trail, with exhibits based on the four major ecosystems that can be found on the property, and the Mount Fayal trail, which leads to the rocky summit of a 1,067-foot mountain with excellent views of big Squam. This is primarily an outdoor museum for children, with many activities all season long, but the kind of place any adult will enjoy as well. One of my own favorite spots to visit, when things get a little hectic down below, is the site of the old Piper Homestead (well marked on the trail map you can pick up at the  visitor center), where the old foundation holes under the pines, the ruins of the old stone walls, speak volumes of the lonely, hardscrabble life led by the farmers who tried to wrest a living from this rocky soil a century ago. The lake country of New Hampshire can be a busy place in summer months, but the  Science Center as a whole, and this quiet, shaded corner of it in particular, are a most welcome refuge -- and not only for animals but for those of us who seek out such spots, where nature and man can share the space of a summer day.

BUSH: Say, why all the glum faces? Yesterday, the people went to the polls and they cast their vote for a new direction in the House of Representatives. And while the ballots are still being counted in the Senate, it's clear the Democrat Party had a good night last night. And I congratulate them on their victories. This morning I spoke with the Republican and Democrat leadership in the House and the Senate. I spoke with Republican leaders, Senator Frist and Senator McConnell and Speaker Hastert and John Boehner and Roy Blunt. I thanked them for their hard-fought contest. I appreciated the efforts they put in for our candidates. I'm obviously disappointed with the outcome of the election and, as the head of the Republican Party, I share a large part of the responsibility. I told my party's leaders that it is now our duty to put the elections behind us and work together with the Democrats and independents on the great issues facing this country. This morning I also spoke with the Democrats. I spoke with Senators Reid and Durbin. I congratulated them on running a strong campaign in the Senate. And I told them that, regardless of the final outcome, we can work together over the next two years. I also congratulated Congresswoman Pelosi and Congressman Hoyer. They ran a disciplined campaign. Their candidates were well organized and did a superb job of turning out their votes. I told Congresswoman Pelosi that I looked forward to working with her and her colleagues to find common ground in the next two years. As the majority party in the House of Representatives, they recognize that in their new role they now have greater responsibilities. And in my first act of bipartisan outreach since the election, I shared with her the names of some Republican interior decorators... (LAUGHTER) ... who can help her pick out the new drapes in her new offices. I believe that the leaders of both political parties must try to work through our differences. And I believe we will be able to work through differences. I've reassured the House and Senate leaders that I intend to work with the new Congress in a bipartisan way to address issues confronting this country. I invited them to come to the White House in the coming days to discuss the important work remaining this year and to begin conversations about the agenda for next year. The message yesterday was clear: The American people want their leaders in Washington to set aside partisan differences, conduct ourselves in an ethical manner, and work together to address the challenges facing our nation. We live in historic times. The challenges and opportunities are plain for all to see. Will this country continue to strengthen our economy today and over the long run? Will we provide a first-class education for our children? And will we be prepared for the global challenges of the 21st century? Will we build upon the recent progress we've made in addressing our energy dependence by aggressively pursuing new technologies to break our addiction to foreign sources of energy? And, most importantly: Will this generation of leaders meet our obligation to protect the American people? I know there's a lot of speculation on what the election means for the battle we're waging in Iraq. I recognize that many Americans voted last night to register their displeasure with the lack of progress being made there. Yet, I also believe most Americans and leaders here in Washington from both political parties understand we cannot accept defeat. In the coming days and weeks, I and members of my national security team will meet with the members of both parties to brief them on latest developments and listen to their views about the way forward. We'll also provide briefings to the new members of Congress so they can be fully informed as they prepare for their new responsibilities. As we work with the new leaders in Congress, I'm also looking forward to hearing the views of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, co- chaired by Secretary James Baker and Congressman Lee Hamilton. This group is assessing the situation in Iraq and are expected to provide -- and the group is expected to provide recommendations on a way forward. And I'm going to meet with them, I think, early next week. The election has changed many things in Washington, but it has not changed my fundamental responsibility, and that is to protect the American people from attack. As the commander in chief, I take these responsibilities seriously. And so does the man who served this nation honorably for almost six years as our secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld. Now, after a series of thoughtful conversations, Secretary Rumsfeld and I agreed that the timing is right for new leadership at the Pentagon. Our military has experienced an enormous amount of change and reform during the last five years while fighting the war on terror","excerpt":"one of the most consequential wars in our nation's history. Don Rumsfeld has been a superb leader during a time of change. Yet he also appreciates the value of bringing in a fresh perspective during a critical period in this war. Don Rumsfeld's a patriot who's served our country with honor and distinction. He is a trusted adviser and a friend, and I'm deeply grateful to his service to our country. I've asked Bob Gates to serve as the secretary of defense. Bob is the former director of the CIA and current president of Texas A M University. If confirmed by the Senate, Bob will bring more than 25 years of national security experience and a stellar reputation as an effective leader with sound judgment. He's served six presidents, from both political parties, and rose from an entry-level employee in the CIA to become the director of central intelligence. During his service at the CIA and at the National Security Council Bob Gates gained firsthand knowledge that will help him meet the challenges and opportunities that our country faces during the next two years. He is serving as a member of the Baker-Hamilton commission. He is a steady, solid leader who can help make the necessary adjustments in our approach to meet our current challenges. I will have more to say about Secretary Rumsfeld and Bob Gates later today here at the White House. Amid this time of change, I have a message for those on the front lines: To our enemies, do not be joyful. Do not confuse the workings of our democracy with a lack of will. Our nation is committed to bringing you to justice. Liberty and democracy are the source of America's strength, and liberty and democracy will lift up the hopes and desires of those you are trying to destroy. To the people of Iraq: Do not be fearful. As you take the difficult steps toward democracy and peace, America's going to stand with you. We know you want a better way of life, and now is the time to seize it. To our brave men and women in uniform: Don't be doubtful. America will always support you. Our nation is blessed to have men and women who volunteer to serve and are willing to risk their own lives for the safety of our fellow citizens. When I first came to Washington nearly six years ago, I was hopeful I could help change the tone here in the capital. As governor of Texas, I had successfully worked with both Democrats and Republicans to find common-sense solutions to the problems facing our state. While we made some progress on changing the tone, I'm disappointed we haven't made more. I'm confident that we can work together. I'm confident that we can overcome the temptation to divide this country between red and blue. The issues before us are bigger than that and we are bigger than that. By putting this election and partisanship behind us, we can launch a new era of cooperation and make these next two years productive ones for the American people. I appreciate your interest. Now I'll answer some questions. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Does the departure of Don Rumsfeld signal a new direction in Iraq? A solid majority of Americans said yesterday that they wanted some American troops, if not all, withdrawn from Iraq. Did you hear that call? And will you heed it? BUSH: I'd like our troops to come home too, but I want them to come home with victory. And that is a country that can govern itself, sustain itself and defend itself. I mean, I can understand Americans saying, Come home. But I don't know if they said: Come home and leave behind an Iraq that could end up being a safe haven for Al Qaida. I don't believe they said that. And so I'm committed to victory. I'm committed to helping this country so that we can come home. Now, the first part about... QUESTION: New direction... BUSH: Oh, new direction. Well, there's certainly going to be new leadership at the Pentagon. And, as I mentioned in my comments, that Secretary Rumsfeld and I agreed that, sometimes, it's necessary to have a fresh perspective. And Bob Gates will bring a fresh perspective. He'll also bring great managerial experience. And he is -- I had a good talk with him on Sunday in Crawford. I hadn't -- it took me a while to be able to sit down and visit with him. And I did. And I found him to be of like mind. He understands we're in a global war against these terrorists. He understands that defeat is not an option in Iraq. And I believe it's important that there be a fresh perspective, and so does Secretary Rumsfeld. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Last week you told us that Secretary Rumsfeld would be staying on. Why is the timing right now for this? And how much does it have to do with the election results? BUSH: Right. No, you and Hunt and Kyle (ph) came in the Oval Office and you asked -- Hunt asked me the question one week before the campaign, and basically it was: You going to do something about Rumsfeld and the vice president? And my answer was, you know, they're going to stay on. And the reason why is I didn't want to inject a major decision about this war in the final days of a campaign. And so the only way to answer that question and to get you onto another question was to give you that answer. The truth of the matter is, as well -- I mean, that's one reason I gave the answer. But the other reason why is I hadn't had a chance to visit with Bob Gates yet, and I hadn't had my final conversation with Don Rumsfeld yet, at that point. I have been talking with Don Rumsfeld over a period of time about fresh perspective. He likes to call it fresh eyes. He, himself, understands that Iraq is not working well enough, fast enough. And he and I are constantly assessing, and I'm assessing, as well, all the time, by myself, about: Do we have the right people in the right place with the right strategy? As you know, we're constantly changing tactics. And that requires constant assessment. And so he and I both agreed in our meeting yesterday that it was appropriate that I accept his resignation. And so, the decision was made -- actually, I thought we were going to do fine yesterday. Shows what I know. But I thought we were going to be fine in the election. My point to you is that, win or lose, Bob Gates was going to become the nominee. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. You said you're interested in changing the tone and committed to changing the tone in Washington. Just a few days before this election, in Texas, you said that Democrats, no matter how they put it, their approach to Iraq comes down to: Terrorists win, America loses. What has changed today, number one? Number two, is this administration prepared to deal with the level of oversight and investigation that is possibly going to come from one chamber or two in Congress? BUSH: What's changed today is the election's over. And the Democrats won. And now we've going to work together for two years to accomplish big objectives for the country. And, secondly, the Democrats are going to have to make up their mind about how they're going to conduct their affairs. And I haven't had a chance to talk with the leadership yet about these issues. But we'll begin consultations with the Democrat leadership starting Thursday and Friday. QUESTION: Mr. President, thank you. You acknowledged that this is a message election on the war in Iraq. And so the American public today, having voted, will want to know what you mean in terms of course correction on Iraq, and particularly in light of this fact that last week the vice president pointed out that you and he aren't running for anything anymore and that it's, quote, Full speed ahead on Iraq. So which is it? Are you listening to the voters or are you listening to the vice president? And what does that mean? BUSH: I believe Iraq had a lot to do with the election, but I believe there's other factors as well. People want their Congress -- congressmen to be honest and ethical. So in some races, that was the primary factor. There were different factors that determined the outcome of different races, but no question, Iraq was on people's minds. And, as you have just learned, I am making a change at the secretary of defense to bring a fresh perspective as to how to achieve something I think most Americans wants, which is a victory. We will work with members of Congress. We will work with the Baker-Hamilton commission. My point is is that, while we have been adjusting, we will continue to adjust to achieve the objective. And I believe that's what the American people want. Somehow it's seeped in their conscience that, you know, my attitude was just simply Stay the course. Stay the course means let's get the job done, but it doesn't mean staying stuck on a strategy or tactics that may not be working. So perhaps I need to do a better job of explaining that we're constantly adjusting. And so the fresh perspective (ph) on what the American people here today is we're constantly looking for fresh perspective. What is also important for the American people to understand is that if we were to leave before the job is done, the country becomes more at risk. That's what the vice president is saying. He said, if the job is not complete, Al Qaida will have safe haven from which to launch attacks. These radicals and extremists have made it clear they want to topple moderate governments to spread their ideology. They believe that it's just a matter of time before we leave so they can implement their strategies. We're just not going to let them do that. We're going to help this government become a government that can defend, governor and sustain itself and an ally in the war on terror. QUESTION: Your message today is not full speed ahead? Is that right... BUSH: We got another man with the mike, David. Please. QUESTION: Mr. President, thank you. Can I just start by asking you to clarify, sir, if in your meeting with Steve and Terry and Dick, did you know at that point... BUSH: I did not. QUESTION: ... you would be making a change on Secretary Rumsfeld? BUSH: No, I did not. And the reason I didn't know is because I hadn't visited with his replacement -- potential replacement. QUESTION: But you knew he would be leaving, just not who would replace him? BUSH: No, I didn't know that, at the time. QUESTION: OK. May I ask you about Nancy Pelosi... BUSH: The other thing I did know, as well, is that that kind of question, a wise question by a seasoned reporter... (LAUGHTER) ... is the kind of thing that causes one to either inject major military decisions at the end of a campaign or not. And I had made the decision that I wasn't going to be talking about hypothetical troops levels or changes in command structure coming down the stretch. And I'll tell you why I made that decision. I made that decision because I think it sends a bad signal to our troops if they think the commander in chief is constantly adjusting tactics and decisions based upon politics. And I think it's important in a time of war that, to the extent possible, we leave politics out of the major decisions being made. And it was the right decision to make, by the way. And secondly, I hadn't visited with Bob Gates. I told you, I visited with him last Sunday in Crawford. You can't replace somebody until you know you've got somebody to replace him with. And, finally, I hadn't had my last conversation with Secretary Rumsfeld, which I had yesterday. QUESTION: Mr. President, I'd like to ask you: Nancy Pelosi has been quite clear about her agenda for the first 100 hours. She mentions things like raising minimum wage, cutting interest rates on student loans, broadening stem cell research and rolling back tax cuts. Which of those can you support, sir? BUSH: No, I knew you'd probably try to get me to start negotiating with myself. I haven't even visited with Congresswoman Pelosi yet. She's coming to the Oval Office later this week. I'm going to sit down and talk with her. I believe, on a lot of issues, we can find common ground. And there's a significant difference between common ground and abandoning principle. She's not going to abandon her principles and I'm not going to abandon mine. But I do believe we have an opportunity to find some common ground to move forward on. In that very same interview you quoted, one of these three characters asked me about minimum wage. I said: There's an area where I believe we can make some -- find common ground. And as we do, I'll be, of course, making sure that our small businesses -- there's compensation for the small businesses in the bill. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. In our discussion with you last week, which you've referenced here several... BUSH: Are you bringing this up so everybody else gets kind of jealous? (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: Certainly. BUSH: Gregory, for example, and Steve were there. QUESTION: This is a very competitive environment we're in here. No. But we asked you about the fate of Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney. Vice President Cheney, of course, has made -- takes many of the same positions as Secretary Rumsfeld did on the war. Does he still have your complete confidence? BUSH: Yes, he does. QUESTION: Do you expect him to stay to the... BUSH: The campaign is over. Yes, he does. QUESTION: And he'll be here for the remainder of your term? BUSH: Yes, he will. Thank you. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. With all due respect, Nancy Pelosi has called you incompetent, a liar, the emperor with no clothes and, as recently as yesterday, dangerous. How will you work with someone who has such little respect for you leadership and who is third in line to the presidency? BUSH: I've been around politics a long time. I understand when campaigns end and I know when governing begins. And I'm going to work with people of both parties. You know, look, people say unfortunate things at times. But if you hold grudges in this line of work, you're never going to get anything done. And my intention is to get some things done, and soon -- we're start visiting with her Friday with the idea of coming together. Look, this is a close election. If you look at race by race, it was close. The cumulative effect, however, was not too close. It was a thumping. But nevertheless, the people expect us to work together. That's what they expect. And as I said in my opening comments, you know, there comes responsibility with victory. And that's what Nancy Pelosi told me this morning. She said in the phone call she wants to work together. And so do I. And so, that's how you deal with it. This isn't my first rodeo. In other words, this is not the first time I've been in a campaign where people have expressed themselves in different kinds of ways. But I have learned that, you know, if you focus on the big picture -- which in this case is our nation -- and issues we need to work together on, you can get stuff done. For example, the No Child Left Behind Act is going to come up for reauthorization. There's an area where we must work together for the sake of our children and for the sake of a competitive America. And I believe we can get a lot done. And I know it's the spirit of the new leadership to try to get some -- to get a lot done, and I look forward to talking to them about it. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. You just described the election results as a thumping... BUSH: I said the cumulative -- make sure. Who do you write for? QUESTION: The New York Times, Mr. President. (LAUGHTER) BUSH: Oh, yes... (LAUGHTER) Let's make sure we get the facts. I said that the elections were close -- the cumulative effect... QUESTION: Yes, is a thumping. BUSH: Thumping. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: But the results have been... BUSH: It's a polite way of saying, you know -- anyway, go ahead. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: But the results are being interpreted as a repudiation of your leadership style in some quarters. I wonder what your reaction is to that. And should we expect a very different White House, should we expect a very different leadership style from you in these last two years, given that you have a whole new set of partners? BUSH: You know, I really haven't -- I'm still going to try to speak plainly about what I think are the important priorities of the country, and winning this war on terror is by far the most important priority. And making sure this economy continues to grow is an important priority. And making sure our children have a good education is an important priority. Obviously, there's a -- there's a shift in the Congress. And therefore, in order to get legislation passed, we've got to work with the Democrats. They're the ones who control the committees. They're the ones who will decide, you know, how the bills flow. And so you'll see a lot of meetings with Democrats and a lot of discussion with Democrats. And in terms of the election, no question, Iraq had something to do with it. And it's, you know, it's tough in a time of war, when people see carnage on their television screens. The amazing thing about this election, and what surprised me somewhat, which goes to show I should not try punditry, is that this economy's strong. And, a lot of times, off years are decided by the economy. And yet, you know, obviously there was a different feel out there for the electorate. The economy -- the good news in the economy was overwhelmed by the toughness of this fight and toughness of the war. And so, look, I understand people don't agree -- didn't agree with some of my decisions. I'm going to continue making decisions based upon what I think is right for the country. I've never been one to try to fashion the principles that I believe or the decisions that I make based upon trying to, kind of, short-term popularity. I do understand where the people -- the heart of the people. I understand they're frustrated. I am too, as I said the other day. I wish this had gone faster. So does Secretary Rumsfeld. But the reality is that it's a tough fight. And we're going to win the fight. And I truly believe the only way we won't win is if we leave before the job is done. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) BUSH: I know. Terrible principle. I'm sorry. QUESTION: Thank you, sir. BUSH: Think I'm nuts? (LAUGHTER) You think my sensibilities left me as a result of working hard on the campaign trail? QUESTION: But to follow, we were speaking about the war. And during the campaign, two very different viewpoints of the war came out. You spoke a lot, as he mentioned, about what you saw as the Democratic approach to the war, which you were greatly concerned about. Are you worried that you won't be able to work with the Democrats? Or do you feel like you have to prevail upon them your viewpoint? BUSH: Well, I think we're going to have to work with them, just like I think we're going to have to work with the Baker-Hamilton commission. It's very important that the people understand the consequences of failure. And I have vowed to the country that we're not going to fail; we're not going to leave before the job is done. And obviously we've got a lot of work to do with some members of Congress. I don't know how many members of Congress said: Get out right now. I mean, the candidates running for Congress and the Senate, I haven't seen that chart. Some of the comments I read, where they said: Well, look, we just need a different approach to make sure we succeed. What -- you can find common ground there. See, if the goal is success, then we can work together. If the goal is get out now regardless, then that's going to be hard to work together. But I believe the Democrats want to work together to win this aspect of the war on terror. I'm also looking forward to working with them to make sure that we institutionalize, to the extent possible, steps necessary to make sure future presidents are capable of waging this war. Because Iraq is a part of the war on terror. And it's -- you know, I think back to Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower. I mean, Harry Truman began the Cold War and Eisenhower, obviously from a different party, continued it. And I would hope that would be the spirit that we're able to work together. We may not agree with every tactic, but we should agree that this country needs to secure ourselves against an enemy that would like to strike us again. This enemy's not going away after my presidency. And I look forward to working with them. And I truly believe that Congresswoman Pelosi and Harry Reid care just about as much -- you know, they care about the security of this country like I do. They see -- you know, no leader in Washington is going to walk away from protecting the country. We have different views on how to do that, but their spirit is such that they want to protect America. That's what I believe. Just like I talked about the troops, I meant what I said. Look, people that's going to be looking at this election, the enemy's going to say, Well, it must America is going to leave. And the answer is no, that doesn't what it means. Our troops are wondering whether or not they're going to get the support they need after this election. Democrats are going to support our troops just like Republicans will. And the Iraqis have got to understand this election -- in other words, I said, Don't be fearful. In other words, don't look at the results of the election and say, Oh, no. America's going to leave us before the job is complete. That's not what's going to happen, Jim. Yes, sir, Fletcher? QUESTION: Thank you, sir. There's a bill that could come before the lame-duck session of Congress that would extend voting rights in the District of Columbia in Congress and also give an extra seat to Utah. You've been passionate about democracy in Iraq. Why not here in D.C.? And would you support this bill? BUSH: Yes, I -- this is the first I've heard of it. I didn't know it's going to come up from the lame-duck. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) bill? BUSH: Well, it may or may not come up. I'm trying to get the Indian deal done, the Vietnam deal done and the budgets done. But I'll take a look at it. It's the first I've heard of it. Thanks. Let's see here, yes, sir? QUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned the prospect that your successor would be dealing with the war. You'll be making your first trip to Vietnam in roughly a week. Some people are looking at the war as another Vietnam War. Are they wrong to do so? And, if so, why? BUSH: I think they are. I think they are. First of all, Iraq is -- after the overthrow of the tyrant, voted on a constitution that is intended to unite the whole country. And then they had elections under that constitution where nearly 12 million people voted for this unity government. Secondly -- which is different from Vietnam -- secondly, in terms of our troops, this is a volunteer Army. Vietnam wasn't a volunteer Army, as you know. And in this volunteer Army, people -- the troops understand the consequences of Iraq in the global war on terror. That's why re-enlistment rates are up, and that's why enlistment is high. Thirdly, the support for our troops is strong here in the United States, and it wasn't during the Vietnam era. So I see differences, I really do. And, you know, you hear all the time, well, this may be a civil war. Well, I don't believe it is, and the Maliki government doesn't believe it is. Zal, our ambassador, doesn't believe it is. But we've got to make sure it isn't by implementing a strategy which helps -- a political strategy which helps unify the country and a security strategy which makes sure that the Iraqis are better capable of fighting off the extremists and the radicals that want to stop progress in Iraq. So I don't think it is a parallel. QUESTION: Thank you, sir. During this campaign season, some religious conservatives expressed support and appreciation for the work you've done. But some also expressed that they felt like they expended a lot of effort on your behalf without a lot of results. I wonder if you could tell us what parts of their agenda are still on your radar screen and if you think the right should be frustrated. And also, Mr. President, I'm asking you if you have any metrics you'd be willing to share about your reading contest with Mr. Rove? BUSH: I'm losing. I obviously was working harder on the campaign than he was. (LAUGHTER) He's a faster reader. (LAUGHTER) You know, I must confess I cannot catalogue for you in detail the different criticisms. In this line of work, you get criticized from all sides. And that's OK. It's just part of the job. And so I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about, but I can tell you that I believe the faith-based and community-based -- the faith- and community-based initiative is a vital part of helping solve intractable problems here in America. And I would hope that I could work with Congress to make sure this program, which has been invigorated, remains invigorated. And the reason why I believe in it so much is that there are just some problems that require something other than government help. And it requires people who have heard a call to help somebody in need. And I believe we ought to open up grants to competitive biddings for these types of organizations. And we have done that. And it's very important that that program stay strong. But you know, you're probably following all these different lists of concerns people have with my presidency. And I respect that. I just, frankly, I'm not sure exactly what you're talking about in this question. I'm sure there's some people who aren't perfectly content -- but there's some people who aren't perfectly content from different parties and different philosophies. All I know to do is to make decisions based upon principles that I believe are important, and now work with Democrat leaders in the Congress, because they control the committees and they control the flow of bills. And I'm going to do that, for the good of the country. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. If you had any do-overs to do in this race... BUSH: You don't get to do them. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: ... or if Mr. Rove had any do-overs to do in this race... BUSH: You don't get do-overs. Anyway, go ahead. QUESTION: Well, what would they be? I mean, are there any tactical... (LAUGHTER) BUSH: Look, I -- yes, well. I, frankly, haven't analyzed the election nearly as much as some of you have. You know, again, I think when you really look close at the results -- first of all, there's a lot of close elections. No question Iraq had an impact. But it's hard to win an election when you're trying to win a write-off -- write-in campaign in our state of Texas. I mean, you could have the greatest positions in the world on the issues and be the most articulate person on an issue, but to try to get to win on a write-in is really hard to do. We had, you know, the race in Florida, the Foley seat. That's a hard race to win, in a Republican district, because people couldn't vote directly for the Republican candidate. All I'm telling you is that there's a -- when you dig into the races, there's a -- look, I had to go down to Houston and Sugar Land and act as the secretary of state -- you know, Take your pencil into the box and then write it in. And the reason I bring that up is, you know, I'm not sure Iraq had much to do with the outcome of that election. Now, it certainly did in other places. One of the interesting observations I had from last night was that, if you take a look at New York state, Senator Clinton ran a very strong race, but she ran a race that appeared to me to be on just a Senate race. She wanted to show people she had the capacity to help others win. And the same thing happened in Pennsylvania with Governor Rendell. He ran a very strong race, as did Senator-elect Casey. And my only point to you is I'm sure Iraq had something to do with the voters' mind, but so did a very strong turnout mechanism in those two important states. So they're just going to have to analyze all the different results. As far as do-overs, I -- look, talk to them. QUESTION: Americans have heard it before: There's going to be cooperation, we're going to get along. What can you do to show Americans that you'll stop and avoid any gridlock, because they've seen it come anyway? BUSH: Well, you know, we had some pretty good success early on in this administration. We got the No Child Left Behind Act passed, which is an important piece of bipartisan legislation. We got some tax cuts passed with Democrat votes. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) BUSH: Look, let me -- all right, I'm anxious, but, you know -- but -- so we've just now got to show people we're capable of doing it. I mean, you're right. I mean, people are skeptical. And the way you defeat skepticism is perform. And I was very pleased with my conversation with Congresswoman Pelosi. It was a very gracious conversation, albeit a little early in the morning; I must confess. But, nevertheless, it was a good one. And my fault since I was the person who initiated the call. But I do believe we can get some things done. I think we can set an agenda. I hope so. I hope so. I didn't come to Washington just to occupy the office. I came to get some positive things done on behalf of the country. And there are some big issues we got to deal with. No Child Left Behind is one. Entitlements. That's going to be an interesting issue to try to deal with. And it's going to be very important in entitlements for people to feel comfortable about bringing ideas to the table, and people being Republicans and Democrats. If we do not have Republicans and Democrats at the table for entitlements, nothing is going to happen. And, therefore, I instructed Secretary Paulson to reach out to folks on the Hill to see if we can't at least get a dialogue started that will enable us, hopefully, to move forward on a very important issue that will affect this country for a long time, if we don't solve it. And that is the unfunded liabilities inherent in these entitlement programs. We need to continue to talk about energy. Dependency upon foreign oil is a national security and economic security problem. And it's a problem that requires bipartisan cooperation. I know the Democrats are concerned about this issue, as am I. So, in other words, there's areas where I believe we can get some important things done. And to answer your question, though: How do we convince Americans that we're able to do it? Do it; that's how you do it. You get something done. You actually sit down, work together, and I sign legislation that we all agree on. And my pledge today is I'll work hard to try to see if we can't get that done. QUESTION: I want to ask you about the thump that you took in yesterday's rodeo. You said you were disappointed, you were surprised... BUSH: See, there you go. QUESTION: You said you were... BUSH: You notice that -- taking one... QUESTION: That was something without a g, correct? I just want to make sure we have it right for the transcript. You said you were surprised. You didn't see it coming. You were disappointed in the outcome. Does that indicate that after six years in the Oval Office you're out of touch with America for something like this kind of wave to come and you not expect it? And on a semi-related note, does Nancy Pelosi look much like Bob Bullock to you? (LAUGHTER) BUSH: It's an inside joke; I'm not commenting on it. Secondly, I'm an optimistic person. That's what I am. And I knew we were going to lose seats. I just didn't know how many. QUESTION: How could you not know that and not be out of touch? BUSH: You didn't know it either. QUESTION: A lot of the polls showed it. BUSH: Well, there was -- I read those same polls. And believed -- I thought when it was all said and done, the American people would understand the importance of taxes and the importance of security. But the people have spoken, and now it's time for us to move on. QUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned entitlements. And one of the big hot-button issues for the Democratic Party is Social Security and the idea of partial privatization, which you have talked about. And I wonder if there's anything in your agenda in that way that you're willing to adjust in the spirit of bipartisanship or back off from, given how important that is to the core of the Democratic Party? BUSH: I told him -- I told Hank Paulson to tell the members that we'd sit down and we'd listen to everybody's ideas. I put out my ideas, as you recall, I think, in the State of the Union last time. And we want to hear their ideas. And hopefully, out of this concept of folks sitting around a table sharing ways forward, that we will come up with commonality that we're able to then say to the American people we've helped solve this problem. It's a tough issue. Look, I fully understand how hard it is. Social Security is -- you know, people are generally risk-adverse when it comes time to Social Security. My problem with that is that the longer you wait, the more difficult the issue's going to become. And so I'm going to keep pushing it. And hopefully, you know, we can get something done. QUESTION: A little earlier, you said that you truly believe that the Democratic leaders care about the security of this country as much as you do. Yet just about at every campaign stop, you expressed pretty much the opposite. You talked about them having a different mindset... BUSH: I did. QUESTION: ... about having a different philosophy, about waiting, about being happy that America gets attacked before responding. BUSH: No, what did you just say? Happy? QUESTION: You said they will be satisfied to see America... BUSH: No, I didn't say happy. Let's make sure... QUESTION: You left that impression. Forgive me. BUSH: With you. Go ahead. QUESTION: Well, I'm wondering: Looking back at the campaign and previous campaigns, do you think that it's been harder to pull the country together after the election by making such partisan attacks about national security? BUSH: I do believe they care about the security. I disagree -- I don't -- I thought they were wrong not making sure our professionals had the tools. And I still believe that. I don't see how you can protect the country unless you give these professionals tools. They just have a different point of view. That doesn't mean, you know, they don't want America to get attacked. That's why I said what I said. QUESTION: On immigration, many Democrats had more positive things to say about your comprehensive proposal than many Republicans did. Do you think a Democratic Congress gives you a better shot at comprehensive immigration reform? BUSH: You know, I should've brought this up. I do. I think we have a good chance. Thank you. It's an important issue, and I hope we can get something done on it. I meant to put that in my list of things that we need to get done. I would hope Republicans have recognized that we've taken very strong security measures to address one aspect of comprehensive immigration reform. And I was talking to Secretary Chertoff today. You know, he thinks that these measures we're taking are beginning to have measurable effects and that catch-and-release has virtually been ended over the last couple of months. And that's positive, and that's what some members were concerned about prior to advancing a comprehensive bill. In other words, they said, Show me progress on the border, and then we'll be interested in talking about other aspects. Well, there is progress being made on the border in terms of security, and I would hope we can get something done. It's a vital issue. It's an issue that there's an issue where I believe we can find some common ground with the Democrats. QUESTION: What are the odds for a guest-worker provision? BUSH: Well, that's got to be an integral part of a comprehensive plan. When you're talking comprehensive immigration reform, one part of it is a guest-worker program, where people can come on a temporary basis to do jobs Americans are not doing. I've always felt like that's been an important aspect of securing the border. In other words, if somebody's not trying to sneak in in the first place, it decreases the workload on our Border Patrol and lets the Border Patrol focus on drugs and guns and terrorists. But I appreciate you bringing that up. I should have remembered it. Listen, thank you all very much for your time. I appreciate your interest.

Bernstein, at No. 176), watching size-12 women squeeze into size 8's. Orchard Street was crowded, dirty and -- at least as I remember it from the 1960's -- the last place I'd want to put a hotel. But these days, Orchard Street is hot -- Il Laboratorio del Gelato (No. 95) has joined stalwarts like Guss' Pickles (Nos. 85-87). That may be why Randy Settenbrino, a Brooklyn-born artist and real estate developer, decided to open a hotel at No. 100. But, unlike the Hotel on Rivington (visible across Delancey Street), a glass-and-steel insertion that makes no concession to its neighborhood, the Blue Moon revels in its past. Mr. Settenbrino employs old toilet tank brackets as decorative features and lines the walls with ephemera, including newspaper clippings recovered from the building's boarded-up apartments.     The trouble is, recalling the plight of impoverished immigrants is a peculiar mission for a hotel where rooms start at $275 a night. Plus, it's hard to meld antiquey décor with the amenities of a modern hotel, and the Blue Moon rarely hits the mark.    THE SCENE -- Mr. Settenbrino added three floors to the five-story tenement building, then constructed 22 guest rooms. Charmingly, he named each room for one of his favorite entertainers. Some, fittingly, were residents of the Lower East Side, but others had more to do with the Harlem Renaissance.    THE LOCATION -- Orchard Street has several terrific restaurants (including the Orchard, at No. 162, which Frank Bruni of The New York Times gave two stars earlier this year, and -- for a superb brunch -- Little Giant, at No. 85). There are dozens of nightclubs within walking distance","excerpt":"one of the most popular is Element, at 225 East Houston Street.    THE ROOM -- On a night when the hotel was only half full, I was upgraded (for the basic weekend price of $330) to a room with a terrace. No larger than a fire escape, it offered a pleasant view directly onto the Williamsburg Bridge. The room itself was less appealing. The walls -- painted a mélange of bright yellow and orange -- are meant to evoke the Victorian era, but looked more like Victorian error. There is lots of old woodwork, all of it overshellacked, but no cabinet for the flat-screen television, which hangs forlornly, its wires dangling down the wall. To control the ceiling fan, I had to stand up on a chair, and I'm 6 feet 2 inches. There's only one phone, far from the bed, and no wireless access. Duke Ellington posters (one for a concert ''with McKinney's Cotton Pickers'') dominate the walls.    THE BATHROOM -- Bland, with retro-style fixtures. The Blue Moon gets credit for leaving a pair of toothbrushes and a tube of toothpaste in the bathroom (something most hotels, inexplicably, fail to do).    AMENITIES -- None, so far. In the lobby, there's an electric kettle and a selection of teabags, but no coffee. Luckily, an in-room coffee maker, and packets of Folger's, satisfied the morning craving. Without a restaurant, there's no room service, and not even a folder of takeout menus to peruse. (There are plans to open a kosher restaurant, featuring Eastern European and Italian food, later this year.) Service is spotty. When I arrived at the hotel, the pleasant man behind the desk was directing an out-of-town couple to walk north to Canal Street. (I intervened.) The elevator, which could presumably be set to chirp (or just keep quiet), makes a loud buzz on every floor. A newspaper clipping about Mussolini should have been filed away, not hung in the penthouse-level hallway.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- The lowest-price room on weekends comes to $374 with tax (though there are promotions available via the hotel's Web site). Weekday rooms are about $50 less. That's a lot for this hotel.     The Blue Moon Hotel, 100 Orchard Street, New York, N.Y., (212) 533-9080, www.bluemoon-nyc.com.   FRED A.

It was translated to the screen from a story written by Major Geoffrey C. G. Moss, formerly a brother officer of the Prince of Wales in the Grenadier Guards. Major Moss has said that incidents arising from the occupation of the Ruhr Valley made him bitterly antagonistic to the French.Mr. Griffith, however, disregards the inspiration for this literary effort and contents himself with a fling at the Kaiser and those responsible for war, without any reference to France. Through countless deft and effective touches in this simple yet deeply stirring narrative Mr. Griffith again proves himself a brilliant director. He depicts the listlessness and dulled eyes in individuals resulting from an ill-nourished condition, the apathy to meals consisting of little more than horse turnips, morning, noon and night: the disappointment in the scramble for a bit of meat, the exhilaration of a family over the hardly believable sight of a bowl of steaming potatoes, the arousing of exuberant spirits in half a dozen persons through the possession of a single egg and the boundless joy caused by a feast with liverwurst.The exteriors of this photoplay were made in Copenick, near Berlin, which is the actual background of the author's story. The interiors were produced in Mr. Griffith's Mamaroneck studio. The principal players, Carol Dempster and Neil Hamilton, are ably supported by others in the cast.The love story of Inga (Miss Dempster) and Hans (Mr. Hamilton) is unfolded with charming simplicity, there being only a few instances in which Mr. Griffith's direction is theatric. He propounds the idea that although scenic beauty loses its attraction to famished persons, love is paramount. Inga and Hans diffidently inform the family that they wish to get married, which elicits the apathetic inquiry: \\"On what—turnips?\\"Theodore, a student son, works in a night club, where, to prevent the stealing of food the waiters are searched as they leave. One is delighted when two Americans buy all the liverwurst in the night club for Theodore. One billion marks worth of liverwurst! It wasn't a very big piece after all, but when Theodore encounters Hans and Inga, who have dug up plenty of potatoes on their allotment, the three dance arm in arm through the middle of the narrow road, their faces lighted up with delirious joy. This scene will surely bring applause every time it is shown.On the same day as Theodore received his magnificent gift","excerpt":"one of the two hens lays an egg. Inga holds the precious egg in her two hands as she shows it to the grandmother.Inga supplements her daily toil by working at night mending cane seated chairs in an antique shop, being paid in secondhand furniture. She deprives herself of her quota of potatoes so as to give food to Hans when he is ill, and to impress him as being well nourished, she pads her cheeks with paper.In a moment of affluence the sons send Inga to buy three pounds of meat. A long line is seen outside the butcher's shop, the door of which is guarded by armed soldiers. An hour passes, two hours, three hours, and still Inga has not gained the threshold of the shop. Meanwhile the price of meat has nearly doubled, which she learns as she watches the man continually changing the chalk figures on a slate. In the end she has insufficient money to buy enough meat, so invests it in bread. Another scene shows a line waiting outside a horsemeat shop, and dejection darkens the faces of men and women when they are told there is no more.Poverty stamps, its mark even in the pathetic cabaret show, in which the dancers wear paper costumes which rip and tear when slightly strained. Toward the end of this picture Hans and Inga are seen as the victims of lazy marauders who steal all their cartload of potatoes. Hans is beaten until he is unconscious, but when he opens his eyes and learns from Inga that all the potatoes are gone, he looks at her and as he kisses her says: \\"Isn't life wonderful?\\"Erville Alderson impersonates an absentminded professor. He gives a splendid performance in which delicate comedy touches are most appealing. Lupino Lane plays the part of one of the boys, and he also cheers up the story, which after all is so well told that it is rarely depressing. Miss Dempster is excellent in her exacting rôle. She looks delicate, wistful and natural without any exaggerated make-up. Mr. Hamilton is capable as Hans, but he hardly impresses one as being in want of food. Helen Lowell does very well as the grandmother.Possibly this story would be even stronger if the sequence with which it is ended were put back and replaced by the dinner chapter, which would make a powerful climax.Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld introduces this picture with a beautiful prologue with twinkling sapphire stars embedded in a midnight-blue background, enhanced by the colorful costumes of the singers.Max Fleischer's cartoon, \\"The Cure,\\" is unusually clever.
