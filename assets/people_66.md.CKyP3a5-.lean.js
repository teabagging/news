As a tract against man's inhumanity to man, it is sincere and powerful. But the spinning of this somber tale, like its outrages, is routine and more primitive than polished.However, the versatile Hugo Del Carril, who produced, directed and stars in this import, which reportedly won some prizes at Cannes and Venice after being completed in 1952, must be credited with tackling an adult and important theme.He is concerned with the bestial use of workers on yerba maté, plantations at the turn of the century. His camera and direction are as subtle as a whip-lashing. Once the impoverished peons are conscripted with promises of money and easy living, these laborers, who gather the leaves used for the native tea-like beverage, are literally prisoners of the feudal plantation owners and their overseers.Señor Del Carril, who plays one of two brothers trapped in this trackless green hell, is not guilty of finesse. Whippings, long hours, short pay, the excesses of overpricing at the only store in the area—which, incidentally, is owned by the boss—as well as the wanton raping of the workers' women are all illustrated in quick array. But even in these steaming lower depths, the idea of rebellion is not dead and his Gothic tale ends in revolt and the promise of hope for the future.Although Señor Del Carril has not extracted outstanding performances from some of his principals, his portrayal is restrained yet forceful. And, while the climactic scene is rudimentary melodrama, some of his supporting players contribute seemingly dedicated characterizations.Include among them the Italian actress, Adriana Benetti, as the pretty but dishonored slavey whom he loves, defends and joins in unholy wedlock","excerpt":"Pedro Laxalt, as his ill-fated, indomitable brother; Elroy Alvarez, as Signorina Benetti's father, and Gloria Ferrandez, as a slightly sullied saloon entertainer who adores Señor Laxalt.Despite a wealth of English subtitles, which help explain their actions, Luis Otero and Raul Del Valle, as the plantation boss and his chief overseer, overact enough, on occasion, to make their villainies seem ludicrous.

He also began a choreographic career with the company, starting in 1999 with ''Guajira,'' a tribute to the hard-working rural women of his native Cuba. On Dec. 6 Ballet Hispanico will celebrate Mr. Ruiz, above, in his final season with the troupe. Mr. Ruiz came close to not having a career in dance at all. He had studied folk dance and classical ballet as a child in Havana and continued his training when the family moved to Venezuela. Then came another move, to the United States and New York. ''I was accepted at the School of American Ballet, but I had to work,'' Mr. Ruiz, who is 42, recalled. ''I found a job in an insecticide factory in New Jersey. They put me in a line, hammering plastic in a bottle. Lucille Ball in the chocolate factory? That happened to me.'' A friend introduced him to Tina Ramirez, the founder and director of Ballet Hispanico, and soon he was studying at night at the company school. Dancing lead roles from the start as a company member, the Bessie Award-winning Mr. Ruiz became known for the heart-stealing warmth and subtlety of his performing. He began to think about choreographing when he worked with the Catalan modern-dance choreographer Ramón Oller in the late 1990's at Ballet Hispanico. ''He started giving me an opportunity to be spontaneous and put myself into solos,'' Mr. Ruiz said. In 1998, Ms. Ramirez saw and liked a duet he was working on and asked him for a full piece. Mr. Ruiz's dances for the company have ranged from ''Club Havana,'' a sultry, stylized ballroom piece, to ''Cecilia,'' a ballet about incest. He has also choreographed for the Luna Negra company in Chicago and will present a new work in New York in May at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center. Dancing has taught him about himself, Mr. Ruiz said. And choreography, he added, ''is a way to pass on my knowledge of my life and who I am.''

There is an interesting family drama hidden behind all the whimsy and moonshine, but the movie is so steadfast in its admiration for Edward and his inventions that it never considers that Will might have a point. The movie, in consequence, lacks one, as it wanders through a series of cute, fairy-tale episodes, featuring, among other things, a glass-eyed witch, a pair of conjoined Korean chanteuses, and a town where nobody wears shoes.

For this is lovely music, crafted with exact care and invariably capable of making a fresh effect. The new Andrew Davis&#8208;New Philharrnonia disk is about as fine as any of its competitors. Partly that's due to Mr. Davis (a promising younger British conductor and no relation to Colin Davis) and the excellence of the playing and recording. But it's also due to Elisabeth Soderstrom; the superb Swedish soprano who sings here in Grieg's native Norwegian. Miss Stiderstrom, an artist of refined quality, with a demurely sensual soprano, has never made a big American reputation, and at this stage of her career some of the major operatic parts would tax her. Here she sounds technically comfortable, and her phrasing and sensitivity are really quite wonderful.

One leaves with the impression that the writers and the director had been carefully building up to their climaxes and then had decided, at the crucial moment, to take the afternoon off for a round of golf, leaving the cast to finish the scenes by themselves.The story presented some small opportunity for a human and poignant drama. It is the tale of a sleazy waitress and dance-hall habitué who consents to pose as the missing Mary Dow, kidnapped from her wealthy parents eighteen years before. The deception is suggested by Mr. Dow when his wife, seriously ill, cries in her delirium for her child. The tale builds upon the girl's struggle between her growing affection for her newly won \\"parents\\" and her resentment at having to live a counterfeit life.The alias Mary Dow's emotional conflict fails of its own insincerity and the writers obviously tried to bolster their structure with the synthetic introduction of a blackmail plot, same gangster stuff and a scene or heroic renunciation. The picture trails off into a confused climax which finds Mary Dow marrying her Prince Charming while the mother silences her husband's attempt to tell her that the girl is really not her own daughter.Sally Eilers's portrayal of the girl is uneven. She is alternately too strident as the waitress and too, too sweet as the long-lost daughter of the Dows. Henry O'Neill and Katharine Alexander turn in perfectly shaded performances as the parents, Mr. O'Neill, particularly, acting with a sincerity that lifts his scenes well above the average of the picture. Ray Milland and Chick Chandler are excellent in their rôles.Having found fault with the picture for so many of its omissions, it might be in order to praise it for another. The adopted daughter does not—as every one in the audience had been trained to suppose—turn out to be the real Mary Dow after all. Almost on that basis alone one is tempted to rate the picture as fair entertainment.The chief spot on the Roxy's stage show is held by Henry Armetta, the rotund screen comedian whose notorious temper has been amusing film audiences for years. Others on the bill are Joaquin Daray, a Mexican singer","excerpt":"Peg Leg Bates, dancer; Pansy, the Human Horse; William McCullough, three dance teams—Nadine Gae and Harvey Karelf, Marie Hanlon and Paul Taggert, Gloria Quayle and Jack Melford; Freddy Mack and the Gae Foster girls.

If its chase scenes and its romance are an old and not particularly inspired story, the unsensational but pithy philosophy and acting inherent in the newcomer which started a short stand at the Globe on Saturday, should be enough to give audiences satisfaction.Filmed in England against the background of moors and the lush, rural countryside, \\"Escape\\" first poses the question of whether justice triumphed in sentencing Matt Denant, ex-RAF flier, to three years in Dartmoor for striking and accidentally killing a detective who was attempting to arrest a lady of the evening to whom Denant had been casually speaking.Rankling under the injustice, Denant flees prision and manages to dodge the police with the aid of a beautiful shire lass with whom he has fallen in love and whose ideas, like those of the freedom-loving Denant, are slightly unconventional. However, hounded by both an indomitable constabulary and a conventional citizenry, Denant, who has sought sanctuary in a village church, finally gives himself up in order to save its parson from lying.As the harried convict, Rex Harrison gives a restrained but persuasive portrait of a man beset not only by physical but moral tribulations. And it is easy and convincing to sympathize with his surrender, which as the padre points out, is \\"what your decent self wanted to do — that's something none of us can escape.\\"Equally convincing are Norman Wooland, as the parson who stresses the fallibility of man","excerpt":"Peggy Cummins, as Harrison's romantic vis-a-vis, who gives up the prospect of a rich marriage for love; William Hartnell, as the intelligent police inspector who finally nabs his quarry, and Jill Esmond, as Miss Cummins' older and more conventional sister.The pace of \\"Escape.\\" as set by director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, is, on occasion, slower than might be desired, and scenarist Philip Dunne's script is sometimes given to lengthy conversation. But these are minor flaws in an adult work, which unspectacularly and effectively does justice to a serious theme.

The author was in the middle of her 54th Nancy Drew mystery, and she had come to the Pemberton and Browns Mills Libraries in Burlington County for National Library Week, no small irony in light of many librarians' long having kept her books off the shelves because they thought them of no literary value.

CHORAL AMERICANA     The 36-member Connecticut Choral Artists, known as Concora, has put together a program of familiar, new and rarely heard American choral music spanning more than two centuries. It will be presented this afternoon at 4 in the Chapel of St. Thomas Seminary in Bloomfield, under the direction of Richard Coffey.    The program opens with Randall Thompson's \\"Alleluia\\" and includes William Schuman's \\"Carols of Death,\\" based on poems by Walt Whitman, and Samuel Barber's \\"Reincarnations,\\" based on Irish folk poetry. Works by William Billings and Stephen Foster are juxtaposed with contemporary pieces by Mathew Harris, Gwyneth Walker, Robert E. Smith, Hubert Bird and David Conte.    Larry Allen will be the organist and Leslie Eckstein the percussionist in Charles Ives's \\"Psalm 90\\" for choir, organ and chimes. A setting for James Agee's poem \\"Permit Me Voyage\\" was composed by David McBride, a member of the music faculty at the Hartt School of Music of the University of Hartford.    Tickets at $12, $9 for students and the elderly, will be available at the door. THE BEAUTY OF SCIENCE     \\"Molecular Mimicry, Rachel and Leah, the Israeli Male and the Inescapable Metaphor in Science,\\" is the remarkable title of a talk to be given by Roald Hoffman, the John A. Newman professor of physical science at Cornell. A Nobel laureate in chemistry, Dr. Hoffman is a refugee from Nazi Germany, a poet and author and the host of the public-television series \\"The World of Chemistry,\\" He will speak at 8 P.M. on Thursday in the cinema of Wesleyan University in Middletown.    Dr. Hoffman is best known as a theoretical chemist with the ability to reveal the beauty of science to non-scientists. He linked science and art in \\"Chemistry Imagined,\\" a book of collages on chemical themes with related essays and poems on which he collaborated with the artist Vivian Torrence.    He received the Nobel Prize for his work on predicting the probability of organic chemical reactions, a project on which he was teamed with Professor Robert B. Woodward of Harvard.    Dr. Hoffman, who emigrated to America in 1949, received his bachelor's degree from Columbia and his doctorate from Harvard. Admission to the talk is free.

PAINTINGS AND ICONS     The new exhibition at the Connecticut Gallery in Marlborough features the paintings of two American women, one the granddaughter of the other, and the iconographic carvings of John Revill.    Therese A. Gilbert was a Victorian painter accomplished in the rendering of fruit, flowers and picture-postcard landscapes that retain their charm today. Her granddaughter and namesake, Isolde Therese Gilbert, who died in 1986, was a professional artist influenced by her assignments for the Works Progress Administration during the Depression. Her bold, stark canvases contrast markedly with her grandmother's work, and many of them are in the collections of the Whitney Museum in New York, the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, the Toledo Museum in Ohio and the Springfield Museum in Massachusetts.    Mr. Revill's unusual milieu is old bits of wood or furniture that he carves into birds and birdlike figures within the self-framing constraints of of the wood. Elaborate carving and figure drawings embellish the pieces, which are finished with a gloss or patina.    The exhibition, which continues through Nov. 25 at 4 Austin Drive, is open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday. The works are priced from $200 to $1,800. Call 295-9544 for more information. POETRY READING     Rachel Hadas will read from her poetry at 11 A.M. on Monday in the auditorium of UConn's Waterbury campus. A 1989 recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and winner of a 1990 award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Ms. Hadas has published several books of poetry from 1975 to 1989. The first, inspired by four years in Greece, was \\"Starting From Troy,\\" and the last was \\"Pass It On.\\"    She obtained her bachelor's degree from Radcliffe College, her master's from Johns Hopkins, and her doctorate from Princeton. Currently she is teaching English at Rutgers. Admission to the reading is free. WORKSHOPS AND CRAFTS     Visitors to the Wilton Historical Society's Celebration of American Craftsmanship next weekend may reserve space in some special workshops. One features the making of a Shaker-style maple or oak stool with woven-tape seats. Another teaches many varieties of counted cross- stitch on 27-threads-per-inch linen, and a third will produce a picture frame with decorative painting that simulates selected wood grains. The fees, ranging from $20 to $50, include all materials.    More than 125 artisans from 20 states will exhibit their work. Some of them have been featured in national craft magazines and examples of their crafts are in the collections of the American Museum of Folk Art, the Smithsonian Insititution, the American Craft Museum and the Williamsburg Restoration.    A lecture on the Amish community in Indiana will be given at 2 P.M. on Sunday, with a drawing for an Amish quilt made for the occasion. The show runs from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Saturday and 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Sunday at the Wilton High School Field House on Route 7. Admission is $4.50. Call 762-7257 for more information.

They and other pieces by the Polish composer became instantly famous. Where many composers had sought to reduce the uncertainties of a nuclear age to stringent counterpoint and rigorous organization, Mr. Penderecki embraced cold-war anxiety with a metaphor of his own.   The element of the mob was introduced, purposeful but not quite under control. Individual musicians and singers were pointed in a direction and then invited to play or sing what they wanted. Textures seethed with organic life. Color replaced harmonic change as a means of movement. Mr. Penderecki manufactured a reputation and a comfortable living from his early depictions of dread, even though those first pieces have long since lost their fascination for the sophisticated listener and even though he no longer writes music that resembles them.

With Dave Righetti gone as a free agent, Don Mattingly, a Yankee since 1982, is now the team's senior man among players in terms of years of service. When's the last time the Yankees' senior member had fewer years in pinstripes?      A.  The answer is 20 years ago or 10 years ago, depending on how Bobby Murcer is regarded. Murcer became a Yankee in 1965, spent 10 years with the team (including two in military service), then was traded to the San Francisco Giants for the 1974 season. He went to the Chicago Cubs after two years, then was reacquired by the Yankees during the 1979 season. At that point, Roy White was in his 15th year as a Yankee, but the next season, with White gone, Murcer became the oldest Yankee in point of service, though the service had been interrupted. Among players on the 1980 team with uninterrupted service as a Yankee, the leader was Graig Nettles, who was in his eighth year.   But if Murcer is considered to be the senior man in pinstripes for 1980, then the last time a senior Yankee had fewer years than Mattingly's nine was in 1970. That team's longest-time Yankee player was the pitcher Mel Stottlemyre, who came up in August of 1964 and was entering his seventh season as a Yankee. The year before, Al Downing (1961-69) was the senior Yankee and before that, Hall-of-Fame players such as Mickey Mantle (1951-68), Joe DiMaggio (1936-51) and Lou Gehrig (1923-39) made being a Yankee a Yankee tradition. Longest Football Series     Q.     During the Texas-Texas A&M game last month, the television commentators mentioned that the schools had the third oldest football rivalry. Which schools have older ones?      A.  The broadcasters obviously had their frequencies askew and were not taking into account the various levels of play in N.C.A.A. football. If they had, then the Longhorns-Aggies series would have ranked no better than 13th in frequency. The teams have met 97 times since it all started in 1894, and there are four other rivalries that have been held exactly as many times: Nebraska-Kansas and Texas Christian-Baylor in Division I-A","excerpt":"Penn and Cornell in Division I-AA; and DePauw-Wabash in Division III (the longest series in Division II is 95, matching North Dakota and North Dakota State).   The dozen series that exceed in frequency the Texas-Texas A&M rivalry are topped by Lafayette-Lehigh (126 meetings), Yale-Princeton (113), Yale-Harvard (107), and Richmond-William & Mary (100), all of Division I-AA; followed by Amherst-Williams (105), Albion-Kalamazoo (104), Bowdoin-Colby (also 104), Knox-Monmouth, Ill. (101), Bates-Bowdoin (also 101), and Coe-Cornell-College (100), all of Division III.   The only Division I-A colleges with longer series than the Texas-Texas A&M affair are Minnesota-Wisconsin (100) and Missouri-Kansas (99). Longest Basketball Series     Q.     Lehigh and Lafayette have played each other the most times in college football, with Lafayette leading after 126 games, 69-52, with 5 ties. Which colleges have been opponents the most in basketball?      A.  For sure, it's not Lehigh-Lafayette, who have met 169 times (Lafayette leads that series, too, 116-53). In fact, the N.C.A.A. is not quite sure which colleges have played the most basketball games against each other, but the best bet appears to be Oregon versus Oregon State.    When those teams meet on Saturday in the first of their three regularly scheduled games this season, it will be the 291st time they have opposed each other. Oregon State holds a substantial series edge, 171-119, in the 79-year rivalry, and the Beavers have been victorious over the Ducks in the last five meetings and 29 of the last 32. One big reason these rivals have met so often is that during many of the sport's early years, when out-of-state games often involved wear on athletes and tear on budgets, the two Oregon schools would schedule several meetings against each other in the basketball season.    And what about the Oregon-Oregon State football series? In that sport, Oregon, which plays Colorado State in the Freedom Bowl on Saturday, holds a 46-38 lead with 10 ties in the 94 meetings. Bengals' First Home     Q.     Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati was opened in time for the Reds' 1970 baseball season. The Reds played at Crosley Field before then. Where did the football Bengals play before Riverfront?      A.  For the first two seasons of the expansion franchise, which joined the American Football League in 1968, home for the Bengals of Paul Brown was Nippert Stadium, where the University of Cincinnati played its games. The Bengals' overall record there was 7-8 for the 1968 and 1969 seasons, which was clearly better than the 1-12-1 mark Cincinnati logged while away from Nippert Stadium.    The Bengals even held an advantage at home in 1969. They won their first three games of the season there and compiled a 4-3 home mark that included upset victories over the Oakland Raiders (31-17), losers of the 1968 Super Bowl, and the Kansas City Chiefs (24-19), winners of the 1970 Super Bowl.
