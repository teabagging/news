Their story is emerging as the New York City Police Department grapples with a succession of scandals involving misconduct and criticism that the department has been slow to spot wrongdoing.

Unlike Lincoln Center's Mozart Bicentennial, which crammed Mozart's works into 18 months, the plan here was to offer Schubert's works chronologically, taking from 1988 to 1997 to present them. That proved commercially unworkable, at least in the short term: the early seasons drew connoisseurs and revealed a few gems, but as with Mozart and Beethoven, the works likely to draw big audiences come near the end. The chronological approach was scuttled just as the series was heading toward the popular works, but at least the project has continued.   The new format has its own logic. Instead of tracing the big picture, the Schubertiade now offers glimpses into specific aspects of the composer's work, with early and late works performed side by side. This year the focus was on Schubert's piano sonatas, and instead of distributing the works among several players, Andras Schiff played them all (except for a few fragmentary ones) in a six-concert series that ended on April 3 evening.

Here and on the next pages are five distinct approaches, compiled and written by Peter Dizikes.    Columbia: Great Books    Philosophy The nation's oldest continuing core curriculum (founded in 1919) is known for its small seminars on ''the great books,'' from ancient Greece to the present -- a course of study, Columbia wants you to know, that university icons like Lionel Trilling and Jacques Barzun helped establish. The standardized courses revolve around classics -- whether books, symphonies or pieces of art -- and are meant to offer undergraduates a common intellectual experience.    Requirements Students take yearlong seminars in philosophy and literature, in addition to semester-long seminars in science, writing, music and art. Undergraduates can make their own choices in fulfilling other requirements, in language, non-Western cultures and more science. The physical education requirement, as all Columbia students are well aware, includes a swimming test.    Politics Columbia is a battleground in the campus culture wars: Defenders of the core curriculum have kept it largely intact, while opponents deride the emphasis on ''dead white European males'' and have pushed to diversify. Among the changes: Professors now have latitude at the end of the literature seminar to add authors like Zora Neale Hurston or Toni Morrison, and the non-Western cultures requirement was added in the 1980's.    Brown: To Each His Own    Philosophy Who needs a core? Brown's ''New Curriculum,'' instituted in 1969, famously dropped general education requirements to promote intellectual independence.    Requirements Guidelines encourage students to ''assume responsibility for their own educational plans.'' Students must, however, take 8 to 10 classes in their majors.    Politics Freedom of choice is a successful selling point -- Brown is harder to get into than some other Ivy League universities. But freedom of choice is a flashpoint for traditionalists who believe that too much flexibility means fuzzy courses and lack of rigor. In a recent report grading 50 universities in general education, the traditionalist American Council of Trustees and Alumni pointedly gave Brown an ''F.''    Johns Hopkins: Balancing Science    Philosophy At a university oriented to scientific and medical research, a distribution requirement is seen as essential to ensuring that all undergraduates receive a well-rounded education. (In distribution requirements, students must take a certain number of courses, of their own choosing, from within loosely defined areas. Core courses, on the other hand, are mandatory courses created specifically for general education.)    Requirements Johns Hopkins adds quantitative science and engineering to the three traditional divisions of study -- humanities, social science and science. All students must take 10 classes in areas outside their majors: humanities majors need four in the sciences or engineering","excerpt":"science and engineering majors need at least six in the humanities or social sciences. Most undergraduates must take four ''writing intensive'' classes (20 pages of written work in each); engineering students take two.    Politics General education is one part of a continuing discussion about the identity and aims of Johns Hopkins and how to balance liberal arts and research. A 2003 internal report concluded that Johns Hopkins needed to improve undergraduate education -- by creating a series of first-year seminars, for example, and strengthening ''the sense of community'' among students.    Duke: Modes of Inquiry    Philosophy A distinctive recent entry in the general education arena, Duke's ''Curriculum 2000'' covers both subject matter and methods of study.    Requirements Duke has divided the world into five subject areas, and students take two courses in each. There are also six ''modes of inquiry'' -- like ''cross-cultural inquiry'' (comparative study of cultures) and ''ethical inquiry'' (moral reasoning, say). Because a single course can satisfy both the subject and mode-of-inquiry requirement, students usually need 12 to 14 general education courses.    Politics Duke installed ''Curriculum 2000,'' in part, to advertise the all-around strength of a university on the rise and to shed the idea that its undergraduate education lacked the rigor of more established elite institutions. By 2003, revising the new curriculum had already begun, after faculty and students complained that its requirements were too constricting for science majors.    SUNY: Public Rigor    Philosophy In 1998, the trustees of the State University of New York introduced an extensive set of distribution requirements. The program represents one of the most specific conceptions of liberal education among American public universities, which often demand fewer general education courses than private colleges. Most typically give wide latitude, and in some cases have no such requirements at all.    Requirements Many large public universities organize their requirements around the three traditional divisions of study. But SUNY requires one course each in 10 areas, including broad categories like ''Western Civilization'' and ''Other World Civilizations.'' An American history class is mandated, and students must meet a basic communication requirement (often a composition course) and two academic ''competencies'' (''Information Management'' and ''Critical Thinking,'' which are frequently filled by courses demanding research and writing, respectively).    Politics Many faculty members regarded the introduction of the requirements as a power play by assertive trustees looking to extend their influence to areas usually beyond their control, while others wondered if the American history requirement represented a conservative agenda at work. But after an apparent détente, the requirements have remained essentially intact.   THE CORE CHOICE"},{"year":"1956","title":"THE relaxed, armchair approach to garden insect control has its merits.

His discovery is a pretty good one, for you would never suspect by looking at him that this 35-year-old actually is an ancient of no less than ninety. Even the beauteous Helen Walker is none the wiser as she falls madly in love with this unfathomable man of science. But like all those who attempt to stay the hand of nature, the not so noble experimenter eventually comes a cropper. He had been prolonging his youth by transferring to himself glands from young medical students who unfortunately succumbed to these operations.This is old stuff, especially for the Rialto's patrons. Boris Karloff has been doing the same thing for years, only more flamboyantly. By playing the scientist with a restraint that almost makes him appear normal, Mr. Asther merely points up the incredibleness of the story all the more. Paramount has dressed the production with much better than average settings for this sort of potboiler fare and in his direction Ralph Murphy occasionally succeeds in establishing a measure of ominous tension. But the net result isn't anything to get excited about.

In a report issued last week, an international team of researchers said that more than a decade of intense effort had allowed them to isolate a cancer gene that is carried by about 1 percent of Americans, or about 2.6 million people. The gene is called A.T.M. (for ataxia telangiectasia mutated). Those who have it are thought to run a three- to eightfold increased risk of developing a variety of cancers, including those of the breast, lung, skin, stomach, and pancreas.
