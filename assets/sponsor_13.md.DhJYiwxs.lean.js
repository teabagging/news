The question was whether Federal judges have authority, under a Reconstruction-era civil rights law passed to protect blacks against the Ku Klux Klan, to keep anti-abortion protesters from blocking access to abortion clinics. The Administration joined the anti-abortion group, which has sponsored many such protests, in urging the Justices to answer no.   While another summer of protests at abortion clinics appears to be heating up, the Court last week surprised almost everyone by deferring a decision, which had been expected this month, and ordering new arguments next fall. The Justices gave no reason in the terse announcement issued eight months after the initial arguments. The bench for the new argument will presumably include Justice Clarence Thomas, who was not on the Court when the case was first argued and so could not participate. That does not necessarily mean, however, that the Court was locked in a straightforward 4-to-4 stalemate in a case that presents several complex issues of statutory interpretation.

A very striking and disturbing young lady—a flashy but substantial debutante—is brought into the Blair General Hospital with a piece of glass puncturing her heart. And before she departs that jolly haven the piece of glass has not only been successfully removed by earnest young Dr. Kildare through a bit of remarkable surgery but the doctor has rather tentatively replaced the foreign matter in her heart. Anything can happen from here on.It is pleasant to know that Dr. Kildare is on the road to spiritual recovery. And it is gratifying to welcome, even on trial, such a pretty and straightforward heroine as Ann Ayars. She seems to get along quite nicely with the other steady members of the cast—Lew Ayres, Lionel Barrymore, Alma Kruger, Walter Kingsford and the nurses and orderlies. But \\"Dr. Kildare's Victory\\" is a badly jumbled and indifferent sort of film to bridge a critical period in the sensitive young doctor's life. It mixes random clinical lectures with a silly and complicated plot, and it casually ambles up to a fade-out with a minimum of dramatic drive. To be sure, it is rather touching that Metro should be so gentle with Dr. Kildare during his grief. But the boys had better get things popping next time. They shouldn't expect the audience to take on mourning, too.

''So many people put their money into these companies at the top of the market in 1983, only to watch the stocks drop in price, that it's cast a pall over the entire area,'' Mr. Mathias said yesterday in a telephone interview from his Baltimore office.

His assessment, Mr. Mathias readily conceded, runs counter to the thinking of some technical analysts on Wall Street, who still counsel avoidance of smaller growth issues.

With their semioperatic melodies and chiseled-in-stone lyrics that give advice, preach optimism and impart adult wisdom, songs like \\"Some Enchanted Evening,\\" \\"Oh What a Beautiful Mornin' \\" and \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" have become part of the bedrock of American middle-class culture. But their power-of-positive-thinking sentiments have also made them synonymous in some people's minds with a drippy \\"Father Knows Best\\" squareness.   \\"A Grand Night for Singing,\\" the new revue of Rodgers and Hammerstein songs at the Roundabout Theater, is a studious attempt to revise that goody-goody image by minimizing it. Conspicuously absent are inspirational warhorses like \\"The Sound of Music,\\" \\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\\" and \\"You'll Never Walk Alone.\\" Missing too are the declamatory love ballads \\"People Will Say We're In Love,\\" \\"No Other Love\\" and \\"Younger Than Springtime.\\" Lesson songs like \\"My Favorite Things,\\" \\"Getting to Know You\\" and \\"I Whistle a Happy Tune\\" are excluded.

As a youth in Germany, he was also a daring revolutionary, a general in the Union Army in the Civil War, a diplomat, a legislator, a lawyer, a journalist and a polemicist. He was a fighter for the right as he saw the right and probably would have liked best the subtitles of two of his biographers -''reformer'' and ''man of conscience.''\\n\\nThe commemoration of the German heritage got under way at the beginning of this month with issues of common design from the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany for the 300th anniversary of the arrival of the first German settlers in America. It was followed by a commemorative for the 100th anniversary of the Brooklyn Bridge, built by the remarkable father-and-son team of John and Washington Roebling. John Roebling was born in Germany and trained in engineering institutions there. The stamp was as much for its builders as for the bridge.
