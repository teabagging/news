The movie is a soulful domestic comedy with more in common with the enchantingly freakish twitches of life found in a Bill Forsyth film like &quot;Local Hero&quot; than one of Sergio Leone's blood-orange epics like &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West.&quot;  &quot;Midlands&quot; weaves a large number of characters throughout the tract homes of Nottingham, where the movie is set. It threatens a showdown  between a pair of rivals, Dek (Rhys Ifans) and Jimmy (Robert Carlyle), who both want Shirley (Shirley Henderson). And by the end of the film, Mr. Meadows exaggerates the conventions of the western to make his own points about the foolishness of machismo.  But what really separates &quot;Midlands&quot; from Leone's desiccated, terse genre work is Mr. Meadows's doting attention over his characters' decency. It gives a demonstrative bittersweetness to a likable but small story. Jimmy strides into Shirley's life to reclaim her and their daughter, Marlene (Finn Atkins), though he's been out of the picture for so long that there could have been a reality show about his disappearance. It's an actual reality show that has caused the trouble for Dek; he proposed to Shirley, with whom he's been living and helping to raise her little girl, and she rebuffed him on national television. Stunned, he's picking up the shards of what used to be his dignity when Jimmy returns, further tangling the knot of emotional complications. &quot;Midlands&quot; is primarily a film about the need that fatherhood fills — Dek's closeness to Marlene registers strongly. — Elvis Mitchell Can a Nice Guy Beat a Bad Boy?"},{"year":"1974","title":"LONDON, June 12 (Reuters) &#8212","excerpt":"Midlantic National Bank of New Jersey said today it has opened a representative office in London to contact and advise British and European companies planning new or expanded investments in the United States.

So what better way to ring in the year with a countdown and a sprint rather than a toast and a stumble? In what has become a sweaty and longstanding tradition, the New York Road Runners club is holding its annual Midnight Run in Central Park on New Year's Eve. The four-mile run starts off at the park's East Drive south of 72nd Street at the stroke of midnight, with fireworks instead of a starting gun. The course heads up to 102nd Street, cuts to the West Side, then wraps up near the 72nd Street transverse, with a pause at the midway mark for a nonalcoholic champagne toast. But the real fun: the dance party with a D.J., and the masquerade parade and contest that come before the race. Runners get gussied up in tuxedos or dress in elaborate costumes (superheroes in running tights are not uncommon), above. Mary Wittenberg, the president and chief executive of the Road Runners, said the race is a good way to begin the year. ''There's no better way to feel great the next morning,'' said Ms. Wittenberg, a race veteran who plans to run this year too. ''You wake up knowing that you've already accomplished something in the first hour of the New Year, which sets the whole tone for the rest of the year.'' About 5,000 runners are expected. Registration at the New York Road Runners building at 9 East 89th Street is open until about 10:30 p.m. on Sunday. And if you plan on running, consider wearing a poncho or a light jacket because the forecast calls for drizzle. (212-860-4455, www.nyrrc.org.)

Item: Autobiographical cinema - the kind that has its origins in the camera-mad 1960's and early 70's, is back with a vengeance. The two most notorious films at this year's festival have unquestionably been ''Lightning Over Water,'' an almost unbearably painful recording of the last, agonizing months in the life of Nicholas Ray (''They Live by Night,'' ''Rebel without a Cause,'' etc.), co-directed by Mr. Ray and Wim Wenders, and ''Taxi zum Klo'' (''Taxi to the John''), a breezy, frequently funny, aggressively candid ''reconstructed'' autobiography.   The ''I'' of ''Taxi'' is Frank Ripploh, a youngish German school teacher-turned-filmmaker who, with a lot of help from his friends, reenacts the ups and downs of his love, sex and professional life and, finally, a somewhat romanticized version of the story of how he came to be bounced from the West Berlin school system for being an ''undesirable.'' Not the least of the film's ironies is that Mr.  Ripploh wants, above all, to be desirable as he goes cruising from one homosexual encounter to another.
