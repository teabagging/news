Here are some suggestions on forming a patrol, from the Citizens Committee for New York City, which helps neighborhood organizations and publishes a wide range of pamphlets with tips on solving local problems.       TAKE A GOOD LOOK Anti-drug patrols don't work everywhere, especially if drugs are sold behind closed doors or if there is drug-related street violence. A door-to-door survey that asks people about drugs and crime in the neighborhood can provide helpful information and identify people interested in a patrol.  FIND VOLUNTEERS The goal is to bring people to an orientation meeting. Residents who belong to a community organization could offer to form a committee to start a patrol.  Churches, clubs and Parent-Teacher Associations can help. Young people should be included in all phases of planning, decision-making and patrolling. As a security measure, advertise the meeting only by phone calls, word of mouth or announcements at trusted community organizations, and consider meeting outside the neighborhood.  ORIENTATION MEETING Ask a volunteer to keep notes. Discuss the possibility of an anti-drug patrol. A patrol leader from another neighborhood could talk about that neighborhood's experience. Summarize the discussion: the area to be patrolled","excerpt":"policies on street confrontation; cooperation with the police, and security measures. Choose a temporary group of patrol leaders.  SECURITY PLANNING Do not publicize the names of the patrol leaders. Maintain close relations with the police and report any threats immediately. Seek safety in numbers through a large patrol, rallies and community meetings. Patrol members should never confront a drug dealer alone. Information on specific dealers should be relayed to a trusted core-group member, but not talked about at open meetings. (For more information, see the Neighborhood Anti-Crime Center sheet on \\"The Potential for Violence in Anti-Drug Organizing.\\")  POLICE RELATIONS Get in touch with the community affairs officer or unit assigned to work with the community.  TRAIN AND PREPARE Ask the police for training in recognizing drug-dealing situations and signs of crimes in progress, reporting information in a form useful to the police, making accurate descriptions of suspected dealers, calling for help in an emergency and safety on the street.   Among useful materials are handheld two-way radio sets (FM sets have a wider range than those operating on citizens'-band frequencies); printed forms for recording incidents and logging each patrol; notebooks; clipboards; flashlights; whistles and jackets, T-shirts, armbands or other form of identification.   Set up procedures for joining the patrol: for example, being trained in the principles and procedures of the patrol.   BEGIN PATROLLING The kind of patrol will vary with the size and strengths of your group, the kind of drug problem you face and the neighborhood terrain.    A few rules that apply to all patrols:   Plan a regular schedule (based on the days and times when a patrol is most needed and volunteers are available) and a standard route. After a while, try different routes or different times to keep the dealers off balance.   Notify the police each time you go out and return.   Maintain contact via walkie-talkie with a home base, an office or building lobby, perhaps. Home base requires a telephone to call the police.   Go out in a group and appoint a captain.

Mayor Bradley eventually joined the chorus, but noted that he was powerless to remove the Chief. The Bradley-appointed Police Commission came up with a compromise of sorts last week, putting Mr. Gates on a two-month paid leave. This would give the commission time to determine whether Mr. Gates's \\"style, rhetoric and conduct contribute to police abuses,\\" said the head a libertarian group that is pushing for the Chief's ouster.

The first, \\"Jews in Poland,\\" is a forty-minute documentary underscoring one of the most terrible chapters in history. \\"Behind the Show Window,\\" a good-natured but lumbering frolic inside a Moscow department store, can be taken only as typical escapist screen fare from and for the Russians.The plodding, sincere and optimistic entry called \\"Jews in Poland,\\" co-produced by Simon Federman and the Polish State Film Studios, remains more interesting for what is not shown than for what we actually see. At the outset, two American visitors begin a tour of Jewish communities in contemporary Warsaw, centering on religious activities. Various leaders who escaped Nazi extermination offer informal reminiscent testimonies. A handsome, smiling lady named Ida Kaminska, queen of the Jewish Art Players, shown in a brief performance, couldn't be more charming and persuasive.Disturbingly, however, the general, quiet optimism of this fragmentary film, even with all its footage of bustling reconstruction, never seems shared by the rest of a briskly toured city, where so many Jews died. We are told, fleetingly, that Jews, \\"are very well received\\" by the rest of Warsaw. What about recent reports of open anti-Semitism? Or the increasing exodus from Poland?It could be that this film record, made last year, is simply dated. Let us fervently hope this also applies, once and for all, to the most impressive sight in the picture: the remnants of the Warsaw ghetto. Like the ribs of a giant skeleton on a flattened, urban landscape, this specter and a few actual photographs of the horror therein, are an awful reminder that history has repeated itself more than once.Life inside a Moscow department store, it seems, is not the glum, undazzling display that many of us might have imagined. At least not in \\"Behind the Store Window,\\" produced by Mosfilm Studios in rather uncertain color, enacted by a determinedly radiant cast and borrowed, for all the party trimmings, straight from Hollywood.The only surprising thing about this store, and its colorful, if hardly tasteful mountains of wares, is that a clerk could lay immediate hands on a dishrag. The incandescent lighting is fierce. Life behind the counter, however, is a picnic, dedicated to the cause of loyalty (honesty with cash).After fanning out for a cross-section of employes, among them several cases of puppy love and one slinky blond vampire, the picture has some sinister backstairs operators framing the sales chief on a theft charge. This fellow, played by I. Dmitriev, is finally cleared, fortunately, after becoming attracted to a pretty, buxom factory head, N. Medvedeva. Indeed, it is the very tender, convincing romance of these two middle-aged people that provides the only relief in a familiar story whose genial air gets slightly hysterical at times.

Less familiar than the crumpled corpses of women and children, but equally effective are the vignettes of the refugees who streamed to New Zealand, Santa Rosa in Mexico, the Holy Land, Africa, England and France to begin life anew. Especially effective too are the sequences depicting the noted Carpathian Division, formed in Iran of escaped Poles, and their subsequent victorious participation with the British Eighth Army in the battles of Tobruk, Mount Cassino, Bologna, France and Holland. And effective also are the shots of the unheralded, tiny Polish Navy, which helped capture Narvik in Norway, helped evacuate Dunkirk and later fought in the Atlantic and the Pacific.While the commentary written by Joseph Wittlin and spoken by Edward Fuller cannot compete in drama with the scenes of emaciated waifs tasting their first food after liberation or the mute testimony of Polish graves at Cassino, Caen and Holland, it is generally in keeping with the film's subject matter. \\"Beyond Endurance\\" is not flawless or entirely new, but it is a composite case-book necessary for the present and the future.

It also includes a feature called ''Wristcutters -- A Love Story,'' billed as an offbeat comedy, in which everybody's dead. The festival is to announce its slate of 64 feature films today in competition for four main categories: American documentary and dramatic categories, and foreign documentaries and dramas. Geoffrey Gilmore, its director, said the festival would feature more risky films than it has recently. A number of the films ''may not play very broadly in the mainstream,'' he said in an interview. The full lineup of 120 films, to be announced in coming weeks, was chosen from 3,148 submissions, a rise from 2,613 last year, and a sign that the festival continues to attract aspiring filmmakers in a digital age. Three documentaries deal with Iraq, including one focusing on the effect of the war on returning American veterans, and another on ordinary Iraqis. One thriller in the dramatic competition imagines a day in which dirty bombs are detonated in Los Angeles. The festival will be held Jan. 19 to 29 in Park City, Utah.

The survey, conducted in early November, asked 1,025 adults around the country to rate the ability of various institutions to act effectively on the local level. Churches, synagogues and other religious organizations headed the list, with 57 percent","excerpt":"political parties were at the bottom, with about 15 percent.   In between, in descending order of confidence expressed, were volunteer groups, schools, the local news media, local business, local government, state government, the Federal Government and national business.    The survey, conducted by telephone Nov. 6-9, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. Its results appeared in the December newsletter of the Princeton Religion Center, an affiliate of the Gallup organization in Princeton, N.J.   Women were more inclined than men to place their trust in religious institutions (65 percent to 48 percent), and adults under the age of 30 less inclined than those over 30 (52 percent to 60 percent).   At the same time, young people tended to show higher confidence than their elders in all other institutions listed in the survey.   \\"This could suggest that the initial impulse of people when they are young is to seek solutions from secular institutions,\\" the report said, \\"but later in life they can be expected to turn more to the church to channel their voluntary instincts to serve the community.\\"  A Surfeit of Reaction    A weekly column by the Rev. Richard P. McBrien, a liberal theologian at the University of Notre Dame who has frequently challenged the Vatican on various issues, has been dropped by The Brooklyn Tablet, the newspaper of the Roman Catholic diocese that comprises Brooklyn and Queens.   Ed Wilkinson, editor of The Tablet, said he had stopped running the nationally syndicated column because Bishop Thomas V. Daily of Brooklyn, who heads the diocese and is the publisher of The Tablet, \\"didn't want it in the paper anymore.\\"    Mr. Wilkinson said Bishop Daily had complained that Father McBrien \\"shows too much disrespect for the Holy Father.\\" The Bishop also discontinued the McBrien column when he was head of his previous diocese, in Palm Beach, Fla.    In November, when controversy over the McBrien column first appeared in the Brooklyn Diocese, Mr. Wilkinson said that he might not always agree with what Father McBrien had to say but noted that the theologian \\"gets a lot of reaction.\\"   Asked about that comment yesterday, Mr. Wilkinson said, \\"I guess he got too much reaction.\\"   A spokesman for Bishop Daily said the cleric was out of the country and unavailable for comment.    In his most recent column, which Tablet readers never saw, Father McBrien had a \\"wish list\\" that included this: \\"Wouldn't it be wonderful if in 1991 Catholic newspaper editors and publishers were to recognize that the Church's capacity to teach with credibility is harmed, not helped, by the suppression of opinion columns with which they are personally uncomfortable?\\" Jews Reach Out    In an effort to attract young people, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, which comprises 800 Reform synagogues, has announced a plan to reduce or eliminate synagogue dues for young, unaffiliated Jews.    In making the announcement earlier this week, Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler, the president of the organization, said the unaffiliated \\"are the fastest growing group in the American Jewish community.\\" He cited statistics showing that more than 50 percent of the nation's 5.8 million Jews do not belong to synagogues or temples.   Many synagogues charge from $500 to $1,000 a year in dues, which usually includes sanctuary seats for the High Holy Days of Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur. Under the new plan, unaffiliated Jews from 22 to 30 years of age would be issued \\"privilege cards\\" that would enable them to join a Reform congregation at little or no cost for up to two years. In addition, college students would be issued \\"access cards\\" granting them free seats for High Holy Day services and other congregational events.   Rabbi Jerome Epstein, executive vice president of United Synagogue, said his group, which represents Conservative congregations, tried a similar program of free and reduced-cost membership 20 years ago.   \\"It didn't work,\\" Rabbi Epstein said. \\"The congregations brought people in but didn't do anything to engage them in synagogue life.\\"   Still, he said, he would carefully watch the Reform program, \\"Just because it didn't work then doesn't mean it won't work now,\\" he said.

More Clashes Shake Iraq","excerpt":"Political Talks Are in Ruins"},{"year":"1991","title":"The beginning of negotiations on a non-racial future for South Africa has underscored the extent of a political shift here -- from a preoccupation with racial exclusion to a more complex concern over how blacks and whites, long divided by apartheid, can survive in a shared system.   The shift has accelerated since the watershed events of February 1990, when President F. W. de Klerk legalized the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups, freed Nelson Mandela from prison and promised to end white domination. The new politics of power sharing were evident at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, as the negotiating forum is titled, which began Friday and wound up its first session on Saturday.   Mr. de Klerk offered to negotiate a multi-racial interim government in place of the white rule of the last 43 years. Mr. Mandela, speaking for the African National Congress, predicted that a new Constitution could be in place by Christmas next year.   In what may have been a harbinger of the future, a white police major and a black former guerrilla jointly supervised the convention's security arrangements. Other old enemies worked, ate and drank together. They will continue cooperating in five working groups created to thrash out differences before the convention reconvenes, probably in March. Friends From Prison    \\"I see all my old friends from Robben Island and Pretoria Central,\\" said Helen Suzman, a veteran human-rights campaigner who attended the convention as a delegate of the liberal Democratic Party. Mrs. Suzman referred to the political prisoners, including Mr. Mandela, for whose welfare she battled so many years. They were rubbing shoulders with politicians of the Government that locked them up.   It took an ugly public argument Friday night between President de Klerk and Mr. Mandela, over the African National Congress's refusal to disband its guerrilla wing, to drive home the reality of political organizations who find themselves now together but dreaming different dreams.   For decades, the battle lines in South Africa were racially drawn between whites defending minority domination and blacks demanding equality. Today, alliances have been recast, dividing those pledged to negotiate a peaceful solution from those who see even talking as a sellout.   The National Party cannot hope to bridge its schism with the Conservative Party, whose founders broke away in 1982 at the prospect of reform. White Afrikaners lead both parties and sit together in Parliament. But right-wingers like those in the paramilitary Afrikaner Resistance Movement threaten civil war if Mr. de Klerk gives blacks the kind of political equality discussed at the convention. Splits in Anti-Apartheid Camp    And the African National Congress is estranged from two smaller black movements, the Pan-Africanist Congress and the Azanian People's Organization, who fought a common struggle against apartheid and now say the African National Congress betrayed blacks by talking to the Government. The Azanian People's Organization, a black consciousness group, balked in October at joining a united front against the Government at the negotiating table. The Pan-Africanists dropped out last month, accusing the African National Congress of colluding with the Government to share power.   The Conservative Party, the Pan-Africanist Congress and other parties that refused to attend the convention gamble that the talks will falter at racially charged impasses. The hard-liners have gained support from defectors leaving the National Party and the African National Congress because of their willingness to compromise.   The Inkatha Freedom Party, a Zulu-based movement, was viewed as a Government ally, if not collaborator, after receiving secret Government subsidies to compete with the African National Congress. Yet Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, boycotted the political convention, which the Government also paid for, because the Zulu King, Goodwill Zelethini, was not allowed a separate seat. Inkatha attended but refused to sign a declaration supported by the Government. To reinforce the paradox, Inkatha has talked with the Conservatives, who speak of Afrikaners and Zulus as proud nations similarly entitled to self-determination. Suspicion Persists    Though the National Party and the African National Congress have emerged as the principal negotiating partners, mutual trust remains fragile, with each party suspicious that the other nurtures a hidden agenda.   Mr. Mandela and other congress officials have said that the Nationalists seek to perpetuate white privilege under another guise. Mr. de Klerk's Government and the National Party accuse the congress of wanting to impose unworkable Marxist panaceas.   The disagreements extend to their definitions of progress. The congress wants an interim government installed within 18 months and a new constitution drafted by an elected constituent assembly. The National Party envisions a transitional government lasting at least 10 years, according to the Minister of Constitutional Development, Gerrit Viljoen, and it wants the Constitution negotiated.    Such differences portend hard negotiations. Yet the journey to a democratic future has begun, dividing South Africans into those embarking on the uncertain trek and those who choose to stay behind.
