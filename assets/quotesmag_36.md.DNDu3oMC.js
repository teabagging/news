Its more mundane theme over the last half-decade has been an unremitting quest for a 50 percent voter approval rating. Lately, he would be happy to settle for 40.         The paradox of the Senator's career is that the more influential he grows in  Washington, the less popular he gets in New York. That was driven home by this month's Republican Presidential primary. Mr. D'Amato, a leader in the Dole Presidential drive, becomes more important the closer the Kansas Senator gets to the nomination. But he was nowhere to be seen during Mr. Dole's local campaign stops outside Long Island. While Mr. D'Amato was powerful enough to deliver his  state's 93 delegates, he was also a potential liability in public appearances. Primary exit polls showed that even Republicans so regular they came out in the  sleet to vote approved of Mr. D'Amato by only the narrowest of margins.

That led New York's junior Senator to begin a disjointed monologue using a fake Japanese accent to mock the trial's judge, Lance Ito, a Japanese-American. Apparently emboldened by the laughter in the studio, Mr. D'Amato could not seem to stop himself until Mr. Imus appealed to him to shut up as a matter of political self-preservation.

The deficit in February was $12.2 billion. The new figures provided clear evidence of the impact on the United States -- both good and bad -- of Asia's mounting economic woes. Growth in the American economy, which had been threatening to overheat, was restrained. But at the same time, United States exports remained weak, hurting many manufacturers and farmers, and imports surged, a trend that does not bode well for the long term.    INTEREST RATES  No Increase, for Now  The Federal Reserve's policy-setting Open Market Committee declined once again to increase short-term interest rates, apparently viewing the threat of inflation as remote and believing that any American rate increase could worsen the economic situation in Asia. Underlying the benign view of inflation are a number of recent indicators, including a 2.3 percent decline in new housing starts last month, to an annual rate of 1.538 million units. Many analysts had expected a small gain. Minutes of the Fed's March 31 meeting show that it saw a risk of inflation but decided to hold rates steady because of Asia's malaise.    MARKETS  Commodity Index Skids  The Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge index of 17 commodities skidded to its lowest level in more than four years, dropping to 219.27 on Tuesday and ending the week at 219.18. Futures prices for copper, silver, oil, nickel, wheat and other commodities have been in a long-term decline that has been aggravated in recent days by Indonesia's political turmoil and -- see a pattern here? -- the Asian economic collapse. Stock and bond markets were little changed for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 9,144.44, up 48.44. But technology stocks were battered, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 41.77, to close at 1,805, its weakest level in more than six weeks.    TOBACCO  A Pipe Dream?  Anti-smoking legislation hit a potentially serious snag in the Senate, and further action was postponed until next month, sending President Clinton","excerpt":"Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and other Senate leaders who want to deter teen-agers' smoking back to the drafting table. Just as it appeared a consensus was forming to increase the Federal tax on cigarettes by $1.10 a pack while giving tobacco companies some protection against lawsuits, an unusual coalition of senators formed. Some want to kill the legislation, while others advocate the toughest possible anti-smoking measure. ''We are making a deal with the Devil,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who opposes any limit on the companies' legal liability.    SOCIAL SECURITY  A Market-Based Proposal  The National Commission on Retirement Policy, which includes members of Congress from both parties, proposed a sweeping overhaul of the Social Security system, calling for the establishment of personal investment accounts and a gradual increase in the retirement age, to 70, to make up for a cash shortfall expected when 77 million baby boomers become eligible for Social Security benefits. ''The goal of this is to have people more involved in their own savings,'' said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, a leader of the group, which includes lawmakers, economists, pension-system experts and business executives. The report says the changes would keep Social Security solvent for at least 75 years without raising taxes. Some liberals, however, oppose any plan that does not offer guaranteed benefits.    DEALS  A Merger Epidemic  What would once have been a big deal seems today to be business as usual. Seagram, accelerating its shift from beverages and spirits into an entertainment powerhouse, agreed to buy Polygram, one of the world's largest music companies, for $10.6 billion in cash and stock; to raise money for the acquisition, Seagram is shedding its Tropicana juice business. . . . Pearson, Britain's largest publisher, and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, a Dallas investment firm, agreed to buy most of Simon & Schuster's operations from Viacom for $4.6 billion in cash. . . . Office Depot said it would acquire Viking Office Products in a $3 billion stock swap. . . . Dillard's said it would acquire Mercantile Stores, a Midwest retailer, for $2.9 billion in cash. . . . Fortis, a Belgian-Dutch banking and insurance group, agreed to acquire Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest, for $11.1 billion. . . . Francois Pinault, the French investor who bought 29.1 percent of Christie's earlier this month, said he would buy the rest in a deal that values the international auction house at $1.2 billion. . . . Royal Ahold extended its reach into the American supermarket business with a $2.6 billion deal for Giant Food Inc.    VIAGRA  Worldwide Demand  Viagra, intended to help impotent men, has yet to pass clinical tests in Taiwan, but it is already selling for $59 on the black market there. In Taipei, a nurse displayed a bag of the medication. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration reported on Friday that Pfizer Inc. had said that six patients taking the drug had died, although it was unknown if Viagra played any role in the deaths. A spokeswoman for the F.D.A. said the agency was investigating but continued to believe the drug was safe and effective and had asked Pfizer to provide more information to patients on the proper use of the drug. Pfizer's stock fell $3.69, to $105.44.
