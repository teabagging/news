Her consort in this production is Clive Brook, the hero and villain of many films. Miss Bankhead acquits herself with considerable distinction, but the vehicle to which she lends her talent is no masterpiece. In fact, only in a few spots is the author's fine hand discernible. Moreover, it is none too well photographed, and while the audience was undoubtedly not a little too captious, their laughter last night at certain abrupt changes of scenes was often only natural. A second or so more time between some of the flashes might have had quite a different effect.But there are in this film some commendable and clever contrasting glimpses, particularly those where Norman Cravath (Mr. Brook) loses his fortune on the Stock Exchange. His floor manager in one of these scenes comes up to Cravath and asks whether he knows anybody who wants a good office boy, and Cravath retaliates with: \\"Do you know any one who wants a house in Long Island with a dozen bedrooms?\\"Prior to that, when Cravath realizes that he has been wiped out, Nancy (Miss Bankhead), Cravath's wife, rushes into her husband's office and broaches Cravath on the subject of divorce. Then there are the scenes revealing Cravath bemoaning his ill luck alone in the spacious rooms of his town home, and those in which his wife is depicted enjoying the revelry of a second-rate cabaret, and finally others in which she invades her husband's relative seclusion accompanied by one old friend and several new cabaret acquaintances of the moment.Although Nancy is in love with a young man named De Witt Taylor, she decides that marriage to the wealthy Norman Cravath will mean her greater happiness. It is just as Cravath is in the throes of a Wall Street crash that she tells him that she has decided that her existence is intolerable. At that moment Cravath has no patience with his wife and he tells her vehemently to get out of his office.Nancy's marriage to Cravath was a sad disappointment to a spiteful woman called Germaine Prentiss, who for mercenary reasons decides that Cravath without his wealth is a better chance as a husband than any other man she knows. Cravath's wife, however, experiences a change of heart concerning him after her baby is born, and while he, at the first meeting since the debâcle and her obstreperous conduct, turns her out of his home, there is finally a reconciliation, and in a closing scene Cravath is all the more sure of his affection for his wife when he gazes upon their child in his cot.Miss Bankhead at moments is not unlike Marlene Dietrich and she has the same deep voice. She is mistress of all her many scenes, whether they are where she is living in luxurious surroundings, enjoying an evening in a cabaret, or serving as a saleswoman in a dressmaker's establishment. But there are moments when her voice seems to come from almost a wraith, which is owing to the poor photography. This, however, is no fault of Miss Bankhead's.Mr. Brook gives an easy and effective portrayal as the man of means who in a few hours discovers that his wealth has gone. He is a little too placid in some scenes, but that may be laid to the nature of the character. Osgood Perkins gives a highly commendable performance in a sympathetic rôle. Alexander Kirkland is not happily cast as Taylor. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Miss Bankhead's First Film."},{"year":"1931","title":"Two matrimonial lawyers.

Sir George Milne appealed to the cinema magnates, directors and producers and all and sundry in his audience in this strain: \\"With your backs to the wall, and remembering the justice of your cause, I urge you to carry the British film into every corner of this very great empire.\\"That the British film industry is in a difficult pass is admitted even by its most optimistic votaries. American, and even Continental European, competition for the world markets has won strategic positions from which it will not be easily ousted. The American dialogue film particularly is entrenched in lines which not only appear to be invulnerable but from which mass attacks can be delivered with every prospect of success. As Sir George Milne, citing Lord Haig, said, the British are fighting with their backs to the wall. It has often been claimed that it is then they fight best. In the cinema field of battle the fact has yet to be proved.Merits of \\"Blackmail.\\"Just at the moment British spirits have been raised by the production of the first full-length talking subject made in a British film studio. \\"Blackmail\\" is the name of the piece and Alfred Hitchcock is the director. Claim is advanced that \\"Blackmail\\" is the \\"best talk-film yet,\\" and that it will \\"give a shock to the Americans.\\" As it has yet only been shown privately, to an audience composed of experts, it may not be certain that the public verdict will be in accord with all the eulogies that have been uttered about it. It is announced, however, that the directors of the Gaumont-British circuit of cinemas were so impressed by it that they have booked it for all their houses at a fee running, into many thousands of pounds. \\"Blackmail\\" is to have its London premiere early in August at the Capitol.That \\"Blackmail\\" has merits is admitted by all who have seen it, but not all the critics are in agreement as to the degree of its merits. Alfred Hitchcock had already won a high reputation as a master of technique. One writer says that in \\"Blackmail\\" he has succeeded \\"in translating into vocal terms the doctrines of expressionism which the great Germans like Pabst and Lubitsch have exploited in pictorial values.\\" Another critic, while not so enthusiastic, states that the director should be well pleased with his work, \\"which easily surpasses its forerunners in the peculiar gifts which the sound film is acquiring for itself. From the first Mr. Hitchcock has held firmly to the principles of movement which underlie his craft. 'Blackmail' is a true motion picture and frees us from the idea that the camera must be transfixed and the pictorial flow of the film arrested merely for the pleasure of recording a variety of strange noises.\\" Yet another critic is forced to disclaim any disrespect for the production which he thinks is \\"the most intelligent compromise between talk and pictures that has yet been found, and as one would expect from Mr. Hitchcock, it is a blaze of pictorial cleverness and technical skill.\\" It has, however, adds this pundit, \\"the defects of Mr. Hitchcock's virtues\\" and \\"most of the sequences are too long.\\"Altogether, one gathers the impression that \\"Blackmail\\" may possibly not make such a strong appeal to the general public as it deserves to because of its artistic qualities.Its Vocal Qualities.\\"Blackmail\\" is a crime story, with the \\"flying squad\\" of Scotland Yard portrayed in a fashion which will rejoice the heart of Lord Byng. London is the scene of their exploits, and there are glimpses of many of the best known landmarks of the British metropolis. The story begins in a famous West End café, where a girl meets an artist who induces her to go to his studio in Chelsea, with disastrous results, and closes at the British Museum, where the blackmailer only escapes falling into the hands of the pursuing detectives by falling through the celebrated glass dome of that institution.One feature of \\"Blackmail\\" which is especially singled out for approval is that \\"after the nasal noises imported from America, the English voices are like music.\\" Here, however, comes in the vexed question as to the use of \\"doubles\\" for the stars whose pictured presentments are more pleasing than their vocal efforts. The leading feminine rôle in \\"Blackmail\\" is played by Miss Anny Ondra, but the voice heard is not hers but that of Miss Joan Barry. Miss Ondra is a Czechoslovakian","excerpt":"Miss Barry is one of the most promising of the younger school of British actresses. That Miss Ondra was being \\"doubled\\" as to the voice by Miss Barry, who does not appear on the screen, was not mentioned at the time of the ''trade show\\" on the program; but that two people contributed to the making of one part was speedily detected. It is suggested that the film requires one \\"final shot, in which Alfred Hitchcock should be seen introducing Joan Ondra to Anny Barry.\\" It is also, asked whether it was Joan or Anny who received the bigger salary, and whether it is fitting that a face should be more remunerative than a voice, or a voice than a face. And also whether the public should be deluded into believing that a pleasing voice necessarily goes with a pleasing face; and half a dozen other similar questions.Two German Films.After \\"Blackmail,\\" which has heartened the British industry—the manager of one company, in fact, is proclaiming that as this country has now secured the indispensable recording apparatus British talking films will be able to compete on their merits with American ones even in the States—the most notable incident in recent film history here was a meeting of shareholders of a company known as Whitehall Films Ltd. The company's first report showed a debit balance of more than £31,000, and the shareholders were rather annoyed at it. Lieut. Gen. Sir Edward Bethune, who presided at the meeting, spoke of the \\"disastrous effects which talking pictures had, for the moment, on the commercial value of silent pictures\\"; but a number of shareholders suggested there might be other reasons for the bad financial showing made by the management, and a motion that the reports and accounts be accepted was passed only, on condition that another meeting be called three months hence to report on the situation.Two German-made silent films have been the new productions of the week here. Both are good—one is \\"Temptation,\\" with Gustav Frolich and Betty Amman, and the other \\"The Wonderful Lie,\\" with Brigette Helm—but the American dialogue films, whose production here has already been recorded in this correspondence, continue to be the great attraction to the public.

For one thing, the cast is small but trim, including such hearties as Bruce Bennett, Forrest Tucker and that hardiest of hearties, Barton MacLane.

For a hero, Mr. Heston, a capable actor merely doing his job, makes a mighty distasteful pillar of piety.Miss Baxter looks lovely, intelligent and uneasy throughout the whole business.

Who knows but what it was intended as a kind of burlesque on Cinderella? The dialogue in it is ultra modern, even to the colloquialisms, and the manner in which some of the characters speak their lines is to a certain extent casual. There are those spasms of silence which are rather enervating, and then there are times when the voices are somewhat stentorian. In some cases, however, the spoken parts are quite well done, especially when a stage producer and his manager are whispering. It is all, however, singularly low-brow, relieved by Miss Brice's own melodies and recitations.The Man in the case is possibly one who suits the part. He is not of the handsome variety. He fits the words of the song, which is sung with no little vehemence and rhythm by Miss Brice. It is a pity, however, that the director, Archie Mayo, does not keep his camera on Miss Brice while she is entertaining a gathering, for when Mr. Mayo turns his camera on the throng listening to Miss Brice, the voice still comes from the centre of the screen. Miss Brice's vocal efforts also are just as resonant when her back is turned to the camera.Miss Brice's outstanding offering is \\"Mrs. Cohen at the Beach,\\" which, in the pictorial story, is done for the benefit of the producer, who at first holds high hopes for Fannie Brand's (Miss Brice) bow to Broadway. Landau, the producer, appears to be enormously impressed by the pantomimic affair supposed to take place on the seashore. This particular piece is almost as effective as it would be before the foot-lights and Miss Brice's Jewish intonation afforded no end of amusement to the audience last evening.Fannie Brand, the industrious and wholesome sister in a family, becomes enamored of Joseph Halsey, who at first earns a pittance by exhibiting an elastic exerciser in a drug store window. Apparently this means of livelihood is unsatisfactory, for Fannie eventually discovers Joe in the grip of a policeman, who is averse to having park benches used for sleeping. As one might expect, Fannie encourages Joe to become more industrious and as time goes on everything is ready for the wedding ceremony of Fannie and Joe. Edna, Fannie's flighty sister who has elected to be a fashionable blonde, is not content with having had an affair with Landau, but she, on this day of days, decides to set her cap at Joe.If the story is to be taken at all seriously, it is not to be wonderea at that Fannie is upset by discovering her sister in Joe's arms. Nevertheless, a neighbor who is fond of Fannie insists that Fannie must not take the unfortunate incident so much to heart.Miss Brice does quite well even in the silent stretches of this film. Edna Murphy officiates as the flirtatious Edna and Guinn Williams plays the part of Joe Halsey. Richard Tucker and Andre de Segurola figure as the stage experts.

She can, of course, and each of them well. But so much being generally admitted, it seemed a little unnecessary to dip so deeply into the sere and yellow leaf in order to locate \\"The Magnificent Lie.\\" Of an aged theme, and not too pleasant, it has the further difficulty at times of running into bits of poor taste.The story is about a soldier who is temporarily blinded, and while in that condition falls in love with a famous French actress. After the war he returns to New Orleans and one day sees that she is to appear there. He attends the performance of \\"Camille,\\" and in the course of it goes blind again. A girl of the music halls, as a joke, pretends she is the actress and visits him.Later, the doctors say he will never recover his sight, so his friend asks the girl to go on pretending. She does. Then, one evening, he visits her cabaret and hears her sing—as herself. The French actress comes in, learns about the great joke and wants to play too. The girl takes the young man home and there makes the error of forgetting the part. He finds out about the deception. Finally, on the way to his house, the car upsets. Naturally, the young man recovers his sight in consequence of the accident.Besides the somewhat miraculous manner of sight recovery, \\"The Magnificent Lie\\" has other factors to cause unhappy men to wonder about it all. Some of the comedy is not funny—being of the \\"oh, yeah\\" school—and some of the situations are as far as possible from that pole which is sublimity. Blindness, even on the screen, does not always appear as a subject for humor, regardless of the fact that most audiences know by now there will be an automobile accident sooner or later.Miss Chatterton carries out her two parts with her accustomed ease and Ralph Bellamy gives a fair portrait of Bill, who is the young man in the case. Stuart Erwin is Bill's friend and Charles Boyer and Tyler Brooke supply comedy.On the stage the Paramount has a revue called \\"Habanera,\\" which is rumba by nature. Don Azpiazu and his Havana Casino Orchestra are in it, and Al Trahan, Fowler and Tamara, Ojeda and Imbert and the Bines Ballet alto take part. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Miss Chatterton's New Film.

Each choreographer tended to keep her dancers moving on a diagonal path. And yet surprisingly and tellingly, the result of this ''double front'' concept was different for each choreographer.   Senta Driver, in concerts by Harry, her company, at the City Center's Space in New York, continues the experiments with two fronts that she began in 1980. Here, the audience seems to have a similar view wherever it sits. The very notion of ''double front'' choreography, a term used by Miss Driver, implies there are two equal fronts. As a result, her choreography is geared to provide maximum visibility with a minimum differentiation at any angle.   Lucinda Childs, in ''Available Light,'' by contrast, appears to offer two distinct viewpoints to audiences rather than the same or similar view. Miss Driver chooses to accommodate her choreography to the viewing situation","excerpt":"Miss Childs asks the audience to see what it can of a dance originally created for two audience sides that were not intended as two equal fronts.

Artur Rubinstein, Jascha Heifetz, Jan Peerce, Nadine Conner and Dimitri Mitropoulos, the latter conducting the New York Phillarmonic-Symphony Orchestra, are the distinguished musicians who perform in this conglomerate concert picture which Rudolph Polk and Bernard Luber have produced. And with such brilliant artists performing onto a sensitive recording device, a program of eloquent music is assured by this picture, at least.To pretend that the aural felicities are even remotely matched by the visual content of this picture would be senseless, however. The artists have been brought before the camera through some naïve and banal stratagems which fail to provide dramatic impulse or even to flatter the performers themselves. Indeed, the binding idea of the picture, which is, in a general way, to note that \\"great artists are also great people\\"—and which is put before the audience at the start by Deems Taylor in a plainly fished-up foreword—is patronizing, to say the least. If the greatness of these artists as people is supposedly displayed by the stuffy acts they are asked to put on in this picture, then that side of them had better be left alone.Mr. Rubenstein is brought to his piano on the pretext that he is being besought to appear in a motion picture by a reverential visitor to his home. While the visitor sits wrapt in admiration, Mr. Rubinstein obligingly runs through the Spinning Song of Mendelssohn, the \\"Liebestraum\\" of Liszt and Chopin's Waltz in C Sharp Minor and the A Major Polonaise. They are beautifully played while the camera watches. Then the visitor is shown a mural painting which records stages in the pianist's life and he departs while Mr. Rubinstein is playing \\"Pop, Goes the Weasel\\" for his tots.In the next episode, Miss Conner and Mr. Peerce are maneuvered onto a bare concert stage to do an impromptu recital for an old night-watchman who sits alone in the empty house with his musical dreams. Via visual dissolves and transformations, Mr. Peerce sings the \\"O Paradiso\\" aria from the opera \\"L'Africana\\" and the \\"Mattinata\\" by Leoncavallo","excerpt":"Miss Conner sings an aria from \\"Don Pasquale\\" and together they sing the eloquent duet of parting from Donizetti's \\"Lucia.\\" The unseen Victor Young orchestra conveniently accompanies them.Mr. Heifetz is coyly discovered, in the following episode, in his California home, lazily relaxing with his family, gardening, playing tennis and doing odd chores. And then, as an unseen narrator explains his working regimen, we see the artist retire to his studio and there begin his practice for a concert tour. The atmosphere of the private workshop and illustrations of the violinist's techniques are pictured in some fascinating detail, but again the dynamic of the film is simply the sound (and the strong appearance) of Mr. Heifetz playing a program. With Emanuel Ray accompanying, he plays Bach's Partita Prelude, \\"The Girl With the Flaxen Hair\\" by Debussy, Scherzo Tarantelle by Wieniawski and Paganini's Twenty-fourth Caprice.Significantly, the least pretentious of the film's four episodes—that is, in the way of staging—is the most valid and cinematic of the lot. This is an observation of Mr. Mitropoulos conducting a rehearsal of the Philharmonic-Symphony orchestra in the third movement of Liszt's Faust Symphony. By simply watching the conductor as he instructs and leads his musicians—by glimpsing the vibrant personality and professional intensity of the man—and then by observing the musicians as they diligently go about their work, making dramatic music, the excitement of dramatic action is achieved. Alex Hammid, who directed this episode, deserves commendation for what he has done.Although, on the whole, this patched-up picture lacks dramatic continuity and visual power, it successfully fills the one purpose of providing a clear and distinguished musical program on the screen.
