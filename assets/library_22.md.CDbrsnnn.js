He had planned to use the coasting period between the time that his nomination became inevitable and the Democratic National Convention in New York to hone his message and raise his national profile for the fall election campaign.

New Jersey, which has voted Republican in recent Presidential races, is considered a must-win for Mr. Bush. But before Mr. Perot's re-entry, Mr. Clinton was running slightly ahead in public opinion polls. The thin margin raises at least the possibility, say politicians and pollsters, that Mr. Perot could lure away enough Clinton supporters to let Mr. Bush squeak through.

Clearly that famous prefatory note to ''Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' has neither dissuaded generations of scholars from annotating the text, nor dissauded other persons from adapting, dramatizing, analyzing or, in one editor's words, ''enriching'' Mark Twain's celebrated epic. In the century following its publication, the classic has been issued and reissued (today there are more than 30 editions of the book available), amplified with introductions, bibliographies and criticism, and in one case even rewritten by a professor, who attempted to update it with contemporary slang, graphic sex and a heightened antislavery theme.   The performing arts, too, have eagerly seized upon the novel. Since 1920, five feature films, two television movies and various plays and musicals have been made of ''Huckleberry Finn''; and there are currently three dramatic presentations, based on the book or its characters, at hand: the Broadway musical ''Big River,'' ''The Adventures of Mark Twain,'' a recently released animated movie featuring Huck, Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher, and a four-part American Playhouse dramatization of the novel, the third segment of which airs tonight on Channel 13.

The rest were on view in \\"The Player,\\" which thoroughly enchanted the Cannes audience even as it lacerated much of what that audience holds dear. Shown only three days into the Cannes International Film Festival, \\"The Player\\" was cheered for its dead-on satire and its irreverence, both of which give it the earmarks of a possible winner. The fact that the director, Robert Altman, publicly expressed his disapproval of organized competitions among artists probably only heightened his chances of winding up with a major prize at this one.   Although \\"The Player\\" speaks a universal language, some of it was inevitably lost in translation. The film's running gag about brands of bottled water seldom turned up in the subtitles. And of course Mr. Altman's famous fondness for overlapping dialogue could not be adequately conveyed. However, the festival audience had its own eye for interesting details, buzzing more about minor players like the director Sydney Pollack than about movie-star walk-ons like Cher. The audience was particularly startled by the film's jokes about newspaper headlines like the one about a mud slide in Chile that is described by Peter Gallagher, playing an ambitious movie executive, as good material for the director John Boorman.

With 3,785 hits, he has moved past Henry Aaron, and now only Ty Cobb is ahead of him with 4,191 hits. Ty Cobb who last played more than half a century ago.

I felt great in warmup, I don't know what happened, I was kind of struggling through the whole thing.\\" Quance, considered a favorite to make the United States Olympic team in the 400 IM, missed the trip to Barcelona, Spain, because she was fighting a severe case of mononucleosis during the Olympic trials in March. She decided to concentrate on the 200 breaststroke, in which she finished third and out of the running for a trip to the Olympics.

For it is this apparently stunning happenstance that is exploited in \\"Mister Drake's Duck,\\" the English comedy, which took up residence at the Embassy Guild Theatre on Saturday. A dispassionate viewing, however, reveals that the whole matter is hardly explosive. \\"Mister Drake's Duck\\" is responsible for some chuckles, a few good-natured gibes at the British armed services and civil servants and the international race for atomic supremacy.Lest all this sound too ponderous it should be explained that the script turned in by Val Guest, who also directed, is gossamer light in its approach and as unscientific as a boiled duck egg. Mr. Guest's direction, on the other hand, is not so briskly paced as could be wished. He proceeds at a measured pace to set up the story of Donald Drake, an ex-United States Naval officer, who brings his bride to the farm in Sussex he inherited. Eventually, that scatter-brained lady unwittingly bids on and buys five dozen ducks at an auction and thereafter, the yarn takes on some speed and spirit.Seems that one of the ducks is responsible for uranium-loaded eggs and this unlikely intelligence finds its way to high places in London. Before our gentleman-farmer can defend himself, a tank company has invaded Green Acres Farm and made it a prohibited area and its inhabitants and visitors prisoners. To complicate matters, the Navy and Air Force, jealous of their rights, have sent contingents too. The object, to the consternation and confusion of the owners, is \\"Operation Chickweed,\\" a maneuver designed to separate with military dispatch, the one remarkable fowl from the rest of the flock. And, to credit the film's tongue-in-cheek approach, it can be divulged that Mr. Guest's and the duck's secret is still a mystery as the curtain is drawn on Mr. Drake's populous rustic retreat.Douglas Fairbanks Jr., who helped produce, as well as co-star in the hectic proceedings, turns in a professionally smooth stint as the harried farmer who is hardly the master of his domain. Yolande Donlan, who left these shores to play the dumb blonde in the London company of \\"Born Yesterday\\" and since has appeared on the British stage, screen and radio, is excellent as his pert and slightly dumb spouse. John Pertwee adds a few humorous bits as a nasal and crotchety farm hand. And, Wilfrid Hyde-Smith, as a meticulous Agriculture Ministry minor official","excerpt":"Peter Butterworth, as a harassed handy man, and Reginald Beckwith, as a country banker, also contribute some levity to the goings-on.They are, of course, laboring one joke, but they do come up with enough laughs to make \\"Mister Drake's Duck\\" a pleasant if slight lampoon.

Peter Gabriel, who was the founder, lead singer and principal songwriter for Genesis before he abruptly left the group in 1975, will be getting back together with his old bandmates. Genesis has remained one of the most popular British bands, notching up gold albums and Top 10 singles","excerpt":"Peter Gabriel's innovative and provocative solo disks have enjoyed solid but unspectacular sales. But for millions of diehard fans around the world, the fancifully elaborate albums and stage shows that Mr. Gabriel and Genesis created together in the early- and middle-1970's remain among British art-rock's most impressive achievements.   Peter Gabriel feels differently, however. He was in New York recently for the release of his fourth album, ''Survival'' (Geffen/Warner Bros.), and although he was excited about several projects, the Genesis reunion was not one of them. ''We'll be doing all the old stuff, nothing new,'' he said. ''It's a case of ask the people for their money and give 'em what they want.''

Five years is a long time to be off the road, and Mr. Gabriel's performance showed some strain and some miscalculation.    He is working with strong basic ingredients. The songs from his most recent album, \\"Us\\" (Geffen), which dominated a two-hour set, brood over love and loneliness, at once hoping for and despairing at the possibility of human connection. His voice has a haggard vulnerability, now and then rising to a diffident, almost unearthly falsetto. And his band, including his longtime collaborators Tony Levin on bass, Manu Katche on drums, L. Shankar on electric violin and David Rhodes on guitar, can lock into his favorite soul and funk grooves, create rippling backgrounds for ballads and chime out mid-tempo rock riffs. Joy Askew, on keyboards, sang the female parts of duets with ethereal tenderness.

Take \\"Black Tuesday,\\" which accompanied the Palace's new stage bill yesterday, with Edward G. Robinson playing his old, snariing, savage self.We hastily add that this medium-budget United Artists offering, produced by Robert Goldstein, by no means reprises the sterling tradition of those cops-and-killers yarns about our urban jungles of the roaring Twenties, when the Robinsons, Cagneys and Munis cut their fangs. However, purely on a surface level, the new entry can snuggle up to them quite respectably.Of course Mr. Robinson easily slips back into evil gear, as a condemned killer who masterminds his escape from a prison death house and uses some subjugated criminals and terrorized hostages in a ruthless attempt \\"to stay alive,\\" which he insists he wants to do. Well, Eddie, who doesn't?For all Mr. Robinson's outward behavior, his declaration is about as close as we ever get to the inner man, the focal point. Consequently, the film merely depicts the bloody trail of a stereotyped sadist.In doing so, not a word or minute falls to waste. The dialogue, credited to Sidney Boehm, is as literate as it is cryptic. And director Hugo Fregonese has done an extremely taut and graphic stag-???In contrast to Mr. Robinson's wholesale sputtering, the supporting cast of comparatively unfamiliar faces are brought, one by one, into impersonal but perceptive focus. And most of them shine convincingly. These include Jean Parker, as Mr. Robinson's sweetheart","excerpt":"Peter Graves, as his spunkiest cohort; Milburn Stone, as a priest, and Sylvia Findley, Jack Kelly, Victor Perrin and others, on both sides of the law.It's a pleasure to see Mr. Robinson shedding his good citizenship in such a colorful, lively show.

He was widely recognized for his avid pursuit of new technology in the ophthalmic field and served on numerous professional committees nationally and internationally.

From the 1960s, he was active on the New York Medical College academic staff, retiring 30 years later as Professor Emeritus of Ophthalamology. During this time, he was active first as Director of the Glaucoma Service of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, and then as Chief of Glaucoma Service of New York's St. Vincent's Hospital. He is the developer of the Halberg Hand Applanation Tonometer, a glaucoma diagnostic instrument.

Although it takes some diverting peeks into and behind the arena of one of Russia's Big Tops, its large helpings of romance and humor are strictly standard and lightweight. Despite its pleasing colors and a potentially exciting setting, this \\"Tiger Girl\\" emerges as a tame act.Since they are concerned with circuses, and not bread, the producers have injected little that could he construed as special pleading. But this excursion into the world of tanbark and trapeze, which manages to be light-hearted, if plodding, sticks to the idea that the path to true love has to be circuitous. So, we have our hero, Fyodor, a daring motorcycle champion, who is importuned into doing a dare-devil turn for the circus, being cast into the orbit of Lena, the girl friend of his best pal.This energetic miss is not only immediately smitten but also yearns for the day when she can take over as a tiger tamer. There also is the complication of another comely miss who casts calf eyes at Fyodor. At any rate, Lena, who is cleverer with cats than with swains, gets her opportunity to handle the felines, after which she whips her romantic affair into shape.In the meantime, a viewer who has been through such amatory trials before, can get satisfactory glimpses of a variety of circus fare such as her man's stupendous act—he leaps through space on his cycle—as well as her climactic mastery of her snarling charges before an appreciative audience.

It broods sardonically over Mr. von Sternberg's carefully lighted canvases, in his master-mind murderer, his ingenue harlot and his pedestrian police inspector. Although Peter Lorre is occasionally able to give the film a frightening pathological significance, this is scarcely Dostoievsky's drama of a tortured brain drifting into madness with a terrible secret. It is Dostoievsky eviscerated and converted into nickel-plate detective melodrama. The production is handsome and as we might expect from a cameraman of Mr. von Sternberg's skill, visually striking. But the major virtues of the film end there.As a psychological study of a murderer's progressive collapse it is confused and almost meaningless. Inevitably a dramatization of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" must stand or fall on its ability to project Raskolnikoff convincingly, and it is here that the photoplay, both in its writing and direction, is least successful. Mr. Lorre himself, in particular moods and scenes, plays with genuine tragic power as the poor student who could commit murder successfully but could not escape from himself. But the character is badly motivated and never completely understood, and Raskolnikoff's behavior becomes a series of disconnected moods which never merge into a continuous psychological pattern.The crime itself, far from being an act of fatal compulsion which had been committed in Raskolnikoff's mind many times before he beat the aged money lender to death, is the emotional violence of a young man with a sudden temper tantrum. His subsequent activities, as he jousts with the inspector, falls under the influence of the sainted harlot, and at last gives himself up, are quixotic without any discernible continuity.The film is at its best, of course, in those scenes of intellectual combat between Raskolnikoff and the inspector. But here, too, the film loses much of its effectiveness because of its insistence on presenting Raskolnikoff as a master criminal instead of a bewildered and tortured youth who is forever on the verge of betraying himself. In the interviews where Porfiry tries to trap his victim, the inspector is not the consistently subtle and assured inquisitor that he should be. Some of his bits of information about the crime seem to have been snatched out of the blue. How, for example, did he know that Raskolnikoff visited the scene of the murder?Within the limits permitted him by an indecisive script, Mr. Lorre gives a fascinating performance, revealing once again his faculty for blending repulsion and sympathy in the figure he projects to his audience. He also shows a hitherto unsuspected talent for comedy. Edward Arnold, again within the limits of the script, is excellent as the inspector. Marian Marsh has been prettified to make a Hollywood version of a bad girl, and she is seldom convincing in the rôle of the harlot. Most of the other characters are pasteboard fabrications.
