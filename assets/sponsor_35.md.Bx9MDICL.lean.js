Instead, he presents Asia from the vantage point of a lone traveler fascinated by the sheer otherness of the lands he visits. Rather than providing a considered overview of Asia, Mr. Rubinfien has created an idiosyncratic travelogue made up of oddly resonant details of the sort usually glimpsed out of the corner of an eye.

Rabbi Leib, combating the longstanding prejudice against the Jewish community, saves Reb Eliezer Polner from death by creating a golem who proves the false accusers wrong: The Jews have not put the blood of the child Hanka into their matzohs - only flour and water.

The story of how this itinerant turn-of-the-century musician moved out of saloons and bawdy houses and became the king of ragtime is told more evocatively in the 1950 book \\"They All Played Ragtime,\\" by Rudi Blesh and Harriet Janis, and there is also an interesting historical collage of facts and photographs in the lobby of the theater.

The house was right on the dunes and had a terrific view of the ocean. The only thing that spoiled the view was me.   I was a spoiled suburban child who failed to see the point of driving two hours just to exchange a view of green lawns for one of green water swilling around outside the window. I spent my summers hunting for bits of a city I hadn't discovered yet. Dropped off for a sailing lesson, I would loiter a while at the door of the yacht club, then dash to the miniature golf course next door. Learning to ride a bike was a pleasure because I could pedal away from the beach and find some stray bits of city thrown up on the island like jetsam. The shop that sold amber jewelry. The Chinese gift store, a miniature Chinatown, with lanterns, chopsticks and the clam shells that you plunged into water, releasing paper flowers.

And in a sense, much music written before Haydn and Mozart was ambient: the Baroque genre of Tafel musik, or table music, was intended as background for aristocratic dinner conversation.   Modern ambient music, however, makes more complex demands. It does not serve as the background for unrelated events; rather, like certain modes of Minimalism, it aims to wrap the audience in its sensuous embrace, excluding more conscious forms of activity. Rather than sitting composedly in chairs, listeners lie on the floor, or maybe dance. Ambient music overlaps heavily with the dense, overwhelming dance sound of techno and rave.

Some of these shows are smallish, rough-around-the-edges retrospectives that provide the chance to size up achievements of well-known artists from the 1960's and 70's. The Nassau County Museum of Art in Roslyn, for example, has mounted a 30-year survey of the maverick figurative artist Larry Rivers. And the Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton has brought together nearly three decades' worth of sculpture by Roy Lichtenstein, the Pop painter, for the first time.
