George M. C. Fisher, who came to the company from Motorola Inc. in December, said Kodak would sell its noncore businesses, including Sterling Winthrop Inc., which makes pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter drugs","excerpt":"L&F Products, which makes Lysol and other home and personal-care products, and the Clinical Diagnostics division, which produces medical testing devices. Together, they generated $3.7 billion last year, or about one-fifth of Kodak's $16.7 billion in revenues for 1993 -- a year in which Kodak had a $1.5 billion loss. 'Tremendous Opportunities'    The company plans to build upon its traditional film and camera business and continue to perfect techniques for capturing images in digital form and storing and processing them as computer files. Such technologies have applications not only for photography but also for business customers in increasingly computerized workplaces.      \\"Imaging offers Kodak tremendous opportunities for long-term success and growth,\\" Mr. Fisher said at a news conference in New York yesterday. \\"To achieve maximum success, we have concluded that we must commit our entire resource base to imaging opportunities and divest noncore businesses.\\"   Kodak, based in Rochester, has been under pressure from investors to cut costs and improve performance. Indeed, it was unhappiness on the part of large, institutional investors that led the company's board to dismiss Mr. Fisher's predecessor, Kay R. Whitmore, last year.    Investors responded positively to the company's announcement, and Kodak stock closed up $1.375 a share yesterday, ending the trading day at $46.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, where the stock's volume of 3.79 million shares made it the fourth most active. On Monday, Kodak's stock rose $3.25 a share on rumors that Sterling would be sold.   The reaction among financial analysts was that Kodak was finally leaving businesses that it never should have entered in the first place.    \\"He had to do it, and he did it,\\" said Brenda Lee Landry, an analyst with the investment firm Morgan Stanley. \\"Those businesses were not making any money if you subtracted debt from operating earnings. So any earnings growth in the next 24 months will have to come from cost cutting.\\"   Many on Wall Street sounded a sharp note of skepticism about whether the company would find much profitability in conventional film. \\"The big question beyond the disposition of assets is what is going to happen to the core business,\\" said B. Alex Henderson, with Prudential Securities Research. \\"How are they going to offset tremendously negative factors in film and paper and demonstrate they can make money in electronic imaging?\\"   Among its health businesses, the company said it planned to retain only its medical and dental imaging businesses, which use both X-ray film and electronics. Kodak said that the French pharmaceuticals company Elf Sanofi, which has several joint programs with Sterling, had the right of first refusal to buy the pharmaceutical portion of Sterling Winthrop.   No buyers have yet been found for the other, smaller pieces of Sterling, which include over-the-counter remedies, or for the other Kodak units that have been put up for sale.   Kodak officials declined to say how much money they expected to realize from the sales, saying they were in preliminary negotiations with potential buyers. However, they conceded the company might have an unspecified \\"book loss\\" for the year, once all the details, including tax treatment, were worked out.   This is the second major divestiture for Kodak, which last year spun off its Eastman Chemical Company, which had $3.9 billion in sales. In addition, the company has sold several smaller operations. Company Will Shrink    As a result of the sales and divestitures, the company will be much smaller, with about $13 billion in sales compared with $20.2 billion at the end of 1992. But it will shortly have less debt as well because the company has said it will use the proceeds of the sales \\"to achieve significant debt reduction.\\" At the end of the year, Kodak had $7.2 billion in long-term debt.   Mr. Fisher said the divestitures would permit the company's managers to concentrate on the core imaging business. And he continued to resist calls from Wall Street to sharply reduce staffing levels. \\"Rather than simply take an ax to budgets and manpower, we are trying to change, in significant ways, how this company operates,\\" Mr. Fisher said.   Mr. Fisher said the company would \\"focus on profitable participation in the five links of the imaging chain: image capture, processing, storage, output, and delivery of images for people and machines anywhere in Kodak's worldwide market.\\"   He said Kodak would press its traditional sale of consumer products, like film and photographic paper, and would move into electronic imaging in areas where \\"Kodak can profitably compete.\\"   Mr. Fisher said he had established 10 special teams to improve return on net assets by increasing revenues and cutting costs. The program includes growth of market, asset management, span-of-control, cost of quality, research and development productivity, marketing opportunities, portfolio review, process re-engineering, cycle-time improvement and policy opportunities. Fisher to Lead Groups    Mr. Fisher said he would personally lead the growth of market and cycle-time improvement groups.    The biggest piece of the divestitures will be Sterling Winthrop, which Kodak acquired in 1988 for $5.1 billion. But analysts say Sterling has never become an integral part of Kodak's business and has been a drain on the company's capital budget and a distraction for management.   Although Elf Sanofi has first rights to bid on Sterling's pharmaceutical operations, there may be at least one competitor. A spokesman for the German drug company Bayer A.G. said yesterday that the company was interested in buying Sterling Winthrop's over-the-counter drug business in the United States.   Sterling markets a number of drugs under the Bayer name and the German pharmaceutical company has long wanted to reclaim its name in the United States. It lost control of the name in this country after World War I.

Sharply emerging were drum beats, and here and there muscular electric guitar licks, variations on simple patterns that resembled traditional blues but that had a very different effect.    When the playing stopped, after two hours of continuous projection at high volume, a high-pitched ringing continued despite the silence.
