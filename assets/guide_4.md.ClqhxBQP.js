Most of the objects and people in this monograph by the photographer Ralph Gibson have been removed from their context, truncated and made into esthetic and intellectual enigmas to accentuate the beauty of their surfaces. Unafraid to use blurs, transparencies and slanted frames to further isolate his subjects, Mr. Gibson celebrates France in a highly elliptical and intimate manner. He seems most fascinated by the balance of abandon and discipline he has found in that country. His pictures of the velvet or muslin folds of curtains, of the curvaceous lines of brass door handles and wrought-iron works, as well as his portraits of women -- their bodies framed by the cut of a garment or the tension of a belt, their faces peaceful or meditative -- all bespeak a sensuality shared by the American photographer and his adopted country. Through his photos of a measuring tape around a tailor's shoulders, a solitary easel, the shiny neck of a bottle of red wine, the profile of a chef in his toque blanche, and a lapel bearing the thin red ribbon of the Legion d'Honneur, Mr. Gibson pays a discreet compliment to France's veneration of precision, craftsmanship and status.

Paris Journal","excerpt":"Seducing France With Watercress Sandwiches"},{"year":"1982","title":"Seduction, which has figured in many great novels, may be disappearing from serious fiction, and not everyone will be sorry to see it go, for it has sometimes carried an unpleasant connotation of a man manipulating a woman's emotions. Seduction implied that she didn't know her own mind or self, or that she lacked the moral courage to make a decision. There was the suggestion too that men were the bold agents of romantic anarchy and women the timid conservators of conventional morality - a view that may never have been accurate and certainly is not now.   It can be argued in defense of seduction, though, that it provided people and fiction with a ceremony of a sort, a structured pattern of strongly motivated behavior. If we give up what's left of our ceremonies, we may be reduced to a minimalist view of human behavior, in which things happen without intrigue or adornment.  Stripped of symbolism, of an enhancing or contributing context, each act becomes its own frame of reference.

But Jim wants to be president  of acquisitions, a position already held by Jack (Scott Paulin), who has no idea of the horrors in store for him. As Jim is fond of saying, \\"Never lose sight of  your goals,\\" and \\"always focus on the present moment.\\" Jim wastes no time finding out that a well-positioned secretary has been doing some small-scale embezzling to help her sick mother. He then blackmails the secretary into becoming his assistant in skulduggery. And that is the least of his machinations.

If you are a music critic you are assumed to have an ample supply of CD's. A book critic accumulates a serious library. But an architecture critic? There is architectural drawing, but it has always seemed so much art manque.  That's why I began to collect tiny toy buildings -- what other way short of investing in real estate is there to build a collection of architecture?   That's the story I would tell an interviewer if I were the sort of person who gets interviewed. The truth is that the whole thing never had so considered a purpose. It was born of necessity. A while ago I lived in a small apartment that had an odd little niche in the wall, and lying around on my desk was one of those cheap, eight-inch-high miniatures of the Empire State Building that you can buy in any souvenir shop.  Better a toy Empire State Building than a vase of dried flowers, I said to myself, and into the niche it went.  That was to be the end of that, until a neighbor saw it and said he had a souvenir World Trade Center that he would like to give me, and then somebody else said you can't have an Empire State Building without a Statue of Liberty, and not too long after that I got married and a friend from California gave us his miniature lead Woolworth Building and then my wife was browsing in an antiques shop and found an RCA Building in the form of an ashtray and it was all over. The RCA Building cost a lot of money -- $85 -- and it meant that there was no turning back.

Actually, such lessons have been around for years. They usually arise out of a kind of inoculation theory -- that if children can wise up to television, they will become immune to it.   This situation is quite the opposite of what happens when schools teach critical reading skills, which are not intended to disclose literary devices to turn students away from reading. Rather, critical reading skills are seen as necessary to becoming an informed, lifetime reader, and they are taught by teachers who love books and reading. They operate on the premise that the more you know about how writers work, the more you will want to read.   Wouldn't it make sense to have television literacy courses taught by people who love television -- well, maybe not all of it -- and who regard it as a legitimate source of information and entertainment?   As much as separate courses on media have become standard fare in many schools, the more sophisticated development integrates television so that it becomes one of many resources available to the clever teacher. Individual teachers are finding inventive ways to use television, and the networks, commercial and public, have a long history of providing materials to support courses that already exist. The CBS Television reading program for example, has provided more than 40 million scripts and study guides for selected broadcasts that have educational merit.   Where television is seen as an ally, not a force to be overcome, that's where the real television-in-the-classroom news is.

The British School of Falconry at the Equinox Resort in Manchester, Vt., has been running educational programs for the last 10 years and, according to its manager, Rob Waite, participation has been growing steadily.

Garry Winogrand's elegantly composed, overhead photo, above, from the 1970's of a woman sunbathing next to a luminous swimming pool projects a voyeuristic yearning so intense that it verges on the mystical.

While the grim statistics of infections and deaths mounted, official neglect and programming timidity became not just scandalous, but tragic as well.

This weekend's encouraging evidence, combining information about AIDS with big-name entertainment, is \\"In a New Light,\\" a two-hour special at 8 tonight on ABC.   Why the turnaround? One reason, certainly, is that what was once thought to be exclusively a disease of homosexuals and drug addicts has been spreading, slowly but inexorably, into heterosexual and proper middle-class communities. Another, and far more significant, is the nationwide realization that people with AIDS do not exist in a vacuum. They are American citizens with families and friends, many of whom care deeply about them. That's the point hammered home throughout this program.
