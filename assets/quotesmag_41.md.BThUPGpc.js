(Perennial/HarperCollins, $11.) This historical fable chronicles the remarkable career of Th&#233;r&#232;se Humbert, a con artist extraordinaire whose skill at spinning lies enabled her to bilk French investors and reign as one of the great hostesses of belle-&#233;poque Paris for nearly 20 years. ''Spurling is able to convey the speed and mystery of Humbert's rise and fall,'' Alice Kaplan wrote in these pages last year. ''We're left, like her victims, seduced and astounded.''    SCANDALMONGER, by William Safire. (Harvest/Harcourt, $14.) The author, a columnist for The New York Times, peers into a murky corner of American history in this fictional tale of a venomous journalist who dealt punishing blows to the reputations of both Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. The result is a ''handsomely constructed and politically sophisticated novel,'' Thomas Flanagan said here in 2000.    A PURE CLEAR LIGHT, by Madeleine St. John. (Carroll & Graf, $12.) After a married television director begins an affair with a single accountant, his wife takes up with Anglicanism, and both dalliances inject some sorely missed vitality into unbalanced lives. ''St. John has a deft touch with dense topics,'' Maggie Galehouse wrote here last year, and her ''knack for smart dialogue'' speeds this novel ''effortlessly along.''    BURT LANCASTER: An American Life, by Kate Buford. (Da Capo, $18.) The onetime circus performer turned Oscar-winning actor is portrayed as a magnetic performer with a leonine beauty and loads of talent, ambition and charisma. But all those attributes were tempered by broad appetites (he was a compulsive womanizer), dark rages and a paucity of charm on a human scale. Last year in the Book Review, Molly Haskell called this a ''splendid biography.''    PRINCE, by Ib Michael. (Picador USA, $13.) A blend of magic realism and conventional coming-of-age story, this Danish novel revolves around a young boy spending the summer at a seaside resort in 1912 and his ''secret playmate,'' a guardian angel who is also the spirit of a dead sea captain. ''Written with precision, energy and a masterly assurance, 'Prince' . . . stirs one's awe at the mystery of life and consciousness,'' Bruce Bawer wrote here in 1999.    OBERAMMERGAU: The Troubling Story of the World's Most Famous Passion Play, by James Shapiro. (Vintage, $13.) A scholar explores the long, twisted history of anti-Semitism by focusing on modern efforts to purge hateful speech from a play performed in a pious Bavarian village every 10 years since 1634 (Hitler was a fan). Shapiro is a ''wonderfully knowledgeable'' author who ''knows how to keep his cool, which is a useful talent for anyone who wants to talk about . . . religion and bigotry,'' Paul Berman said here last year. A World Full of Gods: The Strange Triumph of Christianity, by Keith Hopkins (Plume, $14), is an unconventional study of early Christianity and its improbable emergence from the stew of ancient religions in which Hopkins employs time travel, bawdy humor and other novelistic devices. ''The world of antiquity comes remarkably alive,'' Robert A. Oden Jr. wrote here in 2000. ''We learn a lot, too.''    THE LONG FIRM, by Jake Arnott. (Soho, $14.) The hero of this challenging first novel is a ruthless gay gangster named Harry Starks, whose escapades in 1960's London are reconstructed by five different narrators who are drawn into his orbit at various times in his career. '' 'The Long Firm' is a great read from start to finish, gathering pace and depth as it goes,'' Henry Shukman wrote here in 1999. ''Harry emerges as a kind of demigod of the demimonde'' who ''earns our respect, even affection, at the same time as our horror.''    WANDERLUST: A History of Walking, by Rebecca Solnit. (Penguin, $14.) The author meanders through politics, religion and other disciplines, tossing in profiles of noted ramblers like Wordsworth and Kierkegaard. ''Her words remind us of walking's simple joy . . . and return us to a time when an aimless contemplative stroll was a daily activity,'' Sandra Mardefeld said here last year.    BLOOD RAIN, by Michael Dibdin. (Vintage Crime, $12.) In an assignment he has long dreaded, the philosophical police detective Aurelio Zen is sent to Sicily, where his adopted daughter is working, to spy on the government's anti-Mafia squad. ''Dibdin has always been a master at adapting his style to the various Italian provinces'' where he sets his mysteries, Marilyn Stasio wrote here last year.

Probably on the strength of Miss Crespin's groWing reputation and popularity in this country, Angel has released here a disk of arias recorded in January and February, 1958. There are excerpts from &#8220;William Tell,&#8221; &#8220;Ill Trovatore,&#8221; &#8220;Otello,&#8221; &#8220;Tannh&#228;user&#8221; and &#8220;The Dafinnation of Faust.&#8221; The London recording, of more recent vintage, sticks to the familiar Italian repertory, duplicating in only one instance the material on the Angel disk&#8212;the &#8220;Salce, salde&#8221; and &#8220;Ave Maria&#8221; from &#8220;Otello.&#8221; The French so prano's voice seemed to be lighter and freer in the earlier days, moving with more facility. The singing itself was lovely and interesting but without quite the degree of sensitivity and color that shows up on the later recording.

Since producing, performing on and co-writing songs for the R&B singer India.Arie's debut album, ''Acoustic Soul,'' in 2001, he has had a hand -- more often two -- in creating music by a variety of artists, including Seal, Gwen Stefani, 50 Cent and the Game. Most recently he collaborated with the Dave Matthews Band on the album \\"Stand Up\\" (RCA). Mr. Batson spoke with Joel Topcik last week between studio sessions with the hip-hop producer Dr. Dre:    k-os       ''Joyful Rebellion'' (Astralwerks), from the Canadian rapper k-os (pronounced like ''chaos''), is the most adventurous hip-hop album I've heard. The use of live instruments and the production are what really make it work. At its root, it's still a hip-hop album, but with the live drums, the acoustic and electric guitars, the string arrangements, it's much more than that in the same way OutKast's last record was. The lead track, ''Emcee Murdah,'' and ''B-Boy Stance'' especially grabbed me.    The White Stripes       I've got one or two of the White Stripes' earlier records, but ''Get Behind Me, Satan'' (V2) really caught me. I like Jack White's switch from guitar to piano. The raw piano-and-drum combination sounds like they set up mikes in a room and just played. I like to hear people on records, and you can get that sometimes when someone isn't necessarily a virtuoso player. I wouldn't say Jack White is an accomplished pianist, but the sound has a great feel, like the piano on old Tom Waits records.    Common       There's a beautiful thing happening in hip-hop these days where an artist will get with a producer and they'll make an album. Sounds simple, but a lot of hip-hop records have so many producers, and different producers on different tracks, that it's hard to get a unified feel. On ''Be'' (Geffen), which came out in May, Kanye West stepped up and made a real album for Common. I listen to it all the way through, which I rarely do with a hip-hop album. I might have added a little arrangement, along the lines of k-os's album, but I like the way Kanye crafted enough space for Common's energy to come through.    Foxy Brown       ''Come Fly With Me'' is the new single from Foxy Brown's upcoming album, ''Black Roses'' (Def Jam), which comes out next month. She really jumped into two pots for this one, mixing up her rap thing with Jamaican patois. Foxy has crazy skills, and she's a real lyricist who plays with words. On ''Come Fly With Me,'' she's rhyming Jamaican expressions, mixing them into her raps, and using really intricate rhythms. I don't think anyone has ever done that before, and if they have, they didn't do it this well. The beat has a Caribbean element, but it's a hip-hop song at heart. And with the dancehall singer Sizzla on the chorus, forget about it -- the energy and emotion really come through. I've been playing it every day.    Amerie       Amerie is an artist who's bringing energy back to R&B. It used to be you would listen to R&B records by groups like Earth, Wind and Fire or Sly and the Family Stone, and you just couldn't wait to hear the songs live, they had so much energy. Now a lot of records sound too smooth. It's hard, as a producer, to capture that balance between the production and letting the emotion come through. Hip-hop has been finding that balance in the last five or so years","excerpt":"R&B is starting to catch up. The producer Rich Harrison found it for Amerie's single ''1 Thing'' (Sony Urban). He uses a Meters sample in the song, and I'm a die-hard Meters fan.    Sweet Honey in the Rock       A few weeks ago I went to see the documentary ''Raise Your Voice,'' which follows the all-female a cappella group Sweet Honey in the Rock on its 30th anniversary tour in 2003. The DVD has interviews and great performances of those important freedom songs that give you a feel for the history of the music and the civil rights era. Bernice Johnson Reagon, the group's founder, is probably one of the last living warriors, like Paul Robeson -- someone who sang and got people to listen long enough to stop fighting. The emotion she has been able to express with her voice, and then put into a group arrangement, is a whole other level of artistry. She's more than just a voice, a singer of songs; she's a defender of people.    50 Cent       I've worked with 50 Cent before, but I didn't get a chance to work with him the way I wanted. I'm a big fan of the folk-blues singer Leadbelly (Huddie Ledbetter), and that's how I think of 50 Cent -- as a blues singer. Songs like ''Ski Mask Way'' on his recent album ''The Massacre'' (Shady Records/Aftermath) are like money hymns: they capture the drama and the emotion of wanting to be paid. That's the American dream. There are a lot of great songs on ''The Massacre,'' ones that will last for a while. But there are too many songs on the record, and the sequencing isn't great, so it doesn't make a complete statement. When I listen to it, I use my own sequence and add other 50 Cent songs like ''I Run New York,'' with Tony Yayo, and ''The Way We Came Up.''

Instead, she has produced a delightful compendium of lagomorph lore, profusely illustrated with reproductions of artworks and artifacts culled from a vast array of world cultures -- from ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics to 20th-century American cartoon characters. \\"Rabbits have represented almost every emotion, ideal, foible and personality trait known to humanity,\\" she writes in RABBITS EVERYWHERE (Abrams,  $24.95), and she goes on to explore the rabbit's role as a symbol for such things as sexuality, fertility, purity, luck and cunning in various societies. The text not only touches on the best known of the literary long-ears -- the Easter Bunny, Peter Rabbit, the March Hare, Br'er Rabbit -- but delves into the  lives of the less publicized as well, including the heroic hares of both Buddhist and African fables. Despite the rabbit's affectionate place in the hearts of many, Ms. Ezpeleta, an interior designer, reveals that a few cultures  weren't very fond of them: the Vikings lumped them in the same category as sea monsters, and the ancient Celts assumed that rabbits purposely lived underground because of their affiliation with darker powers. The giant demon-bunny absconding with a young maiden carved into a portal of the Chartres Cathedral is a little unsettling compared with the familiar images of Bugs and Thumper, and the author even manages to link similar medieval notions of evil to the role of  killer rabbit in the movie \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\\" Ms. Ezpeleta takes a grand hop through rabbit history, noting along the way that the same creatures used to represent immortality and rebirth in the old Chinese, Greek and Roman legends can be seen even today fulfilling the same role in television's Energizer Bunny commercials.

Most recently, a public service ad he did for GlaxoSmithKline became the centerpiece of an advertising blitz in magazines like Ebony and Savoy to focus attention on H.I.V. and prevention. The message was long overdue, and Mr. Johnson's celebrity and leadership status certainly make him a valuable spokesman. But within this image also lies what's wrong with the limited conversation on African-Americans and AIDS: women are not always a meaningful part of it.    Black women make up less than 15 percent of the female population in the United States. But they represented 64 percent of all new AIDS cases among women in 2001, according to the federal government.
