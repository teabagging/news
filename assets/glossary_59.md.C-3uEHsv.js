The board lists contributors by name and car, ranking them in a hierarchy of generosity, with the big tippers traditionally celebrated in a green zone at the top. It appears to all the world as a confirmation of the city's enduring holiday spirit: Yo! Pay up! Remember the greediest!         But is this really what Christmas is about today? Maybe not. Outside the garage many New Yorkers seem to be abandoning their holiday rituals of bribery and extortion. I don't want to be alarmist -- after all, doormen and supers are  still doing nicely -- but a lot of people have become reluctant to skim their customary share of the city's wealth. Companies routinely forbid employees to accept gifts worth more than $25, which has been a tremendous hardship on the class of executives -- advertising buyers, mutual-fund managers, fashion editors -- who once proudly adorned their offices with tributes of crystal and leather and wine. Some still manage to sneak their booty home, but others no longer even get the chance to violate company policy: because of all the corporate cost cutting, they're lucky these days to be offered a box of cookies.

Let's examine them one by one.\\n\\nWe all know that plants require water, yet it seems that we persist in providing either too much or too little. Too much will often result in the destruction of the root system as a result of poor drainage and lack of air. Such conditions favor the development of fungi that cause root rot. Without active roots to take up water, plants may wilt even though they are standing in water. Too little water limits the moisture available to the plant, and if the deficiency is severe, the roots will die. This will also result in wilting and desiccation of the foliage.

All the great stores have their superb electrical displays glittering along the façades from sidewalk to mansards and their windows staging animated puppet shows. The market for \\"étrennes\\" and \\"cadeaux\\" is brisk. Along the Grand Boulevards, as well as up in Montmartre the booths have come back for the annual fair time. Anybody who is lucky and has a good eye can ring trophies just as at Coney Island—except that here the prize is as likely as not to be a bottle of champagne. Along a block or so of the Boulevard St. Germain, artists even more independent than the \\"Independents\\" have rigged up their galleries on the sidewalks with complete disregard of rain and weather, and will sell you a genuine signed oil painting for a good deal less than you expect.The season of the New Year has brought a decided fillip to the business of cinema entertainment. A glance at posters and other listings shows a great shifting from only a week or so ago. Many attractions have performed a last fade-out, after having hung on for weeks or sometimes months. Some have bowed themselves out in venerable glory, as for instance, \\"The Jazz Singer,\\" just closing after eleven months at the Aubert Palace. And it is closing only to be supplanted by \\"The Singing Fool,\\" so that the voice of Jolson will still resound along the Boulevard des Italiens.Passing Pictures.Another picture which played many weeks and has just now left the snug Colisée for a tour of the weekly-change-of-bill houses is \\"Tempête sur l'Asie,\\" the Russian propagandist piece already described here. That has been replaced by the Martin Johnson spectacle, \\"Simba,\\" which has won great approval in the press.It should be reported that \\"Fox Follies,\\" cause of some commotion at the opening of the cinematized Moulin Rouge not long ago, has folded its tents and slipped away. Perhaps not an inspired vehicle for M. Foucret's début as cinema proprietor, it has no Paris listing as far as your correspondent can learn. It has been replaced by a picture entitled \\"Terre de Volupté,\\" presumably a worthy successor, in the true Moulin Rouge tradition.The first French \\"cent-per-center,\\" \\"The Three Masques,\\" has quit the fine new Marivaux-Pathé, and is now to be seen on a weekly schedule about the city. And \\"Noah's Ark,\\" which reached here with much sound and fury only the other day has taken the same itinerary, now being shown in two boulevard houses.Among the newcomers this week is a picture which slipped very unobtrusively into the Paramount—where a picture plays generally only a week—and had a press surprisingly minute in comparison with the publicity it had in America. \\"Has had,\\" one might say, speaking of the play as well as the film—\\"Abie's Irish Rose.\\" Here it is called \\"Mon Rabbin chez Mon Curé.\\"Reviewers, even though probably unacquainted with \\"Abie's\\" almost classic tradition in America, took it very well. The homely little story was recounted in detail by some critics, who led Paris to feel that here was an American picture which, if slightly banal, was not offensive.Since it is the holiday season, when theatre owners hope to pack the people in, your correspondent may be permitted to mention Chaplin again, always \\"sure fire\\" with the Paris public. No less than twenty-three Paris cinema houses are billing their beloved \\"Charlot\\" in various pictures this week.The sensation of the moment has taken the place of \\"The Three Masques\\" at the Marivaux. It is a German film called \\"Prisoners of the Mountain,\\" an extraordinary document of Alpinism, a tragedy unrelieved, whose central figure is nothing less than a mountain range. Against the cliffs, the crevasses, the avalanches and the glaciers of this forbidding monster a few mortals pitifully cling, grope and struggle in a vividly rendered human tragedy which serves only to enhance the grandeur, the cruelty, the fatality of the mountain itself.The north face of Mont Palu is inaccessible save for the very hardiest of mountaineers. It rises towering above the hospice on the plateau, challenging all ardent Alpinists, among whom is Dr. Jean Kraft. With his bride and a guide he starts the ascent, secure in his prowess and strength. They reach a point where it is necessary to cross a deep crevasse. The wind in a certain quarter worries the guide, who fears the mountain's possibilities. The Alpinist lowers his bride down the crevasse, where she descends with perfect confidence. Then an avalanche tears loose upon the three.The doctor's grip is secure on the rope. He smiles, proud of his own capacity to meet this situation and of his bride's trust in him. Then he draws his hand up aghast. The rope has parted, short off.The crevasse is bottomless. Somewhere, far below, under icy torrents and smooth arabesques of ice and rock, the bride is entombed. Superhuman efforts fail to find her or her body. She is—for eternity—a prisoner of the mountain.Several years pass and the story picks up with the arrival at the hospice of a young engaged couple. It is the fourth anniversary of the death of Dr. Kraft's bride. The hospice door blows violently open, and he is standing on the sill, a brooding, tragic figure.The three, next morning, start the fatal ascent. Step by step the climb is pictured, true mountaineering, clambering with pick and spiked boots against the face of icy cliffs. The wind, again, is bad. The young engaged man insists on taking the lead from the experienced Kraft, and falls. His companions' ropes hold him, dangling over a precipice. But when Kraft rescues him, a boulder loosened in a minor fall of snow, cracks the leg of the older man. Kraft straps himself up in splints made from alpenstocks. The younger one has been injured too, a bad blow on the head, which Kraft binds.There is nothing to do but wait for help to come. The cold, the hunger, the monotony, the wind pile up the suffering. Four days pass, during which the young mountaineer goes crazy. The rescue comes when the flier Ernest Udet—a flier by the way whose repute is not of the cinema but of reality—discovers them. When guides arrive, after a stirring search by torchlight among the crags and ice ravines, they find only two. Kraft has dragged himself away, to join his bride in the icy fastnesses.The picture is finely acted by Gustave Diessl (Dr. Kraft), Leni Riefensthal and Ernst Petersen (the young couple). It is the mountain itself, however, which takes the precedence. Every phase of its varied life is shown, the wind-blown summits, the warming of the sun, the avalanches that sweep like torrents down its flanks. There is some beautiful photography, particularly in scenes where the rescue parties set out by night from little hamlets in the valleys, and in the rare shots of Udet's plane among the cliffs.With such films as this, as \\"Simba,\\" \\"Chang,\\" and \\"Grass,\\" for instance, the place of the silent picture may be held—in France, at least—for some time.
