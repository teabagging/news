More than a third say their travel and entertainment expense accounts are getting greater scrutiny. With good reason, apparently: more than a third believe it is either ''somewhat'' or ''quite'' common for business travelers to submit expense accounts with ''one or more completely false or bogus charges.'' But most road warriors also disapprove of such fraud. Those in the United States expressed the strongest support (77 percent) for careful audits of expense reports and receipts, while 72 percent in Britain agreed, as did 70 percent in Germany and 64 percent in France. For all their stepped-up vigilance, companies do seem to be loosening up on restrictions against traveling in style. In a survey conducted by the National Business Travel Association and the Travel Industry Association of America, the proportion of corporate travelers who reported their employers restricted the class they could travel on fell to 50 percent last year from 56 percent in 2002. The decline reflected a better economy and ''a departure from severe travel restrictions'' put into effect after the 2001 terrorist attacks, the survey said.    UPGRADE UPHEAVAL -- As turmoil churns through airline elite-status programs, with many top-level members complaining that upgrades on major airlines have become more elusive this year, Continental Airlines is changing its upgrade policy to favor those who pay the highest coach fares and check in earliest online. Effective March 16, Continental said, priority for upgrades will be given to OnePass elite members traveling on full economy fares, based on elite status and time of check-in. Next in line will be those traveling on fares less than full economy, with priority based on elite level, then fare paid, and then time of check-in. The policy for companion travelers accompanying Platinum Elite members also is changing. Companion upgrades will be sorted by the status level of the elite member and by the time of check-in. For instance, Continental said in an e-mail message to its elite members, passengers accompanying a Platinum Elite member will be upgraded only after all other Platinum Elite members have received upgrades.

The original title of the collection &#8212;or, rather, selection&#8212;when it appeared in 1935 was &#8220;Time: The Present,&#8221; and so alive is Tess Slesinger's voice that she makes her times, which were intensely important to her, seem present again to us, dwellers in a very different decade. Yet Tess Slesinger died of cancer in 1945, at the age of 39. She had been considered one of the more promising young writers of the 1930's (as well as &#8220;one of the most personable,&#8221; according to &#8220;Twentieth Century Authors,&#8221; with &#8220;a smile as vivid as her literary style&#8221;) on the basis of her stories and her one novel, &#8220;The Unpossessed.&#8221; (Alas, it is out of print.) But the last 10 years of her life, spent writing screenplays in Hollywood (&#8220;The Good Earth,&#8221; &#8220;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&#8221;), did not live up to the rough promise of the novel or the more finished brilliance of her best stories. A lesson in carpe diem if there ever was one. But such times of silence in a writer's life often bear riper fruit, and premature death is cruelest when it decrees barren what may have been time of growth and gathering forces. Tess Slesinger left notebooks that suggested she meant to get back to fiction and I believe she would have, in her forties, and further that she would have outgrown the slight tendency to mannerism and the bright and strenuous consciousness that occasionally mar her early fiction. We'll never know. Reviewing her gives me a particular sense of futility because in her writing she is so very much alive.

President Bush talks about the possible need for a United States offensive that would be justified under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter -- help to Kuwait. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d goes to Moscow, where he reportedly gets qualified support for the use of force. First puzzle: Why do both State Department spokesmen and journalists fail to explain the important nature of Soviet qualifications?   Article 51 sanctions only interim measures until the Security Council acts. If Iraq attacked Saudi Arabia, Article 51 would cover immediate war to defend Saudi Arabia. But after 10 Security Council resolutions, no one in his right mind could read Article 51 to justify a United States attack to liberate Kuwait as an interim response to a Kuwaiti cry for help.   The Security Council having taken the Kuwait invasion aboard, the Soviet Union insists that any use of force should conform to Article 47, which very clearly requires that \\"the Military Affairs Committee under the Security Council\\" should be \\"responsible for the strategic direction\\" of forces carrying out any agreed action and that the command structure should be determined by agreement.   So my puzzle is: Why is there no national debate about what kind of strategic direction and command structure would be acceptable? Best answer I can think of is contempt for legal niceties: we've got the military clout and the responsibility. What can the enfeebled Soviets do about it?   Is that reassertion of hegemonic status and world-policeman responsibility wise? No way would the Russians or the Chinese accept the Bush Article 51 argument. And in the resulting dispute only the precarious Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (and maybe, after six days, Japan) would support the United States. In Europe, France, Germany and Italy -- and perhaps a majority in the British Parliament -- would side with the Russians. Perhaps the Lone Ranger really should think about becoming sheriff.   Second puzzle: Why is all the talk -- in the home and heartland of escalation strategy -- only about an all-out offensive? United Nations action -- if it really were consensual action -- could well take the form of a graduated ultimatum.    Step one, for example: We sink one of your warships or destroy one of your airfields every two days until you get out of Kuwait.

PRODUCER: Doak, Carrier, O'Donnell, Wilkinson, Goldman & Associates (English)","excerpt":"Mirram Global (Spanish).    ON THE SCREEN: The English-language spot begins with a series of black-and-white photos showing Mr. Ferrer's mother and grandmother, followed by pictures of the candidate as a child, as a college student and as a young public official, in one image gesturing before a graffiti-covered wall, in another scrubbing graffiti from a wall of the Bronx County Courthouse. Moving from Mr. Ferrer's past to point toward the future, the ad then switches to a series of live-action color segments. First comes a pastiche of parents and students with an image of apartment buildings. Then there is Mr. Ferrer, pointing out tidy homes, chatting with a man inside a school, talking to students on the street.    The Spanish-language ad has a more casual, intimate feel, with views of Mr. Ferrer, wearing a tie but no jacket, speaking to a group of students in a dimly lit classroom, with vintage images of Mr. Ferrer's family and young political life interspersed.    THE SCRIPT: In the English-language ad, a narrator speaks as music swells gently in the background. \\"Raised by a single mother and his grandmother, who worked in the kitchen of the Waldorf,\\" the narrator begins. \\"As a boy he shined shoes to help the family. With the help of scholarships, he worked his way through N.Y.U.''    \\"As borough president, he helped build 66,000 affordable houses and apartments and began the turnaround of the Bronx. Now with costs in the city skyrocketing, he'll be a mayor who understands. Building housing families can afford and keeping more kids in school. Fernando Ferrer,\\" the narrator concludes. \\"For all of us, for a change.\\"    In the Spanish-language version, Mr. Ferrer tells his own story, emphasizing the same themes of working his way up into public service and helping to create housing as well as schools and \\"more peace in the streets.\\"    \\"That is the New York that we are going to build when I am mayor,\\" he concludes. \\"Housing for our families, schools that graduate our kids.\\"    ACCURACY: Mr. Ferrer grew up in a struggling household in the South Bronx and pulled himself into the middle class. After decades of devastation, the Bronx has been reborn through a combination of immigration, private investment and a flood of public money. Mr. Ferrer became borough president in 1987 and was part of that recovery, but his role has always been debated, with other city officials and community groups frequently receiving the credit.    SCORECARD: Both ads effectively tell Mr. Ferrer's life story and hit his main campaign themes: that he is in touch with ordinary New Yorkers because he understands, from his own experience, their need for affordable housing and better schools. Carefully calibrated to show images of Mr. Ferrer with whites, blacks and Latinos, the ads also sell what the campaign sees as his qualifications to run the city and champion the middle class.

The index is simply the result of adding monthly unemployment figures with the year-to-year percent change in the Consumer Price Index. A rough but easily grasped gauge, it was devised by the late Arthur Okun, then a member of President Johnson's Council of Economic Advisers. Although many analysts discount it as a true indicator, politicians seem to hold the index in somewhat higher esteem: In the last two Presidential campaigns, candidates Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan both invoked it to measure the public's discontent with economic conditions.

President Reagan, anticipating the release today of the October unemployment figure, has already given notice that the rate is likely to go ''a few fractions'' of a point higher.   But the memory of inflation also appears to have played a role in voters' blame of the incumbents for the state of the economy.

Last year, the Health and Environment Subcommittee, headed by Representative Henry Waxman, Democrat of California, seriously considered a measure that would have banned candy cigarettes as well as the chocolate cigars many new parents now hand out instead of real cigars. The sponsors argued that even look-alikes glamorize smoking and encourage children to develop a real tobacco habit -- though there's scant evidence to support that linkage.   The candy industry complained that it would be unfair to bar its products when real tobacco is legal. So the provision, part of a larger anti-smoking proposal, has now been narrowed to apply only to look-alike packaging, not the sweets inside. The revised version forbids packaging that \\"bears a resemblance\\" to \\"a tobacco product trademark.\\"   That's progress. But over the next several months, the National Candy Wholesalers Association, as well as health groups and tobacco companies that support the measure, will spend hours debating whether even the new language is too broad.   It's not worth it. Consumption of candy cigarettes and cigars will promote tooth decay and defeat a balanced diet. But if the remaining issue now is trademark infringement, and present laws in that area are inadequate, why burden the health committee?
