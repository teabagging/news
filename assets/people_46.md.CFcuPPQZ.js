It would be a grave injustice, however, if we neglected to give some thought to more long-range measures. The State Department of Social Services recently released a report that gave a thorough and comprehensive review of the problem of homelessness. One of the most startling facts is that close to 40 percent of the sheltered homeless previously lived independently in their own housing units. The marked decrease in the state's low-income housing stock is thus a contributing factor in the growth in the ranks of the homeless.Along with a number of advocacy groups, including Catholic Charities, the Community Service Society, the Coalition for the Homeless and the S.R.O. Tenant Rights Coalition, I believe that the loss of single-room-occupancy dwellings in particular can be linked to the growth in the number of homeless.

A1 NEWS SUMMARY"},{"year":"1990","title":"In the quiet of a weekend morning when the deserted downtown is theirs, a group of homeless men and women lolled in the shadow of a skyscraper, chatting and enjoying the day's handouts of cigarettes and coffee with extra cream.    But the moment was broken when an outsider appeared and asked for Oliver, one of the homeless men.    \\"They need you in wardrobe,\\" the outsider said, directing Oliver to a trailer to exchange his New York Yankees cap and T-shirt for a tired black jacket.   Art and real life met and intertwined one recent day in downtown Los Angeles, where the downtrodden from the local skid row have been employed as actors and crew members in an independent film that addresses the issue of how to help the homeless.    The film, \\"Jeremiah Pollack: The Life of an American Saint,\\" is a fictional tale, shot partly in documentary style, about a computer whiz with a social conscience who tries to fight homelessness.    Not wanting to shirk social responsibility, the producers recruited homeless people for the project. Nine of the 15 main roles in the film, as well as those of extras, are held by homeless people. In addition, three were taken on as production assistants with the promise that they will receive financial help to rent apartments when filming is completed.   The collaboration has given wide exposure to an underground artistic community here that includes homeless writers, poets, actors and painters. Among the performers and extras in the film are members of the Homeless Writers Coalition, which gives poetry readings, and Project Return, a downtown improvisational comedy troupe for the mentally ill.    The producers said they included the homeless, who are paid nonunion wages, because they believe it would have been wrong to use only professional actors when they knew of locals with performing talent. There was also the belief that hiring the homeless for exciting jobs might inspire some of them to continue working.    \\"These are people accustomed to failure,\\" said L. C. Edwards, a former homeless man who works as a counselor for a community group that recruited and supervised some of the homeless actors.    \\"This is something they can say, 'I was a part of,' \\" Mr. Edwards said. \\"It gives them a sense of worth and demonstrates that they can succeed at something. Then maybe they can succeed at something else.\\"    The venture also offers the homeless a taste of celluloid immortality, a heady experience for social pariahs who live anonymously in parks and shelters.    \\"The performances are pretty amazing,\\" said Eames Demetrios, the film's writer and producer. \\"Some of them are playing themselves, typecasting, but not as much you would think.\\"   While Mr. Demetrios deems the experiment a success, the collaboration has raised the same prickly issue that confronts Jeremiah Pollack, the film's protagonist and computer programmer who tries to end homelessness.    \\"In the movie he reprograms automatic teller machines to dispense money to the homeless, but some of it is spent on drugs,\\" said Tim Disney, the executive producer, who is a great-nephew of Walt Disney. \\"In making the film, we were faced with the same dilemma.\\"    Mr. Disney said three people employed as production assistants had to be dismissed when it was found that they were spending their earnings on crack.    \\"This is the question we all face: does money solve the problem?\\" Mr. Disney said. \\"The lesson we've learned is, you need to help people, but they have to be ready to help themselves.\\"    Mr. Disney says he has high hopes for Flo Hawkins, the 54-year-old set designer.    Ms. Hawkins, a painter whose works have been included in a homeless art show sponsored by the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, once held a steady job as a commercial artist. She landed on the streets and lived in a park after encountering financial problems and being in several bad relationships. Now, with the film makers' support, she plans to leave the shelter where she lives and find an apartment.    \\"Everybody has the potential to better themselves,\\" she said.

Among nearby homeowners, Nassau County's plan to build a new sludge-treatment facility on an 80-acre site surrounded by the 191-acre park is viewed as a menace to their way of life and the value of their homes.\\n\\n\\"This is extremely scary, but nobody is listening,\\" said Thomas Vogel, a retired New York City police officer who has lived for 27 years on South Cedar Street in Seaford. \\"For the safety of my grandchildren, I want them to find a different location.\\"\\n\\nResidents within a six-mile radius, which includes communities as far north as Levittown, west to Merrick and east to Massapequa Park, are concerned about a county proposal to add a sludge-drying facility to an existing sewage-treatment and sewage-dewatering plant within Cedar Creek Park.\\n\\nWith Long Island struggling to comply with stricter state and Federal rules on garbage and sewage disposal, the Cedar Creek controversy is one of the more recent disputes over whether alternatives to existing measures will themselves pose a threat to health or property values in surrounding communities.\\n\\nResidents of Bay Park, Oceanside and East Rockaway are opposing a similar plant proposed for Bay Park, which also has an existing sewage-treatment plant. The Bay Park and Cedar Creek plants process 95 percent of the county's sewage.\\n\\nThe Cedar Creek proposal \\"hasn't affected real estate values yet, but I think it will,\\" said Maryann Lana, an owner of the Lanthorne Realty/Anne Steel brokerage in Merrick. \\"We already have buyers who have flatly refused to buy in areas that could be affected.  What we do is give people a sheet to make them aware of what's going on.\\"\\n\\nThe two new facilities, called pelletization plants, would heat sludge -- the residue left when sewage has been treated and dewatered -- to high temperatures to reduce it to dry pellets, which can be trucked out and sold for fertilizer.\\n\\nOpponents say such plants should not be built near residential neighborhoods because the process releases toxic fumes containing lead, arsenic and other components, and that there is also a risk of explosions and chemical fires. County officials say that emissions from the proposed plants would be well below state and Federal standards, and that fire hazards are negligible. \\n\\nThe need for alternatives to existing sewage disposal methods -- which in Nassau have consisted of barging treated sewage 106 miles out to sea and dumping it -- stems from a 1988 Federal law banning all ocean dumping of sewage and sludge by the end of this year. Interim measures can be taken, but permanent solutions must be in place by 1995. For the interim, the county will be dewatering and trucking all its sludge out of state by the end of the year, which is already being done at Cedar Creek. \\n\\nBecause of time constraints, the pelletization proposal in Cedar Creek and Bay Park was the only \\"viable\\" way to meet Federal requirements for a permanent solution, said Francis X. Merklin, Nassau's Senior Deputy Commissioner for the Department of Public Works. But Irving Shaw, the Mayor of East Rockaway, said his proposal to barge sludge to an existing pelletization plant near Baltimore went unheeded.\\n\\nThe county's $140 million, two-plant proposal, approved by the Board of Supervisors in March, still needs the approval of the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, which is now studying it. \\n\\n\\"What we object to is an experimental process in a residential area that will pollute the air we breathe,\\" said James Beldner of Wantagh, a lawyer and co-chairman of a group called Scare -- Stop Cedar Creek and Recover Our Environment. He also said there would be no way to safely evacuate residents and children at nearby schools in an explosion and chemical fire. \\n\\nLate last month, he and Scare sued Nassau County and its Board of Supervisors in State Supreme Court in Mineola, charging that the county had not complied with the State Environmental Quality Review Act. Among other things, the county has not considered the cumulative impact of all three sewage treatment facilities at Cedar Creek, said Stefanie Brand, a lawyer with Gordon & Gordon of West Orange, N.J., which is representing residents.\\n\\nA SIMILAR suit was filed July 25 by seven people representing residents of Bay Park, Oceanside and East Rockaway and their group called Hope -- Homeowners Opposed to Polluting the Environment. \\"Our argument is not so much a cumulative argument as much as it is a segmentation argument,\\" said their lawyer, Lawrence A. Ceriello of Melville. \\"You can't divide the action into small pieces and say no piece really has a significant effect.\\" \\n\\nOne of the 18 accusations in his petition, for example, is that the county did not consider property value depreciation. Although residents of affected communities say they are concerned primarily with health and safety, they also fear property values will plunge if the plants are built, said Albert Kalastein of Bellmore, a candidate for the Hempstead Town Council. \\n\\n\\"We put our whole life into our house, but I'm not going to jeopardize the safety of my children, and the day the plant goes through, I for one will put my house on the market,\\" he said. A financial planner with two children, he estimated that his house, now worth $500,000, could drop 30 percent in value. \\n\\n\\"Our priority is health and safety, but the economic concerns are there,\\" said Alicia Steger, president of the Bellmore/Merrick Homeowners Association and a founding member of Scare. \\"We might be digging our own graves with all the publicity, but you have to make a choice. We could be very self-serving and keep all this hush-hush, but public awareness is the only thing that lets public officials know how you feel.\\"\\n\\nBut real estate agents who have dealt with similar problems elsewhere said the public's memory is short. Sixty days after the Three-Mile Island nuclear plant accident, sales in Shoreham, where a nuclear plant was under construction, were back to normal, said Linda L. Albo, a broker in Rocky Point.\\n\\nLast summer, when the Port Washington dump, which is now closed, started to smell, the first thing people asked was, \\"What about that dump?\\" said Elizabeth Farriella, a Roslyn broker. \\"But since January, with the publicity over, nobody has mentioned it.\\" In the Region: Long Island","excerpt":"Homeowners Protest New Sewage Plans"},{"year":"1958","title":"Greenwich residents protest plan to let United Aircraft estab indus plant SITE IN GREENWICH FOR PLANT FOUGHT","excerpt":"Homeowners Protest Plan of United Aircraft -- Zoning Hit in New Canaan"},{"year":"1963","title":"SI residents protest establishment of Daytop Lodge, Tottenville, 'halfway house' for rehabilitation ADDICTS RESENTED ON STATEN ISLAND","excerpt":"Homeowners Protest State Rehabilitation Center Councilman to Act"},{"year":"1971","title":"homeowners, Lindsay and Deputy Mayor Aurelio score action","excerpt":"homeowners remain divided into 2 groups over compromise plan; Lindsay links death of plan to pol deal between Battista and Duryea; illus Divided Corona, Foiled on Horne Compromise, United Only in Anger"},{"year":"2006","title":"Homeowners are redesigning and organizing their garages, making designer garage latest suburban status symbol","excerpt":"homeowners spent $800 million on garage organizing products last year, double amount spent in 2000 and amount spent on garage makeovers is expected to rise by 10 percent per year for rest of decade, making garage oranizing one of fastest growing segments of home improvement market; as Americans accumulate more and more goods, three-car garages become too stuffed with junk to hold cars; photos (M) After $12,000, There's Even Room to Park the Car"},{"year":"1975","title":"NYC Planning Comm holds hearing on special zoning protection for large part of Riverdale sec of Bronx as greenbelt","excerpt":"homeowners support proposal but several educ insts oppose designation; Sister Doris Smith, pres of Mount St Vincent, says college would be adversely affected by inclusion in special dist; Brother Gregory Nugent, pres of Manhattan College, also opposes special dist and Horace Mann‚ÄêBarnard School asks that its grounds be excluded from proposed dist (S) ZONING PROPOSAL STIRS RIVERDME"},{"year":"1958","title":"WHEN aerosol-type insect \\"bombs\\" were first invented during World War II, no one envisioned the hundreds of new products which these self-contained spray bombs would soon be dispensing.

As it is, Mr. Brusati's film requires a lot of deciphering, and plenty of patience, too. Whatever secrets lurk beneath this pretty and bewildering surface, they feel like more trouble than they're worth. Mr. Brusati offers extravagant amounts of smoke, but no evidence of a real fire.\\"To Forget Venice,\\" which opens today at the Little Carnegie, has a solemn, pretentious air that marks quite a departure from Mr. Brusati's previous effort, the far more effervescent \\"Bread and Chocolate.\\" A group of people, whose family connection is extremely puzzling, are reunited at a large country house where at least a few of them were raised. There, they confront memories of their past and in some ineffable way prepare to face the future.They see images of themselves as small children, and dance the tango. Then one of them dies, and the others are dispersed, and the house's sole remaining occupant eats a life-affirming picnic lunch. Freeze-frame and finale.The occupants of the house include two homosexual couples, Nicky and Picchio (Erland Josephson and David Pontremoli) and Anna and Claudia (Mariangela Melato and Eleonora Giorgi). Also in the group is Marta (Hella Petri), an aging opera star whom the others call Aunt Marta, although it is one of the film's lesser ironies that she is nobody's aunt.Marta and Nicky, who are brother and sister, must have had a traumatic upbringing, since they are such unhappy adults. But neither the setting nor the frequent flashbacks cast much light on the source of their troubles. Everything wrong with Anna, on the other hand, can apparently be traced back to her blowsy, sexually ravenous mother, also played by Miss Melato in one of the film's very few funny episodes. Miss Melato, a gifted comedian, spends most of her time here experiencing an anguish that the audience can never quite fathom. Mr. Josephson's principal task is to beam with wonder and amazement each time an impish ghost of Nicky as a small boy breezes by. Both of these fine actors give earnest, energetic performances that are undermined by the film's generally baffling tone.Mr. Brusati's fondness for self-important claptrap reaches its pinnacle in a flashback involving young Marta, a crystal ball, and a cast of masquerade characters with names like Wealth and Beauty, dressed in outfits that would be excessive even on Halloween. The rest of the film is more subdued, very handsomely photographed, and only occasionally given over to shots of glistening, dripping leaves in the forest and similar window-dressing.The film's occasional earthiness may help it hold the interest of a docile audience, but when it comes to the characters' sexuality, Mr. Brusati is at his most unclear. Heterosexual sex is made to seem grubby and disgusting","excerpt":"homosexuality fares no better, since it appears to be the principal factor in the characters' arrested development. Perhaps Anna and Claudia have simply been together too long, though, after 20 years. And maybe it's the duration of their love affair that holds them back, and not its sexual nature.Perhaps Nicky is merely hiding from himself by staying with Picchio, a much younger man. Perhaps the senile housekeeper is right in proposing that everyone bring galoshes to Venice ‚Äî a trip that never takes place, and does nothing to explain the title, by the way ‚Äî since Venice is full of water.

In 1997, Hong Kong will revert to the control of China, and the British colony is already on edge with every twist and turn in China, as shown when the stock market plummeted 22 percent after Tiananmen Square.

The Russians agreed -- with great reluctance, officials said -- to serve under the nominal control of the allied commanders of each sector where they will operate, but they reserved the right to refuse to carry out orders.

A1    New Political Players  Private investigators are playing a larger role in the public arena, digging up dirt on people like regulators, elected national and small-town officials. Their reports are usually aimed at discrediting or disposing of their clients' critics or opponents, but they are also used defensively, to find and avoid potential embarrassments. And their ranks are increasingly being joined by ex-journalists, who can tap old news contacts to get negative information published.   A1    Gore, Bush and Female Voters  Al Gore is trailing George W. Bush among women, despite a determined effort by Mr. Gore and his campaign to appeal to female voters. Advisers suggest that Mr. Gore may be a casualty of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, though the Vice President himself rejected that notion in an interview.   A13    Democrats are talking up the idea of Mr. Gore naming a woman as running mate. But who?   A13    Plan to Lift Appalachia  President Clinton, visiting eastern Kentucky, presented a package of proposals intended to increase investment in the idle coal fields, which have largely been bypassed by the prosperity of the 1990's. The plan would use Federal tax credits and loan guarantees to induce private companies and investors to build plants and stores.   A10    Election of Church Leader  The United Church of Christ, a 1.4 million-member denomination that traces some of its roots back to the Puritans, elected as its president the Rev. John H. Thomas, 48, who is widely known for his work in ecumenical relations. He succeeds the Rev. Paul Sherry.   A11    Plea in Maryland Slaying  A Maryland teen-ager pleaded not guilty in an Israeli court to murder charges arising from a 1997 killing in Maryland. The teen-ager, Samuel Sheinbein, 19, did admit to dismembering the victim's body and burying it. But his lawyer challenged the prosecution to prove that Mr. Sheinbein had actively participated in the killing with a friend, who committed suicide in a Maryland prison before his trial was to begin. Mr. Sheinbein, whose father was born in Israel, fled to Israel, whose Supreme Court ruled that he is an Israeli citizen and therefore could not be extradited.   A13    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-7    Record Heat in Region Will Linger a Bit Longer  The temperature hit 101 degrees in Central Park, a record for a July 5, according to the National Weather Service on Long Island. In Washington, it was 102 degrees, 100 in Philadelphia and Newark, 99 in Atlantic City and 94 as far north as Portland, Me. The heat index, which considers temperature and humidity, registered 110 degrees or more across the region for most of the day. Forecasters said the high temperatures could last through tomorrow, before a cold front settled in.   A1    Third Party Candidate?  Lowell P. Weicker Jr., 68, left, the former Governor and Senator from Connecticut, is being courted by strategists for Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota to seek the Reform Party nomination for President. And Mr. Weicker is interested. Ross Perot has not announced his intentions.   B1    Fireworks Injuries  City police and fire officials said the holiday was marred by several injuries caused by illegal fireworks.   B3    Doctors Cite Company Abuses  Three years after New York State enacted the Managed Care Bill of Rights to combat abuses by managed care companies, a survey of city doctors suggests that many of those abuses not only continue but in many cases have grown worse.   B5    SCIENCE TIMES   F1-8    New View of the Dolphin  Scientists are discovering that dolphins are far from happy, peaceful creatures. Unlike most animal killers, which eat their prey, dolphins seem to have murderous urges unrelated to the need for food.   F1    Witches, Aliens, Sleep Disorder  A growing number of scholars believe sleep paralysis -- a brief but intense condition in which the brain seems awake but the body cannot move -- may help explain ancient reports of attacks by witches and modern claims of alien abduction.   F1    A Case for Rogue Planets  Several Earth-like planets, created billions of years ago during the formation of our solar system, may be wandering in deep space harboring conditions that could sustain some form of life, a prominent planetary scientist theorized.   F1    Health & Fitness   D5    SPORTS   D1-8    Jeter to Start on the Bench  Nomar Garciaparra of the Boston Red Sox edged out Derek Jeter of the Yankees as starting shortstop for the American League All-Star team.   D1    American Yields Yellow Jersey  Lance Armstrong of the Postal Service team gave up the Tour de France overall leader's jersey to Jaan Kirsipuu, an Estonian.   D1    BUSINESS DAY   C1-9    Hostile Oil Bid in Europe  Total Fina announced a hostile bid for Elf Acquitaine worth nearly $43 billion, setting off the third big takeover battle in France this year, this time in the oil industry. Elf, a refiner and chemicals conglomerate, denounced the offer and lined up investment banks to plot its defense.   C1    Phone Merger Talks  Qwest executives gathered in Denver and Manhattan to begin preliminary and separate merger discussions with executives from both Frontier, the long-distance telephone company, and U S West, the regional Bell company.   C1    Sign of Optimism in Japan  The Bank of Japan's quarterly assessment of business sentiment showed that the perception of business conditions among more than 9,000 executives who responded in June was still negative, but improving -- within the range of estimates by economists. The Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks rose 1.13 percent yesterday, but slipped in morning trading today, down 11.21 points at noon, or 0.1 percent, to 18,123.85.   C4    Oil Prices Top $18 a Barrel  Crude oil rose above $18 a barrel in London for the first time in 18 months on continued signs that OPEC was cutting output. Major stock indexes in Europe showed gains, and the dollar was stronger, as well.   C8    Business Digest   C1    OBITUARIES   A15    Wallace E.

Something special in the look and way of the people, the more relaxed pace of life and the natural beauty of the place belie the superficial resemblance of Honolulu to any other city.

As her quest to learn more was publicized, surviving members of her husband's unit contacted her to say that Captain Reed deserved a commendation for the Mekong Delta fight, in which exposed himself to enemy fire to help aim his unit's return fire. Ms. Reed pressed the claim, but the Army rejected it because Captain Reed's commander, who had been pinned down in another battle at the time, failed to immediately recommend a citation. After several appeals, Ms. Reed contacted William D. Clark, a deputy assistant secretary of the Army, who subsequently overruled the boards that had denied Captain Reed a medal.

It was a sense of honor, conceived as part of a military culture that also embraced the values of self-sacrifice and unswerving courage, that drove American boys into Nazi fire and onto the Normandy beaches. The same values were the guarantee and the bedrock of postwar security and prosperity in Western Europe.

Thousands refused meals to protest cuts in services. Correction officers went on high alert. The nation's largest jail complex braced for a riot. But the explosion of New York City's nearly 20,000 inmates never happened. This year, slashings and stabbings by inmates have declined sharply as jail officials herald an era of relative peace. A1. HANGING 10 COLD ONES ON LONG ISLAND   Forget Malibu. Forget about Hawaii's renowned Banzai Pipeline. The national surfing circuit has discovered Long Island. This weekend, at what its organizers billed as the first professional surfing contest around New York, dozens of surfers came to Lido Beach, on Long Island's south shore, to try to capture a share of $5,000 in prize money. The problem was that the waves didn't quite follow them. A1. NEW YORK CITY  THE LATEST FEUD: GIULIANI-MCCALL   In his 16 months in office, Mayor Giuliani has had no shortage of high-profile skirmishes, whether with the Schools Chancellor, the Public Advocate or with fiscal monitors. But his current rift with the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, stands apart for its intensity, drawing some of the harshest criticism by -- and of -- the Mayor. The feud came to a boil after Mr. Giuliani suggested that the city stop financing the section of the State Comptroller's office that monitors and comments on New York City's finances. B3. TALKING TRASH, AND TALKING MONEY   Why is New York City so dirty? That question was posed in this space five weeks ago, in an article with photographs of some of the city's filthiest places. In response, several readers and city officials have tried to explain why New York is not as clean as, say, Paris. As they see it, money is, as usual, the largest part of the problem: People flout rules to economize, and budget cuts impede government's efforts to stop them. That is not to say that nothing can be done. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick, B3.

AGE AND SANITY CATCH UP WITH A KILLER   Since his mother died a decade ago, only a few people have continued to visit Howard Unruh, the most infamous of the 303 criminally insane patients held in New Jersey mental hospitals. One visitor is his lawyer, James H. Klein, the public defender who has represented him since 1976. Mr. Klein describes his 73-year-old client as a timid man who could be mistaken for someone's grandfather. B5. 2 DIE OF PNEUMONIA AT NURSING HOME   Two people have died of pneumonia and 12 others have developed pneumonialike symptoms at the Nathaniel Witherell Home, a municipal nursing home in Greenwich, Conn. Plans for some Mother's Day visits were canceled, and the 35 residents living on the home's fourth floor were quarantined to prevent the further spread of the disease. During the last two weeks, 14 residents on the floor have suffered respiratory illnesses with symptoms including fever and congestion. B6.

His offense seems to have been that as State Motor Vehicle Director he refused to do favors for politicians and their friends. The excuse advanced is that he has not practiced law for the last nine years. Since that was a period in which he engaged in public service in New Jersey, the excuse is a shabby one.

Bernstein, who would have been 75 last Wednesday, was the music world's most openly emotional, self-revealing, culturally omnivorous figure. Those qualities suffused his conducting and his own works, to say nothing of his books, his lectures and his television shows, particularly the \\"Omnibus\\" and \\"Young People's Concerts\\" that made him a kind of musical father figure for the generation that grew up in the 1960's.    So it was very much in the spirit of his expansive personality that the celebrations spilled out of the concert halls and into the streets and parks. And it was wholly in character that the main event -- an Alice Tully Hall concert on Wednesday, organized by the conductor's family -- was broadcast live in Japan and by tape delay in Germany, with an American showing scheduled for Sept. 9 at 9 P.M., on the Arts & Entertainment cable network.

Where the majority of jazz musicians onstage simply perform their music without bothering to place it in a historical or stylistic context, Mr. Taylor provided annotation that was useful without being labored.
