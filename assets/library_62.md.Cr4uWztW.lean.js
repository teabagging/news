The lush blacks of Mr. Kitajima's images, which were initially published in a book and only recently printed, bring to mind his friend and mentor Daido Moriyama.

Some are hard-working immigrants whose faces loomed close to Mr. Kitajima's lens as they hurried along the street. Others are celebrities (Mick Jagger) or soon-to-be celebrities (the young Madonna, when her face still had pores), drag queens or denizens of the Mudd Club or CBGB's.

Wolford made $700,000 last year","excerpt":"Kelly makes $2.864 million a year.   Ralph Cindrich, Wolford's lawyer, negotiated a deal with the Colts over the weekend that included this clause tied to the team's record: He would be paid at least as much as the Colts' highest-paid offensive player.   Wolford then took that offer, which calls for Wolford to average $2.6 million a year over three years, and showed it to the Bills, who had seven days to match it. But the Bills' highest-paid player on offense happens to be Kelly, the quarterback hauling down an average of $2.9 million a year. Did this mean the Bills would, in order to match the Colts' deal, have to pay an offensive lineman as much as their star quarterback?   The league yesterday said no. Cindrich said yes.   The league's management council and the Players Association will fight it out before an arbitrator at a hearing tomorrow.   \\"If this is disallowed, it's discrimination against offensive linemen,\\" Cindrich said.   But that wasn't the only flurry of N.F.L. activity yesterday. In addition, the Cleveland Browns reunited those former University of Miami quarterback rivals, Bernie Kosar and Vinny Testaverde, by signing Testavarde as a backup for what the Browns described as a one-year deal plus an option year.   The 29-year-old Testaverde had wanted a $2 million-a-year deal. He is believed to have signed with the Browns for a base salary of about $1.4 million this year. The contract is heavily laced with options that could swell to more than $2 million.    Art Modell, the Browns' owner, said the team doesn't expect to move on Carl Banks, a linebacker who two years ago asked the Browns to make a deal for him with the Giants. Banks still expects to leave the Giants, and Alan Herman, his agent, said he expects at least one club to make an offer early next week. Since Banks is a transition player, the Giants would be entitled to match that offer and retain him. Coach Dan Reeves says the Giants will compete with any offer he receives.

Make that blimp, singular.   When the landmark skyscraper was built in 1931, it was indeed designed as a blimp terminal. The balconies surrounding the top of the building's 16-story metal finial, now the 102d floor, were equipped to secure and dock the dirigibles as well as to house ticket stands and loading docks.    After the building was opened on May 1, 1931, and its mooring mast declared safe, it took four months before a blimp actually moored there. On Sept. 16, 1931, The New York Times reported that a small privately owned blimp had docked for all of three minutes before taking flight. (This was after it circled for a half-hour in 40-mile-per-hour winds, attracting quite a crowd of gawkers and tying up traffic below.)    Two weeks later a Goodyear blimp dropped a bundle of newspapers, but it failed in an attempt to dock in near-perfect conditions the next day, according to the forthcoming Encyclopedia of New York City (Yale University Press, 1995).    After other docking failures, the mooring tower was abandoned in favor of a safer, more profitable venture: sightseeing.  Lurking for 114 Years   Q. I often run in Central Park and I notice a strange black carving of a big cat (a cougar, perhaps?) crouched above the East Drive at about 76th Street. It's partly hidden by trees, there's no pedestal, and sighting it unawares can give you quite a chill. What is its history? A. The bronze kitty is called \\"Still Hunt.\\" It was created by the sculptor Edward Kemeys, and Parks Department records show it has been scaring the Spandex and its predecessor off joggers and skaters since 1881. Kemeys's inspiration to sculpt animals came while he worked as an ax man with the Parks Department's corp of engineers in the 1860's. He traveled around the United States in search of indigenous beasts to sculpt and places to put his works.    His special talent seemed to lie with felines. \\"Still Hunt\\" depicts an American mountain lion","excerpt":"Kemeys's two majestic African lions guard the Art Institute of Chicago's gates. That Mystifying Hum   Q. There's a walled compound on Avenue A between Fifth and Sixth Streets that mystifies me. It looks like some sort of power plant (and it hums!), but there are no signs identifying it, and I never see anyone coming or going. What is this place?   A. Your instincts were correct.   The compound is a Con Ed substation, one of 14 in Manhattan that distribute power generated at larger plants around the city, Bruce Wittmer, a spokesman for the company, said. Electric power is generated at very high voltages, which are gradually decreased to allow for use in homes and businesses.    The substation, at 502 Sixth Street, receives power from the East River Generating Station, on 14th Street, and feeds it to the surrounding area.    Some substations are also used by meter readers and maintenance workers, Mr. Wittmer said, but Sixth Street apparently sees little human traffic, a sign that it is doing its job.   As usual with city infrastructure, you only hear about substations when they aren't doing their job. The last time they were in the news was August 1990, when a fire at the South Street substation cut power to most of lower Manhattan and parts of the subway system. Subway Map as Art   Q. Who draws the subway map? I love its weird pseudo-Cubist crunching of New York geography. (For instance, the Harlem River ends up twice as wide as the East.)  A. Since 1992, the Transit Authority has used C.A.D. programs to draw and redraw the map three to four times a year, said David Jenkins, of the authority's marketing department. The computer version is based on a 1979 map that was hand drawn by a graphic designer, Michael Hertz. Mr. Hertz said the distortions were inevitable to fit the finished product into subway car map frames. The result: a massive Manhattan, a widened Queens, a shrunken Brooklyn, and a squat Bronx.

Lee and Larry Olmstead of The New York Times to discuss the candidates and the issues in Tuesday's mayoral election and their feelings about life in New York. The participants were Melissa Woronoff, 20, a college student who divides her time between the Bronx and Manhattan","excerpt":"Ken Shung, 39, a free-lance photographer who lives in Manhattan; Jerolyn J. Minter, a retired college professor who lives in St. Albans, Queens, and Roger D. Fields, a \\"40ish\\" Harlem resident and the senior vice president of the United Block Front Street Association, a program in which ex-offenders build housing.   What follows are excerpts from their discussion.   What things are most important to you when you look at the quality of life in the city?    ROGER FIELDS: No. 1 is crime, which, as an African-American, is very, very on my mind. And No. 2 is affordable housing. When one talks about upgrading and upper mobility in any community, it must be a safe community. And once you build housing, that housing, which may be comfortable and affordable, has to be in a safe neighborhood.   JEROLYN MINTER: I agree with much of what you're saying, but I think when you put things in order of priority, it's not crime first. Crime is an offshoot of something that I think is more deeply rooted. Attention to education and educational standards, economics, housing -- all are built upon the first fundamental, and that's learning how to understand someone who is different from you that you have to live next door to or in the community right adjacent to yours.   FIELDS: Well, I don't tend to agree with you. When one talks about empowering different ethnic groups, those communities must first have safe streets and must have affordable housing before one can no longer feel stressed. And one gets angry because one sees that one group is getting more than another group, which also causes division.   No. 2, if we talk about education standards, when you develop affordable housing and affordable home ownership, then those communities become mixed and those educational standards become more active, because the community is not monolithic nor mono-economic.    Melissa, what's your idea of the key areas?   MELISSA WORONOFF: Well, I would agree with Jerolyn. I would also add not only race but also class and religion. And I think that's what's great about New York City, but it makes things hard at times. I mean, to get those things to work out, that's really the starting point and then other things will follow.   KEN SHUNG: My concerns with the city have to do with crime. I think the real issue for me is, like, who's raising our kids? When there are two functional parents in the house, then you can maybe have the next generation of people that would want to not resort to crime. I just feel that you've got to start at home. If parents don't spend time with their children, then there's no love. When there's no love, the children don't grow up with any kind of sense of responsibility and moral obligation.   MINTER: I have a concern when I read statistics that come past my desk, that eight out of 10 African-American children are going to be brought up in single-parent families.  What is going to happen to that poor mother who's going out working, trying to support that child. And she has to put that child in a daycare center if she doesn't get home until 5, and that daycare center or that school program is not going to be able to give them the kind of structure that they need. When they look and see Mama struggling to pay the rent and buy food, and on the corner is this drug dealer who has diamonds and is driving cars, what's going to happen? What happens is that person becomes the role model.    WORONOFF: I think it's interesting that there certainly are a lot more single-parent families today. But I think what needs to happen is that both our city and the country need to acknowledge that families are changing and need to accommodate for that, rather than try to change it.   What can the mayor of this city, whoever is elected, do about any of these issues? What are they really responsible for?   MINTER: They're responsible for selecting the people who are going to take care of the various city agencies and monitoring them. I would make sure these people are knowledgeable, decisive, have some humanist to them and are in contact with the needs of the people.   FIELDS: I would fire every single commissioner in the City of New York; that's the first thing I would do. The second thing, I would go to people who have grown up in this city, understand its problems, are not political. I would want my commissioners to be responsible to me, not to the Democratic or Republican or whatever leader placed them there.   MINTER: I have come to realize that in our society we aren't willing to give people time enough to bring about change. You can't come in and change things in four years that have been messed up for the last 12.    FIELDS: Wait a minute, Jerolyn, are you trying to tell me things were messed up in the last 12 years before David Dinkins became Mayor? This Mayor, he has more nepotism than any other mayor in the history of this city. He appoints Joyce Brown deputy mayor -- who happens to be married to Carl McCall, the person the Mayor appointed to the Board of Ed. He appoints Victor Gottbaum to the Board of Ed, and his wife to being Parks Commissioner. I can go on and on and on. I think that this Mayor has shown no leadership. I think this Mayor has gone to traditional clubhouse politics and has not reached out to the community. I think the city was much better four years ago than it is right now.   Who else wants to jump into that?   WORONOFF: I think the country was better off four years ago than it is now. I mean, the economy was better. When the economy goes down, you know, crime does go up. We have more homeless people. Fewer people have jobs; more people are being laid off. I wouldn't place that blame on Mayor Dinkins.   Ken, are you better off than you were four years ago?   SHUNG: Oh, what a question. I guess -- I don't know, I haven't been that alert in the last four years. Do I feel more fear when I walk down the street? I do.    The accusation has been that the Mayor panders too much to blacks. And that Mr. Giuliani has pandered too much to whites. Then the President came in and said that there are too many people in this city who are unwilling to vote for people who are different from themselves, be it because of race or religion.   SHUNG: Anyone who suffers from any kind of discrimination might find truth in that kind of statement. I think people go into the voting booths after all is said and done, and get very tribal and start to, like, push the lever they feel they can identify with.   FIELDS: I think that everywhere you go there are going to be people who are racist. But I think people are concerned about issues. And President Clinton, I thought, made an inappropriate statement which caused the campaign to become even more racially oriented than it is.    What should the Mayor do to build bridges to racial harmony?   MINTER: I believe that Mayor Dinkins has been systematically trying to build those bridges here in New York, initiating programs all the way toward bringing this into fruition.    FIELDS: In reference to Mayor Dinkins's leadership in building bridges, I did not approve of the way he handled Crown Heights. I did not approve the way he handled the Korean boycott. I did not approve of the way he dealt with the Washington Heights situation with the drug dealer, in which my tax dollars were used to bury him. I think when you build bridges, you build them in an objective and corrective manner. I think, unfortunately, in this campaign, no one is building any bridges.   MINTER: In terms of Giuliani, I don't think that he would be building bridges. He has set a tone with his activities that, to me, is negative and divisive. I will vote for David Dinkins, because I believe in his dream.   FIELDS: Well, let me tell you something. I'm not going to vote for David Dinkins. I'm going to vote, this ex-offender, this African-American, is going to vote for Rudolph Giuliani. I think his record in reference to civil rights when he was United States Attorney shows his concern. I don't see Rudy Giuliani as a police monster.   Tell me about welfare.   MINTER: To eliminate the high numbers of people on welfare, you have to improve the economic situation. You have to provide training for people so that they can fit into the economic arena for jobs. For mothers who have to work, you have to provide the services that will care for the child while the mother is in training on a new job. You have pockets of this happening. It's not happening across the board in large numbers because you're looking at money. Where do you get the funding for this?    FIELDS: You've been doing it for 30 years, and it hasn't worked, the social scientist's philosophy. This is this old liberal philosophy that has kept our community behind. We need to inform people very candidly. If you have children out of wedlock continuously, you are going to be punished. We must stop people from having six children from six different fathers.    No. 2, we cannot reward people because of the fact that they do not wish to work. I agree with you, we must provide jobs. But those jobs must be provided with the partnership between private industry and the government. The government cannot continue to absorb and create these make-believe jobs and cost taxpayers more money. Now the welfare system rewards you.    What is it that the mayor can and should do?   FIELDS: He should have an aggressive, aggressive program of finding fathers who are not paying. We need to have these people who are on temporary income maintenance, these Aid to Dependent Children, and these Workfare people actually participate in training and working and placed in private enterprises. We need an aggressive program like that. And Mayor Dinkins doesn't have that program.   MINTER: He has started some of these programs.    FIELDS: He hasn't started -- the only thing he has started is sitting there and playing tennis at Gracie Mansion.   WORONOFF: I would say that as far as welfare is concerned, we need to have programs that fit the people's needs, rather than programs that lead people into who we want them to be. If there are single mothers with children, then we need some sort of daycare for these children while the mothers learn the skills that they need to go out and work. We need support for our community members out there.   We're talking about ethics and values. What can any city administration do to affect values -- let's say, the homeless problem?   SHUNG: Well, those policies should not polarize people and put them on the margins of society. I think people tend to think: \\"Well, not in my neighborhood. Or not in my backyard. Or I'll just retreat and it won't happen.\\" What happens is, they'll be sitting in a public school, or even a private school. And the child that grew up on welfare, that value system will be in the same classroom as your child who had maybe a nice upbringing, and those values will cross. This is a problem that America has to confront, that our value systems, whether you're rich or poor, and those class distinctions, are eventually going to cross paths.    MINTER: You know, another concern is health care. I think that a lot of women, particularly pro-choice women, may not be inclined to vote for Giuliani, because he has gone back and forth on the issue of abortion. I think that taking a stance on abortion is really taking a stance on women and how highly you value them.    FIELDS: Well, people are going to vote for David Dinkins, who at one time was not pro-sexual preference, and that's become pro-sexual preference.    WORONOFF: I'd also say that Giuliani's issues on homelessness and his 90-day policy is something that people are going to be looking at.    FIELDS: I think what he was talking about was that bureaucracies tend to drag their feet. And what he was saying was, \\"Within that 90 days, I want that person placed.\\" I think he was using the concept that the Rev. Calvin Butts and the Abyssinian church do in Harlem, that you come to the shelter for a short period of time. And the first day you're there, you begin to look for employment and permanent housing.    Is the city doing enough?    SHUNG: To deal with homeless?  The city is not doing enough. I think I don't even look for Mayor Dinkins to solve the world's problems. I look for him to start moving in the right direction, to build the bridge instead of break it down. . . .    MINTER: I'd like to tell you, I have not voted for Mayor Dinkins because he was black. I voted for him because I thought he was the best person to do the job. I'm proud of him because he happens to be an African-American. I feel that he sets a good role model for African-American children, who can look and say: \\"I can aspire, too. And doors will not necessarily always be closed to me.\\" But I think he is a man, a human being, trying to do what I would like to see done in this city.   FIELDS: Well, I will tell you, it took a lot for me not to vote for him this time.   Because of race?   FIELDS: Because of race. It was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever made in my life. . . . You know, it's interesting, because you have such diverse people here. Here I am, supporting a relatively conservative candidate. And here are some of the traditional people who you would think would support a more conservative candidate, supporting a liberal candidate.   And what I'm hearing over and over is that we're all saying the same thing. Who would be the best mayor to take care of the quality of life and show compassion? We're all saying, who's going to show more compassion? All of us sitting here who are employed or have some income are saying we're concerned about those people who can't take care of themselves.

Relying on Robert Kennedy's book \\"Thirteen Days,\\" Mr. Lewis gives the conventional account of the October 1962 confrontation. However, new evidence suggests that this version of how the crisis ended is misleading.   A key to resolving the crisis was United States willingness to remove intermediate-range Jupiter missiles from Turkey, basically as a quid pro quo for the Soviet removal of missiles from Cuba. According to \\"Thirteen Days,\\" Robert Kennedy spoke of the Turkish missiles to the Soviet Ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin, on Oct. 27, 1962, telling him that President Kennedy had \\"ordered their removal some time ago.\\"   Hence, the United States agreement to withdraw the missiles from Turkey as a way to end the crisis was not a concession -- because the missiles should not have still been there.    However, in \\"Essence of Revision,\\" by Bruce J. Allyn, James G. Blight and David A. Welch in International Security (Volume 14, Number 3, winter 1989-90, pages 136-172), there are reasons to doubt this version of the missile swap. According to Mr. Dobrynin, Robert Kennedy never said the President had ordered the removal of the missiles in Turkey. And Theodore Sorensen (page 164), who edited \\"Thirteen Days,\\" has stated that while the diaries on which that book was based depicted the missile deal as an explicit trade, \\"he had seen fit to revise that account.\\"   Clearly, the events of October 1962 offer important historical lessons for the conduct of international crises. However, it is crucial that those interested in drawing such lessons base them on all the available evidence and not on selective or self-serving accounts.
