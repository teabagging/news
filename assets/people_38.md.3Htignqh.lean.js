The vogue reached its peak at about the time of the First World War, lingered during the Depression, briefly revived in the 1930's and, after the war, went the way of privately owned railroad cars. Two things about YACHTS IN A HURRY: An Illustrated History of the Great Commuter Yachts (Norton, $40): The text by C. Philip Moore (himself the former owner of a commuter boat, the Saga) is buoyantly well written, miles removed from the technical cant one might expect in a 200-page book given over to describing one boat after another. Second, the introduction, written by Robert B. MacKay, the director of the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities, is sheer joy. His narrative of what the commuter boats were expected to do and did do could not have been improved upon by the writers of \\"Saturday Night Live.\\": \\"Typically, owners were picked up at their docks or from their yacht clubs, often clad only in their nightgowns since they waited to don their business attire on board. It appears, however, that there were many variations in routine. . . . The sons of James D. Mooney . . . remember that their father would walk to the end of his Center Island dock in Oyster Bay promptly at 7:30 A.M. clad only in his bathing suit. Captain H. R. O. Johnson . . . would already have the twin Liberties purring aboard Rosemarie . . . and Mr. Mooney's mail and the daily papers already on board. Halfway down the sound toward Manhattan, Captain Johnson would cut off the engines and Mr. Mooney would take an invigorating morning dip before dressing for work.\\" I mean, the whole scene would have been worth a book by Uptown Sinclair, fun reading en route from Seawanhaka to the New York Club to 23d Street, plowing serenely over the rippled sea.\\nWilliam F.

State leaders edged toward a first-step solution, negotiating to buy power on long-term contracts at reasonable prices, then pass it on to the state's near-bankrupt utilities. The state would float bonds to finance the deal, perhaps in exchange for receiving utility stock that could be sold to repay the cost once the market rebounded. Consumers would also pay through an extension of recent rate increases. But officials warned that a crash program to conserve energy and finish construction of new power plants would still be needed to avoid blackouts at times of peak demand this summer.   Todd S.

Numerous political scientists agree with the diagnosis that news coverage has made Congress a more decentralized and less disciplined place than it used to be.   But the conventional wisdom is wrong, at least in the Senate, according to Stephen Hess, a longtime observer of the Washington press corps who has tracked the coverage of every senator by the three networks and by five major newspapers for one year. His conclusion:   Instead of becoming more diffuse, news coverage of the Senate focuses increasingly on a relative handful of recognized leaders.

Made in England by Coronado, with Mr. Montgomery at the directorial helm as well as in possession of the leading role, it tells a fetching little story of an American lawyer's willful attempts to take a hand in the administration of English justice and save an innocent friend from a murder rap.In this pursuit and by virtue of a moderately well-written script, contrived by Hugo Butler and Ian Hunter (with a dialogue assist), its most entertaining accomplishment is the build-up of humorous give-and-take between the headstrong and resourceful American and the administrators of English law. The American, played crisply by Mr. Montgomery, finds it hard to understand (and so do we) why a rumored missing witness to the alleged murder has not been found by the police. And his natural and heated vexation at the deviousness of country cops and the formalized customs of English law courts makes for the fun in the film.It is in these aspects of the picture that the amenities of English craftsmanship come through, with the atmosphere of quaint provincial living nicely got in the English studios. Especially does Felix Aylmer as the judge at the murder trial contribute much charm and humor. His grudging tolerance of the intruder from overseas, whom he endeavors to discourage with witticisms, is completely enjoyable. Leslie Banks, too, is effective as the squire and high sheriff in these parts who blends his politeness to the American with an amusing amount of British phlegm.As for the plot—a minor matter in which the American, by sleuthing, contrives to turn up the missing witness (and a surprise she is!) just in time—this is a bit less English than it is straight Hollywood, and no one accustomed to American thrillers will be much aroused by it. However, Mr. Montgomery plays it with relish and style and brings off his coupe de courtroom with conventional and acceptable éclat. A pretty young English actress by the name of Patricia Wayne assists him in romantic fashion. Other members of the cast are helpful, too.As usual in films about courtrooms, this one takes liberties, we sense, with the rules of English procedure. But we gather no great harm is done.

LIVESTOCK IN CHICAGO; CATTLE SHEEP"},{"year":"1994","title":"IN the Po Valley, about halfway between Florence and Venice, Bologna lies in a sort of buffer zone between the olive oil country and the butter culture where animal fat reigns supreme and the pig is king. This is a hard act to keep going nowadays. Traditional recipes are being rediscovered all over Italy, yes, but they are being rehabilitated, too. Extra-virgin oil has replaced lard, and pesante (heavy) is the worst name you can call a food.    So where does this leave Bologna the Fat (the city's best-known epithet), which has waddled its way into gastronomic history with the plumpest sausage, the richest meat sauce and the heftiest repertory of stuffed pastas on the entire peninsula? The answer seems to be: a bit out of favor but still setting standards for foods and ingredients that Italians will never give up entirely. On a recent weekend trying restaurants in Bologna's medieval center, we aimed first to sample the most famous traditional dishes at the source, but also to explore something of the alternatives. Ristorante Diana    It is generally agreed that if you can't wangle an invitation to someone's house, this is the place to taste the classic dishes. We joined about 150 hungry Bolognesi and a few assorted foreigners for lunch on a rainy Sunday to do just that. The restaurant's two large rooms were closely packed, and the cloakroom perilously close to the trays leaving the adjacent kitchen at high speed. Bustling doesn't even begin to describe the atmosphere, but hectic would be unfair.   The menu has two parts: traditional dishes and daily specials. The latter included some seasonal offerings (funghi porcini), but also a great deal of what seemed designed to provide a little relief to family members accompanying conservative older relatives. For example, strozzapreti, a regional pasta, with salmon -- not traditional, and, until the last few years, not even Italian. The traditional menu is short -- the Bolognese repertory is dense, not extensive, and stronger in the primi piatti, or first courses, than in meats and vegetables.   Our surprisingly delicious appetizer of spuma di mortadella was decidedly not the usual bologna. It was a pate made of mortadella sausage, the true bologna, and served with dainty white toast. We sampled lasagne verdi (my favorite food on earth), tagliatelle with ragu (the authentic, and only, Bolognese meat sauce) and the lighter but no less traditional passatelli in brodo, short, fat strings of a paste of bread crumbs, Parmesan and nutmeg cooked in broth. All were worthy specimens, the lasagne juicy and tender, with a ragu-bechamel ratio distinctly in favor of the meat sauce. Our main courses were served generously from a trolley, one for bollito misto, the other for roasts.   Desserts included excellent homemade ice cream with hot chocolate sauce and a very nice torta di riso (a slice of dense, not overly sweet rice cake). Our wine was Sangiovese, a local red, chosen from the limited list. Pappagallo    As a graduate student in the early 1970's, I discovered early on that some of the best restaurants in Italy were conveniently situated near important archeological museums. And so it was that I had an excuse for a pilgrimage to this restaurant, justifiably considered to offer the finest cuisine in the queen city of food. But soon after, a series of changes in management and reputed decline began, and I did not go back until recently, when a Bolognese friend convinced me that it was time to try it again.   The restaurant is in the same beautiful place, a medieval building on a small, historic piazza, and the parrot (pappagallo) on the sign is the same. Inside, however, the rather cold results of a 1980's renovation -- higher ceilings, brighter lighting -- have forever done away with the happy coziness that tempered Pappagallo's elegance. In addition to a bar, there are two spacious dining rooms, one hung with rows of showbiz photographs, in which we recognized no one. What we found was good food in an attractive restaurant, but the little extra touches in both ambiance and cuisine that might have brought back the former greatness were largely missing.   The menu is varied: In addition to the (not exhaustive) list of classics, there is fish as well as other modern, low-calorie offerings (smoked swordfish, veal fillets with capers and balsamic vinegar). But on our first evening in Bologna we wanted tortellini in brodo and lasagne verdi, which the waiter divided into half-portions so we could share with dignity. (Tortellini, small meat-stuffed rings of pasta, are properly served only in broth","excerpt":"practically an object of cult worship to some people, they are eaten all over Italy on Christmas day.) We gave both dishes high marks, but they turned out not to be the best we tasted in Bologna.    My companion then tackled a satisfying fritto misto al Pappagallo. Despite the proprietary name, this was pretty much what is called fritto misto all'italiana everywhere else, a local standby consisting of deep-fried vegetables, including a small mountain of julienne-sliced zucchini, and a small amount of meat, as well as some sweet pieces -- chunks of fruit and custard. My filetto di tacchino (breast of turkey with prosciutto and cheese) was good but heavy (that word), and its garnish of out-of-season peas was a touch of so-called international cuisine we could have done without. Again, we chose the local Sangiovese wine, but this time from a more extensive list.   I'd advise skipping the unexciting antipasti to leave room for the desserts. We loved the crema liquida con biscottini -- liquid custard with little cookies -- and sorbetto (more of a slush) of lemon and vodka.  Trattoria da Gianni    This archetypal trattoria makes no attempt to provide lighter alternatives, and to judge by the happy faces of the many local patrons who fill it, nobody cares. Neither did we; we loved it. Even the musician who came in off the street was delightful -- a young woman who played Renaissance and Baroque music on, respectively, tenor and alto recorders.   We began with a voluptuous slice of polenta dripping with melted squacquerone, a very soft, very fresh white cheese, and then tried two of the same dishes we'd had at Pappagallo -- tortellini in brodo and fritto misto all'italiana -- giving them rather higher marks. The tortellini were more succulent, the fritto misto more exciting (and slightly larger -- we shared it), with even more components, such as tiny deep-fried skewers (on toothpicks) of fresh ham and also a chunk of brains (a canonical ingredient). We also tried the inspired tortelli (large, square ravioli) stuffed with a chestnut puree and sauced with butter, transparent little rings of leek and lots of Parmesan -- which the chef, Loredana Brusori, grated exuberantly directly onto the plate and everything else in sight. Many of the other diners were tucking into the bollito misto, and the offerings also included a slab of baked ham and lepre (hare) alla cacciatora.    Only the desserts were disappointing. We chose what seemed the most unusual option, apple souffle (not made to order), but its crown of several inches of meringue was rubbery. We should probably have stuck with homemade creme caramel. We never saw a wine list -- the choice seemed to be Sangiovese or Lambrusco, the region's other famous red, lighter and slightly sparkling. We took the Lambrusco. Torre de' Galluzzi    The most interesting meal of our weekend, in the most beautiful setting, was here, in a 13th-century tower that belonged to one of the medieval city's great families, but now is the least typically Bolognese of the restaurants we tried. The ambiance is elegant but not forbidding. The main dining room, dominated by a magnificent fireplace, is large, and there are two attractive private rooms. The eclectic choices include tasting menus: vegetarian, traditional (but not overwhelmingly), fish and fiorentina alla Toscana (the celebrated Tuscan steak). Since we were accompanied by our local friends without whom we would never have discovered this gem, we ordered a la carte and shared.    All the dishes used fresh, subtly flavored ingredients, skillfully handled and light, until we reached dessert. From the fish menu we sampled steamed cannocchie (mantis shrimp), green ravioli stuffed with scorfano (scorpion fish), scampi (langoustines) with julienne artichokes, and turbot filets in a tart lemon sauce. Vegetarian choices included an exceptional zuppa di farro (spelt), orecchiette con cime di rapa (a quintessentially Puglian pasta, reflecting the owner-chef's origins) and a marvelous main dish of simply grilled vegetables and cheese. Ravioli stuffed with potato (yes!) with a light sauce of tomato, sausage and diced eggplant came from the traditional menu, while scaloppine of calf liver with pine nuts and raisins was unclassified. Our Bolognese friend, who has written a book on matching foods with the right wine, chose a white Sardinian Vermentino from the excellent list.   The splendid desserts included a grape tart with lemon gelato, an individual carrot cake, an exciting apple mille foglie (millefeuille) with Calvados, and a crepe filled with melted taleggio cheese and sliced pears, drenched in Marsala sauce, about which I am still having unseemly dreams. Osteria del Sole    Fat is not Bologna's only epithet. The city is also called the Learned and the Red (for both its politics and its buildings), and this tiny wine shop, founded in 1468 and practically unchanged since, is a favorite haunt of underfed leftist intellectuals from the even older University of Bologna. They are kept company by wine enthusiasts of various girths and credos, with or without academic credentials. The Fat does not apply since the only food consumed is from the patrons' own brown bags at centuries-old communal wooden tables. Seriously, since it is physically impossible to eat more than one Bolognese meal a day, a place to go at noon and evening to observe a very typical local scene in a historic setting -- but not eat -- is a useful thing to know. But if you're feeling hungry, there are a number of hedonistic food shops within a stone's throw where you can buy prepared dishes or cold cuts to carry in and eat with the glass or bottle of fine wine or even Champagne that you have ordered at the Osteria. WHAT IT COSTS    Prices are for full meals for two with a moderately priced bottle of wine, calculated at a rate of 1,500 lire to the dollar. With the exception of the Osteria del Sole, all the establishments accept credit cards.   Torre de' Galluzzi, 5A Corte de' Galluzzi; (051) 267638. Closed Sunday. A la carte for two, about $100.

The crooked lanes largely free of traffic, the pastel-colored houses with crumbling facades, the glowing street lamps that illuminate their little patch of street and no more, the scent of burning coal in the crisp night air -- all evoked an image of what Central Europe must have been like in its pre-World War II days. The knowledge that the city's charm had not been orchestrated by capitalist tourism officials or had succumbed to the mediocre tastes nurtured by 41 years of Communism amplified the marvel. \\n\\nBut more than two years after the Czechs and Slovaks showed their Communist leaders the door, and elected the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel to the Presidency, tremendous changes are under way. Not so obvious to short-term visitors is the economic misery of the country's 15 million people, who are struggling to manage fast-rising inflation with wages that have gone up little or not at all. Immediately evident, however, is that Prague, and the whole country, is trying to spruce itself up, putting on fresh coats of paint and setting up touristic conveniences -- like newspaper stands with postcards and stamps -- that make the city more welcoming. New neon-lighted money exchange shops stay open until midnight, and the country's first McDonald's opens in a few days. In the eyes of many Czechoslovaks, these are signs of progress in the race to join the West. But to some Westerners, it was the very shabbiness, the artful neglect that made Prague so special.

Why do they bother—in time, trouble and money—to make such junk? Secondly, Anthony Quinn is good in anything. No wonder the guy owns two \\"Oscars.\\"At any rate, the bare hands of Mr. Quinn literally hold together this threadbare, unconvincing little melodrama from Twentieth Century-Fox, costarring Debra Paget and Ray Milland. Written by Harold Jacob Smith and James Leicester and produced by Benedict Bogeaus (in color, for some reason), the film has an upstanding prairie farmer accompanying his restless young wife and her killer boy-friend on a flight toward the Mexican border.Most of the action, or dialogue, centers on these three persons, as they drag across the Rio Grande terrain. The lady's paramour emerges as the snake of all time, and conveniently sails off a cliff. The reunited couple finally go poling down a river. The End.The trouble is that none of the principals, or the motivations, manages to be credible. Even Mr. Quinn's talent can't overcome the abrupt foolhardiness of his farmer characterization. The two other protagonists—and Miss Paget and Mr. Milland are capable players—are hopelessly outlined. Incidentally, Allan Dwan directed.The tip-off occurs in the careless opening scene, when an escaping bull flattens Mr. Quinn like a locomotive. The camera then pulls in for a close-up of the battered actor and the comforting Miss Paget. The churning bull is forgotten—not even one backward glance. Whatever became of him?

But they can't fool the professionals in the audience, the fashion press and retailers who know what's exciting when they see it.         Of course, when the clothes get into the stores, the customer won't have the  music to distract her or influence her. And if all she wants is a great pants suit, a long coat and a turtleneck sweater to take her through the winter, she will find plenty to choose from. And she will be in step with fashion, if not ahead of it.
