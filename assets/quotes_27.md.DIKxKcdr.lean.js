Even so, the display of woodcuts by Arthur Wesley Dow (1857-1922) more than holds its own -- as well it might, for Dow was a man intoxicated by color and well before the advent of Orphism and its American counterpart, Synchromism.   One reason the artist's work has not attracted comparable attention from historians may be that, drawing inspiration from Japanese prints, he expressed his chromatic ideas in landscape, rather than in abstractions. And though he took a \\"holistic\\" view that encompassed the decorative arts, he was primarily a printmaker. Yet as a teacher and writer he exerted considerable influence -- Georgia O'Keeffe, Max Weber and Alvin Langdon Coburn were among his students -- and did much to further the American branch of the Arts and Crafts Movement.
