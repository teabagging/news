Columbia's \\"The Young Don't Cry,\\" with Sal Mineo, James Whitmore and J. Carrol Naish in the principal roles, is suprisingly admirable on so many counts that it would be a pleasure to report a solid \\"sleeper.\\" It isn't. However, when this low-budget drama turns up at the neighborhood showcases, stay, if such is the case, for the second feature.Richard Jessup's adaptation of his novel, \\"The Cunning and the Haunted,\\" filmed in the Georgia swamp country, shows some subtle forces for good and evil working on the mind of a confused but spunky orphan, at the orphanage itself and during his casual visits to a near-by chain-gang. The fade-out, after a killer-convict forces his aid in a futile marshland escape, finds the lad entering the outside world minus some dog-eat-dog resolutions.The absolute, picturesque Southern authenticity, which director Alfred L. Werker and his camera man, Ernest Haller, have imbued with semi-documentary flavor, sits atop the entire little picture like a moss-covered halo. If the simple, direct plot never attains real stature or power, it never succumbs to flaring melo-dramatics (even during the climactic chase), as could have happened about every ten minutes or so. A viewer might also wonder why the young hero, Mr. Mineo, would be so frustrated to bust loose from an orphanage resembling a happy, comfortable work camp. Likewise, what about Mr. Whitmore's fatal lunge from a far from brutal chain gang?This plot weakness detracts continually from the professional tenseness that both actors convey. But it is the very unstereotyped surrounding characterizations, dialogue and human touches along the way that strengthen Mr. Jessup's first film script (and may we have more).Some of the scenes, actually vignettes, remain haunting, Take one where a visiting millionaire, to his wife's disgust, sadistically squelches a hopeful orphan boy. Or another, where a Negro woman stoically buries a dead Negro convict in the woods. (These four people are excellent—in order, Gene Lyons, Roxanne, a lady from television","excerpt":"Ruth Attaway and Leigh Whipper.)Mr. Naish is fine as the laconically violent prison overseer. So, too, are Paul Carr, as a sullen, older orphan, and Thomas Carlin, as his slick, opportunistic counterpart. It's not always easy, in fact, to distinguish the professionals from the real Georgians—a score or so were used. It is a high compliment indeed for an interesting picture, whose components never quite attain its rightful sum.

De Mille's latest photo-dramatic effort, \\"Something to Think About,\\" came to the Criterion Theatre yesterday afternoon. This time Mr. De Mille has gone to the country for his story, but he has not plastered \\"homely virtues\\" and \\"plain people\\" all over it, for which, at the outset, let him be thanked, no matter what sins he subsequently commits.The principal characters of the photoplay are a sturdy village blacksmith, Luke Anderson, splendidly played by the unfailing Theodore Roberts","excerpt":"Ruth, his daughter, interestingly and, in the main, effectively developed by Gloria Swanson; David Markley, their wealthy city-bred neighbor, who is described as \\"a philosopher,\\" apparently because he does not believe in God and must be converted, but who, nevertheless, is often human, because of Elliott Dexter; and a husky young countryman called Jim Dirk, who is made genuine in the person of Monte Blue.David Markley enters the story as its philanthropist. He persuades the blacksmith to let him send Ruth away to school, and when she returns, polished and grown up, he naturally falls in love with her. He is a cripple, however, and does not declare his love until the girl, prompted by her father, volunteers to be his wife. The engagement is immediately settled—and then Jim Dirk, not rich, but also not lame, comes forward. He, too, is in love with Ruth, and she cannot turn away from this vigorous and active young male animal to the crutch-dependent Markley. The tug is between her human instinct and the conscious obligation of gratitude and a promise. Instinct wins.The story is real up to this point. Mr. De Mille and his players succeed in making it something to think about. Through dramatic scenes in climactic continuity the full force of a situation that derives its strength from life is developed—and the outcome is what it has to be, not what some theatrical mechanic might like to make it.But how should the story so on? It shouldn't. When Ruth runs away with Jim Dirk it is finished. It has said what it has to say, and anything it may add is bound to be nothing to think about. But, like those after-dinner speakers who refuse to shut up and sit down when they are through, the story must continue to the end of its six or seven reels and like them bury its living body under a mass of lifeless verbiage. Why must the movies always do it? Some after-dinner speakers don't.Jim and Ruth go to the city. Ruth's father asks God not to let him see her again and he is immediately blinded by red hot sparks from an iron he is hammering. Jim is killed working in a subway excavation. Ruth returns to her home in rags. David, disillusioned and bitter, marries her, more from his habit of kindness than anything else. Jim's baby is born. Ruth (now the grand Gloria of earlier De Mille productions) loves David, but he is still bitter and still doesn't believe in God—and everything is every way it oughtn't to be in well regulated fiction until David's housekeeper suggests prayer to put things right and miracles begin to happen. David loses his bitterness and lameness at the same time and goes to Ruth's outstretched arms, while Jim's little boy leads his reconciled grandfather over the hill from the poor-house to the home of happiness restored.All this may be impressive to some, and if so, let them be impressed, but its effect upon others is unmistakably indicated in the overheard exclamation of a woman, neither frivolous nor cynical by nature, who said impulsively, at the story's most ecstatic moment, when David was about to drop his crutches and reveal the miracle of his new-found love and strength. \\"Look what stunning patch pockets Elliott Dexter has on his coat.\\"When everything is said, however, it must be added that Mr. De Mille is a maker of motion pictures. Whether they mean anything or not—and many of them do—they are works of cinematorgraphic skill. In the first part of \\"Something to Think About,\\" they vitalize the story, and in the latter part they serve to compensate somewhat those spectators whose boredom would otherwise be unrelieved. Also they permit the omission of many subtitles, which is especially good, because those used do not, as a rule, make one wish for more like them. Praise and blame for the authorship of the story must go to Jeanie Macpherson.Another melodrama of the frozen north, with realistic storm and snow scenes and virile, if not always convincing, acting, and plenty of plot with interesting marjonettes for characters, comes to the Capitol this week as Rex Beach's \\"The North Wind's Malice.\\" Tom Santschi, Edna Murphy, Jane Thomas, Walter Abell, William H. Strauss, and Vera Gordon, the sterling Jewish mother of \\"Humoresque,\\" all make their roles real for moments, but all of them, except possibly Santschi, are too camera-conscious at times, and they are too definitely determined by the story's mechanical procedure ever to be real for long. They all suffer through the interference of a diaphanous figure called Malice, but it is hard for the spectator to be accommodating with his sympathy when he knows that the spirit will not be such a malicious Malice as to spoil everything irrevocably. There's bound to be happiness to go around in the end.The picture was directed by Carl Harbaugh and Paul Bern.Also on the Capitol program is an amusing Hy Mayer Travelaugh, \\"Such Is Life In and on the Water.\\"\\"Harriet and the Piper,\\" with Anita Stewart, is the photoplay at the Strand, and \\"Behold My Wife\\" has moved from the Rivoli to the Rialto, while \\"The Restless Sex\\" has gone from the Criterion to the Rivoli for the week.

On Thursday ''THE O.C.'' returns for its fourth season (Fox, 9 p.m.), picking up the story five months after Marissa died in Ryan's arms and Mischa Barton left the show for that great movie career in the sky. High school is over, Ryan (Benjamin McKenzie) is bartending, Seth (Adam Brody) is working in a comic book store and Summer (Rachel Bilson) is starting her freshman year at Brown, where she's a particularly perky environmental activist.

(Think ''steel cage.'') And in its 40-plus minutes it manages to pack in many of the essential ''O.C.'' tropes: Ryan must be searched for, Summer must prove herself and Seth must rescue his true love (the one that dare not mumble his name). The jump-the-shark arguments may have started before this series was 10 episodes old, but it's still the most operatic teen drama on TV.    Just as pessimistic but much more adult is ''CRACKER: THE NEW TERROR,'' a new installment of the British series starring the great Robbie Coltrane as the troubled criminal psychologist Edward Fitzgerald (BBC America, 9 p.m. Monday). Fitz returns to Manchester after a long absence, just in time to get involved in the case of several murdered Americans. The mystery is solved against a backdrop of news reports about the violence in Iraq, and the solution involves linking the current occupation with Britain's earlier woes in Northern Ireland. Even more than most British shows, this one exhibits what can seem like a casual and thoroughgoing anti-Americanism. That might prevent some viewers here from enjoying the drama, but it can't obscure the quality of Mr. Coltrane's performance in a role that has been continually copied since he created it in 1993.

Sage, a penetrating literary critic who died in 2001, tells of her chaotic coming-of-age during the 1940's and 50's in north Wales, and later just across the English border, where her family struggled at the bottom of the heap of the British class system. Her bickering grandparents, in particular, bestowed an internal freedom on her that molded her sensibility. In this memoir, chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2002, ''she has created a soulful narrative from the humble cloth of her own experience,'' Mary Hawthorne wrote here.    VIOLENCE, NUDITY, ADULT CONTENT, by Vince Passaro. (Simon & Schuster, $13.) William Riordan is a Manhattan lawyer trying to juggle the demands of two brutal cases -- a gang rape and a murder -- while keeping his marriage from collapsing and his conscience intact. Last year our reviewer, James Marcus, called this a ''gripping and suitably grimy portrait'' of New York life, praising Passaro's ''superb feeling for the city's beauty and banality.''    FLESH AND MACHINES: How Robots Will Change Us, by Rodney A. Brooks. (Vintage, $14.) The director of the M.I.T. artificial intelligence laboratory examines the history and current state of robotics as well as its short-term future. The result is a ''stimulating book written by one of the major players in the field,'' Dick Teresi wrote here in 2002, adding, ''It also offers surprisingly deep glimpses into what it is to be human.''    EVA TROUT: Or, Changing Scenes, by Elizabeth Bowen. (Anchor, $13.) This novel's mercurial heroine, an orphan and heiress to a vast fortune, is sent by her guardian to live with a controlling, down-on-their-luck couple in Worcestershire. Their relationship is intensified after Eva adopts a deaf child in America, setting off an emotional tug of war for the child with melodramatic consequences. Bowen has a ''hard-grained intelligence'' and ''an understanding of the most subtle feelings,'' Howard Moss said here in 1968. ''Like Henry James, she is a storyteller in the most primitive sense and a writer in the most profound one.''    TOBACCO: A Cultural History of How an Exotic Plant Seduced Civilization, by Iain Gately. (Grove, $15.) Since its first cultivation in the Andes between 5000 and 3000 B.C., Nicotiana tabacum has been used to relieve hunger, cure disease and commune with the gods. Gately's ''breezy, readable history . . . documents the resourcefulness with which human beings of every class, religion, race and continent have pursued the lethal leaf,'' John Leland wrote here in 2002.    AMONG THE BEARS: Raising Orphan Cubs in the Wild, by Benjamin Kilham and Ed Gray. (John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $15.) Kilham, a New Hampshire naturalist, and Gray, a journalist, describe Kilham's efforts to raise orphaned black bears and then release them into the wild, making a case along the way that bears are self-aware and altruistic. The authors ''paint a vivid picture of ursine social life and intelligence,'' James Gorman said here last year.    THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE, by Ann Beattie. (Scribner, $13.) Drawing on the language and insights of therapy, Beattie employs a triptych of first-person narratives to explore a family's messy, unhappy past, especially the fraught relationship between an inveterate womanizer and his 40-ish sister, whose life has ground to a halt after her husband's death in a car crash. ''The novel lays bare baroque structures of guilt and blame'' as it ''participates in psychology's secular religion,'' Rand Richards Cooper wrote in the Book Review last year.    EDWARD ABBEY: A Life, by James M. Cahalan. (University of Arizona, $16.95.) Literary provocateur, world-class crank and impassioned conservationist, the novelist, poet and essayist Edward (Cactus Ed) Abbey was a cult hero who nurtured his desert rat persona even as he harbored grand literary ambitions. In his ''thoroughly researched'' account, Cahalan ''has unearthed some of Abbey's finest bons mots,'' T. Coraghessan Boyle said here in 2002.    THE FALL OF ROME, by Martha Southgate. (Scribner, $12.) Set at an idyllic all-male prep school full of ''clich&#233","excerpt":"s brought to life,'' this tale revolves around the collision of three characters: a black classics professor, an idealistic white English teacher and an ambitious African-American student from Brooklyn. The result is an ''intriguing novel'' that is ''powerful'' if uneven, Elizabeth Judd wrote here last year.
