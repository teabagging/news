The industry's most visible story involved something that cannot be seen: radio frequencies used by cellular telephones. More than 10 million people now subscribe to cellular services, a level once forecast for the turn of the century. A.T.& T., recognizing the shortsightedness of its withdrawal from the cellular market a few years ago, announced in November that it was negotiating to buy a third of McCaw Cellular, the nation's biggest provider of wireless telephone service in a $7 billion market.   Within a few years, the second generation of wireless phones -- handheld devices that are smaller, lighter and more versatile than today's cellular models -- may well add $30 billion more annually, some telecommunications consultants say. Known as personal communications, the market will consist of an as-yet-undetermined mix of telephones, computers and low-power radio transmitters.   The Federal Communications Commission may decide in the coming year how to organize markets for these phones, probably in ways intended to promote more competition and lower prices than in the cellular markets. A Phone for the Subway?    As envisioned by the product planners, people will be able to use wireless phones at their desks, on the street and in places normally blocked off from cellular signals, like elevators and subways. GTE, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech spent the year conducting large-scale trials to help them design such personal communications services.   The year's less visible story was the continued increase in capacity and speed in communications networks. With the addition of new undersea cables planned this year, there will be more than 1.1 million voice circuits between the United States and Europe by 1996 and 441,000 to Asia. And new techniques in data transmission that were widely deployed this year, like the so-called frame-relay format, will raise speeds nearly thirtyfold. Meanwhile, improvements in laser-fired fiber optics by A.T.& T. and Northern Telecom promise even higher communications capacity, and lower costs.   The technologies place intense pressure on long-distance carriers like A.T.& T., MCI and Sprint and local carriers like BellSouth and Nynex to fill up these huge pipelines. They spent the year increasing services like caller-identification and information services like stock quotes. The more people call, the more cost-effective all that increased capacity becomes.   Even telephones intended to remain firmly on the desktop received a facelift. A.T.& T. introduced a $1,500 videophone in January, and MCI intends to bring out a similar phone, priced at $750, early in 1993. Larger corporate videoconference systems have improved in quality even as they have dropped in price, to $10,000 from $30,000 only a year or two ago.   It was perhaps fitting that the ugliest proxy fight of the year involved a long-distance company with local telephone holdings, Sprint, seeking to buy the Centel Corporation, a Chicago-based company with both cellular and local-carrier businesses. Narrowly, the fight centered on whether Centel stockholders were getting a rich enough price for their shares. But more broadly, the fight involved whether a juggernaut like a Sprint-cum-Centel would be better able to cope with the coming communications revolution than Sprint or Centel alone. Centel's managers won, narrowly, and the company is scheduled to be merged into Sprint in 1993.  Perhaps the most significant move in the industry was made by the F.C.C., which voted in September to expand competition in local telephone service. The agency has permitted small communications companies like Metropolitan Fiber Systems to expand sharply their use of the networks operated by the regional Bell companies and other local phone carriers.   The action is very likely the first step toward a day when businesses and consumers will be able to choose local telephone service the same way they now choose long-distance service: from a jostling pack of carriers advertising big discounts and improved service.

The virtual collapse of Southern California's mighty arms industry, with the largest regional job losses since the Great Depression, is no longer on the national radar screens. Unemployment in Los Angeles County has edged down to 8.6 percent today from 9.4 percent in 1994. Besides, downsizing is hardly a problem unique to Southern California or to military contractors: the drive for enhanced productivity is hitting every big business from banking to textiles to retailing.         But planning specialists at Rutgers University's Project on Regional and Industrial Economics and the nonprofit Economic Roundtable in California argue that the long road back for Los Angeles offers lessons that should not be ignored. For one thing, said Ann Markusen of Rutgers, it says a lot about what sort of government intervention works in coping with economic dislocation. It also underscores the risks in leaving the military-industrial complex intact --  arguably even stronger -- after consolidation. \\"If the contractors don't diversify, you'll end up with even more pork in the defense budget,\\" she said.
