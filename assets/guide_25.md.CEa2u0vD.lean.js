But within a few months it became clear that something was missing: visitors. Consultants had predicted a first-year attendance of 460,000. Instead, only 320,000 people showed up, and just 120,000 of them went on the much-vaunted multimedia virtual tour of the world's wine regions - billed as the main event in the 100,000-square-foot museum. Major losses in its first year did little to cheer the 550 impatient shareholders who had put up $39 million. Duncan Vaughan-Arbuckle, the founder and president of Vinopolis, said the museum's problems have been part marketing misfire, part misunderstanding by industry insiders. ''Nobody knows what we are, or who we are for, and our marketing campaigns have not helped,'' he said. ''People saw our first campaign, with the tag line 'Taste. Explore. Enjoy,' and thought we were elitist.'' In truth, Vinopolis is clearly designed to entertain the masses. In addition to a lively audio guide, there are atmospheric videos about winemaking around the world","excerpt":"olfactory kiosks that teach visitors to use their nose to tell corked from moldy, and chardonnay from chenin blanc; a hair-raising virtual ride through the Chianti region of Italy; and of course, plenty of wine to sniff, swirl, sip, spit or swallow.

Manuel Antonio Noriega, the former dictator of Panama, will finally go on trial here this week, charged with 10 counts of drug trafficking, money laundering and racketeering that could get him 140 years in prison.   Never before has the leader of a foreign nation been tried in an American courtroom. But what makes the case of the United States v. Manuel Noriega even more notable is the promise that it will shed light on some of the most controverisal and embarrassing episodes of American foreign policy over the last decade, ranging from the arming of the Nicaraguan contras to the conduct of the war on drugs. In Uniform for Court    In testimony expected to stretch over four months, the names of at least two other heads of state, George Bush and Fidel Castro, are sure to be invoked, and there may even be efforts to have them testify. But most of the dozens of witnesses likely to be called will be drawn from the ranks of renegade pilots, admitted cocaine and marijuana smugglers, corrupt businessmen and bankers or Panamanian military and intelligence officials who have turned against their former chief.   General Noriega, who says he is a prisoner of war and who wore his four-star general's uniform in court today during the last hearings before the start of jury selection Thursday morning, stands accused of allowing cocaine traffickers in Medellin, Colombia, to use his country to process and ship drugs intended for the United States market and to launder their profits in Panama's banks.    He is also accused of sheltering the cocaine bosses after a political assassination they ordered. In return, he is said to have received at least $4.6 million in bribes.   Government prosecutors have declined to discuss any particulars of the charges publicly, and they try to minimize the case as just another drug prosecution.  Higher Stakes, Same Pattern   Their actions in court have played down the possible national security aspects of the case while simultaneously driving a wedge between General Noriega and former associates like Maj. Luis del Cid, who was captured in the American invasion. Panamanian officials describe him as General Noriega's bagman, who may be a star witness against him.   \\"As unique as this case is, it follows the framework of a standard drug case,\\" said Mark Schnapp, who was head of the criminal division of the United States Attorney's office here when General Noriega was indicted and is now in private practice. \\"You plead out the lower-level people and gain their cooperation. The stakes are higher in this case, but the pattern is the same.\\"   The lawyer leading General Noriega's defense, Frank A. Rubino, seeks to frame the case not as a drug trial, but as a seamy outgrowth of this nation's foreign policy. As part of that strategy, he emphasizes that for much of the period covered by the indictment, General Noriega was also on the payroll of the United States Government and performed services that advanced American interests. Not only did General Noriega receive payments from the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon's intelligence wing, he also worked closely with the Drug Enforcement Administration","excerpt":"Oliver L. North, the former national security aide linked to the Iran-contra scandal, and other White House emissaries.   \\"This is absolutely anything in the world but your routine, garden-variety, run-of-the-mill drug case,\\" Mr. Rubino said. He calls General Noriega \\"the C.I.A.'s man in Panama\\" and argues that the Reagan Administration turned on the Panamanian strongman only after he refused to cooperate with a 1986 plan to invade Nicaragua and overthrow its Sandinista Government.   Mr. Rubino stopped short of saying that General Noriega would take the stand, but Justice Department officials say the General is unlikely to pass up the chance to portray himself as a martyr of American foreign policy. Battling Over Documents    For months, Mr. Rubino and prosecutors have been battling over classified information in closed hearings, with the only hint of the intensity of their struggle coming from documents made public with gaping white spaces. But both sides scoff at the notion that the case will turn on some damning piece of evidence still under wraps.   \\"I don't know where the press got this idea we are going to pull some rabbit out of a hat, some smoking gun, some hand grenade,\\" Mr. Rubino said. \\"What the hell could there be? I know there are a lot of things that will show the general's relationship to the U.S. Government that I know the Government does not want out, because they have been screaming bloody murder about them. But there isn't one single thing that stands out with bright lights and flares.\\"   There has been constant speculation that the defense team also hopes to subpoena George Bush, who met with the general both as Vice President and Director of Central Intelligence. When asked directly whether Mr. Bush would be called as a witness, Mr. Rubino left the issue open.   \\"As President of the United States, I think he has executive privilege,\\" he said. \\"As a former director of the C.I.A., I sincerely doubt he has it.\\" Horrified Over Indictment    From the moment General Noriega was named in 11 counts of an indictment handed up on Feb. 4, 1988, the legal proceedings against him have been a political inconvenience that many in the American Government hoped would simply evaporate. Officials of the State and Justice departments and the D.E.A. were horrified, convinced that the charges would complicate efforts to persuade him to step down. One minor count was dropped Tuesday, leaving General Noriega to stand trial on 10 charges.    For almost two years after the indictment, negotiations between the Reagan and Bush administrations and General Noriega's representatives, aimed at securing his resignation, continued intermittently. But on Dec. 20, 1989, 25,000 American troops landed in Panama and overthrew the military government he headed.   Several hundred Panamanians and 25 American soldiers died in that invasion, which governments throughout Latin America condemned as a violation of Panamanian sovereignty and international law. General Noriega and his lawyers have argued that he was kidnapped, in disregard of norms applying to heads of state, and that his treatment at the Metropolitan Correctional Center here violates the Geneva Conventions on prisoners of war.    General Noriega's surrender on Jan. 3, 1990, revived an indictment that had initially been regarded as a purely political gesture. His arrest provided prosecutors with the means to strengthen their case: caches of seized documents including bank statements, correspondence and official papers.  'Boxes of Ammunition'    The prosecution appears to have built its case less on sensational revelations on than the sheer accumulation of detail. \\"There is no smoking gun,\\" said one Justice Department official who is familiar with the case. \\"But there are a lot of boxes of ammunition.\\"   Originally, General Noriega was only one of 16 defendants but, with his last co-defendant pleading guilty today to aiding a drug-and-money-laundering conspiracy, he will stand trial alone. In all, seven of his alleged associates have pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against him, and two others were convicted on cocaine smuggling charges this spring. Last month the Government also acknowledged in documents provided to the defense that six of its potential witnesses have received more than $1.5 million, payments that Mr. Rubino has described as \\"bribes.\\"    A spokeswoman for the United States Attorney's office declined to comment on the payments.    In documents submitted earlier this year, General Noriega's lawyers argued that he allowed arms, drugs and chemicals to be shipped through Panama at the express orders of the United States Government, in the person of seven former directors of the C.I.A. and four chiefs of the D.E.A. Whether Mr. Rubino will pursue that line of argument remains to be seen.   \\"The defense is ultimately going to have to make a tactical decision,\\" Mr. Schnapp predicted. \\"Your best defense is to say he didn't do it and that these people are liars. If the defense is going to argue that he was acting with the permission and authority of the United States Government, they have to admit that he was involved in drug trafficking, and that's a very risky defense.\\" One Original Lawyer Remains    Of the three main lawyers the general hired to defend him after he was indicted, Mr. Rubino is the only one who remains. A former Miami Beach policeman, Secret Service agent and race car driver, Mr. Rubino specializes in defending accused drug dealers. He calls the Noriega case \\"probably the greatest challenge I will ever face in my career.\\"    The defense had originally been headed by Raymond Takiff, who resigned the day after General Noriega's capture for what he described as health reasons. In June, it was revealed that Mr. Takiff had been working undercover for the Government in an unrelated judicial corruption investigation at the same time he was representing General Noriega.  Assertion by the Defense    In today's final pretrial hearing, Mr. Rubino charged that Mr. Takiff, hoping to \\"ingratiate himself with the Justice Department,\\" had called General Noriega on Jan. 3, 1990, and urged him to surrender. Mr. Takiff and prosecutors have said he never discussed the Noriega case with the Government.    The Government's team will be led not by a politically connected Washington prosecutor brought in especially for the case, as was widely predicted when General Noriega surrendered, but by Michael P. Sullivan, an assistant United States attorney and the top trial lawyer in the Miami office.   Presiding will be Federal District Judge William M. Hoeveler, who at age 69 is semi-retired. Educated at Harvard University and appointed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter, the native Floridian is described by those who know him as religious, calm, soft-spoken, patient and meticulous -- qualities they say make him ideal for this trial.

Derived from a Swedish word meaning \\"one who represents another,\\" ombudsmen (they are known as ombudspersons on some campuses) are now employed at more than 140 American colleges and universities, according to Howard Gadlin, former president of the University and College Ombudsmen Association.    \\"It's a way to help students find their way through some of the quagmires\\" said David Grady, ombudsman at the University of Texas at Austin. \\"I'm the defense attorney, not the judge and executioner,\\" added Alan Meltzer, a physics professor who this semester became the first faculty ombudsman for academic affairs at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.    Universities began appointing ombudsmen in the late 1960's as campuses across the country erupted in turmoil and students began demanding a greater say in how their schools were run, Mr. Gadlin explained. These days, said Barry Culhane, ombudsmen for students at the Rochester Institute of Technology, ombudsmen are in growing demand because \\"colleges are getting really big and students are getting more consumer oriented.\\"      Common Problems        In addition, ombudsmen are needed because administrators \\"don't have the time or inclination to deal with individual details,\\" said Mr. Gadlin, who also serves as ombudsman at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.    Describing the most common problems - disputes over grades as well as difficulties with university housing and financial aid - Mr. Culhane said that a big part of his job was helping students help themselves. \\"I can give information and ideas for the process of problem solving.\\"    \\"When push comes to shove, I can advocate a position,\\" he said. \\"But that's the last resort.\\"    Mr. Culhane did serve as a mediator last spring when a group of students were angry about the reassignment of a popular professor. \\"They wouldn't talk to the dean unless someone else was there,\\" he recalled. \\"So I attended the meeting as a neutral third party.\\" Eventually, he said, a compromise was reached that enabled the professor to continue teaching one course in his old area. In addition to this kind of work, Mr. Culhane also issues an annual report on his activities with recommendations for the future.    Unlike Mr. Culhane, Mr. Gadlin of the University of Massachusetts represents faculty and staff members as well as students. Although fewer in number, these cases tend to be more \\"complicated and time consuming\\" and often involve difficult issues like sexual harassment.      \\"Do It More Quietly\\"        Victims of sexual harrassment are often reluctant to file a formal complaint, Mr. Gadlin said. Ombudsman's offices, though, have a special advantage because they \\"can handle it in an informal way.\\"    \\"It means we can do it more quietly.\\"    While Mr. Culhane and Mr. Gadlin are both professors and Mr. Culhane is also a former administrator, some schools have brought in students to fill the job, like John Scalzi of the University of Chicago.    Mr. Scalzi, a senior from Claremont, Calif., majoring in philosophy and allied fields, said, \\"Students can deal with me on their own level. There's a sense of mutual understanding.\\"    A former editor of the campus newspaper, The Maroon, Mr. Scalzi said that being a student had not hampered his ability to get things done. \\"The administration knows and understands the position of the ombudsman,\\" he said. \\"They usually respond to me immediately.\\"    \\"It's a great feeling,\\" Mr. Culhane said, describing the times when he can help people reason together and find common ground. 'It's literally making a difference.\\"    On some days, though, cutting red tape can be like cutting the Gordian knot. \\"I can't snap my fingers and make things better,\\" Mr. Culhane said. \\"It can be like pushing a ship through sand.\\" Campus Life","excerpt":"Ombudsmen Help People on Campus Help Themselves"},{"year":"1952","title":"IISS.NAHCIE SHE, I :R","excerpt":"omc w' St. Mary s Church, Providence,[ !s Scene of Her Marriage"},{"year":"2002","title":"$1 billion deal recently struck between Walt Disney Co and OMD USA, media arm of Omnicom Group, has become subject of much controversy in world of media advertising","excerpt":"OMD Worldwide president-chief executive Joe Uva says far-reaching pact, considered to be largest of its kind, represents critical shift in way media will be bought and sold; OMD will be able to tap into ABC properties like 2003 Super Bowl, Academy Awards and National Basketball Association games, as well as Disney's radio, magazine and Internet units; ABC Television president Mike Shaw comments; photo (M) Disney marshals its parts into a new kind of advertising deal."},{"year":"1976","title":"Elkin wins Repub gubernatorial primary","excerpt":"Omdahl defeats Teigen to obtain Dem HR nomination (S) Senator Chiles Faces a Tight Contest in Florida"},{"year":"1934","title":"marriage MI$S .

The unseemly nastiness that erupted among formerly close colleagues was hardly spontaneous. Its practical roots could be found behind the cameras as several key members of the cast decided that they had had enough of courtroom theatrics and that it was time to push their careers in different directions. Among the defectors were Harry Hamlin, Susan Dey and Jimmy Smits. Actually, Miss Dey's Grace Van Owen, once in love with and made pregnant by the Smits character, has returned with neither lover nor baby.

The decision, adopted by a vote of 5 to 3, expands the rights of lawyers to advertise. The State of Ohio had defended its advertising restraints, in part on the ground that lawyers should be prevented from ''stirring up litigation.'' Associate Justice Byron R. White, writing for the majority, subjected that rationale to this examination:   ''It is important to think about what it might mean to say that the state has an interest in preventing lawyers from stirring up litigation. It is possible to describe litigation itself as an evil that the state is entitled to com-bat: after all, litigation consumes vast quantities of social resources to produce little of tangible value but much discord and unpleasantness.

This season, the company's plans include productions of \\"Tosca\\" and \\"La Traviata,\\" but its lure for the more adventurous is Verdi's sixth opera, \\"I Due Foscari.\\" The production opened last Saturday evening at the company's intimate theater at 319 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, and is to continue on weekends through March 24.    \\"I Due Foscari\\" is a gloomy work in which Jacopo Foscari is a helpless pawn in a multi-generational squabble between his family and that of Loredano.

Walter Huston, who has the leading male part, is equally unfortunate, perhaps more so, because the dialogue is crude. This is not so noticeabe in Miss Dagover's portrayal inasmuch as she speaks English with a decided Teutonic accent and occasionally talks in German.It is a confused chronicle, in which the characters seldom seem to be acting on their own initiative. They will not look anywhere until the director has given the order, and the most exciting happenings are left to one's imagination.Lottie, played by Miss Dagover, is the lovely wife of Captain Corlaix, Lieutenant Commander of the French cruiser Lafayette. Lottie is presumed to have become acquainted with the world before she became Mme. Corlaix. She is tired of being left on land while her husband is at sea. But one day his ship steams into Monaco and Lottie is highly gratified, but not for long, for she learns soon that her husband cannot go ashore. There is a party, however, but it is willed that this shall be interrupted with news of the declaration of war. All visitors are ordered to get into the shore boats. Lottie, however, delays matters and discovers herself not in her husband's cabin but Lieutenant D'Ortelles's quarters.D'Ortelles is not the scoundrel of this inconsequential affair. The blackguard is Commander Brambourg, who becomes most vehement, obviously because he suspects a lady fair is in D'Ortelles's cabin, on account of the fragrant perfume about the place.Corlaix, knowing nothing about his wife being left on the ship, goes about his work on the bridge. The cruiser gets under way. Signals are explained and Corlaix permits a seemingly friendly destroyer to come too close to his vessel. The smaller vessel is known to be an enemy craft only when she fires a torpedo at the L'afayette.Hundreds of the crew of the Lafayette perish, but the principal characters are all saved. Corlaix is court-martialed. Brambourg lies about the signal, and, after bullets fly, Lottie succeeds in winning her husband's exoneration, but apparently he will not pardon her for having compromised herself with D'Ortelles.Judging by the last scene, however, Lottie is not shedding many tears about the incident.The conception of naval warfare is quite original. In fact this part of the picture might prove amusing to naval officers. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"On a French Cruiser."},{"year":"1929","title":"Devil's Island. Interesting old creaker.

Replacing or patching a damaged shingle is trickier than patching asphalt-roll roofing, the material normally used on flat roofs. Flat roofs also are much safer to work on.  In addition, a leak is much easier to locate in a flat roof because it is more likely to be directly above the trouble spot inside","excerpt":"on a sloping roof the leak may actually be much higher up on the roof or even off to one side of where it occurs inside.   If you see signs of a leak, or suspect a leak, the first thing to do is examine the roof's surface directly over that area to see if you can find any defects that need patching or repair. The most common trouble spots are the places where there is a joint between the roofing and other structural material a brick wall, a vent pipe, a chimney or any other object that comes up through the roof - or any surface that forms a joint or seam with the roofing material.

But nobody concerned with the most vital subject in the world today will be bored. For Joris Ivens, who directed such screen achievements as \\"The Spanish Earth\\" and \\"The Four Hundred Million,\\" and collaborated this time with Jerzy Szelubski, has put together a political documentary in the best tradition, at least technically. Like the convention itself, to which 2,000 overwhelmingly leftist delegates streamed from eighty-one countries, \\"Peace Will Win\\" is as questionable as it is expertly organized.Mounting the rostrum and facing some highly interesting close-ups are such peace-minded individuals as Joliot Curie, Dimitri Shostakovich, the Rev. Willard Uphaus from the United States, the Dean of Canterbury, Chile's Pablo Neruda and Jessica Street of Australia. John Miller, the burly chairman of the Scottish mining delegation, assures the gathering that \\"we will fight anywhere to preserve peace.\\" China's Communist vice premier, Kuo Mo-Jo, lashes out at the United Nations as a \\"screen to hide aggression.\\"But the most absorbing plea for world brotherhood comes from the frail, sweet-faced Pak Den-Ai of North Korea, whose passionate utterances are underlined with a shrewd montage of bombers, obviously American, and the bloody, fly-covered corpses of Korean children. The only discordant note at the Stanley yesterday was the hissing in the balcony when the camera slid away from this lady's tumultuous, acclaim to focus on two American delegates, O. John Rogge and his wife, sitting quietly on the sidelines.Mr. Ivens' real accomplishment, when all is said and done—and plenty is said and little done in \\"Peace Will Win\\"—is his camera's concentration on faces, not only on the rostrum but in the hall itself, which, with each delegate giving rapt attention suggests nothing more than the General Assembly of the United Nations. The most telling shot has a group of Negro men viewing the ruins of Warsaw's Ghetto with absolute anguish. But the most challenging one is a sea of Polish infant faces jubilantly screaming \\"Peace\\" in the Victory Square celebration that closes the convention. \\"Every child old enough to talk understands the meaning of the word peace,\\" trumpets the English-speaking narrator.

ON CHRISTMAS EVE,    by Peter Collington. (Unpaginated. Alfred A. Knopf. $14.95.)    In wordless pictures, arranged comic-strip style like the author's previous success, \\"The Angel and the Soldier Boy,\\" a young girl arranges her Christmas stocking and her list for Santa at the foot of her bed and goes to sleep. Then a tiny angel arrives, consults the list and sets about her night's chores. What is so beguiling is the lightness of the nearly pre-Raphaelite illustrations and the weight of their detail. For all the magic she works, the little angel is exhausted by the effort of flying and the demands of all she has to do before Christmas morning dawns.    LITTLE BEAVER AND THE ECHO,    by Amy MacDonald, illustrated by Sarah Fox-Davies. (Unpaginated. G. P. Putnam's Sons. $14.95.)    An only beaver child sets out in his canoe to befriend his echo, and on the way meets a duck, an otter and a turtle.  What makes this enchanting is Ms. Fox-Davies's illustrations, particularly her child beaver, who somehow suggests a future Member of Parliament.    SHADOW PLAY,    by Paul Fleischman, illustrated by Eric Beddows. (33 pages. Charlotte Zolotow/Harper & Row. $14.95.)    A boy and girl are drawn to a carnival sideshow in the hope of getting the autograph of a shadow puppeteer \\"honored by the kings & queens of Europe.\\" They get it all right, along with an offbeat version of \\"The Beauty and the Beast,\\" but more entertaining to them and to us is what they learn about the differences between elegant shadow and down-to-earth substance.    THE TREASURE OF COZY COVE,    by Tony Ross. (Unpaginated. Farrar, Straus & Giroux . $12.95.)    A pair of nearly drowned kittens get shanghaied into a treasure hunt aboard the good ship Kipper. An otherwise ordinary story is made irresistible by the wit of Tony Ross's drawings, which manage to blend the color sense of Degas with the camera viewpoint of a Warner Brothers cartoon. Mr. Ross's most inspired invention is a feline Ahab with no fewer than three wooden legs.    JULIUS, THE BABY OF THE WORLD,    by Kevin Henkes. (Unpaginated. Greenwillow Books. $12.95.)    Until Julius is born, Lilly Mouse has mixed feelings about gaining a younger brother: \\"Hooray!\\" she exclaims on one page","excerpt":"on another she says, \\"You mean that bump is going to be a baby?! I thought you were just getting fat like Aunt Mona!\\" But after Julius is born, Lilly dissolves into pure poison: \\"3, 8, 1, 5, 9, 6!\\" she shouts at him in his crib after their parents have tried to teach him to count. How is Lilly's venom milked?  With psychological acuity in this exuberant opera of sibling rivalry.   THE EMPTY POT,    by Demi. (Unpaginated. Henry Holt & Company. $15.95)    The plot overshadows the perfectly serviceable illustrations in this story of a flower-loving Chinese emperor searching for his successor. He invites the youth of his land to grow him \\"their best in a year's time,\\" gives them barren seeds, and then rewards the only boy brave enough to show up with a pot containing nothing. \\"I admire Ping's great courage to appear before me with the empty truth,\\" he announces. One is relieved that he doesn't add, \\"at this point in time.\\"    MIK'S MAMMOTH,    by Roy Gerrard. (Unpaginated. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $13.95.)    Through bouncy verse and Mr. Gerard's inimitable paintings of sawed-off characters, we learn of Mik, a small and cowardly loser, who is abandoned by his fellow cave dwellers. Instead of giving up, he befriends a baby mammoth, discovers agriculture and art, and saves the tribe from enemy hordes.   The moral is that little chaps   May overcome life's handicaps,   And, with some effort, they perhaps   Can triumph in the end.    For Mik won through on brains and wit,   Though fortunate, I must admit,   To have one priceless benefit --   A mammoth for a friend.     SHREK!by William Steig. (Unpaginated. Michael di Capua/Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $15.95.) Shrek is the worst, a flame-spitting guy so ugly and venomous that \\"any snake dumb enough to bite him instantly got convulsions and died.\\" When Shrek's parents hiss things over and decide to kick him goodbye, he slogs off down the road, \\"giving off his awful fumes,\\" to seek his worst deserts in the form of the ugliest princess in the land. As usual, Mr. Steig's comic illustrations are topped by his perfect-pitch ear for daffy English idiom.   In PUSS IN BOOTS,    by Charles Perrault, illustrated by Fred Marcellino, translated by Malcolm Arthur. (Unpaginated. Michael di Capua/Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $14.95.)    In which Mr. Marcellino, the master dustjacket designer, turns his hand to the fable of the con-artist cat, and produces illustrations of surpassing drama and wit.My favorite happens to be the one of the ogre who, having risen to Puss's challenge to turn himself into a raging lion, manages at once to appear magnificently fierce and yet to have a look in his eyes that says, \\"How'm I doin', sport?\\"    WAR BOY:    A Country Childhood, by Michael Foreman. (92 pages. Arcade /Little, Brown. $16.95.)    This is an affecting memoir by an English children's book illustrator of a boyhood spent during World War II in the village of Pakefield on the Suffolk coast hard by Lowestoft, Britain's nearest town to Germany. Though his memories are haunted by enemy bombers and V1 and V2 rockets, the author recalls in delicate watercolors the many joys of being a shopkeeper's child under siege: the licorice comforts that left your teeth stained black, or the millions of flower seeds that were exploded out of gardens and showered around the district so that \\"the following spring and summer, piles of rubble burst into bloom.\\"   Eventually the war ended, and the children could fly their kites again.  The author concludes: \\"So it was true, all the things the grown-ups had said during the dark days. Now the war was over everything would be all right, there'll be blue birds over the white cliffs, not barrage balloons.  And men with rainbows on their chests would, like my kite, come home.   \\"And the memory of those who passed through our village on the way to war will remain forever with the ghosts of us children in the fields and woods of long ago.\\" Books of The Times; Presents of Words, Pictures and Imagination"},{"year":"1991","title":"Last year was the worst, Nadia Yussef said.

Public & Private; Sex For Sale"},{"year":"1951","title":"A fascinating adventure film woven around the wartime exploits of the Navy's underwater demolition teams in the Pacific was presented yesterday by Twentieth Century-Fox at the Roxy Theatre. \\"The Frogmen,\\" with a cast headed by Richard Widmark, Dana Andrews and Gary Merrill, represents an expert blending of fact and fiction that adds up to a fast-paced action drama. Besides the principals, the picture has an excellent cast of supporting players who perform remarkable aquatic feats with astonishing skill and ease.The U. D. T. groups didn't receive too much publicity during the war for obvious reasons, but there's no secret, or very little is left now, we suspect, because \\"The Frogmen\\" exposes in elaborte detail just how these intrepid human destroyers operate. All of the action takes place in the Pacific and as the story ends, the destroyer carrying Lieut. Comdr. Widmark and his teammates is heading toward Pearl Harbor with a \\"well done\\" from the flagship. So this is a sea story, with nary a girl in sight and only a casual mention of the good times that lie ahead on shore.If the Navy and the script writers won't object too strenuously, a landlubber might dare to mention that some of the things the boys do are obviously a bit farfetched. But this is not a serious consideration because the director, Lloyd Bacon, has carried off even the implausible with a surprising degree of authority. There is indeed a documentary quality about \\"The Frogmen\\" that overshadows the routine hero-worshipping pattern of the script.Naturally, a good deal of the footage is concerned with underwater exploits, such as reconnoitering an enemy-held beach to discover sunken mines as well as planted and natural barriers which would rip the bottoms out of landing craft. There is an eerie quality to this underwater warfare as the sailors swim into shore wearing only trunks and face masks, or decked out in Buck Rogerish water-repellent suits equipped with oxygen bottles. On one occasion their mission is to dynamite offshore beach defenses","excerpt":"on another to blow up a Japanese submarine pen.Purely from a technical standpoint, the underwater photography is truly remarkable. Fantastic as it may be, there is tremendous excitement when the Americans fight a subsurface battle with Nipponese frogmen. And, there are genuine thrills and awesome astonishment in those sequences which show how the U. D. T. men are scooped up out of the ocean by speeding powerboats and returned to the mother ship. To give continuity and form to the group's activities, \\"The Frogmen\\" tells a story about how the boys are cool to their new commander who has replaced an idolized leader who gave his life to save a teammate. It is a formula yarn and it is giving away no secret to say that Mr. Widmark eventually earns the respect of his crew, but somehow the formula seems all right under the circumstances.With topnotch performances by all hands and action that is unusual, \\"The Frogmen\\" rates a position close to the top of superior movies inspired by the innovations and heroics of World War II. See it and be proud of your Navy.\\"Red, White and Blue,\\" an ice revue, headlines the stage show at the Roxy, which also features Betty and Jane Kean with the Martin Brothers.

Sales are up about 20 percent over last year.\\"\\nHISTORIC SIGHTINGS: James Dean wore Jack Purcells on the set of \\"Giant.\\" Kurt Cobain favored black Jack Purcells. Before being displaced in the 60's, Jack Purcells were the only shoes worn by members of the United States Davis Cup Team.\\nORIGINS: Although considered by many to be a quintessential American product, the shoe was actually introduced, in 1933, by the Canadian branch of B. F. Goodrich. Two years later, the company put it on the United States market. In 1972, Converse bought the B. F. Goodrich rubber division and acquired the Jack Purcell trademark.\\nJACK BE NIMBLE: Mr. Purcell, also Canadian, was one of his country's leading tennis players in the 1930's and the world badminton champion from 1932 to 1945. But he was not just the shoe's namesake. Although another famous athlete, the basketball player Chuck Taylor, had lent his name to the Converse All Star as early as 1923, Mr. Purcell was the first athlete to play an integral role in designing a shoe.\\nTHE TOES HAVE IT: Designed for racquet sports, the Jack Purcell became popular among serious athletes because of increased performance and comfort. Key elements that set it apart were a layered rubber toe that extended across the top of the shoe (providing better protection and traction, especially when toe drag came into play); a durable, baby-blue rubber sole, and a blue stripe across the shoe's tip that has become known as the \\"smile.\\"\\nBLUE SMILE MANIA: \\"In the 30's and 40's, the Purcell was the shoe,\\" said Jack Kramer, the American tennis legend. \\"The first time I tried on a pair was in 1935. I went to a junior tournament in San Bernardino, and everyone was wearing Purcells. That night I told my father that I needed to have the shoe with the funny blue mark on the toe. None of us kids knew who Jack Purcell was, but that didn't matter, it was a great shoe. I wore them for the next five years. In fact, the only reason I stopped wearing them was because I signed up with Wilson, who offered to give me free shoes.\\"\\nCOLOR MANIA: Although the classic Jack Purcell comes in white (adult sizes 3-12, $36 retail), the shoe is also available in black, navy, maroon, pine, deep grape, chestnut and \\"torpedo gray.\\" A suede model in either \\"pilot blue\\" or terra cotta is to be unveiled next spring.\\nME MANIA: The stylist Brana Wolf has used Jack Purcells in several high-profile fashion shoots, giving the shoe considerable exposure.

Through the explosion of global satellite communications, a technological ''genie'' has been unleashed which will change forever the way that governments communicate ideas and information abroad. Because of the expansion of technology, foreign policy is no longer the exclusive domain of elites. Diplomats of one nation will continue to conduct business with diplomats of another, as they always have - privately. But there is now a new dimension - the dimension of public diplomacy. Telecommunications has now made it possible for governments to speak directly to people in other countries. The impact is unparalleled in the world's history.

A picture of Gavin, taped to the wall, reminds them that this is a memorial for a child, but the surrounding posters that read \\"We Black and Strong\\" and \\"This is Not Palestine\\" transform it into a call for political action.
