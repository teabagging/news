He first marries a false princess, and after his marriage to Sugki Nyima, the first queen plots against her until the king orders Sugki Nyima's execution.

With a promotional fanfare Hollywood might envy, the film, \\"The Crowning Experience,\\" opened on Saturday at Broadway's big Warner Theatre.Even more surprisingly, Hollywood could well note the smooth direction (Marion Clayon Anderson) and superb color photography (Rickard Tegstrom, a Disney alumnus). With its clean, bright hues the picture is beautiful to watch.Simultaneously, it remains so utterly, guilelessly home-spun—in the dialogue and the transparent acting of a naïvely constructed plot—that it hurts, and probably where it may do the most good. This movie is not for the wise, jaded sophisticate. Or is it, precisely?Rather sketchily, Alan Thornhill's script traces the rise of Miss Smith, as Emma Tremaine, from a teacher in a shack (presumably Southern) to a nationally respected leader of her people and a member of a Presidential advisory committee. Eventually drawn to a conference area operated by Moral Re-Armament on Mackinac Island, Mich. (the movie's production base), the altruistic heroine finds spiritual peace in a happy gathering of international members.The climax, a warm song fest, also brings peace to the other principals. These include Ann Buckles, as a perky reporter","excerpt":"Phyllis Konstam Austin, as her proud, rich mother; Anna Marie McCurdy, as the heroine's restless daughter, and Louis Byles, as Miss Smith's iconoclastic son-in-law.But the over-all flavor of the picture is uncalculating and informal, not unlike the songs dropped in all along the way. It's impossible not to smile with Miss Buckles, when she abruptly warbles \\"I Gotta Get a Scoop\\" to the gentlest assortment of reporters on record. (Next time, Moral Re-Armament must get more original composers—please!) And anybody who saw \\"Carmen Jones\\" knows that Miss Smith, who keys the acting with a pleasant, inquiring expression, can sing. Stunningly.We'd like to know just how Miss Smith became president of a splendid-looking college in ten years. And we'd have welcomed more specific data on Moral Re-Armament's program, for all those smiling countenances on Mackinac Island. Screen: 'Crowning Experience?

Still, many health officials say they need more experience with the system to draw firm conclusions about its effects.

I would like to point out that Medicare reimbursement is not limited to institutionally based and physician- provided care, although the program has a strong bias in that direction.
