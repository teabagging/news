There is simply no correlation between how much money is taken in and how much is spent. I would be willing to bet that nearly every family in this country has better sense than the Federal Government when it comes to watching pennies and balancing a budget.

Within this simple format, Mr. Sugimoto, a Japanese artist who lives in New York City, records a surprisingly varied range of effects, from streaks of pale clouds in the sky to subdued ripples in the water.   In the back gallery, Mr. Sugimoto is showing a series of night shots, with both sky and ocean black, and only an occasional wave or wisp of cloud to disturb the image's rich, dark tones.   The systematic nature of Mr. Sugimoto's project recalls a work from a decade ago by the Conceptual artist Sol LeWitt, in which he photographed sunrises and sunsets over the ocean off Priano, Italy, on the Amalfi coast. But where Mr. LeWitt's seascapes were dramatic and gloriously colorful, Mr. Sugimoto's are marked by a calm intensity.   In an earlier series, he photographed movie theaters using extremely long exposures, so that the screen on which the film was being projected was reduced to a glowing white rectangle. The seascapes have a similarly meditative sense. With their delicately modulated expanses of gray, these finely printed images seem to be as much about the achingly luscious tones that can be achieved in black-and-white photographs as about the scenes they record.

George Pataki and other critics have created the impression of a soft-on-crime bench fairly racing to let dangerous felons off the hook.         Anyone who believes this image ought to look again. A valuable analysis of the court's work appeared recently in The New York Law Journal. It provides both hard facts and perspective -- two things in short supply in all the political tumult over judges, and not just in New York. The author is Norman Olch, a lawyer who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Mr. Olch reviewed the court's criminal law decisions for a one-year period from December 1994 through November 1995. Far from being reflexively pro-defendant, he found when he examined the record that the court has been overwhelmingly pro-prosecutor.

says restricting debate to physical limits invites rejoinder that tech can circumvent such limits; says belief that shortages of energy and food can be overcome will be used by people and govts as excuse to avoid facing issues posed by growth of population and consumption; says pushing back physical limits has taken physical pressures off population growth, but as consequence, rising population density and scarcities will shift pressures to soc limits; says soc limits are already exerting growing pressures in form of drug addition, kidnapping, aircraft hijackings, sabotage, revolution and returning threat of atomic war; contends that soc limits are not relieved by more emphasis on tech; Hudson Inst head Dr Herman Kahn suggests that limits-to-growth belief is ‘delusion’; says assessment indicates that application of modicum of intelligence and good mgt in dealing with current problems can enable econ growth to continue for considerable period;

But that's not to say that every one of us is riding the same wave, economically speaking -- or even that our own individual waves are all that big or dynamic. What we're in the midst of collectively is, to borrow a term economists use, idiosyncratic volatility. Which means that however the broader economy is moving -- maybe even up -- its component parts can be experiencing significant and wildly differing swings in fortune. As Harris Collingwood explains in ''The Sink-or-Swim Economy,'' the march toward ever-increasing efficiency at the macro level has meant spreading volatility around at the micro level. And that's what this issue is about: some individuals or groups cresting, others living in the trough. The newly rich in ''Suddenly Popular,'' by Stephen J. Dubner, have inherited their windfalls, putting them in the vanguard of the largest transfer of private wealth in history, while the states' governors and other local public officials in ''Drip, Drip, Drip,'' by Matt Bai, are inheriting only woe from Washington these days.

A poll taken last year by the Roper Organization found that 74 percent of those who answered favored mandatory recycling to ease environmental problems.    But solid-waste disposal problems vary widely across the country. Embracing one disposal method over others may increase costs without necessarily providing environmental benefits.    It is certainly true that when thrown-away materials are recovered and turned into new products, there are several benefits. Obviously, that much less material is going to overburdened landfills. Re-use also eliminates the need to mine or harvest virgin materials, and since reprocessing usually involves less pollution than extraction and refining, the earth benefits in this way as well.   Some materials, largely metals, have been recovered for years. A sophisticated network of dealers and processors collects the steel in old cars and industrial projects and sells it to mills as a raw material. Aluminum-can makers have promoted the re-use of beverage containers because they save vastly on electricity consumption, compared to using raw ore.    But other materials have not fared so well. Old newspapers have piled up for lack of equipment to de-ink and repulp them into new paper. Plastics come in a multiplicity of chemical formulations, which must be separated to be of much use. Markets for most recycled plastics have been slow to develop as well.    To promote recycling, 38 states have enacted a variety of product bans, mandates, taxes and tax incentives. Now, with the Federal law that governs solid waste, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, due for reauthorization, some environmentalists are pushing for national standards. They would insist that a broad variety of materials and products contain a certain percentage of material recycled from trash bins.    But many economists argue that such rules would be wrong. Recycling may make economic sense in highly populated areas where landfill fees have been rising. But in some parts of the country, landfill space is abundant and cheap, and reprocessing plants are nonexistent. These people would be better off dumping and using the money saved for other worthy purposes, if there is no threat to the environment.    \\"Mandated recycling in some circumstances would make sense if conserving landfill space were the only policy goal,\\" wrote Lynn Scarlett, of the conservative Reason Foundation, in a study on solid waste. \\"But such efforts may consume more overall resources (environmental and commercial) than if waste were simply landfilled.\\"    Still, environmental groups see a Federal mandate as essential to develop recycling industries. \\"For more than 20 years, environmentalists have sought such a mandate on the grounds that recycling conserves resources, saves energy and is fiscally prudent,\\" said Allen Hershkowitz, a scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.    An effort to reconcile the two positions is included in a report, \\"Project 88-Round 2,\\" drafted by Robert N. Stavins, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. The report is significant because its predecessor, issued in 1988 at the behest of Senators Timothy E. Wirth and John Heinz, had an important influence on the Clean Air Act passed last year.    The Clean Air Act allows generators of acid rain gases to trade credits, allowing the emission of a certain amount of pollutants. This is intended to encourage the company that can curb pollution at the least cost to do so and sell its credits to companies where cleanup costs would be higher. The argument is that this is the lowest-cost approach to reducing the desired amount of pollution.   The current report would take a similar approach, using tradable permits as part of a general trend toward using market techniques to achieve environmental goals. \\"Under such a system,\\" the report says, \\"the Federal Government could set an industrywide recycling rate (or recycled content standard) which individual firms could meet in one of two ways: they could use the required percentage of secondary materials or they could use fewer secondary materials and buy permits from other firms which exceed their recycling requirements.\\"    This approach would increase the demand, and presumably the price, of recycled materials without forcing companies that are unable to use them to make expensive alterations to their production processes.    As markets for recycled materials develop, generators of solid waste will have to do some calculations. Do the prices being offered justify the cost of collection and separation, minus the cost of dumping in a fully approved, environmentally sound landfill? For some, the answer will be to recycle. But for others, dumping will make more sense.

Antarctica has been photographed more startlingly than it is here, and scenes of polar exploration have been staged with greater visual ingenuity. But these authentic glimpses, shot between 1905 and the 1930's and found by Peter Delpeut in the Netherlands Film Museum, where he is a programmer, capture the daring of film making as an adventure in its own right. Scenes of sailors as they battle the polar elements are doubly audacious, not only because of the sailors' courage but also because a camera was there at all.

Those changes manifest themselves in indirect ways, but family tragedies and reversals of fortune are inextricably linked to larger changes in Chinese life.

Since the mid-1980's, when Mr. Weller last appeared in New York City, his identity has been more or less missing in action. He started his career in 1977 with the Jam, one of the most idealistic and uncompromising bands of Britain's punk movement, then disbanded the group in 1982 in an effort to avoid becoming just another dinosaur rock outfit churning out hit singles. His next venture, the Style Council, dabbled in everything from cocktail jazz to punchy rhythm-and-blues to disco.

Guru, who is half the hard-core hip-hop duo Gang Starr, is known for his monotonal and blase delivery and thoughtful if raw lyrics. The show, like his own album, \\"Jazzmatazz Vol. 1,\\" is Guru's attempt at fusing jazz and hip-hop. The two genres, often compared because of their similar origins, existed symbiotically onstage. Each was clearly if only slightly changed by the other.  It was an easy fusion, almost as if the fuss over it is unwarranted.\\n\\nBy the time the band went into \\"Transit Ride,\\" a lyrical tour of New York's subways, the band had melded. Guru was on point with one of his best songs and the horn section, highlighted by the sweet-sounding hollowness of Donald Byrd's trumpet, was blowing in rich unison. The guitarist Zachary Breaux was making his funky presence known, and the disk jockey, Jazzy Nice, contributed the occasional well-timed scratch from the turntables.

One of these subjects is an Italian drama known as \\"Madre,\\" the only film to which the late Eleanora Duse lent her talent, and the other is \\"The Rink,\\" an early comedy in which Charlie Chaplin displayed his wonderful faculty for creating laughter.\\"Madre\\" is only interesting because of Mme. Duse's presence. Her efforts in this gloomy feature are confined to depicting the sacrifice of a mother for her illegitimate son. Yet every gesture and movement made by the great actress awakens thoughts of her illustrious career. She obviously understood the technique of acting before the camera far better than many of her more experienced contemporaries, for her actions are never too studied and always rhythmic. She was averse to make-up, and therefore in the early episodes of this picture, when she is supposed to be a young woman, her hair is covered with a cloth. Fifteen years (according to the story) then elapse, and Mme. Duse appears as she was shortly before her death. You see her fine features, crowned by her white hair.There are quite a number of scenes in this production that might have been excluded to its advantage, as the narrative is never stirring.Chaplin's comedy soon aroused laughter from the audience that had been silent. His antics in \\"The Rink\\" are not without originality. Where you would expect to see the comedian flounder all over the place when he is on roller skates, he turns out to be a master at gliding over the floor. His little cane comes in as useful as d'Artagnan's sword, for it needs but a touch at the bulky man on skates to send him to the floor.A comical parody on \\"Chang,\\" called \\"Twang,\\" treats New York as if it were a jungle and anything from cats to ferryboats, something to be dreaded. It was devised and titled by Joseph Fleisler. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Mme.

Sixty years ago she posed for her sculptor husband, Anthony de Francisci, when he fashioned a depiction of Miss Liberty for the new silver dollar of 1921 -a coin now known to hobbyists as the Peace dollar.   Much has changed since then. The model now has silver hair to match the coin, her husband has been dead since 1964, and the coin for which she posed has long since disappeared from circulation.  However, the events of 1921 remain warm and vivid in Mrs. de Francisci's memory.   She and her husband were newlyweds at the time and Mr. de Francisci, while viewed as an artist of promise, had not yet attained the widespread recognition that he later won. Thus, they were elated when the U.S. Treasury invited him, along with eight other sculptors, to submit proposed designs for the new silver dollar - a coin that would mark the return of peace following the end of World War I.
