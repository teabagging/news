An opening montage, replete with public figures ranging from Abbie Hoffman to Ronald Reagan, reflects the confusing array of influences that have shaped Max's consciousness and left him just barely able to get out of bed in the morning.

Later we see Jimmy no more, and in his stead there is an apartment, and a close-up of a meal check for $22. Erank Stanton, who is married, comes into Dolly's life, as does Robert Crane. Both men fade into the night when Jimmy, tired and a little pale, returns to claim his own. Add to this the fact that Dolly and Jimmy find love (so it is assumed) on a park bench in the middle of a movie rainstorm, and you have it all.Of the characters, Bert Lytell, as Robert Crane, is the best portrayal—so much so that his failure to win the elusive lady seems a shame. Larry Kent, as Jimmy, gives the appearance of a bright but weak soul lifted to the heights through the power of \\"romance that just happens,\\" which may, as a matter of fact, explain why Robert didn't do better.

By STEWART PARKER   M ost cities grew up around a river, but Edinburgh grew up on a rock, and the rock is at the heart of it now. Rivers are for to-ing and fro-ing to the outside world, but castellated rocks are for defending the world within. Edinburgh is a defensible position, wellnigh impregnable. Approach it with deference and respect, don't attempt to take it by storm. You'd know what I mean if you'd ever tried to get a plumber here.   This rock is impressive; at any rate it still impresses me, and I have seen it practically every day for three and a half years. It keeps coming at you suddenly, as you round a corner. The buildings on top are solid rather than fantastical, a working garrison rather than a picture-book fastness, with most of what's now visible being retaining walls and severe Georgian barracks. But the buildings and the rock are of a piece after eight or nine centuries of mutual accommodation, and it's the whole hulking entity that constitutes the Castle. It also constitutes the aspiration of all the other edifices in town; every bank, department store, hotel, hospital and school looks as if it's trying to be another castle. Plenty succeed, especially the schools.

Even where the total figures for Americana declined, as they did at Sotheby Parke Bernet, there were some records and remarkable prices. Sales of American decorative arts at Sotheby's fell from $10.2 million to $7.7 million and American paintings from $25.6 million to $17.2 million.   The auctions of paintings at Sotheby's in October and April established records for the works of several artists, including two for Winslow Homers. His ''East Hampton, Long Island,'' brought $525,000, the highest price ever paid at auction for one of his oils","excerpt":"his ''Three Boys on the Shore,'' at $270,000, topped previous prices for a watercolor by him.

The company was established in 1965 to entertain and instruct California vineyard workers who were on strike, and it remains dedicated to theater that speaks to political and social issues.

The title of the first piece is a line in Federico Garcia Lorca's ''Blood Wedding'' and, as Mr. Valdez said in a brief talk before Thursday night's opening, he was a bit overwhelmed by the Spanish poet's powerful but elusive dramatic techniques at the time he was writing ''The Dark Root of a Scream.'' The scream is piercing at the end of the play when the flag-draped casket of a soldier killed in Vietnam is opened in the presence of a priest, the soldier's mother, his girlfriend and three of his friends.

The public is invited to watch them now. This doesn't sound like your ordinary setting for dance rehearsals, right? In fact, the vaults are clean, dark and cool but with spooky, phantom-of-the-opera overtones. In a more exalted vein, the vaults can recall the experience of being in a European cathedral.   The dance troupe, headed by Ann Carlson, a choreographer in residence at the Anchorage this summer, certainly likes it here. And if you think the vaults are strange, consider some of the sets designed by artists for the September show. Todd Gilens's \\"trees\\" are made up of long twigs \\"planted\\" in green bases","excerpt":"his \\"gold nuggets\\" of papier-mache are big enough for children to sit in them. Pat Oleszko's inflated-nylon clown sculptures are about 24 feet tall and swallow up an entire vault.   All of which is bound to perk up children on a desultory August afternoon. They can also participate in art projects during their visit: drawing their dreams, making handprints and molding plaster impressions of their arms, knees and other body parts (the casts are to be used in the September dance show).   The rehearsals are open to the public from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M today and on Aug. 17, 18 and 19, and from noon to 3 P.M. tomorrow. Ms. Carlson's performance, \\"A Mirage,\\" presented by Creative Time and Dance Theater Workshop, is to be held Sept. 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18.   To reach the Anchorage, take a No. 2 or No. 3 subway train to Clark Street, then walk north on Henry Street to Old Fulton Street, which you cross near Hicks Street (there is no traffic light). At the Anchorage's entrance is a large sculpture depicting a man, a woman and a child. Fulton Ferry Esplanade and Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park    26 New Dock Street (near Water Street)   Fulton Landing, Brooklyn   (718) 858-4708   Recommended for all ages    Inside the courtyard of the River Cafe is a gate to this hard-to-find esplanade, which hugs the East River and offers a view of the belly of the Brooklyn Bridge. And though the park and the esplanade can also be reached at their official address on New Dock Street, going through the grounds of River Cafe, at the end of Old Fulton Street, is easier.   On the esplanade is a display explaining how the bridge was built; the site is also popular with film makers, fashion photographers and tourists. Unfortunately, there's also a big pile of trash, so you'll want to mosey on to the adjacent state park, which doesn't look like a state park (there are no rangers, although a sign reminds you who the Governor is).   This park is a quiet, enclosed, grassy three acres with a knoll to run up and down on. Some rosehip bushes entice children to pluck their big pink berries. There are empty brick warehouses on the fringes of the park (they once were coffee and tobacco factories). In one corner of the park is a cluster of trees, and benches in the shade. On a recent afternoon, the park was buzzing with children from a nursery school; they were spritzing one another and passers-by, who didn't mind. And, oh yes, there's the river to admire.   The esplanade is open from dawn to dusk. The park's summer hours are 10 A.M. to 8 P.M. daily. Puppet-Making Workshop    Andrew Heiskell Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped   40 West 20th Street   Chelsea   (212) 206-5400   Recommended ages: 8 to 12   Tomorrow    \\"I'm the puppet lady,\\" said Sahyini Morningstar, who has been making puppets, doing puppet shows and teaching both skills for the last 30 years. Ms. Morningstar, who is also the founder and artistic director of the Speaking Shield Puppet Theater in Manhattan, is to create puppets tomorrow in a program meant for blind or partly sighted children.   \\"I'm going to take a tactile approach,\\" she said, explaining that the children are to make U-shaped finger puppets that can squeeze into a pocket. \\"We'll focus on smooth and soft textures and geometric shapes and dimensions, like thickness and thinness,\\" she explained. Ms. Morningstar is supplying the materials: lace, buttons, beads, seashells, Styrofoam, ribbon, yarn and glue.   The free program is at 1:30 P.M. and requires registration. A slightly different form of the program, this one for sighted children ages 6 to 12, is to be offered on Tuesday at the Hunts Point branch in the Bronx, (718) 617-0338; on Thursday at the Melrose branch in the Bronx, (718) 588-0110, and on Aug. 24 at the Harlem branch in Manhattan, (212) 348-5620. 'Jazz on the Hill'    St. Luke's Episcopal Church   Convent Avenue at 141st Street   Hamilton Heights   Manhattan   (212) 926-2713   Recommended for all ages   Sunday    Hamilton Heights wants to draw attention to its designated historical district and its artists, writers and musicians, past and present. So the recently formed Hamilton Heights Preservation Association is holding jazz concerts to make adults and children more aware of this artsy terrain.   Sunday's concert is dedicated to the saxophonist John Coltrane, who died in 1967. Coltrane didn't live in Hamilton Heights, but his music certainly influenced musicians in the community. Bernice Cummings-Ubiles of the association explained that Hamilton Heights extends from West 135th Street to West 155th Street, between Broadway and St. Nicholas Avenue (and then St. Nicholas Place).   Playing Sunday will be the C.C.N.Y. Jazz Trio -- a pianist, a percussionist and a bass player, all CUNY graduate students -- and vocalists and a saxophonist from Hamilton Heights. A jam session involving the audience is to finish the program.   Tickets to the show, from 6 to 8 P.M., will be available at the door. Admission is $10 and free for children under 12. Refreshments will be sold.

This ploddingly thorough account of Alec Guinness's professional life traces his enigmatic career to multiple, often competing ambitions. Regarded as one of the greatest stage actors of the 20th century, Sir Alec (1914-2000) spent prime years playing ''demeaning if lucrative bit parts'' in Hollywood, and is popularly best remembered as Obi-Wan Kenobi in ''Star Wars.'' When he did appear in West End theater, critics were not always sympathetic: his 1951 Hamlet was a ''monumental'' failure","excerpt":"his 1966 Macbeth was ''totally colorless.'' Still, he remained the gentleman thespian whose sheer presence could elevate the most meager script.     Sir Alec was aware of his dramatic talents from the start, and determined to become ''one of the four greatest classical actors in England.'' But he was also the socially precarious bastard son of an alcoholic mother, and did everything he could to distance himself from the coarser associations of the theater. (He cruelly forbade his wife, Merula, a talented actress, to pursue her stage career.) Paradoxically, Read suggests, class pretensions (and the money they required) helped drive him to the movies, where his high standards were less likely to be met.

Ever since then the dissension within the Liberal ranks has been acute, until it has finally culminated in today's drastic step by the aged veteran.Lord Oxford stated his reasons in a letter addressed today to J. A. Spender, President of the National Liberal Federation of England and Wales, and is expected to amplify them tomorrow in a speech at Greenock on the future of the Liberal Party.Lloyd George intends to make a speech on Saturday at Barnstaple, in the course of which he will undoubtedly take up his schism with Lord Oxford from his own viewpoint.The Letter of Resignation.In his letter to Mr. Spender Lord Oxford and Asquith writes:I have had to reconsider from every point of view, public and private, since the differences which arose in the early Summer over the general strike, my own personal relations with the party. In my judgment, then and now, serious matters of principle vital to the State and to parliamentary government, and not less so to the Liberal Party, were put in peril.The outbreak of the organized-general strike was the gravest domestic event in my lifetime. If it had succeeded parliamentary government would have been at an end. To temporize with such a situation would fatally and with justice have discredited the Liberal Party. It was no action of mine which made this a ground of controversy in the Liberal ranks, and it was with as much distress as surprise that I found that my public declarations were met with a challenge from a quarter which it was impossible for me to disregard, coupled with a refusal at a time of national crisis to meet me in council.Fortunately for the country, the general strike came to a speedy end, and I think I may firmly claim that the firmness of some of the Liberal declarations made during the progress—the only time when they could be of use—contributed materially to this result. If it had gone on I am convinced that the Liberals would have had the strongest reason to deplore vacillating counsels on the part of their leaders.Rivalry Fatal to Party Unity.I attach as great importance as any one to party unity and I have done as much as any man living (often under difficult conditions) to attain and preserve it. But I am satisfied that It cannot be effectively maintained under a system of rival authorities with separate organizations and separate funds.I cannot and will not take any part direct or indirect in sectional controversies. I am now in my seventy-fifth year. I have been for the best part of half a century in public life. I was Prime Minister for a longer consecutive term and had to face graver responsibilities than any of my predecessors during the last hundred years. For a still longer time I have been leader of the Liberal Party.During all these years I have given my time and strength without stint or reserve to the service of the party and State. From the principles of liberalism as I have always understood them and understand them still I have never swerved to right or left and I never shall.Though my health is now restored, I feel that the anxieties and responsibilities of leadership ought not to be undertaken or continued by any one who can not be reasonably certain that he can stand the strain.I do not contemplate retirement from public life and hope that I may still be of some service to the State and to Liberalism. But I have come to the conclusion that it is my duty to lay down the leadership, and this decision, arrived at after much consideration and with many regrets, must be regarded as irrevocable.Party Rift of Long Duration.For a long time the British Liberal Party has been rent by dissension within its ranks. At no time were these so marked and serious as during the general strike. Then the differences between the two great former. Liberal Prime Ministers, Lord Oxford and Lloyd George, made it clear to every one that the factional fight was bound to lead to an open rupture unless one or the other made may. Lord Oxford has now made way.Whether this means the rise of his younger and still vigorous rival to supremacy over the Liberal Party remains to be seen. There is a faction against him in its ranks which even without Lord Oxford in the leadership may continue the Asquithian tactics so successfully that Lloyd George may fail to gather the Liberal reins into his hands.The schism between Lord Oxford and Lloyd George became clearly visible to all when the former, soon after the close of the general strike, wrote a letter deploring the course adopted by Lloyd George during the strike, which the writer characterized to the recipient of the letter as \\"the greatest domestic crisis which the country has had to confront in your time or mine.\\"A letter was then written to Lord Oxford members of the \\"Liberal Shadow Cabinet\\"—the name given to the group of Liberal leaders—assuring him of their support and hitting out at Lloyd George thus:\\"Confidential relations are impossible with one whose instability destroys confidence.\\"Since then several endeavors have been made to restore Liberal unity. But it could not be done. Where Lloyd George was Lord Oxford could not be and vice versa.The members of the \\"shadow\\" Cabinet who stand firmest behind the veteran Lord Oxford are Lord Grey of Fallodon, British Foreign Secretary at the outbreak of the World War, Sir John Simon, Mr. Runciman, Sir Donald MacLean, Vivian Phillips, Geoffrey Howard and William R. Pringle. Sir Godfrey Collins, the chief Liberal Whip, is absent in America.It is stated tonight that Lord Oxford's supporters will not put forward a candidate in his place as leader of the Liberal Party, and they assume that the post of leader will lapse.Conservative Organ Regrets Split.In a leading editorial The London Times says:\\"Upon the fortunes of Liberalism the resignation of the veteran leader of the party is not likely to have any immediate effect. The schism which had long been forming and which became an open breach last Summer remains as it was. It may be aggravated and intensified by the recriminations which are certain to follow Lord Oxford's decision and his candid statement of the reasons which made it inevitable.\\"There may follow fresh desertions from the Asquithian Liberals in some few cases to the Conservatives or to the camp of Lloyd George, which already outnumber theirs in the House of Commons, but they are not likely to be numerous. Most of the party will continue, like Lord Oxford, to hold fast to Liberal principles as they have always understood them. Some may prefer to cherish these principles in private life rather than prosecute an internecine quarrel in a hopelessly divided party.\\"What the result of these transformations in Liberalism may be upon the future of our domestic and imperial politics is a subject for speculation altogether too uncertain for immediate discussion. But there is no doubt at all that the present state of the party is regretted profoundly far outside its own ranks.\\"Papers of all political shades pay tribute to Lord Oxford for the great work he has done for the country and express the earnest hope that although he has resigned the leadership of the Liberal Party he will long be spared to render service to the State.The Asquithian Westminster Gazette declares that Lord Oxford \\"is beyond question the most illustrious of our elder statesmen.\\"The Lloyd Georgian Daily Chronicle says Lord Oxford's resignation brings to its historic close a long period of fruitful and useful service to the State.The Radical Daily News says:\\"The Liberal Party has had one greater leader but none more disinterestedly devoted to its service.\\"The Conservative Morning Post puts the blame for the Liberal split mainly upon Lloyd George and recalls his \\"comic, although vicious, travesty of the facts of the general strike published in American newspapers.\\"As to the future, most of the papers are awaiting further developments before they venture to predict anything. But The Morning Post says that deprived of Lord Oxford's leadership the Liberal Party becomes Lloyd Georgian or nothing.

Like ''Noises Off,'' ''Benefactors'' is ingeniously constructed and has been directed with split-second precision by Michael Blakemore - but there all similarities end. Mr. Frayn's new play is a bleak, icy, microcosmic exploration of such serious matters as the nature of good and evil, the price of political and psychological change and the relationship of individuals to the social state. Though ''Benefactors'' evokes Chekhov, ''Othello'' and ''The Master Builder'' along its way, it is an original, not to mention demanding, achievement that is well beyond the ambitions of most contemporary dramatists.

The fairy tale ''The Briar Rose'' by the Grimm brothers serves well as the narrative spine of the poem. A poet-prince embarks on an arduous quest for a princess who is sleeping in a thorn hedge and waiting for the kiss that will awaken her from a trance that is a simulacrum of death. Mr. Carruth's wife, Rose Marie Dorn, the    Dornr\\"oschen    (brier rose) to whom the poem is an offering of reconciliation, is a mature woman, though the memory of her as a slender girl of 17 also haunts the poet.

In very different ways, both Lawrence Tierney, the swaggering Brooklyn native who specialized in cold-hearted killers in films like Max Nosseck's 1945 ''Dillinger'' and Robert Wise's 1947 ''Born to Kill,'' and Robert Ryan, the trembling giant on the brink of violent self-destruction in Edward Dmytryk's 1947 ''Crossfire'' and Fritz Lang's 1952 ''Clash by Night,'' embodied the anxieties of a generation of men who had experienced hell at first hand but were now being asked to be compliant citizens.      The hulking Tierney was not so much an actor as a frightening force of nature. An anonymous bit player at RKO, he was promoted to stardom with the title role in ''Dillinger,'' a B-movie from Poverty Row's Monogram studios that became a sleeper hit, no doubt because of its extreme violence. (At one point, Tierney's Dillinger carves up a waiter's face with a broken beer mug.) The thoroughly urban Tierney may have been grotesquely miscast as Dillinger, an Indiana farm boy turned bank robber (and played with infinitely greater accuracy by Warren Oates in John Milius's 1973 ''Dillinger''), but he conveyed such a strong sense of impending danger that audiences couldn't look away.

His directorial debut, the sometimes awkward but often hilarious fright-comedy ''Jabberwocky'' from 1977 -- which opens tomorrow at Film Forum for a limited run -- is unremittingly silly and subjects its hero to relentless bouts of hardship.

On the basis of the 90-minute Part One, subtitled \\"Neocolonialism and Violence,\\" the work might well turn out to be a polemical epic, an essay film of a political, cinematic and psychological complexity unlike anything I've ever seen.For reasons I do not know, Solanas has allowed only Part One to be released for commercial distribution here, although the entire film has been shown at the Museum of Modern Art and is available for 16 mm. showings by film societies, universities and such. It has also been widely screened in Europe but, understandably, only privately in Argentina.Part One opened here yesterday at the New Yorker Theater on a program with Joseph Strick's 22-minute \\"Interviews with Mylai Veterans,\\" which has been nominated for an Academy Award. As its title implies, the film is a series of interviews with five enlisted men who participated in the Mylai action and all of whom are now out of the Army. The effect of the testimony—rueful, matter-of-fact, unsentimental, a lot of it smiling (at the interviewer and at the fact of being interviewed, rather than at the subject)—is terrifying, and almost indescribably sad.Because no movie genre makes quite as personal demands on the viewer as the political documentary, or plays on his prejudices with such accuracy, perhaps I should explain something of my own experiences, which, of course, I took with me when I entered the theater to see \\"The Hour of the Furnaces.\\" I'm no student of either Argentina or Latin America, and just about everything I know of them is the more or less chance result of several short visits to Argentina in the early 1960's.First of all there was, for me, each time I arrived in Buenos Aires international airport, the feeling that I'd arrived at the end of the line, if not the world. Although the airport services the largest city in South America, and is modern and efficient and handsome, it seems—as Solanas says of Buenos Aires itself—to have \\"turned its back on the country.\\" It faces north and east and west, but not south, and if one had wanted to go to Tierra del Fuego, or even Córdoba, one had to go to another airport.Seen from the perspective of either British Empire or United States hegemony, Argentina is, quite literally, as far away as you can get, the last stop before the South Pole, a fact that has shaped a kind of national inferiority complex—political, cultural and economic. It has set out to demonstrate that being Argentine, as well as Latin American, can be beautiful.\\"La Hora de Los Homos,\\" Part One, is a cool but furious examination of first the British and then the American neocolonialism that, according to Solanas, had as its aim the \\"Balkanization\\" of Latin America for economic exploitation. Here is no unbiased report, but a vivid, angry, indoctrination lesson, sometimes crude but always cinematic, that has the look of the kind of documentary film Godard might make if he opted to play on the bourgeois emotions he now scorns.The film employs old prints, newsreels and interviews, as well as clips from the work of Joris Ivens and Fernando Birri (the only other young Argentine filmmaker I know who shares, with Solanas, an authentic Argentine vision), On the soundtrack there are lengthy quotations from Sartre and Fanon, slogans, and masses of facts, none of which I can easily authenticate.Some of Solanas's juxtapositions are so obvious they are unworthy of the quality of the passion of the film that contains them. Mostly, however, the images, the editing and the sound track are fine, even witty, as in the section on the Argentine aristocracy, defined by its grandiose cemetery that looks like Washington's Resurrection City, sculptured in marble. The aristocrats, he notes, \\"take the past as [if it were] a future.\\"I find difficult (and depressing) Solanas's conclusions in favor of Perónism, which he describes as the first popular expression of Argentina's national consciousness, and suspect that, in the style of other contemporary revolutionaries, he may well feel that the past can be rewritten, through re-evaluation, according to the needs of the present. Solanas's conclusions thus escape me","excerpt":"his arguments do not.\\"La Hora de Los Hornos,\\" Part One, is, most importantly, a unique film exploration of a nation's soul. It's full of tremendous vigor, unlike the tired Buenos Aires dinner party at which the hostess, before introducing me, gave me quick sketches of everyone in the room. \\"Over there,\\" she said, pointing to a handsome, morose man, who seemed to be getting quite drunk, \\"is José. . . .

The group quickly gained notoriety with a British public used to what Sickert contemptuously called the \\"lilies and languors\\" of Pre-Raphaelite sentimentality by painting tired working-class faces in cramped North London flats, bawdy performers at seedy music halls and moody cityscapes. Sickert's grim subjects (as in \\"The Camden Town Murder,\\" where a fleshy woman lies sprawled on a dingy cot, her throat cut) and his disturbing palette of dirty yellow-ochers, dusty blues and sickly greens are thought to have paved the way for the severe, pessimistic art of contemporary British painters like Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon. While Sickert's influence on modern English art is well established, his own artistic evolution has been neglected. The publication of SICKERT: Paintings (Yale University, $60), edited by Wendy Baron, director of the British Government Art Collection, and by Richard Shone, associate editor of The Burlington Magazine, fills that gap and more. The excellently researched and handsomely produced volume details Sickert's nocturnal expeditions by the edge of the Thames with Whistler, the artist's friendship with Degas, and his great admiration for the French realists Millet and Courbet. What emerges is a portrait of a man fiercely determined to change the course of British art, motivated by the resigned belief that, as he wrote in 1908, \\"for some reasons to me hidden and inscrutable, the genius of painting still hovers over Paris, and must be wooed on the banks of the Seine.\\" IN SHORT: NONFICTION","excerpt":"His Art Was Not a Cheerful Business"},{"year":"1937","title":"Bishop Manning renews fight on laws MANNING RENEWS DIVORCE LAW FIGHT","excerpt":"His Article in Living Church Asks Withdrawal of the Proposed Canon Change ISSUE SLATED FOR VOTE Bishop Urges Clergymen and Laity to Join in Drive on 'Nullifying' of Marriage Holds Change Means Chaos Wide Disparity Forecast \\"Easy Divorce\\" Challenged"},{"year":"1952","title":"R Raymond tours mil bases","excerpt":"his article in Picture Post sees 30 US bases, staffed by 50,000, netting $400 million; '52; finds many residents dubious of bases value; cites various problems raised by personnel British Wonder if 50,000 Fliers Of U.

Lawrence: From Eastwood to Taos,'' (Lawrence was born Sept. 11, 1885, in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire","excerpt":"his ashes are interred in Taos, N.M.) begins at 9 A.M. and ends Tuesday at 8:30 P.M.    Both the conference and an exhibition of paintings - many of Lawrence's landscapes will be shown for the first time - are free. They are being financed by the state's Committee for the Humanities and Department of Higher Education.    On Tuesday, an original drama based on Lawrence's youth, ''The First Edition of D. H. Lawrence: The Long Adolescence,'' will be performed by Roy Spencer.

But Nicholas Ray, director","excerpt":"his associate, Andrew Marton; Philip Yordan and Bernard Gordon, the script writers, and an energetic cast have made these \\"55 Days\\" rousing, sometimes exciting, action fare that should keep the customers alert and entertained even if their intellects are confused.The fact of the matter is that the principals and the multitudinous extras involved have no more depth than Occidental and Oriental figures on a Chinese tapestry. And their actions—at least the reasons behind the actions of the principals — are rarely explored fully. Without authentic historic background, a viewer gets a foggy picture, if any, of the real causes of the Boxer Rebellion.With a variety of intertwined personal stories that are also superficial and vague in treatment, the characters of the principals remain largely one-dimensional. Charlton Heston, satisfactorily tough and stalwart as the U.S. Marine major, and David Niven, as the British envoy,—his is the outstandingly realistic acting stint in the film — are the leaders of the successful resistance to the rebellious Boxers.Ava Gardner, as an ill-fated, tarnished Russian baroness with whom Mr. Heston falls in love, appears to be merely haggard and tired in a role that could stand some elaboration. As the stoic despotic Empress, Flora Robson is simply an aloof, haughty figure as remote as a carved idol. Robert Helpmann is waspish as the Boxer leader and Leo Genn is phlegmatic as the understanding Chinese general who opposes his extremism.Kurt Kasznar, as the angry Russian envoy and relative of Miss Gardner; Paul Lukas, as a harried doctor; Harry Andrews, as a helpful priest, and John Ireland, as the Marine sergeant-sidekick of Mr. Heston, are not aided by their dialoguein brief and perfunctory appearances. Lynne Sue Moon, as a wistful half-caste orphan girl, does contribute a few genuinely appealing moments.But the film remains in memory for its flashing movement and fireworks. The producers were sensible enough to keep the dialogue, which is often banal, to a minimum.Although it was all done in and around Madrid, the sound and fury and beauty of these momentous \\"55 Days at Peking\\" are brought vividly to life.

Kreuz's offers no sauce, no beans, no potato salad, no plates and no chance to walk away with the steak knives because they are chained to the tables. The lime-green walls are bare, save for the mounted body of an 11 1/2-pound bass and the hide of a 6 1/2-foot rattlesnake. This is a place to eat, not to see and be seen.   Squares of paper come loaded with ropes of link sausage, mounds of prime rib and brisket and thick pork chops stacked like pancakes, all smoked in brick pits fueled by post-oak logs. Tomatoes and avocados are available, but Mark Henry declined. The frivolity of vegetables is not how a man grows to 6 feet 3 inches, 400 pounds by his 23d year.   Tomatoes and avocados do not provide enough octane for the gas tank of an Olympic weight lifter in the superheavyweight class, one who bench-pressed 525 pounds and squatted 937 pounds in high school, who can dead-lift a national-record 850 pounds, who snatches 391 pounds and cleans and jerks another 475. Vegetables did not provide the strength for this five-lift total that no one can match. A meatless diet did not provide Henry's bank-vault physique, did not cantilever his chest to 62 inches, or expand his waist to 48 inches, or hew his 23-inch biceps and calves, his 24-inch neck and 38-inch thighs.   Henry waved off the vegetables, and picked up a pork chop in hands so massive that he cannot find a pair of gloves that will fit them.   \\"I'm from a family of carnivores,\\" he said.   Where Henry's immense bulk might be intimidating or forbidding, instead it is inviting. He is open, friendly, a man who luxuriates in his formidable heft. He trains in a T-shirt that says \\"West Virginia gymnastics,\\" although he is the size of five Mary Lou Rettons. He calls Nate (the Kitchen) Newton, the Dallas Cowboys' 325-pound guard, a \\"little guy.\\" He gives a curdling scream when he enters a locker room at the University of Texas, just to watch the muscle boys scatter. And when he finds another car parked too close to his own, Henry simply nudges it over, as if the offending vehicle were furniture to be rearranged.   He is bringing personality back to a sport tarnished by doping scandals, and eventually, if Henry develops the technique to match his strength in the snatch and in the clean and jerk, he could become the first American superheavyweight to win an Olympic gold medal since Paul Anderson in 1956.   There were six in Henry's party at Kreuz's one day earlier this month, including his mother, Barbara Mass","excerpt":"his aunt, Amy Chaney, and his coach and manager, Terry Todd, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Texas at Austin, where Henry lives and trains. Four pounds of prime rib, three pounds of pork chops and five pounds of link sausage disappeared quickly, but Henry is not a gargantuan eater. Not the way people assume. Some of his weight-lifting friends can go to those all-you-can eat places and devour 70 ounces of steak. Henry said he once ate 50 ounces but had to stop because \\"my face got tired.\\"   His 25-year-old brother, Patrick, tips the scales at 6-2, 285, and excelled on the defensive line at Texas A&M. The brothers were born in Silsbee, in the piney woods of east Texas, but they were not as imposing as their uncles in a family of enormous strength. Chudd Adams stood 6-5, 420, and DeWitt Adams reached 6-7, though he was a bit on the thin side at 320.   \\"You should have seen Uncle Chudd,\\" Henry said last March at the Pan American Games in Argentina. \\"He picked me up when I was a boy, and I cried. He was just so damn big.\\"   The surprising thing about Henry is his agility. He does not have, as his coach said, that \\"constipated crab\\" look of bodybuilders who are sometimes so awkwardly bulky that they appear to be rusted and in need of oil. Henry is fluid, graceful. He can explode off his 16 EEE feet, lift his 400-pound bulk to a rim 10 feet above the ground and dunk a basketball.   But there are many questions to be answered before he can be considered a serious medal contender in the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics. Those around him say Henry must first define his ambitions. Does he want to win a gold medal? Or does he want an acting career? Will he flirt with professional football? Will he gravitate toward strongman exhibitions? He thinks he could draw a crowd by lifting a table laden with 10 or 15 kids, or tossing beer kegs like Frisbees, or lifting cars by the bumper as he once did to his aunt's Pinto, leaving two wheels spinning in the air as she tried to drive home.   At the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, where Henry finished 10th, he was the largest weight lifter in Olympic history at 365 pounds. Now he is 35 pounds heavier. The strength is there. Now it's a matter of refining the technique of sliding his body under the bar in the Olympic disciplines. The world records of 451.75 pounds in the snatch and 558.75 in the clean and jerk are about 61 and 84 pounds more than Henry's best efforts.   \\"Of all the top 10 lifters in the world, Mark is the strongest,\\" said Dragomir Cioroslan, who will coach the United States weight-lifting team at the Atlanta Games. \\"If he's healthy, and he puts in the commitment and energy, he's definitely a medal candidate at any major international competition.\\"   Aside from questions about his motivation and technique, some American officials are concerned that drug use by Henry's competitors may make it even harder for him to earn a medal in Atlanta.   Aleksandr Kurlovich, the two-time Olympic superheavyweight champion from Belarus, was recently suspended for two years after testing positive in Germany for a muscle-building anabolic steroid. Henry has tested clean about 25 times in the past two years, said Todd, Henry's coach, who is a former national champion and onetime user of steroids who now advises against them.   \\"I'm already strong enough without drugs,\\" Henry said. \\"My goal is to lift a weight so high that people on drugs can't even do it.\\"   Always, Barbara Mass remembered, her youngest son had preternatural strength. He weighed 7 pounds at birth, nothing extraordinary, but by six weeks he was eating mashed potatoes and rice, she said. By age 10, Henry weighed 220 pounds. That Christmas, Mass said she bought her sons a set of weights \\"to keep them from destroying each other.\\"   By ninth grade, Henry could dunk a basketball and he put a small crack in a backboard. He did play football, and although he had stamina enough only for several plays in succession, his friends remember a 370-pound offensive lineman who cleared holes like an 18-wheeler on a downhill grade.   His real passion, though, was weight lifting. He read the muscle magazines, saw the ads with the men who could pull trains along a track, worked out so hard that he would have to walk the streets late at night with his mother to work out the cramps, and watched the Olympics on television, wondering whether he would ever be that strong and accomplished.   \\"I didn't want to be big and not be strong,\\" Henry said. \\"I'd like to win a medal at the Olympics. You can be a movie star, but if you don't get any more roles, then you 'used' to be a movie star. You get an Olympic medal, you've always got an Olympic medal.\\"   After lunch, Henry pulled his shirt from his pants for the short drive back to Austin, stuck a B. B. King tape into the cassette player, screamed \\"Lucille!\\" at King's guitar, as King wailed about unrequited love: \\"I buy you a $10 dinner and you say thanks for the snack.\\"   His mother remembered a story about the folly of buying bunk beds for her massive sons. Eventually, she said, she resorted to simple mattresses placed on box springs.   \\"How many beds did you break?\\" Mass asked her son.   \\"Three,\\" Henry replied with a proud laugh, as if this, too, might be some sort of world record.

Perhaps this long overdue opportunity will help to erode our country's widespread ignorance of and unfounded disdain for jazz.   It is not only jazz musicians who correctly understand their music to be a highly sophisticated, challenging and limitless art form. Gunther Schuller, composer, conductor and former president of the New England Conservatory, has made the analysis of jazz a significant part of his career","excerpt":"his authoritative \\"History of Jazz\\" attests to his passionate appreciation for the music and to his recognition of jazz as an unconditionally \\"serious\\" music. Almost every page illustrates some aspect of the richness of jazz, from the subtlety of its rhythmic variations to the artistry required to create a melodic solo extemporaneously over rapidly changing chords.    And the Larousse Encyclopedia of Music (dedicated almost entirely to \\"classical\\" music) goes so far as to call the modern jazz musician \\"a hypersophisticated animal, versed in every harmonic subtlety.\\"   Unfortunately, many Americans, particularly those who regard \\"classical\\" music as the only serious music, do not share the openmindedness of Mr. Schuller and others. At best, they see jazz as a spirited music, which sometimes contributes to a romantic or \\"cool\\" atmosphere, but they scoff at the idea that listening to Duke Ellington, John Coltrane or Pat Methany can be as intellectual an experience as the works of Bach, Mozart or Shostakovich provide. Maybe this sentiment is perpetuated by the association of jazz musicians with smoky night clubs and booze.    Or perhaps people are suspicious of the improvisational emphasis of jazz, mistaking a highly disciplined flexibility and creativity for musical anarchy. Whatever the case, we jazz players can only hope that some day our dedication to the music -- our days and years spent practicing, struggling to improve and keep up with the competition, thinking about the absence of financial reward -- will at least earn us due respect.    I congratulate Lincoln Center for its boldness and hope its efforts get a standing ovation.

The heart of the question is an old one, but this is the first time the Paris film industry has been so violently shaken by such a controversy in public print. The problem was posed by Francis de Croisset, the celebrated author, who is the chief complainant, in a letter originally written to the Paris-Midi, but later picked up in reply, counter-reply and columns of comment by a number of Parisian newspapers.M. de Croisset was referring to the film version of the famous operetta he and the late Robert de Flers wrote, \\"Ciboulette,\\" for which Reynaldo Hahn wrote a musical score which has since become very familiar. In his letter the author explained why he refused to go to the opening night, but certain friends of his having seen it and told him that \\"the scenario was a massacre and the spectacle, for those who knew the stage piece, a grotesque parody\\" he gathered up his courage and went to see it.An Indignant Author.\\"I hoped my friends exaggerated,\\" he wrote. \\"I have just left the Paramount: it was horrible. For my dignity as an author, but even more for the memory of Robert de Flers, I beg you to be kind enough to insert this communication, which will enlighten the public on the truly tragic situation in which the original author of a play can find himself when, ostracized by the pretentiousness of a film director, he has lost all rights to his creation. This is a problem which surpasses any personal considerations, concerns all authors, and imperils the French cinema.\\"M. de Croisset then went on to say that once the rights to his play had been bought he was completely ignored by the producer, scenario writer and director for eight months. At the end of that time he received a copy of the scenario, but since the cast had been chosen and work started weeks before, he refused even to read the text. Two more months of silence were followed by the commencement of a publicity campaign for \\"Ciboulette, by M. Autant-Lara\\" (Claude Autant-Lara was the director). M. de Croisset having successfully demonstrated that \\"Ciboulette\\" was written by him and Robert de Flers, that complaint was heeded.Declined Tickets.The film was finally completed (the writer continued) and a first showing given in the studios, but M. de Croisset was not invited. Six months later, that is to say Nov. 7, he received four tickets for the opening night at the Paramount, which he promptly returned to the producer, \\"not desiring to sanction by my presence a film of which I am entirely ignorant.\\"\\"The interpretation of this film does not enter into the discussion,\\" he says in conclusion. \\"There is no actress or actor in the world who could succeed with a rôle so deformed or a plot so pitiful. I do not even consider that M. Autant-Lara, to whom the company confided discretionary powers, is to be blamed. This young man thinks himself a genius","excerpt":"his awakening is certain to be cruel.\\"The question goes beyond that. My objection is to the business ethics of the cinema, to its habits, which were grafted upon France, but which do not come from its soil; to an aggregation of things against which our Society of Authors and Dramatic Writers has struggled for years. So long as with so-called moral guarantees which are traps and with promises which are decoys firms continue to buy novels and plays as one would buy raw materials, so long as the authors of an original work are not duly supplied with arms to oppose spoliation, so long as they are not directly interested in the production of a film, the future of our film industry is hopeless.\\"Advised Trade Papers.That was the opening gun of the battle which has been raging intermittently for nearly a month. Curiously enough, M. Autant-Lara, doubtless sensing what was coming, took the precaution on the same day to write a letter to various cinema publications stating that his production had been cut and otherwise mauled by the directors of the producing company and that he declined \\"professional responsibility\\" for the film as finally released.With nearly every critic in town discussing the matter, however, it was not allowed to rest there. Except for the usual subsidized \\"criticism,\\" of which there is a great deal in Paris, the published opinions of the film were very low. Certainly the picture did not attract an admiring public, for after a week one ceased to hear of it. Your correspondent can vouch for the fact that one audience, at least, gave evidence of finding it extremely bad.500,000 Francs for Play.In its first phase the controversy seems to have been ended by a final letter which M. Autant-Lara issued to the press. It had a Gallic frankness and logic which presumably was unanswerable. M. de Croisset, he pointed out, had received no less than 500,000 francs in cash for the rights to \\"Ciboulette.\\" The producers, having paid that much for it, considered their obligation to M. de Croisset ended, and also that the play was henceforth theirs to do what they pleased with.Thus ended the particular aspect of the quarrel; from now on it is the general principle of authors' rights which will be threshed out. Meanwhile the process of turning plays into films goes industriously on. The French screen is more than merely dominated by pictures derived from plays; there is almost nothing else to be found. Needless to say, the result is as often satisfactory to the author as not, \\"Ciboulette\\" fortunately being an extreme case.

Pop music is usually so desperate to mark off an identity for itself -- to keep its constituency -- that it inevitably alienates someone for whom the signs of class or ethnicity are offensive. It's hard to imagine too many people being put off by Mr. Nascimento, even though he does sing in Portuguese. At the Ritz, he exuded the desire to please, and backed it up with a set of beautiful melodies that floated along on a rounded, burbling rhythm section.   At times Mr. Nascimento's eagerness led him into perilous territory","excerpt":"his ballads came off as saccharine, almost verging on the emotional simplicity of Broadway or Las Vegas. But at their best -- and Mr. Nascimento worked through selections from his new album, \\"Txai,\\" as well as several decades worth of older material -- the pieces mixed melodic sensuality with rhythmic ingenuity, yielding music that was complicated and listenable.   Mr. Nascimento has become interested in the fate of the Amazon jungle, and many of the pieces he performed were either directly related to the destruction of the rain forest -- and the human toll that accompanies it -- or tangentially related. He dedicated one song, originally about John Lennon, to the rubber tapper and slain activist Chico Mendoza. He made references to the beauty of the forest, and to trips he'd taken and people he'd met traveling the rivers. None of this felt intrusive, and by the end of the show, the audience, which was there for his hits, had found a special type of euphoria that had more to do with a party than with explicit politics.

A prominent socialist writer and author on trade union issues, died in New York City May 1 of a heart attack at the age of 84. He had lived in Manhattan for the past thirty years. Attracted to a revolutionary and democratic variety of socialism often associated with the Socialist Party of Eugene V. Debs and the militant Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) as well as the idealism of the early Communist movement, Lovell became part of the small international movement led by Leon Trotsky known as the Fourth International. His political commitment and analytical insight were widely appreciated in left-wing and labor circles-as were his warmth, avid intellectual curiosity, adroit sense of humor, and engaging interest in persons of all ages and backgrounds. He was born on July 24, 1913, in Ipava, Illinois, a farming town where his father was a local entrepreneur. In the early 1930's Lovell attended the University of California's radical Berkeley campus, earning a Bachelor's Degree in philosophy. He was drawn into the socialist movement just after the San Francisco general strike, joining the Workers Party of the United States, led by James P. Cannon and A.J. Muste, in 1935. He consequently became a seaman and an organizer for the Sailor's Union of the Pacific. In 1938, Lovell was a founding member of the Socialist Workers Party, & for many years played a leading role in that organization, especially as a trade union activist. For a number of years he served on national leadership bodies of the SWP. He wrote extensively for socialist publications on labor issues and other matters, and under the pen-name Frederick Lang wrote a classic-''Maritime!'' (New York: Pioneer Publishers, 1943). In Portland, Oregon in the late 1940s he edited ''The Defender'', a rankand-file paper opposing the conservatism and anti-left purges triumphing throughout the maritime industry and unions. In the early 1950s Frank moved to Detroit with his wife Sarah and their infant daughter, Joan. There he became an auto worker and a member of the United Auto Workers. With close friends, George & Dorothea Breitman, Frank and Sarah played an especially significant role in the Detroit labor and socialist movements of the 1950s and 1960s. They initiated and maintained for many years the influential Friday Night Socialist Forum (later called the Militant Forum), a weekly series tht drew a broad range of prominent trade unionists and workingclass militants, civil rights and black liberation activists, scholars, intellectuals, students and others. They also ran openly socialist electoral campaigns-such as Frank's campaigns for Governor of Michigan on the SWP ticket in 1954, 1958 and 1964. In the late 1960s they moved to New York City, where Frank served as the Socialist Workers Party's trade union director. Expelled with hundreds of others from the SWP in the early 1980s, Lovell initiated publication of ''Bulletin In Defense Of Marxism'' in December of 1983.

He has also been known to contradict himself and produce a somewhat bewildering musical picture. A case in point was the Schubert Piano Sonata in B flat, played on the second half of his program Friday night. Mr. Zimerman had the technique and control for Schubert's easeful spans of sound, but the argument went awry at several crucial points.   At the outset of the first movement, for example, the main theme foundered amid unnecessary spells of rubato: the bass trill in the eighth bar, which should rumble beneath an even surface, failed to play its unsettling role. Then, later in the movement, Mr. Zimerman undercut major events with inexpressive articulation: the forte statement of the main theme did not roll in with the right leisurely grandeur (the tempo was slightly too fast throughout), and the momentous triple-piano re-entry of this same theme in the development slid past without a shiver of epiphany.

Sir Charles Delme-Radcliffe."},{"year":"1964","title":"THE exquisite skill with a camera that Ermanno Olmi showed in his first feature film, \\"The Sound of Trumpets\\" (\\"Il Posto\\"), which opened here last fall, is evident again in his second, entitle \\"The Fiancés.\\" But this time his use of the camera is for a diametrically opposite effect.In the first film, Mr. Olmi gives us an onlooker's view of a Milanese working-class youngster applying for and getting his first job with a big industrial organization. We are permitted to watch the youth as he goes through the nervous business of tests and interviews, has a modest encounter with a girl who is also trying to get a job, gets himself slotted as a messenger and finally is promoted to be a clerk.It is a strictly objective observation, from the outside looking in, with no comment whatsoever from the camera as to how the boy feels. But from what the camera shows us — from the long looks it gives us of the lad in various tense situations and from the myriad details it absorbs — the viewer is induced to have feelings of understanding, compassion and sympathy.But in this second film, \\"The Fiancés,\\" which opened at Cinema II yesterday after having had one presentation at the New York Film Festival last fall, Mr. Olmi is using his camera to suggest the feelings and moods of a man in a lonely situation as he experiences them. Now the recording camera is inside looking out, and the viewer is thus in the singular position of the man.He, too, is a working-class person, a young bachelor who takes a job on what appears to be a power-plant construction project in a remote part of Sicily, leaving his widowed father and his girl friend in northern Italy. The whole film, except for a short scene of farewell between the couple at the start, is a sort of poetic exposition of the loneliness and nostalgia of the man.It builds, through a subtle terracing of casual, commonplace images of the day-to-day life in the Sicilian outpost, a sense of the boredom of the man, his weariness and irritation at the contentment of people he doesn't know, his anger at fellow workers who play harmless practical jokes on him.He feels an unsettling depression (and so, as a consequence, do we) when he walks among the celebrants at a costume carnival. (Mr. Olmi seems to have a disposition to see cheerlessness in festivals","excerpt":"his best scene in \\"The Sound of Trumpets\\" is of an office party that goes sour.) Then the hero goes home and sees, through the slats of a Venetian blind, a dismal imagination of his girl at a carnival.So it goes in his exile. On Sunday the churchbells ring and he walks in wistful isolation through the streets of the town. He sees the impersonal beauties of the countryside—windmills in barren salt ponds, sunsets beyond the seaside town, sparks from welders' torches showering from a steel construction job.Finally, he works up the courage to call his girl on the telephone, and this briefly elevates his spirits. But we leave him standing in the rain.Mr. Olmi has a remarkable ability to make images speak and to stimulate emotion with the interrelated use of sound. Churchbells, scraps of music, a blaring radio—all sorts of sounds become ingredients in his compositions of moods. And he poses and paces his actors for strong emotional effects.Carlo Cabrini, starting out with a sad, almost tragic face makes a tense and vibrant vessel for discomfort and loneliness; Anna Canzi is boignant as the plain, inarticulate girl. Others, all nonprofessional actors, move within the scenes, playing their roles as participants almost for scenic effect.What is the sum toal of it? A profound agitation of mood, but still a limited recreation of a private experience. It does not have the large-scale social comment and implications of irony that are tenderly muted by \\"The Sound of Trumpets.\\" It voices a personal sigh. Very few English subtitles are need to translate the dialogue.Braving a strong snow flurry, a capacity crowd filled the 291-seat Cinema II for the first presentation of \\"The Finacés\\" yesterday at 1 P.M.In an experimental policy believed to be without precedent in the metropolitan area, the rugoff circuit, owners of the theater, charged no admission for the opening day of the movie's premiere engagement.Several hundred persons were turned away for each performance of the Italian import and lines formed outside waiting for the theater to empty after the end of the showing. A spokesman for Cinema II said that the viewers were predominantly young people and film connoisseurs. By midafternoon, the line for \\"The Fiancés\\" paralleled that of \\"Tom Jones\\" at the adjacent Cinema I.Yesterday's admission-free opening represented an attempt by the Rugoff chain to establish Ermanno Olmi, the Italian scenarist-director, as an American box-office attraction.Mr. Olmi's first feature, \\"The Sound of Trumpets,\\" opened at Cinema II last year to excellent reviews and poor public response.

A former U.S. Ambassador and Editor and Publisher of the Santa Fe New Mexican for more than half a century, died of pneumonia Sunday night at New York Hospital. He was 90. He was a diplomat, corporate director, conservationist, veteran and poet. McKinney served by appointment to five presidents: As Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Interior, as U.S. Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency at Vienna, as U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland and held two appointments in the U.S. Treasury Department. McKinney bought the Santa Fe New Mexican in 1949. Due to health problems from the high altitude McKinney sold the company to Gannette Co. in 1976, retaining the right to continue as editor and publisher. After a protracted and celebrated court battle, which he won, McKinney resumed management of the Newspaper in 1987 and repurchased the property in 1989. At one time, he owned four newspapers: The Taos (N.M.) News, The Las Vegas (N.M.) Optic in Las Vegas, N.M., The Monte Vista (Colo.) Journal and the Santa Fe New Mexican. The Taos News is now owned by his daughter, Robin Martin, whose succeeds him as head of The New Mexican. Born in Shattuck, Okla., August 28, 1910, McKinney grew up in Amarillo, TX, the son of a minister. His father Edwin McKinney was a descendent of Colin McKinney, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence. His mother, Eva, was the daughter of Robert Moody, a trader on the Santa Fe Trail. McKinney graduated from Amarillo High School and was a reporter for the Amarillo Globe News. He received a bachelor's degree, Psi Beta Kappa, from the University of Oklahoma in 1932. Upon graduation, he worked in New York City as an investment analyst at Standard Statistics, now Standard and Poors. He served as a partner in his cousin Robert Young's investment firm from 1934 to 1950 and became successful by investing in bankrupt railroad stock at the depth of the Depression. During WWII McKinney was a Lieutenant Junior Grade in the U.S. Navy. He helped develop the Tiny Tim Rocket and participated in D-Day to observe the devices piercing German tanks. In 1943, he married Louise Trigg, the daughter of a ranching family from Eastern New Mexico. Because of Santa Fe's close proximity to the National Atomic Weapons Labratory at Los Alamos, McKinney became interested in peaceful uses of atomic energy and published a five volume book on the subject. McKinney served on the board of major corporations, including the Rock Island Railroad, International Telephone and Telegraph, Trans World Airlines and Martin Marietta. He was a published poet","excerpt":"His book ''Hymn to Wreckage'' was rated by the New York Times as one of the ten best poetry books in 1947. Mr. McKinney was divorced from Louise Trigg in 1970 and later married Marielle De Mont Mollin who died in 1998.

Per was a social anthropologist initially interested in cognition, but whose restless mind soon wandered to the classic topics of social structure and kinship. He pioneered the use of graph theoretical models in anthropology to greatly enhance our knowledge of the human mind, human society and human history, especially in his beloved Polynesia. The three books he wrote (co-authored with Frank Harary), Island Networks, Exchange in Oceania, and Structural Models in Anthropology, have been the cornerstones of a new appreciation of kinship in all of social science. Always generous with his time for students and colleagues alike, he was most often found in his office quietly reading in one of a number of languages in which he was fluent or writing another article or book.

It has its own red-herring equivalent to John Brockman's head—in the form of a title that everybody seems to find terribly provocative but that refers more logically to piano pieces for the beginner. And it has a trip—north to Alaska—which is part of a fairly elaborate central metaphor. And it is full of ideas, and a style—in this case, a rigorously deliberate and plain style—that is not less insistent than the canny exuberance of \\"Head.\\"\\"Five Easy Pieces\\" is an open-ended story, like much recent American fiction, satiric in thrust (notice the names in the cast of characters) and elegiac in mood, about a young California oil worker (Jack Nicholson) who travels up to his family's island home on Puget Sound where he sees his dying father, makes a sexual conquest, and visits his past—before heading further north.By inclination the young man is very rootless-contemporary-American, with a country-and-Western loving mistress (Karen Black), beer in the refrigerator, and nights out at the bowling alley. But his family is well-off, musical and eccentric","excerpt":"his brother and sister (Ralph Waite and Lois Smith) concertize; and he himself has given up a career—more or less in the name of aimless integrity. Before he seduces his brother's fiancée (Susan Anspach), he plays for her—an easy piece—but scorns her reaction: \\"I faked a little Chopin. You faked a little response.\\"Something of this exchange carries into my feeling about \\"Five Easy Pieces,\\" which at first appears to be rich with a quantity of felt life, but on reflection seems both more carefully studied and more coldly casual than profoundly understood. In all non-essentials it is movie-making of a very high order. But scene by scene I find myself moving from sympathy, to admiration, to respect—for a performance, for Laslo Kovacs's evocative photography, or merely for the superior quality of the color film used in capturing the soft, wet lovely ambience of the Pacific Northwest.The acting is generally good, but except for Karen Black's pathetically appealing vulgarian, it lives in bits and pieces, rather than in a quality of sustained characterization. Almost everybody in \\"Five Easy Pieces\\" is a caricature but plays for all-round sentiment, and in context the one pointedly funny single-dimension role (Helena Kallianiotes as a tough Lesbian hitchhiker on her way to Alaska to escape America's accumulated filth) looks like a tour de force.\\"Five Easy Pieces\\" is built around a series of good-bys. As the central character divests himself of responsibilities, of people and possessions, finally of the coat off his back (rather too pointedly—just before hitching his own symbolic ride North) the film grows heavy with a kind of poignancy that for all its understatement leans heavily on a stock of quite unearned response.Rafelson is expert at supporting this movement, and the film proceeds from scene to scene with a quiet competent modernism that bespeaks quality, but that more often begs than provides expression. Greater things seem always to be in the offing. But I think they are an illusion. \\"Five Easy Pieces\\" is a film that takes small risks and provides small rewards.
