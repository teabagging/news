His manner suggests that if it takes being President to carry out his deeply held ideas - by golly, he'll just have to be President.    The Reagan style also contrasts with that of the Democratic nominee. The people who know him best could not imagine the Republican nominee concluding a speech with Walter F.

A childhood refugee from the \\"wrecked world\\" of the Holocaust, Isaac came to New York an orphan, reinvented himself as a bon vivant, married well and found a measure of fame and fortune as a rigorously independent champion of literary books that wouldn't be caught dead on a best-seller list. By the late 1980's, when Mr. Baitz's play unfolds, Isaac has long since been a brand name in the culture industry. He is one of those survivors, of post-war American intellectual firestorms no less than Old Europe's bloodbaths, who run Manhattan with an iron tongue.   Isaac is such a familiar type that one could draft an extensive list of actual literary power brokers -- no names will be named here -- who share some or most of his childhood background, professional resume, neo-conservative politics and cosmopolitan accent. But to recognize a Manhattan archetype is not the same thing as knowing one, and it is the searing achievement of \\"The Substance of Fire\\" that it keeps chipping and chipping away at its well-worn, well-defended protagonist until finally he and the century that shaped him and then reshaped him are exposed to the tragic quick. As written with both scrupulous investigative zeal and bottomless sympathy by Mr. Baitz and as acted in a career-transforming performance by Ron Rifkin, Isaac Geldhart is one of the most memorable and troubling characters to appear onstage this season.

Raoul Cedras to give up his tyrant's grip on Haiti shows what a difference decisive commitment can make in American foreign policy. When at long last President Clinton made clear that he meant business, and former President Carter's mission underlined that determination, the game was over for the Haitian military.   \\"This agreement came,\\" President Clinton said in announcing the news, \\"only because of the credible and imminent threat of the international force\\" that was about to invade Haiti.   The denouement is a critical victory for a politically battered Bill Clinton. He came to the point of ordering an invasion of Haiti with evident reluctance, without asking Congress and against what polls said the public wanted. It was a very large gamble and it worked.    The fact that Gen. Colin Powell and Senator Sam Nunn were part of the Carter mission that Mr. Clinton sent to Haiti makes the result even happier for him politically. General Powell wears no party's label but has been eyed by Republicans as a potential candidate. Senator Nunn is the most important Southern Democrat in Congress.    As the American and other forces go in, Haiti still remains a potential policy minefield. But at least we are past the long, dismal example of classic failure in foreign policy: the failure to decide.    General Cedras and his colleagues overthrew Haiti's elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on Sept. 30, 1991. That posed a choice for American policy. We could work vigorously to undo the coup and restore Haiti's legitimate Government, or we could decide that what happened in Haiti did not engage the deepest U.S. interests.   President Bush sounded as if he had chosen the former course. He called the coup a threat to American security and said it would not stand. He demanded \\"an immediate halt to violence and the restoration of democracy.\\" But during the remaining 15 months of his Presidency Mr. Bush made no real effort to oust the Haitian military regime.   President Clinton, after he took office, shifted to a policy of negotiating with General Cedras for a settlement that would bring President Aristide back but give the military guarantees of safety. Negotiations took place on Governors Island in New York, and agreement was reached there on July 3, 1993. The plan called for President Aristide to return to Haiti on Oct. 30.   In the months between the Governors Island agreement and the scheduled date of President Aristide's return, there were many signals that General Cedras had no intention of doing what he had promised. The so-called \\"attaches,\\" killers directed by the military, murdered numbers of civilians in Port-au-Prince and assassinated a leading Aristide supporter.   But the Clinton Administration proceeded as if it believed Governors Island would be carried out. In October the Defense Department sent a U.S. ship, the Harlan County, to Haiti with 175 American and 25 Canadian soldiers who were supposed to train Haitian security forces for President Aristide's return.   On Oct. 11, 1993, as the Harlan County arrived in the harbor, armed goons and uniformed policemen demonstrated on the docks, beating civilians and shouting against the United States. The Clinton Administration ordered the Harlan County to leave.   That, surely, was the moment for decision. President Clinton could have ordered an immediate strike. A small invasion force, entirely adequate to round up the military leaders and their thugs, could have been quickly assembled. Congress and the public would have supported that response to the deliberate insulting of the United States. But Mr. Clinton did not act.   Nearly another year passed, with Americans unpersuaded that President Clinton had the determination or the power to act. Then he made the decision to invade, and the drama quickly changed.   This is President Clinton's moment, without wanting to quibble at that one may express the hope that from this episode will arise a new decisiveness in American foreign policy. The next best place to apply it is Bosnia. Abroad at Home","excerpt":"Resolution Matters"},{"year":"1947","title":"Council discussion U.N.

The President's choice of pursuing strategic defenses through S.D.I. rather than limiting them through the ABM treaty is the path of folly because nuclear weapons are too powerful and too numerous to be successfully defended against.
