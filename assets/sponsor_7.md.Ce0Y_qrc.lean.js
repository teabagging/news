After more than 40 years of performing -- moving from rhythm-and-blues  party anthems in the late 50's and 60's to bedroom ballads in the 70's -- they still have music all over the pop charts. This includes not only albums and singles they make music on (their new record, \\"Mission to Please\\" on T-Neck/Island","excerpt":"R. Kelly's Jeep anthem \\"Down Low\\"; Quincy Jones's \\"Q's Jook Joint\\" album, and the soundtrack to \\"Friday\\") but also recordings they influenced, by everyone from the Beatles to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony to Boyz II Men.         On Saturday night, the Isley Brothers showed one reason for their longevity:  their willingness to accept new pop music and then to capitalize on the debt that the music owes them. Over a fluid backdrop provided by four synthesizer players sporting black bowlers, the group performed songs written by modern rhythm-and-blues Lotharios like Babyface, Keith Sweat and Mr. Kelly, in addition to reclaiming \\"Holding Back the Years,\\" by Simply Red.

It bears the title of \\"The Village of Sin\\" and happens to be the first Soviet film to be directed by a woman, whose name is Olga Preobrazhenskya. One is perhaps justified in assuming that the drama of this subject has been materially weakened by the editing and cutting it received for showing in this country.Much of this production is interesting, however, for there is fine acting, a variety of types and impressive stretches depicting the traditions and customs in the dour lives of these people. But the morbid nature of the story, with a treacherous tyrant who betrays his son's wife while the young man is fighting in the trenches is apt to kill the effect of part of the picture. Vassili Shironin, as this hard character is known, succeeds most of the time in striking fear into the hearts of those around him. He is a farmer who objects to his daughter marrying a smudgy blacksmith. He wills that his son shall wed, and therefore takes the timid young man to the place where the youth may claim from among several girls the one he wishes to make his bride.Shironin's daughter defies her father and goes forth to live with the blacksmith, to whom she can't be married without the paternal consent, which is withheld.The story is too morbid to call for concentration. It is better to think of the scenes of undulating golden wheat, with mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, all working together. It is more stimulating to think of the clear eyes of some of the participants, of their even white teeth, which, incidentally Olga Preobrazhenskya takes trouble to bring to the attention of the spectator.Olga Preobrazhenskya has directed parts of this picture in an intelligent fashion, but the tragic ending of the victim of her father-in-law is like pulling on the heart with hawsers or using the onion to obtain effect from the lachrymal glands. She has, however, elicited sterling work from the players, notable A. Yastrebitsky, who impersonates the villainous father","excerpt":"R. Puzhnaya and E. Tscssarskaya, who interpret the r√¥les of two girls, and M. Savelyef, who acts the smudgy blacksmith.Olga Preobrazhenskya was at one time an actress in the Moscow Art Theatre group. She was subsequently with Meirhold and Tairov in their modern conception of theatre work. She directed a number of plays, and after the revolution joined the staff of the Moscow Film Institute.After this picture there comes a most distressing comedy, the fun in which consists in characters dashing from pillar to post and winding up in a black pool conveniently placed near a curb.
