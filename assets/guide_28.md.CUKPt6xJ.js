Now a signal honor has also been bestowed on Emma Lazarus, the noted New York poet who helped her fellow-Americans fully discern the purpose of the monument. Miss Lazarus, author of the so-called ''Statue of Liberty Poem,'' has been chosen for induction into the Jewish-American Hall of Fame in Berkeley, Calif. To mark the occasion a special new medal has been issued in her honor.\\n\\n Born to wealth in 1849 and raised in the lap of luxury, Emma Lazarus seemed to have little in common with the immigrant bands that landed in New York Harbor. Indeed, for most of her life she paid little heed to the turmoil and travail that impelled them to search for refuge in the bosom of a new homeland.\\n\\nMiss Lazarus first attracted favorable public attention in 1867 at the age of 18, with the publication of a volume entitled ''Poems and Translations.'' Famed author Ralph Waldo Emerson praised this work and offered advice and encouragement, so in 1871 the young poet gratefully dedicated her second book, ''Admetus and Other Poems,'' to Emerson. She went on to produce several other volumes of both poetry and prose which were, in the words of one commentator, ''pleasant, cosmopolitan in flavor, sometimes excellent, but lacking in real distinction.''
