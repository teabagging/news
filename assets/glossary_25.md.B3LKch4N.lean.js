Richard Dix, the star of this picture, is customarily a hero of the than-whom-none variety. He is a member of the order in good standing, and it would be a mere nothing for him to wipe the dust with a score of desperadoes or whip a bull elephant with one hand tied behind his back.His adventures in \\"The Lucky Devil\\" are therefore remarkable. They do all sorts of things to him, and he stands them without once flashing his badge or pulling his card in Heroes' Local No. 444. What's more, he seems to like it. This is passing strange, also more than a little refreshing. It is, in other words, proof that this picture broadcasts, on a wave any human receiver can get.It is only fair, however, that the star should take his share of the feeling, because more or less everybody concerned is fooled in one way or another before the picture gets through. The director and scenarist must have been in merry mood when they concocted this confection. It begins by fooling the audience. The first picture shows Randy Farman (Richard Dix) preparing a sleeping bag in front of an automobile out where the woods are woods. You no sooner get that than the camera moves the foreground toward you and you find Farman is a sporting goods salesman demonstrating outdoors goods in a department store sale. Rather an effective entrance for the story, if not for the star.Farman wins the automobile that figures in the demonstration in a charity raffle and sets out for the open spaces. Here he meets the girl, Doris McKee (Esther Ralston). She is traveling with an aunt who for a time forestalls their arrangement to voyage in company. They get to the county fair town, both broke. Farman enters his prize auto in the road race, and to get the entrance fee stays two rounds in the ring with a sideshow fighter. Then, of course, he wins the race—if it is necessary to impart that information.All this sounds as though it might be a little trying, but it is not. Quite the contrary. Director and star take it all in a humorous tempo, and there are constant little flashes of humorous and original action. Brains went into this picture. And part of the brains was devoted to illustrating the principle that the voice with the smile wins, provided always it speaks in thoroughly human accents. There is not a single highfalutin' moment in this film, thanks be.In the beginning the reviewer intended to list the things they did to the hero to prove he is not oppressively heroic. But you had better see them yourself. Let a single instance suffice. When Farman goes in to earn his $200 by staying two rounds in the ring with the prize fighter does he knock said bruiser all over the lot as any hero would who held to the highest ideals of his profession? He does not. He just manages to stay on his feet. When the final bell sounds you see him on the ropes covering up against a merciless shower of rights and lefts and barely surviving.

The flight is so remarkable that the owner of the \\"Spirit of Goldberg\\" decides to engage Cohan and Cohen to pilot his machine for him in the great race.The other truly laughable episode is where the friendly enemies are once more up in the air, the machine being steered by a man who happens to have spent the latter part of his life in a lunatic asylum.The queer aviator decides that he has too much weight aboard so he asks Mr. Cohan to jump off, handing that startled gentleman a bag as he gives the order. Now neither Cohan nor Cohen is a master of spelling, but they have an intuition that b-a-1-l-a-s-t does not spell parachute.Both Mr. Sidney and Mr. Murray do quite well in this vigorous comic endeavor.

Especially impressive are the pirogis ($5.25), varenikis ($4.95) and pelminis ($4.95), dumplings of various sizes and shapes. These kissing cousins to wontons and raviolis are stuffed with minced meat, chicken, potato, mushrooms, cheese or even cherry, and often topped with sauteed or fried onions. Blinis, the blintz-shaped buckwheat-yeast Russian pancakes, are another agreeable appetizer option.

I expect relatives from Europe to visit in the spring. Are there air passes for foreign tourists similar to Eurailpasses? -- Elisabeth H. Nebehay, New York, N.Y.     A.  Most United States-based airlines that fly from Asia or Europe to the United States offer discounted travel for foreigners. Generally these consist of booklets of coupons, sold at the airlines' offices overseas, where buyers must present proof of residence. As a rule, each coupon can be used for one flight","excerpt":"making a connection to a second flight requires another coupon. Usually, coupons must be used within 60 days after using the first one or 120 days after arrival in the United States, whichever comes first.   The examples cited are for those flying in on trans-Atlantic flights; there are similar programs for those flying from Asia. The prices are for coupons to be used in the continental United States and Canada; coupons for Alaska, Hawaii, Mexico and the Caribbean cost more.   Generally, to buy coupons for domestic flights, passengers must fly into the United States on the airline they travel on. However, in American Airlines's Visit U.S.A. program, travelers not flying in on American can buy its coupons, though at a higher price. American sells a minimum of three and maximum of eight coupons. Except for the summer, when prices will be higher, coupons cost $100 each in conjunction with an American Airlines trans-Atlantic ticket and $130 without one. (Tickets are sold in local currencies, so prices may vary according to the exchange rate.) Those using coupons must reserve the first trip inside the United States before arriving here. Subsequent flights can be booked at any time.    Northwest has a variety of options. One is a two-coupon pass costing $186 in most countries; all reservations must be made before arriving in the United States. A second is a package of four coupons, for which an itinerary must be set before leaving; there is a $50 charge for changes made after arrival. The cost is $379 ($399 in July and August), with additional coupons $35 each. A third option is the Open Pass, $439 for four coupons for which reservations can be made at any time. Each additional booklet of four coupons is $140. There is also a Standby Pass by which overseas travelers, flying standby, can travel unlimited mileage in the continental United States and Canada for 30 days for $399.    The United Airlines program offers 3 to 10 coupons, for routes that travelers establish before they leave, though the dates are left open for all but the first. The price depends on the itinerary. As one example, using four coupons to fly from Chicago to San Francisco, then to San Diego, back to San Francisco and then to Chicago, would cost $415.  L.A. Museums by Bus    Q.     I will be in San Diego for a month and want to take a train to Los Angeles and visit the Getty and Huntington museums and the Museum of Contemporary Art. How can I get to them from the train station? -- Frances Hunt, Madison, Wis.       A.  The Museum of Contemporary Art is housed in two buildings. One of them, in a converted warehouse called MOCA the Temporary Contemporary, is at Central Avenue and First Street, about a 15-minute walk from Union Station. From there, you can get to the museum's other building, at 250 South Grand Avenue, via the Downtown Area Short-Hop (DASH) shuttle, for 25 cents one way, from First and Central to Grand Street, a long block's walk to the museum. The shuttles run each six to eight minutes every day but Sunday.  Museum of Contemporary Art, 150 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, Calif. 90012; (213) 621-2766.   To get to the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino get the No. 79 bus at Alameda and Macy near the train station and get off at Huntington Drive and San Marino Avenue in San Marino, three blocks from the Huntington. The bus costs $1.10 and takes roughly 30 minutes. A cab is $22 each way, according to the museum. Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens, 1151 Oxford Road, San Marino, Calif. 91108; (818) 405-2141.    To get to the J. Paul Getty Museum from Union Station you can take the No. 2 bus from Broadway and Sunset Boulevard, near the station, which takes about an hour and 50 minutes to get to Sunset Boulevard and the Pacific Coast Highway, the closest stop, a half-mile from the museum. The cost is $1.10. In the morning, there is an express bus, No. 434, costing $2.30, which runs from Alameda and Macy Streets at 6:18 A.M., 6:58 A.M. and 7:53 A.M., taking about an hour and five minutes to get to Sunset Boulevard and the Pacific Coast Highway. Passengers going to the Getty must get a museum pass from the bus driver. The No. 434 leaves the Pacific Coast Highway and Sunset Boulevard at 3:20, 4:26 and 5:06 P.M. Cabs between the museum and Union station are roughly $30, a museum official said. J. Paul Getty Museum, 17985 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu, Calif. 90265; (213) 458-2003.

Olson-Travelworld has been named the sole ticket distributor in the United States for tickets for events in the winter and summer Olympic games. The company says it will issue a brochure late this month listing events and prices and will put tickets on sale some time next month. The company will also offer accommodations packages of from one to three weeks. A weeklong package at either event will be about $3,000 not including tickets or air fare, the company said. The company is taking names of those who wish to get information: Olson Travelworld, Post Office Box 92734, Los Angeles, Calif. 90009; (800) 874-1992. East German Marks    Q.     Fifteen years ago while in West Berlin, I traveled to East Berlin nearly every day. I did not return the unspent portion of my converted currency but smuggled it back to the west.

The deadline for the exchange of East German money into West -- now all-German -- marks for foreigners expired July 13 (with an extension for special cases until Nov. 30). To change the money, you would have had to open an account at an East German bank and pay your East German marks into that account. There was no exchange of cash.

To some, the future will indeed witness the end of history, the end of time, the death of God and the novel. The future, as they see it, will be a post-nuclear wasteland, inhabited by rag-tag bands of refugees, bereft of language and memory, and thrown back on primitive skills of survival. Other writers -- a minority, it must be said -- envision a more utopian future, in which science and human wisdom serve as midwives to a brave new world of global harmony and hope.   In Julian May's new novel, \\"Jack the Bodiless\\" (Alfred A. Knopf), the 21st century witnesses, at least temporarily, a new era of peace throughout the universe, in which earthlings develop amazing new metapsychic abilities under the watchful eye of solemn, green-skinned guardians. If the novel's galactic vision owes something to \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Star Trek,\\" Marge Piercy's new novel, \\"He, She and It\\" (Knopf), takes its cue from cyberpunk fiction, as well as such movies as \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and \\"The Terminator.\\" The book depicts a 21st-century America in which anthropomorphic cyborgs (robotlike creatures made of computer components with \\"human implants\\") can mingle and make love with human beings, and threaten to develop minds of their own.

As schools and public-health officials across the country increasingly realize, teen-agers are a high-risk group. There is a deadly virus at large. It does not discriminate about whom it will infect. Awareness and precautions are crucial.   This is the message of \\"In the Shadow of Love: A Teen AIDS Story,\\" an unusual collaborative project involving PBS and ABC. The film will be shown on Channel 13 tonight at 8 and tomorrow at 4 P.M. as an \\"ABC Afterschool Special.\\" Underlining the message's seriousness, the film is being promoted in English and Spanish public-service announcements by Surgeon General Antonia Novello.   The fictional story focuses on two students at Paul Revere High School in a small city. Katie Dunn (Jennifer Dundas), anchor for the school's television news team, is spirited and ambitious. Lisa Diaz (Lisa Vidal), returning to school after having dropped out, is street-smart and wary. Planning a journalism project, Katie considers doing a television essay about students in the 90's. Lisa, who has just discovered that her gay younger brother has tested HIV-positive, suggests a report on youngsters with AIDS, all types of teen-agers who happen to be infected.

On Tuesday night at the Village Vanguard, Mr. McLean showed off the intense, hard tone that has been his most consistent companion since he picked up the alto saxophone, determined to make it sound like a tenor.         For years his sextet has emphasized hard bop, mining waltzes, sambas, ballads and even hymnlike numbers for material. Tuesday night was no exception. The first set, opening Mr. McLean's six-day engagement, started tentatively with a bluesy piece featuring all the members of his sextet: Raymond Williams on trumpet, Steve Davis on trombone, Allen Palmer on piano, Phil Bowler on bass, and Eric McPherson on drums plus Mr. McLean's son Rene, who plays the alto, tenor and soprano saxophones. Later, in a gentle moment, father and son, both on alto, traded fours in a fast, dissonant waltz that toyed with \\"Tea for Two,\\" Jackie McLean playing strong and lyrical to Rene's high and wild flurries. The son followed his father's controlled solo with respectful swagger. It was no Oedipal struggle.
