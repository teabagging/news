A new member of the top 10 this week is &#8220","excerpt":"Hefter Skelter&#8221; by Vincent Bugliosi with Curt Gentry, which has sold 65,000 copies thus far, Norton says. It's a Book&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Month Club selection, and it's also about a sensational murder case &#8212; the Tate&#8208;LaBianca mass killings for which Charles Manson and some of his &#8220;family&#8221; were convicted. We talked with co&#8208;author Bugliosi, the Los Angeles D.A. who prosecuted the case (he's now in private practice and finishing up another book), and he spoke of it as volubly as if it happened only yesterday. Although he had successfully prosecuted 14 other murders, it was Mr. Bugliosi's biggest case; but when he first took over, the evidence was so weak that a Los Angeles sheriff's deputy commiser?? with him on being handed a &#8220;bummer.&#8221; Mr. Bugliosi did his own investigating, working 100 hours a week, and prepared meticulously, concentrating on his final summation first. The three key elements of proof were motive (Manson's vision of &#8220;helter skelter&#8221;&#8212;a race war triggered by the atrocious murders he ordered), domination (enabling Manson to order family members to out the killings) and the testimony of Linda Kasabian, the only witness to the murders who cooperated with the prosecution. He reminisced about his court&#8208;room t&#233;te&#8208;&#224;&#8208;t&#233;tes with Manson. &#8220;We'd rap sarcastically,&#8221; in off moments, he recalled and Manson once told him that &#8220;he couldn't care less&#8221; about his female co&#8208;defendants on trial with him. &#8220;I've had girls that made them look like men,&#8221; he boasted. Mr. Bugliosi characterized Manson variously as &#8220;evil,&#8221; &#8220;a sophisticated con man&#8221; and, quoting his disciples, &#8220;&#8216;a heavy dude.&#8217;&#8221; He thought the family members had considerable &#8220;homicidal rage&#8221; inside them in order to carry out the murders; others in Manson's menage&#8212;notably Linda Kasabian&#8212;refused to kill. The Manson case was distinct in the annals of American crime because he importuned others to murder for him and because the victims were &#8220;faceless,&#8221; chosen as establishment symbols. Manson was an intelligent man (I.Q. 121), his mind aboil with Nazism, satanism, scientology and emanations from the Beatles' songs. Prison was his only home. When it was all over, he told Mr. Bugliosi, &#8220;You haven't accomplished anything.

As the Olympic silver medalist in the giant slalom last year in France, Roffe-Steinrotter came to the Subaru United States Alpine championships here this week with a reputation as big as all outdoors. But she had been on a losing streak, despite her domination of the national event last year with gold medals in three events.    That changed today, the last day for the women in this competition. Roffe-Steinrotter, a 25-year-old skier from Potsdam, N.Y., streaked down a course laced with 45-mile-an-hour gusts of wind, and blowing snow. She finished first, with a total from two runs of 2 minutes 8.04 seconds. In second-place was Julie Parisien, of Auburn, Me., in 2:09.12","excerpt":"Heidi Voelker, of Pittsfield, Mass., was third in 2:09.57. No Sense Complaining    The women competed in conditions that Parisien said would have caused World Cup officials to cancel a race. But Roffe-Steinrotter said the weather turned out to be an advantage.   \\"I grew up in the East,\\" she said, referring to the cold, icy slopes where she learned to ski. \\"Let other people stand up at the top and complain. It doesn't make much sense when you have a job to do.\\"   It has been a tough year for Roffe-Steinrotter. She has not been able to duplicate her 1992 season, which included a spectacular run on the World Cup circuit and a No. 3 ranking in the world giant slalom standing.   \\"For me, maybe I have been trying too hard,\\" Roffe-Steinrotter said. \\"My expectations at the beginning of the season were too high. Maybe I put too much pressure on myself and forgot to ski with the freedom you need to ski with.\\" A Trying Year    The 21-year-old Parisien has also overcome a trying year. Ranked No. 1 in the world in slalom at the beginning of this season, she won the first World Cup slalom, at Park City, Utah. But she was sidelined temporarily in January with a knee injury, and is still reeling from the death in December of her brother, Jean Paul.    But in the championships here, Parisien regained some of her prowess. Besides the giant slalom, she won a silver medal in the super giant slalom, and a bronze in the slalom. She also won a gold medal in the combined, a total of all four events including the downhill.   \\"I'm a little disappointed in my downhill,\\" Parisien said. \\"I was seventh, and I definitely think I should have been in the top five. But over all, I'm psyched. I pulled myself together after being really tired after Japan.\\"   As did the other world-class skiers here, Parisien competed two weeks ago in the world Alpine championships in Shizukuishi, Japan, where she won a silver medal in the slalom. A Near Sweep    This is the third year in a row that Voelker, 23, won a bronze medal at the nationals. \\"I'm very happy with my third-place,\\" she said, noting that the competition has been more intense than in other years.   The United States women's team excelled here, winning 13 of 15 medals. The other two went to Lindsey Roberts of Canada. Picabo Street, of Sun Valley, Idaho, who has emerged lately as a major world-class contender, won the silver in the combined; and Kristi Terzian, of Park City, Utah, won the bronze.   The American men were under much more pressure from the Canadians. So far, the Canadian men's team has won four medals, compared with five for the United States.

Abrams specializes in art books, and in the early 1950's that meant importing most books from Europe. Accordingly, Mr. Landshoff soon set up an Abrams office in Amsterdam. Today, that office is run by his son Andreas, one of his six children, who is vice president of international publishing for Abrams.

She is the lovable but shiftless mistress of a decayed Louisiana plantation in Joshua Logan's \\"The Wisteria... FIRST NIGHT AT THE THEATRE","excerpt":"Helen Hayes Returns in Logan's 'The Wisteria Trees,' Set on a Louisiana Plantation"},{"year":"1952","title":"For her return to a full-length role in movies after an absence of seventeen years, Helen Hayes has regrettably selected and permitted herself to be starred in an extraordinarily positive, impassioned and controversial film. \\"My Son John,\\" produced and directed (as well as planned and written, in part) by the talented Leo McCarey, who is best remembered for his \\"Going My Way,\\" is a picture so strongly dedicated to the purpose of the American anti-Communist purge that it seethes with the sort of emotionalism and illogic that is characteristic of so much thinking these days.Offering the vastly potent person of Miss Hayes in the pitiable role of a mother who has cause to be suspicious that one of her sons is on the Communist fringe, \\"My Son John,\\" which was presented at the Capitol Theatre last night, corresponds with the present public ferment of angry resentment and fear. Not only does it heroize the image of the ranting, song-singing patriot who distrusts and ridicules intellectuals as dangerous perverters of youth, but it falls in completely with the assumption, which has become so perilously prevalent, that guilt is evidenced by association, so far as politics are concerned.Without even seeming to realize it—or, if he does realize it to care—Mr. McCarey has permitted a mother, the ideal of devotion and trust, to revile and condemn her own son for being a Communist on the flimsiest evidence To be sure, the young man has neglected to come home from Washington in time to see his two halfback brothers off to the Korean War. To be sure, he has smirked at his father, in a smug, condescending way, when the old man has loudly boasted his attitude as an Ameriman Legionnaire (if you don't like your Uncle Sammy, then go back to your home o'er the sea—\\"). And he has even questioned his father's stubborn belief in the Bible's literal words. But he has sworn to his mother on the Bible that he is not a Communist.However, suspicion darkens when the mother fearfully learns that her son, a mysterious \\"somebody\\" in Washington, is being investigated by the F. B. I. And she leaps to the dismal conclusion that he is a Communist for sure when she discovers that he has the key to the apartment of a girl who has been arrested and is charged with being a spy. Mind you, the girl has not been convicted, nor is there any more evidence against the son than the possession of the key to her apartment. Yet he stands condemned in everyone's eyes.This is an indication of the hot emotional nature of this film. The normal procedures of justice are forgotten utterly in the haste of Mr. McCarey—and the audience, perhaps—to condemn. And the ominous thing is that such suspicion and drum-head condemnation are espoused when the son, in a post-humous statement, confesses and humbly recants. (His statement is delivered through a recorder at college commencement exercise after the penitent son has been murdered in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial).There are some other things about this picture that may cause a thoughtful person to feel a shudder of apprehension at the militance and dogmatism it reveals—its snide attitude toward intellectuals, its obvious pitch for religious conformity and its eventual whole-hearted endorsement of its Legionnaire's stubborn bigotry. And to make this concern more considerable, there is the fact that the picture is played with remarkable skill at illusion by almost everyone.Miss Hayes is arch and winsome as the middle-aged mother of a brood of sons and the spouse of a husband who is full of crotchets and moods—winsome, that is, until she gives way to harrowing torment and despair and a candidly pathological breakdown that is morbid and mawkish, indeed. Dean Jagger is disturbing as her husband—a man fired with passionate zeal so that he sings that old \\"Uncle Sammy\\" number as though he were a Nazi singing the \\"Horst Wessel\\" song, and yet is possessed of sentiments of the most humble and affectionate sort. As the \\"bad\\" son, the late Robert Walker does an elegantly suave and unctous job, scratching his eyebrows with his little finger and doing other self-revealing things like that, and Frank McHugh is bouncing and pious as a genial parish priest. James Young and Richard Jaeckel are studiously standard and colorless as the dutiful football-playing brothers who go away to war.In the present confused national climate, \\"My Son John\\" may add heat and wind, but it may also startle some people into making a new and sober estimate of things.

Helen Twelvetrees makes a splendid Millie, and the tragic current of her life is made safe for the diversion seeker by the intelligent and ???rood-humored playing of Lilyan Tashman, Robert Ames, John Halliday, Anita Louise and Frank McHugh, among others.The story carries Millie from her first innocent affair of the heart to the day seventeen years later when she shoots an old admirer of hers because he has transferred his attention to her daughter. She begins by eloping with Jack Maitland (James Hall), member of a wealthy New York family. Embittered by his infidelity, she leaves him and throws herself wildly into the feverish nightlife of the city. Up to the point where she pulls a gun to save her daughter's honor, the piece is a series of tragi-comic episodes. Thereafter the narrative goes heavily melodramatic, and the court trial at the end is in the best traditions of screen hokum. 'MILLIE' SHOWN AT MAYFAIR.","excerpt":"Helen Twelvetrees Starred in Film Version of Clarke Novel."},{"year":"1934","title":"In an unimaginative fashion the Mayfair's new film, \\"She Was a Lady,\\" strives to deal with the experiences of a girl whose father, a member of a snobbish English family, had married his mother's maid. Although the early parts of the picture attack the theme intelligently. later episodes are emphatically incredible. The picture appears to have been bolstered up to commercial length by hapless, extraneous episodes, and there is a wholesale changing of minds before the anticipated happy ending is reached.But poor though much of the narrative is, the players give sterling performances, even when they have to struggle with silly incidents. Helen Twelvetrees portrays Sheila Vane, and Donald Woods impersonates Tommy Traill, who is in love with her. Ralph Morgan acts Sheila's father, Stanley Vane, and her mother is played by Doris Lloyd.The Vanes have migrated to Montana and in the opening scenes one sees Stanley returning to his modest homestead intoxicated, that evidently being one indication of his blue blood. His wife, however, is quite lenient with him in her cockney style. During his sober moments, Stanley expresses the wish that Sheila will one day go to England and show his family that she is a lady. It is rather interesting to observe that when Sheila does ring the door bell of the Vane family home, she discovers a haughty woman who, so soon as she learns the girl's name, demands that she leave the place immediately. The master of the house is more sympathetic, but it is a curious muddle, for it appears that Sheila's grandfather on her mother's side is the gray-haired butler.Apparently appreciating the complications that have arisen by her father's marrying a servant, Sheila goes away and the audience knows that it will not be long before she again meets that young American who was in love with her before she sailed for Merry England. There is, however, many a misunderstanding before the attractive Sheila falls into Traill's arms.

Unveiling"},{"year":"1955","title":"THE Roxy unveiled yesterday \\"The Rains of Ranchipur\\" and a properly seasonal ice show on stage as its Christmas gifts to Broadway. Neither is an innovation.It is not this corner's province to analyze the capers being executed by the skaters except to note that the management is reinstituting an entertainment form previously presented at the Roxy from time to time. And, by a coincidence, \\"The Rains of Ranchipur\\" is a remake of the Louis Bromfield novel, \\"The Rains Came,\\" first shown at the Roxy under its original title in 1939.Time and Twentieth Century-Fox do not appear to have worked wonders for Mr. Bromfield's work. It is still largely a romantic saga strikingly over-shadowed by its authentic Pakistani locales and an explosively shattering climactic earthquake and flood photographed in excellent color. And these spectacles are eminently enhanced by the wide-screen vistas of CinemaScope. But the amatory tribulations of the promiscuous Lady Esketh (she's an American heiress who married a title this time) and her regeneration via her great love for a dedicated, handsome Indian physician, are, in the main, thin, transparent and tedious play acting.Although Merle Miller's script is heavy with philosophical passages, they are only surface comments on the people and social issues involved. Lady Esketh and Dr. Safti find themselves desperately in love. Lord Esketh, a weakling, admits he loves his wife, too, but seems willing to let nature take its course. Dr. Safti, on the other hand, naturally is bothered by the fact that he has a love for and duty to Ranchipur, its people and, especially, the wise old Maharani, who reared and loves him deeply. Will the once bored temptress, whose soul now has been cleansed by her first true amour wreck Dr. Safti's future? It's as obvious as an elephant that only an earthquake and the flood rains of Ranchipur can straighten it all out.Credit Richard Burton, as Dr. Safti, and Eugenie Leontovich, as the Maharani, who looks like a tiny, exquisite Hindu figurine, with truly sensitive, dignified and restrained portrayals that often tower above the lines they speak. This is especially notable in the scenes they have together and in some sequences with Lana Turner, who somewhat fitfully portrays Lady Esketh. It might be noted that Miss Turner's wardrobe is superb and that she never looked lovelier. Although her climactic tirade against the Mararani, in which she reveals her reformation, does not quicken the senses, she effectively delineates soul-sickness in earlier scenes.Michael Rennie's characterization of the playboy Lord Esketh is only rarely revealing, and Fred MacMurray, as an expatriate American engineer who is finding surcease in alcohol, seems out of place in Ranchipur. Although he, too, regains courage and purpose from the disaster, he appears to be out of his depth in the role. Joan Caulfield is decorative but a mite mature as the missionary's daughter with whom he falls in love.But director Jean Negulesco and his crew have fashioned a pip of an earthquake and flood. The shock of the temblors as they wreck the palace and town, the ensuing angry rising of the river and the final crashing of the dam amid the screams of the fleeing natives are visually arresting manifestations. In this case they are much bigger than love and well worth the price of admission.Featured on the Roxy's stage show titled \\"Happy Holiday—Anywhere, U. S.

A1    Economists say that because there is no damage even as little as a mile away from the battered shores in affected countries, there is a perverse likelihood that one of the world's largest-ever human disasters may have a relatively marginal economic impact.   A1    So much aid is now piling up in warehouses and on tarmacs around the Indian Ocean that officials are trying to avert a second potential disaster that often strikes in the aftermath of human tragedies: a lack of coordination among those seeking to help.   A9    Rebel Campaign on Iraqi Forces  Insurgents killed 18 members of the Iraqi national guard and a civilian with a suicide car bomb north of Baghdad. Meanwhile, several police officers and local officials were killed in other attacks around the country.   A1    Abbas Makes Plea to Militants  Mahmoud Abbas, the favorite in the impending Palestinian presidential election, visited the northern Gaza Strip and called on militants to stop firing rockets at Israel. His remarks came just hours after the latest salvos prompted a brief Israeli incursion in the area.   A3    Spanish Leader Faces Crisis  The Basque region's declaration that it has the right to secede from Spain has pushed Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero toward the first crisis of his tenure. Editorial writers and politicians say his affinity for following the polls has kept him from taking on tough issues.   A6    NATIONAL   A11-13    Vigorous Interrogation Expected For Nominee  The Senate Judiciary Committee begins hearings on Thursday to consider President Bush's nomination of Albert R. Gonzales to be attorney general. Mr. Gonzales may face a vigorous interrogation because of his role in overseeing internal legal memorandums that appeared to condone mistreatment of detainees.   A13    Hastert Asserts His Power  J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, has emerged as a powerful force, the man President Bush is counting on to enact his ambitious second-term agenda, including Social Security legislation and changes in the tax code.   A1    New Head for Paramount  A deal that would name the veteran talent manager Brad Grey to head Paramount Pictures is almost finished, people involved in it said. He would replace Sherry Lansing, who announced late last year that she would retire after her contract expired in September 2005.   A11    Bush Celebrates Inauguration  Kelsey Grammer will be the M.C. at a kickoff inaugural gala honoring the military, the rap artist Kid Rock will perform at an inaugural youth concert and President Bush's most reliable fund-raisers have so far collected $15 million for three days of meticulously planned parties to celebrate his second swearing-in.   A13    Former Judge Focus of Case  A retired federal judge who ruled in 1982 that mental hospitals were violating the rights of patients now has dementia and is at the center of a dispute over whether he should be released from his nursing home. As the nation's population ages and the number of Alzheimer's patients rises, the case could have important ramifications.   A11    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-5    White Plains Savors New High-Rise Lifestyle  The construction of 35-story residential towers in White Plains is giving the city something that no other city in Westchester has: a skyline. The project continues the development boom that began two years ago.   B1    Readying for Battle  New York's heavily Democratic delegation on Capitol Hill will battle with conservative lawmakers over federal funds when Congress convenes this month, and New York Republicans may step in to help force concessions.   B1    Pastor Endorses Bloomberg  Mayor Bloomberg accepted the endorsement of the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, the influential pastor of Allen A.M.E.

Just bow Martin runs up against the solid wall of red tape and officialdom in his vain effort to establish his identity is detailed with fine effect, as are his meetings with his wife and 17-year-old daughter. In his hour of need the desperate \\"Man Without a Name\\" finds sympathy and aid in the persons of Crete Schulze, a rather happy-go-lucky Berlin stenographer, temporarily out of a job, and Julius Hanke, a sort of entrepreneur on a small scale. While his new friends are somewhat doubtful characters, they play an important part in bringing the picture to a satisfactory ending.The main attraction of this film is the acting of Herr Krauss and his supporters. During the scenes where Martin confronts his former friend and his wife, Frau Thimig and Herr Wieman leave the audience in doubt as to whether they have recognized him or not. In her minor rôle, Miss Thiele is charming. Frauen Thimig and Bard are both efficient and sympathetic. The photography is clear.

Guillermo del Toro has brought a similar woozy, disconcerting melancholy to his film adaptation, and his obvious affection and affinity  for that dankness alone would make &quot;Hellboy&quot; worth seeing. But Mr. del Toro lets loose with an all-American, vaudevillian rambunctiousness that makes the movie daffy, loose and lovable. The story is pretty complicated stuff: during World War II, Hitler sends a special squad, led by Rasputin (Karel Roden), to rend the dimensional bonds and obtain a creature that will give the edge to the Nazis. His conjuring leads to the emergence of an infant creature, red as sin, with a long tail, who falls into the hands of the Allies. The kindly British scientist Dr. Broom (John Hurt) tames the tiny scarlet devil with a Baby Ruth the size of a Bazooka. Adopted by Dr. Broom, Hellboy, with his huge stone-like left arm, grows up to be the go-to guy for the good doctor and the anti-apparition league known as the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. What gives &quot;Hellboy&quot; squirmy, ferocious life is the environment that Mr. del Toro creates onscreen. It's this texture that he avidly lavishes on &quot;Hellboy&quot; that offers the kiss of distinction.  It's an elegant haunted house of a picture, with dread and yearning part of the eeriness. Ron Perlman's performance as Hellboy, and his mastery of bad-tempered volubility, makes the film a kind of screwball comedy version of the Thing from the Fantastic Four comics.
