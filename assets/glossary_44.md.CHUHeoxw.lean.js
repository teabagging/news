It is called \\"Skyscraper,\\" and is a rather crude and none too edifying subject, its redeeming features being some of the scenes depicting the coolness of the iron workers at dizzy heights. This production sways from buffoonery to melodrama and the title writer seems to have taken no end of trouble to capture what he believes to be the slang of the heroes of the girders and also that of chorus girls.Dudley Murphy, who aimed at high art in his futuristic screen contribution, \\"Ballet Mechanique,\\" is credited with the original yarn of \\"Skyscraper,\\" which was twisted into its present form by Elliott Clawson and Tay Garnett. It is not set forth on the program or on the screen which of the three writers was responsible for the inspired idea of having two iron-workers fighting as they carry an unconscious chorus girl. There are several other equally brilliant incidents, which, strange as they are, do not succeed in arousing quite the same degree of irritation as the priceless gem showing \\"Blondie,\\" a steel riveter, dropping ashes on his sweetheart's photograph, and then, by an expression of intense agony, denoting his regret for his action.For a brief period it seems as though this might be quite an impressive picture. One of the first scenes depicts the blacksmith at work high up in the skeleton of a steel structure. It is also interesting when \\"Blondie,\\" impersonated by William Boyd, swings back and forth from a steel structure to a window of another building. As a touch of melodramatic relief, a man falls to the street in trying to do what \\"Blondie\\" accomplished in an off-hand manner.Coney Island's amusements come in for a slice of this photoplay and \\"Blondie\\" and Sally are beheld enjoying a cuddle in a canoe. Sally happens to be a saucy chorus girl, who at one time refers to \\"Blondie\\" as Hercules and on another occasion addresses him by that delightful appellation, \\"Egg.\\" Sally is very much impressed when \\"Blondie\\" takes her up an unfinished skyscraper and gives her a steel riveter's eye view of New York.What is presumed to be the high dramatic point of this farcical melodrama is where \\"Blondie\\" and his peculiar pal, the Swede, are injured when a falling girder tears through several stories. The Swede recovers quickly, but \\"Blondie\\" can't get back the use of his legs. The Swede is supposed to be a frightful villain, but, eventually, it appears that he has been brutal so as to force Blondie to use his legs.William Boyd has his worthy and poor periods in the rôle of Blondie. Alan Hale is frequently far from the popular conception of an iron worker, but he evidently sought to portray an iron worker with a quasisense of humor. As for the others, the less said the better.Paul Whiteman and his orchestra are this week to be seen in John Murray Anderson's stage production, \\"Knick Knacks.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Iron Workers Aloft."},{"year":"1951","title":"iron workers and steamfitters dispute right to install heating units, Garfield plant RIVAL UNIONS IN FRACAS","excerpt":"Iron Workers and Steamfitters Battle at Garfield Plant"},{"year":"1927","title":"Dispute between iron workers and derrick engineers threatens cessation of work on addition to Bamberger store at Newark, N J STRIKETHREATENS BUILDING","excerpt":"Iron Workers Are First Out on Addition to Bamberger Store."},{"year":"1961","title":"DENVER, Sept. 18 (AP) -- A walkout by iron workers hampered construction work today at three of the six missile launching sites near here.

As for those over-ripe ads spicily implying something akin to the book \\"Lolita\\" — nuts.Here is a moving, beautifully molded adult drama of an aging philanderer, adapted from the Georges Simenon novel published here as \\"Act of Passion\\" (still the ideal title). The picture is even better than the source, take it from one Simenon addict. Without losing any of the author's insight and detachment about human foibles, the French have thawed the author's clinical deep-freeze with quiet, unobtrusive compassion.But the real strength of this Films-Around-the-World release, equipped with good English titles, is the performance of its star, Fernandel. As a desperate man sensually trapped between loneliness and respectability, the beloved comedian (playing it straight) is — why quibble? — perfect.Gone, now, is the icy guillotine blade overshadowing the story, as detailed in a condemned man's prison letters. An excellent director, Henri Verneuil, and his two co-scenarists have tossed these literary riggings right out the window, opened it wider for a sharp camera, and let in some fresh air. What follows is a simple story flowing toward tragedy, as a gentle, middle-aged provincial doctor boyishly annexes himself a young, amoral mistress, played by Françoise Arnoul.Bit by bit, in the acting of a splendid cast and the absolute transparency of the homely Fernandel features, the hero's soul is laid bare and the family portrait that isolated it. Completely dominated by a loving but businesslike wife (Claude Nollier), and an even tougher-spirited mother, played by Sylvie, the doctor has been thrust toward his highly respected career (\\"even parenthood\\" — there are two nice kids) since infancy. Abruptly using a train encounter to assert his independence and manhood, ??? graying \\"mama's ??? installs a wise, understanding litte tart as his secretary.The remainder of the picture details — beautifully — the agony and tension of his furtive, then careless, jealousy of the restless girl, as the two home ladies learn the truth. (How the whole town missed it escapes us.)M. Verneuil has staged one telling scene after the next in mounting crescendo, greatly abetted by the dialogue, most of it pure Simenon. The initial hotel seduction is touching, as Mlle. Arnoul suavely snares her timid prey. There is humor in the doctor's coltish delight, back home, with his new \\"possession\\"","excerpt":"irony in a county fair crowd, with the lovers under hawk-like observation.Mlles.

And his weakness as well as his strength is evident in the exhibition of recent photographs opening Wednesday at the Marlborough Gallery, 40 West 57th Street (through Oct. 2).\\n\\nThe exhibition consists of black-and-white still lifes done ''for himself'' (as the phrase goes) rather than on assignment for Vogue, where he first made his reputation in the 1940's photographing new clothes and celebrities, but the new photographs have a lot in common with the fashion and portrait work done for Vogue. They were taken in the studio, where the photographer has something of a painter's control over composition and lighting, rather than outside, where he is far more at the mercy of accidents. And in their lighting and composition they remind the viewer of paintings in the way that news photographs seldom, if ever, do.

On the one hand, there are ordinary people. On the other, there are people who pose for photographs in Vogue, the fashion magazine for which Penn has worked since 1943.\\n\\n Now it must be true of the people who pose for photographs in Vogue that they, like ordinary people, take buses and taxis, go to the supermarket, sweat, strain, grow old and die. Or, if they do not take buses and taxis, they take chauffeured limousines. For they, like ordinary people, have to get from one place to another, and even suffer some annoyance and inconvenience on the way. But none of this shows up in Vogue. The people who appear in Vogue may suffer a cosmic anguish that far surpasses in intensity and significance the limited capacity of ordinary people either for suffering or for understanding. The photographs they pose for often suggest this. But no one will learn, from these photographs, of the frustration they, too, must feel when trying to get across town in rush- hour traffic. For Vogue is founded on the premise that its readers and its contents are unassailably superior to the ordinary.

Large companies that own cable systems, eager to win franchises in unwired cities, are quite willing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build modern systems. At the same time, they give much lower priority to rebuilding their older systems in areas where there are no competitive reasons to offer the more lavish services.   Take New York City. It may be the communications capital of the world, but you wouldn't know it by the quality of its cable television service. Of the city's five boroughs, four remain unwired for cable. The fifth, Manhattan, is served by two companies, Teleprompter (uptown) and Manhattan Cable (downtown). But while both systems are required by their franchise agreements to provide subscribers the most sophisticated, state-of-the-art systems, neither one does.   Nor do the parent companies of Teleprompter and Manhattan Cable sense any contradiction in promising far more elaborate systems to potential subscribers just across the river. Both companies are among the competitors for franchises due to be awarded by the city next month in Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and the Bronx.
