It was directed by Ernst Lubitsch, who directed \\"Passion\\" and \\"Deception,\\" and its leading rôle is played by Pola Negri, the Du Barry of the now famous \\"Passion.\\" As in the cases of the other importations, its name has been changed to suit a supposed domestic demand for peppy title. Originally it was called \\"Carmen,\\" and it is a motion picture version of the story by Prosper Merrimee.These are the facts of record, but the much more important fact is that once more Mr. Lubitsch has made a motion picture that can hold the interest and excite the discriminating admiration of intelligent people, and once more Pola Negri has endowed a character with the attributes of reality.Miss Negri's Carmen is no studio puppet","excerpt":"she is no grand operatic queen without a vivifying voice. She is a tempestuous, intemperate gypsy girl, a magnetic, unmoral animal, a freeliving, free-loving savage of capricious appetites and a consuming zest for satisfying them. Nothing is precious in her eyes. She does not seek to have and to hold; her sport is to capture and destroy, for to destroy the captured is to carry the conquest to its natural completion. She hunts and kills in disregard or ignorance of posted fields and closed seasons. She possesses all of the natural artfulness of the female of the species without the protective finesse of the civilized variety.Such is the Carmencita who lives on the screen in the person of Pola Negri. Her moods, her impulses, her joys, her fears are all eloquently expressed. She is a vivid human being every moment of her performance and never a mere shadow of doubtful meaning. Miss Negri has abundant personality, and that illuminates her, but she is also expressive, her actions are communications of thoughts and feelings, and that makes her Carmencita, the cigarette girl, not Pola Negri, the actress.The others in the cast are also real people on the screen. Harry Liedkte, the Armand de Foix of \\"Passion,\\" is the Don Jose Navarro of \\"Gypsy Blood,\\" it is said, but he is so distinctly Don Jose that one does not recognize Armand in him. Incidentally his performance in the latter picture is a better piece of work than he did in \\"Passion.\\" Momentarily, others seem to have stepped from rôles in \\"Passion\\" and \\"Deception,\\" but although several of them do not look exactly Spanish, they do look and act so exactly like smugglers, soldiers and assorted villagers that the spectator instinctively accepts them as what they are supposed to be.But the director still remains in the most important person connected with the production of a photoplay, so it is to Mr. Lubitsch that first and last praise must go. His scenes create the undisturbed illusion of Seville and its surrounding country. His sets are part of his story, never getting out of it insignificantly nor obstructively Many of his moving pictures are masterpieces of dramatic composition. His production as a whole is a vigorous, glowing, living thing that never lets the spectator's interest slacken for a moment—except when it is interrupted by one of the many unnecessary and dulling subtitles stuck into the American edition of the film.The Criterion, Theatre, having let \\"Sentimental Tommy\\" go after six happy weeks, now has a new program which includes two exceptionally interesting pictorial numbers. One is the first chapter of Tony Sarg's \\"Almanac,\\" edited by Herbert M. Dawley. It is an exceedingly clever and amusing work in silhouettes of prehistoric animals and men called \\"The First Circus,\\" and one of the best things about it is that it promises to open a rich new field for black-and-white photography.The other promising novelty at the Criterion is \\"Moongold,\\" a fantasy of Pierrot and Pierette, produced under the direction of Will Bradley. Its significance is that it employs the idea of expressional settings, not cubistically as does \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\\" but selectively. Normal chairs, beds, doors, windows and the like are used, but only as they enter into the action. The real background of every scene is jet black. Against it stand the objects essential to the story, and no others. The picture, then, is one of sharp contrasts, of bright high-lights surrounded by darkness, with shadings only on the faces and figures of the players. Crudely treated, such a work would be effective only as a novelty, but Mr. Bradley has had the imagination and skill to make his pictures pleasing to the eye and dramatically interesting. The only serious fault to find is that the film is too long for its frail story, and sometimes sags beneath the weight of the subtitles loaded upon it. The cast is excellent, on the whole, but Picrrette does seem a bit too childish at times.The photoplay at the Criterion is \\"The Lost Romance,\\" written by Edward Knoblock and directed by William de Mille. It is like most of the other De Mille productions, ornate, unconvincing, homiletic, but no doubt interesting to those who like their fiction elaborately fictitious. Jack Holt, Lois Wilson, Fontaine LaRue and Conrad Nagel, in the principal parts, are finished marionettes.If censorship is established, however, and Young America gets a chance on the board, \\"The Lost Romance\\" ma be suppressed. It is really dangerous. It may encourage maiden aunts, ???another unoccupied elders, to meddle ???the affairs of younger folk. The ???ang??? of the photoplay is a maiden aunt, ???wh undertakes to show a young wife ???the she really loves her husband by kidnapping the couple's only child, and ???other strategems, and there is no doubt th??? she is beautifully successful, but that just the danger of the picture. Au??? Lizzie of the movies has the aid of a exceedingly friendly dramatist when she sets out to play the part of Providenc??? but who's going to arrange things f??? all the amateur directors of destiny wh??? may try to emulate her?\\"The Wild Goose,\\" directed by Albe???

There is a curious sense of timelessness about the stories; often one has absolutely no idea when they are taking place.

But it is the unexpected birth of Joan Canary, half idiot savant and half changeling, that catalyzes the individual idiosyncrasies and personal secrets of the people around her, melding them into a clan defined by its eccentricity. Before the arrival of Joan, Gordon, a repressed homosexual, considered himself a devoted homebody, content in his marriage to Doris, a compulsive liar and concealed lesbian. But their attempt at 1950's normalcy comes undone when their placidly slow-witted 15-year-old daughter, Sonja, bears an out-of-wedlock daughter and they decide to raise the dwarfish, nearly albino infant as if she were their own. Doris and Gordon's younger daughter, Marcy, is left out of the loop, but with her telepathic closeness to the ''sister'' who is really her niece, her childhood and adolescence gain a magical quality. Resembling no one in the family (or on earth), Joan proves so sensitive to light that she can play outside only at night","excerpt":"she is so attuned to music that she can perform Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations at 8, though she never bothers with intelligible speech. Using Joan as a sounding board, the person in whom all the others confide, Ms. Gowdy gently and humorously pries into everything they try to conceal from one another, including Gordon's first extramarital affair and Marcy's promiscuity. These secrets flit in and out of their lives the way snatches of popular songs play in their heads. Joan's possibly brain-damaged brilliance lies at the heart of both the narrative and the symbolism of this delightfully quirky novel, in which the Canary family's life emerges as a weird yet often affecting group composition.

The opening song of the London concert, ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' as performed by Sir Paul McCartney and Bono, right, was No. 1 on the Apple iTunes charts in Britain, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Belgium, a spokesman for Universal Music International told The Associated Press. It was also No. 2 in Spain and No. 3 in France. (It was No. 11 on the American version of iTunes yesterday.) The first sale of the track was made just 45 minutes after the song was performed. Sir Paul's ''Hey Jude,'' which closed the London show, went on sale yesterday. Universal planned to donate its share of the sales to Live 8, the spokesman said.  Some performers at Live 8 saw significant sales spikes for their albums. Pink Floyd, which performed with Roger Waters, its bassist, for the first time in more than 20 years, had about 13 times as many sales of its ''Echoes'' collection at HMV stores in Britain on Sunday, compared with the same day a week before, a spokesman for the chain told Reuters. The Who and Annie Lennox also had gains of up to eight times as many sales. But the factors can be deceiving, since sales for those albums had been low: despite the big gain, ''Echoes'' sold only about 1,000 copies at British HMV stores, the spokesman said.  The BBC received about 400 complaints from viewers about foul language at the concerts. Among the performers who swore onstage were Madonna and Snoop Dogg. The BBC, which did not use a time delay during the broadcast, apologized for the swearing.    Chechnya Rock Festival Canceled Over Security       A rock festival scheduled to take place in Chechnya today has been called off because of security concerns, the BBC reported. ''Phoenix: Rebirth,'' in the city of Gudermes, was to feature eight Russian rock acts over six hours, with an expected audience of 20,000 and plans for broadcast by Russian television networks. But it was shelved after the government announced that the police would not be able to guarantee security. The exact location of the festival had been kept secret, and some acts were said to have refused to participate for safety concerns. Some 9,000 free tickets for the event had already been handed out. In 2003 a bomb exploded at a rock festival in Moscow, killing 16 people, an incident for which Chechen separatists were blamed.    A Lot of 'Spamalot'       ''Spamalot'' (with Sara Ramirez, below) continues to be a hit on Broadway, and its cast recording is selling well, too. The show, which won this year's Tony Award for best musical, had a weekly gross of $989,000 for the week that ended Sunday, a new record for the Shubert Theater. And its cast recording has become the fastest-selling Broadway cast album since ''Rent'' nine years ago, selling 42,000 copies in its first four weeks, about 5,000 more than the ''Wicked'' album did in its first month, and almost 9,000 more than ''The Producers,'' a spokeswoman for ''Spamalot'' said.  Elsewhere on Broadway, ''Lennon,'' the new musical by Don Scardino based on the life and music of John Lennon, will begin previews on Thursday at the Broadhurst Theater on West 44th Street and open on Aug. 4.    African Literary Prize       S.A. Afolabi of Nigeria has won the Caine Prize for African Writing, Africa's leading literary prize, for a short story called ''Monday Morning.'' The $15,000 award was announced yesterday at a dinner at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, England. Mr. Afolabi was born in Kaduna, Nigeria, and has worked as an editor at the BBC. A collection of his stories, ''A Life Elsewhere,'' is to be published next spring, and a novel, ''Goodbye Lucille,'' in 2007.    Flamenco Star on Trial       One of the biggest flamenco stars in Spain, Farruquito, below, has gone on trial for manslaughter, accused of a hit-and-run killing of a pedestrian in Seville in 2003, the BBC reported. Prosecutors say the dancer, whose real name is Juan Manuel Fernández Montoya, was driving at high speed without a license or insurance. He is also accused of trying to cover up the damage to his BMW said to have been caused by the collision. Mr. Montoya, 22, has admitted he was behind the wheel but denies negligence. He initially said that his 15-year-old brother had been driving when the car hit the pedestrian, Benjamin Olalla. Prosecutors are calling for Mr. Montoya to be jailed for three years, fined, banned from driving and ordered to pay compensation to the victim's family.    Free Concerts       CityParks, the City Parks Foundation's series of free concerts in all five boroughs, begins tonight at 7 in Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn with Omar, a British soul singer, and continues with 30 concerts through August.

Free concerts will return to the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art beginning July 17.

Cabaret Nights       Carol Channing, below, is scheduled to play her first major nightclub engagement since her days at the Empire Room of the Waldorf-Astoria from Oct. 11 to 22 in the fifth-anniversary season of Feinstein's at the Regency. The season opens on Sept. 20 with a 95th-birthday celebration by Kitty Carlisle Hart, who will perform through Sept. 24. She will be followed by the jazz guitarist and singer John Pizzarelli, with a special guest, his father, Bucky Pizzarelli, from Sept. 27 to Oct. 8. Also on the schedule are Michele Lee (Nov. 15 to 26) and, in his annual holiday engagement, Michael Feinstein (Nov. 29 to Dec. 30) with a break from Dec. 12 through 15, when Rebecca Luker will present a new Christmas show.

Every time Jupiter emerged from a cartoon cloud that opened like an elevator, a bell rang as if the deity were arriving at the ladies' foundations area of a department store. Sometimes the costumes made it seem that way as well: the nymph Pasithea appeared in an outfit that might have been from Frederick's of Hollywood, a bright red garter belt and stocking outfit with a white feather boa and a pair of handcuffs. Jupiter jumped into a bubble bath, apparently in his birthday suit. Even the musicians did not keep their minds on the score.   This was a production of \\"Semele\\" but hardly the \\"Semele\\" that Handel's operatic setting gives us with its pastoral scenes and hints of high tragedy. This opera is based on the very same libretto (written by the Restoration dramatist William Congreve) and was completed by the English composer John Eccles in late 1706. It takes the same story from Ovid, of the young girl (Semele) in love with a god (Jupiter)","excerpt":"she is tricked by the god's jealous wife (Juno) into demanding to see him in divine form; she dies from the exposure. The composer -- Purcell's heir in the English theater -- never heard the work. It is influenced by Italian opera, with declaimed recitatives and da capo arias, but by the time \\"Semele\\" was ready for performance, the fashion in London demanded authenticity: operas in Italian from Italy.

(Doubleday, $24.95.) Set in 1950's Los Angeles, where real life was basically film noir, this novel of harsh, precise everyday violence by the author of the scary 1988 novel ''Paris Trout'' involves a cynical detective, a young woman who surely deserves better than what she gets, and a black caddie, nearly 18, who is nice to animals and serves as the book's moral center.    JAMESLAND, by Michelle Huneven. (Knopf, $24.) Alice Black, who cannot forget her descent from William James (people keep bringing him up), has trouble being pragmatic about the paranormal in the Los Angeles of this novel, where unlikely things (a deer in the house) seem to trump less exotic ones (like mental illness and the fear of mental illness).    L'AFFAIRE, by Diane Johnson. (Dutton, $24.95.) Johnson's third witty and graceful novel about Americans in France is a comedy of manners that concerns a self-made woman, a dot-com millionaire from Palo Alto who goes to France seeking a life-changing love affair. Most of it happens at a ski resort in the Alps, where cultural misunderstandings prevail by day, love affairs by night.    THE COLOSSUS OF NEW YORK: A City in Thirteen Parts, by Colson Whitehead. (Doubleday, $19.95.) An engaging, ambitious author takes his shot at the cityness of New York in this short, dense tour de force of shifting voices and points of view in a town that changes faster than its inhabitants can follow.    SHE IS ME, by Cathleen Schine. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) A skillful domestic comedy (full of cancer victims and short tempers) whose title refers to the frightening probability of growing up to become our mothers. One major character is an expert on ''Madame Bovary''","excerpt":"she is trying to develop a Bovary movie treatment, while nearly everyone has one or more symptoms of Flaubertian adultery.    LOVE AND HATE IN JAMESTOWN: John Smith, Pocahontas, and the Heart of a New Nation, by David A. Price. (Knopf, $25.95.) A solid, absorbing history of Jamestown (founded 1607), the first English-speaking colony in North America to survive. Its hero is John Smith, but not the same old John Smith; this one is a student of Machiavelli and soldier of fortune who was just what Jamestown needed, especially to deal with the Indians.    A DISTANT SHORE, by Caryl Phillips. (Knopf, $23.95.) In the sad and ugly modern Britain of this novel by a Caribbean writer who has specialized in the homelessness of the descendants of slaves, nothing redemptive happens in the friendship of Dorothy, an Englishwoman and retired schoolteacher, and Solomon, an illegal refugee from a war-blighted African nation; both are left to drift.    HOW TO BREATHE UNDERWATER: Stories, by Julie Orringer. (Knopf, $21.) Parents seem well-meaning but ineffectual in these stories; they do everything right, but it doesn't necessarily work. Children and adolescents operate in a secret world of their own, a kind of callous, Darwinian universe that admits reality as illness and loss, aggression and sexuality.

But is that really the most accurate description? Some of the new season's books would suggest a more universal truism: travel is never easy.    The Spanish grow olives, ''but the taste is so bitter, I am sure you would not like it.'' In China, ''it is a common thing to stumble over the bodies of dead babies in the streets.'' The Irish, ''if affronted, are filled with rage.'' These withering pronouncements come from a Victorian writer named Mrs. Favell Lee Mortimer, perhaps the most uncharitable person ever to have emerged from the country that also brought us Simon Cowell and Jack the Ripper. In THE CLUMSIEST PEOPLE IN EUROPE: Or, Mrs. Mortimer's Bad-Tempered Guide to the Victorian World (Bloomsbury, $19.95), the present-day writer and editor Todd Pruzan collects entries from three volumes of Mrs. Mortimer's wonderfully odious, travel-based misanthropy. Pruzan also provides some telling biographical details about Mortimer -- most notably that she left England only twice. Moreover, despite being a successful children's author whose Bible primer aimed at 4-year-olds sold a million copies, Mortimer led a life of utter misery. Her first great romantic attachment (to Henry Manning, who became Cardinal Manning) was unrequited","excerpt":"she later married a violent, cruel man from whom she often hid. To the modern eye, Mortimer's work -- by turns unsettling and hilarious -- is nothing short of a revolution in guidebook writing: here, at last, is irritable-bowel-syndrome-as-travelogue.

(Picador, $18.) By all appearances a paragon of the English Establishment and a dominant figure in British art history for three decades, Blunt was also a Soviet spy for 20 years, part of a group recruited at Cambridge that has gained a perverse notoriety over the years. Carter's biography, chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2002, is more interesting than the man, as it takes careful measure of his time and place. ''She tells his tragic story with lucid fair-mindedness and . . . authority, as well as with a much needed sense of humor,'' Jeremy Treglown said here.    ENEMY WOMEN, by Paulette Jiles. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) In the Missouri Ozarks during the Civil War, a hotbed of treachery and divided loyalties, the spitfire daughter of a gentleman farmer with Rebel leanings is drawn into a love affair with the Union officer assigned to interrogate her at a women's prison. She ''becomes a storyteller to survive","excerpt":"she lies, charms and improvises her way through the wilderness,'' John Vernon wrote here of this novel in 2002. ''And so -- triumphantly -- does Paulette Jiles.''    THE SHORT SWEET DREAM OF EDUARDO GUTI&#201;RREZ, by Jimmy Breslin. (Three Rivers, $12.) A master of plain-spoken reportage provides a true-life account of an illegal Mexican who met his senseless death on a Brooklyn construction site, and of the travails of the millions of Mexicans scratching out lives in the United States illegally. Those lives ''are dreary ones, and they are chronicled beautifully and truthfully,'' Charlie LeDuff said here last year.    DESIRABLE DAUGHTERS, by Bharati Mukherjee. (Theia/Hyperion, $13.95.) An Americanized Indian woman living as a single mother in San Francisco finds herself unable to shake off the constraints of class, female deference and fate from her Brahmin past when a young man shows up who says he is the illegitimate son of her oldest sister. Last year in these pages, Deborah Mason found this ''a novel of grace and shrewd intellect'' and ''a page turner as well, with shifting identities and dangerous plot twists.''    WITHOUT END: New and Selected Poems, by Adam Zagajewski. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15.) Light, music, the weight of history and awe at life's passing are among the constants in this anthology of work by the Polish poet and 1970's dissident, which contains three previous English collections, recent work and early poems, rendered gracefully by four different translators. His poems ''pull us from whatever routine threatens to dull our senses,'' Philip Boehm wrote here in 2002. ''This is an astonishing book.''    WEST OF KABUL, EAST OF NEW YORK: An Afghan American Story, by Tamim Ansary. (Picador, $13.) The author tells of growing up in the 1950's and 60's straddling his father's Afghan world and his mother's America, conjuring a virtually medieval Kabul where extended families lived in private compounds. His account illustrates ''many of the questions that the West needs to answer if Afghanistan is to emerge from this latest round of warfare in a better state than before,'' Isabel Hilton said here last year.    THE FUTURE OF LIFE, by Edward O. Wilson. (Vintage, $13.) In this call to arms, the esteemed sociobiologist argues that there is still time to avoid a planetary crash in the variety of species, provided we stop depleting biodiversity and eradicating ecosystems and adopt a serious duty of stewardship to the vast web of life on earth. Last year our reviewer, Jon Turney, said the ''book eloquently makes one thing clear about the difference between the actions of present-day Homo sapiens and . . . our ancestors: within broad limits, we know what we do, and we have a choice.''    THE REHEARSAL, by Sarah Willis. (Berkley, $14.) Set in upstate New York in 1971, this novel centers on a despotic theater director who tries to salvage the future of his acting troupe by staging a radical reinterpretation of Steinbeck's ''Of Mice and Men'' while his family life unravels around him. The result is a ''clever, knowing take on obsession and rebellion,''James Polk wrote here in 2001.    THE NANNY DIARIES, by Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus. (St. Martin's Griffin, $13.95.) In this first novel by two former child-care workers, a college student is hired by an impossibly demanding Park Avenue family to look after their 4-year-old son. The nanny turns out to be a ''vastly entertaining narrator and impromptu social critic'' whose adventures make for ''a diabolically funny New York story,'' Janet Maslin said in The Times last year.

Margaret, four years younger, was a freer spirit; \\n\\nshe \\n\\nliked Ethel Merman songs, jokes and nightclubbing, and was not exactly sure how she felt about the prospect of one day having to call her older sister \\"Your Majesty.\\" They are the subjects of \\"Royal Sisters,\\" a biographical look at a rather normal case of sibling rivalry, quite unexceptional -- except, of course, for its having been played out in Buckingham Palace. The girls advanced to the first and second positions in the line of succession to the English throne in 1936 when their Uncle David (Edward VIII) abdicated to marry the American Wallis Simpson. Thereafter during their adolescence, according to Anne Edwards, the future Queen grew increasingly conscious of the part history had marked out for her to play; Margaret, meanwhile, was occasionally confused and resentful over the greater amount of attention paid to her sister and the fact that her future position offered little scope for her talents other than trivial ceremony. (\\"I was born too late!\\" she complained.) This uncomfortable situation came to a climax in 1956 when, determined to avoid a repeat of the loss of royal prestige incurred in the abdication scandal, Elizabeth reluctantly but firmly refused Margaret permission to marry the divorced commoner Peter Townsend, a decision that may well have ended her hopes for personal happiness. There \\"Royal Sisters\\" ends; no information from the intervening 35 years is admitted. Ms. Edwards, whose previous biographical subjects include Queen Mary of England, Vivien Leigh and Judy Garland, is a meticulous, unsentimental biographer, and she works hard to breathe life into this melange of official history and gossipy anecdote, counterpointing it with sketches of significant personalities and events in the sisters' lives that are occasionally intriguing. It has to be said, though, that in the end her subject defeats her. For all their fascination, the English royals tend by design to lead lives of aggressive ordinariness beneath the carapace of monarchy; and here, as elsewhere, that ultimately precludes the generating of any real personal or narrative interest.

Aloise—the protagonist—makes a remarkable series of paintings: bright-colored, Chagall-like figures with a rocketing sexuality and, invariably, closed eyes.\\"Aloise,\\" which was shown yesterday in the Second International Festival of Women's Films at the Cinema Studio, is divided by its director, Liliane de Kermadec, into two very distinct sections. The first is an elliptical series of scenes, filmed with deliberate stillness and a white light, showing the protagonist as a young girl.She is the daughter of a Swiss railroad employee","excerpt":"she lives with him and her sister. Her mother is dead. \\"My name,\\" she says, \\"has every vowel except 'u.' I wish I were called 'Lulu'.\\" She is sure she is a singer; she takes lessons, practices, glares at other less-determined singers at church. But her voice won't serve; it is tuneful, but hard and reedy.As played by Isabella Huppert, the adolescent Aloise is, in her unvarying gravity, a figure of some mystery. What is this frustrated effort, this self-delusion building toward?The scene shifts suddenly, and so does the actress. She arrives in Germany for her job as a governess; almost at once the role is taken over by another actress, Delphine Seyrig. She falls in love hysterically, is sent home, and breaks down.The mystery of the child is resolved: All those nuances were preparation for madness. But this is asserted, not demonstrated. There is no real link: First she was sad as Isabella Huppert, then she was mad as Delphine Seyrig.The bulk of the film, then, is Miss Seyrig in the asylum. We see the doctors talking, the other patients, Aloise serself. It is most painfully and well observed, and Miss Seyrig's performance is breathtaking. But for quite a while we are never really sure why we are seeing it.The ending puts things together to some extent. Aloise begins to paint on wrapping paper, the doctors encourage her, and her work is put on exhibition in a big-city gallery. There is one splendid scene: She inspects the display, this aged sparrow of a woman, still quite mad, hopping by those evidences of a life that lives only on the wall and that she only faintly recognizes. And making banal comments such as this one, in front of a picture of two lovers: \\"This is a little vulgar; pretty, but not my cup of tea.\\"A startling image of disassociation, it almost makes up for the long, long passages that precede it.

Call it karma or original sin, but for Cecile Pineda's characters, the given of life is suffering, and deliverance is possible only through the violent dismembering of the worldly self. Her elegiac first novel, ''Face,'' nominated for a 1985 National Book Award, told of a barber from a Brazilian slum whose face is grotesquely mutilated, and the solitary anguish of reconstructing it. The major character of her new novel is Gopal, a stone carver in 10th-century India, whose dissolution of self is more gradual at first and thus more deceptive. After losing the wife he cherishes to the shadows of her own dream world, he is conscripted by a dynastic prince to travel to Java to carve 120 friezes of Buddha's life for the shrine of Borobudur (still standing today), whose construction devoured the lives of thousands of laborers. Ms. Pineda is convincing in her description of the passion and hubris that fuel Gopal's carving of the sacred friezes but also blinds him to the close, hot breath of danger around him","excerpt":"she makes the act of savagery that forces him to recast his life both horrifying and believable. Unfortunately, the novel suffers from her insistence that Gopal lead a pointedly metaphorical life: she names his first, dreamily seductive wife Maya, the Sanskrit term for the illusions from which we must detach ourselves to gain true enlightenment; Borobudur is a not too subtle symbol for the pridefulness and cruelty of this world.

But a little frustration is a small objection in this case. This is Mr. Arkadie's first professional production in New York, and his talent for creating dramatic characters whose wit and good humor amuse one without diminishing the peril of their situation is one that may, in time, give us impressive, and heartwarming, theater.

Policemen were kept busy escorting dazzling women and their escorts into the theatre and after the show there was a terrific crush on the carpeted pavement. Outside, the theatre was decorated with tricolor streamers, and Napoleonic soldiers stood stolidly on guard just outside two sentry-boxes.Half the audience spent a large share of its time in staring at the balcony wherein sat the evening's star of filmdom. The film itself was a secondary affair.With the faintest suggestion of the \\"Marseillaise\\" coming from the string instruments, the stage curtains swung apart at last and revealed performers costumed in the days of 1792. Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld skilfully conducted his orchestra. The house, of course, was packed. Upstairs in the loges were distinguished Frenchmen and their wives, and in the centre box sat Gloria and her husband.In the film, ghosts of the Napoleonic days seemed to come to life and tread once more the floors, staircases and lawns of the Chateaux of Fontainebleau and Compeigne. The figures were there in all their old glory and if anything—as one might imagine—the pomp and ceremony was heightened. There was the room in which Marie-Louise, Marie-Antoinette and the Empress Eugenie had laid their weary heads. A prototype of Napoleon, perhaps more kindly of eye, but with the same forelock and the bold forehead as the Emperor, stood in the very room, in Fontainebleau, in which part of the Little Corporal's strategy was carried out. Wonderful scenes on the steps of the glorious Chateau de Compeigne brought to life the striking court levees of the olden days.The Duchess of Dantzig, impersonated by the vivacious Miss Swanson, held her lavish reception in the gallery of Henry 11 in Fontainbleau Palace, which awakened ideas of the days of yesteryear. Beautiful vistas were spread before one, in which the dense foliage and the carpet-like lawns evoked murmurs of admiration from the people of the New World.At first Miss Swanson was seen as Catherine Hubscher—Madame Sans Gene—the impertinent little laundress, to whom Lieutenant Napoleon Bonaparte took his soiled lined. This studious young officer ched out a living as best he could and was not able to pay his laundry bills. Madame Sans Gene stole stockings from other customers to help Bonaparte","excerpt":"she mended his shirts and darned his hose.Miss Swanson gives a lively portrayal in this episode, but she is occasionally a little too demonstrative and her linen frocks are cut so low that one would think that the saucy Catherine was impervious to colds. Miss Swanson also has a little too much make-up on her cyelids, which one can forgive after she becomes the unceremonious Duchess of Dantzig. In the comedy sequences she is alert and clever, making the most of her effective eyes, shooting glances to right and left in telling fashion.Later in the resplendent raiment of the Duchess she is as awkward as the occasion demands, even to losing her petticoat when she enters her carriage. From the way in which this Duchess acted one could readily conceive that Marie Louise and the other court ladies were a trifle shocked. In fact one can hardly imagine even this former laundress—who it is true never was ashamed of her early efforts—acting so queerly because she wore satin instead of linen. Many an outburst of laughter was occasioned by Mem. Sans Gene's antics, and also by a few of the spoken titles, which are translated into the modern American vernacular. Mme. Sans Gene finds that her shoes pinch her feet, and she feels an unspeakable relief when she manages to rid herself of one of them.A decidedly amusing scene is where the Duchess confronts the great Emperor with the bill for his washing, and he tells her that her, charges are too much. He feels in his pockets for the money with which to defray the bill, but even as an Emperor finds himself without gold. Emile Drain, a French actor, enacts the part of Napoleon, and although he is a trifle too benign in some scenes, his appearance and his characterization of the Emperor is on the whole impressive.It fell to Charles de Roche to play the part of Lefebvre, which he does in a restrained manner but without sufficient vigor or expression. He is very tall and consequently effective in uniform.Madeline Guitty is amusing as the plump Mme. La Rousotte. There is a splendidly sympathetic scene where the Duchess, tired of the blaze of splendor in which she lives, suddenly sees in the motley throng her companion of laundry days. She takes La Rousotte into her carriage and wraps her in fine furs.Empress Marie Louise is acted with dignity by Suzanne Bianchetti, and Jacques Marney is appealing as Salvary, the Minister of Police. Warwick Ward is only fair as Neipperg.Aside from Miss Swanson's performance and possibly that of the rôles of Napoleon and La Rousotte, the characterization that is obtainable on the stage is lacking in this picture. Somehow the players are pleasant but rather flat. The idea of having the titles in English without a tinge of French is unsatisfactory in several stretches. When Madame Sans Gene, as the vivandière, marches through the streets with the troops Gloria Swanson appears to be only certain of one word in the national anthem, and that is \\"Marchons!\\" In other scenes it is plain that Madame Sans Gene is speaking English.

Is she crazy? the diners ask one another with a mix of fascination and horror. Doesn't she know about sharks? The swimmer's name is Adele, and by some standards she must be crazy: not so long ago, she turned her back on a pampered, privileged life in the Connecticut countryside to fly off to India and worship at the feet of a tyrannical guru. Narrated in part by one of Adele's acquaintances, THE WOMAN WHO WALKED ON WATER (Riverhead, $21) unfolds in brief, elegantly written chapters, keeping its distance as it traces  this restless, enigmatic woman's attempts to lose herself in something greater.  Seen from the narrator's detached perspective, Adele's headlong pursuit of enlightenment proceeds inexorably, like a 10-car pileup viewed in slow motion far in the distance. As she steadily recedes from her earthly existence, Adele sacrifices not only her autonomy and her material possessions but also a chorus  of bewildered family and friends. She loses weight, her hair becomes streaked with gray, she suffers from mysterious illnesses. But could she be exchanging these mundane measures of health for a deeper spiritual well-being? Is Adele's flight from her former life transcendent or tragic? As it explores these questions, Lily Tuck's second novel emerges as a haunting, strangely perplexing  meditation on the quest for higher meaning -- and the steep price that seekers (not to mention those around them) must pay.

She was in the first class to attend Smithtown High School West, where she played three sports. She was in the first graduating class and was awarded the scholar athlete award and most valuable female athlete. While a student at Smithtown High School she and her dear friend, Kathy Hanlon, chaperoned dances for the Junior League for developmentally disabled citizens for three years. She also volunteered as a camp counselor at Camp Wilton in New York State. As a young woman, Jean led a group of adults and children who, for several years, sang in the local nursing home during the holidays. She also brought out children from the city to spend ''weekends in the country'' at Smithtown. Jean travelled extensively visiting Africa twice to view the natural beauty and the wildlife. She was greatly concerned about the environment and found her joy in the outdoors camping, kayaking, and bicycling. As an adult, Jean completed four triathalons and although girls could not play soccer when she attended high school, she did manage, as a woman, to join the Bergen Kickers and later to play with Leitrim's team in the upper Bronx. Jean attended Stony Brook University graduating in 1980 from an accelerated program and earning a B.A. in political science and an M.S. in Urban Policy Sciences. In 1981 she completed an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering. Jean was initiated into Pi Sigma Alpha, the national Political Science honor society. Jean joined the Port Authority in April 1982. In December '83 she was assigned to the Fire Safety Section. In '85 she was elected into the Society of Fire Protection Engineers. She advanced through the P.A. and was presently the Operations Manager for Risk Management in the Treasury Dept. Jean was the kind of aunt every kid wished for. She loved her nephews dearly and certainly did dote on them. They are George and Michael Andrucki and Michael Devlin Izzo.

Clare Boylan's gift for stunning prose and unorthodox images is wonderfully evident in her second novel (her first, ''Holy Pictures,'' was highly praised). But she overburdens her central character, Harriet Bell, with more problems than even the strongest character could resolve in this novel. An unenviable sad sack, Harriet is chronically at sea, without the faintest notion of how to fulfill herself. Fittingly, she is vacationing in the Aegean with her three children on the none-too-subtly named isle of Keptos, which has kept her returning every year for a decade with its promise of idyllic stasis. This character without drive knows herself only in terms of her many unsatisfying relationships. Yet her children, noisy slobbering teen-agers, are not the monsters Harriet likens them to, just typical adolescents bumbling through one postpubescent trauma after another. She obsessively schemes to lure Joe Fisher, an unexceptional businessman, away from his wife, but doesn't see that his dalliance with her is a pathetic attempt to absolve himself of guilt about his dead daughter, who resembled Harriet. Even her imaginary childhood companion, the toothy Hawna Maroyle, keeps cropping up to taunt her. Harriet's estrangement from Joe and her children is just the beginning","excerpt":"she no longer recognizes her own vision of paradise, as Greek entrepreneurs set about modernizing Keptos and the neighboring island into tourist resorts.

Unlike its parent organization, Centrediscs receives no direct financial support from the Canadian government, relying instead on funds raised through corporate sponsorship as well as contributions from other nonprofit cultural institutions to finance its productions. Significant support is also given by some of Canada's most famous performers.

(Vintage International, $13.) In her latest collection of essays, which won a National Book Critics Circle Award, the author recalls her public school education in New York City in the 1930's and 40's and her formative encounters with New Criticism during its heyday in the 1950's. She also offers striking reflections on such topics as the Unabomber and the commodification of Anne Frank. Ozick is ''the most accomplished and graceful literary stylist of our time,'' John Sutherland said here last year.    BETRAYAL OF TRUST: The Collapse of Global Public Health, by Laurie Garrett. (Hyperion, $16.95.) The author of ''The Coming Plague'' (1994) argues that the covenant between citizens and government in health care matters is broken","excerpt":"she outlines in chilling detail the threat of bioterrorism and the crumbling health systems in Russia, India, Africa and the United States. ''These are lurid, disturbing and well-documented images that are not easily dismissed as alarmist,'' Fitzhugh Mullan wrote in these pages in 2000. ''Her message . . . is a momentous one that is delivered persuasively.''    ABYSSINIAN CHRONICLES, by Moses Isegawa. (Vintage International, $15.) This panoramic first novel about Uganda's turbulent postcolonial history uses the struggles of three generations of a single family to show how external forces -- religious, political and economic -- have blighted the nation and corrupted its traditions. Last year our reviewer, Richard Eder, said that even if the tale is disjointed and overwrought at times, ''Isegawa makes his country a locus of life, tragedy and character that . . . stays with us.''    A POSITIVELY FINAL APPEARANCE: A Journal, 1996-98, by Alec Guinness. (Penguin, $14.) Modest, refined and droll, Sir Alec Guinness, who died last year at the age of 86, holds forth on country living, the larger world, acting and the passage of time. ''He is a repository of theatrical knowledge and a vessel of gratitude,'' Barbara Grizzuti Harrison wrote in the Book Review in 1999, ''a man whose impeccable, fluid prose takes us from inner thought to outer action seamlessly, a man who in all his ways is buoyant, vivid and brave.''    AFTERBURN, by Colin Harrison. (St. Martin's, $6.99.) Among the many balls tossed into the air in this thriller are an international tycoon (and former P.O.W. in Vietnam), his barren daughter, a mob boss and a young female mathematical genius jailed for hijacking trucks. It adds up to ''an exciting ride,'' Stephen Dobyns said here last year. ''Harrison writes extremely well, and sections of 'Afterburn' are as elegant as you'll hope to find in any novel.''    EINSTEIN IN LOVE: A Scientific Romance, by Dennis Overbye. (Penguin, $15.) Plumbing the first 40 years of Albert Einstein's life, a science writer for The Times focuses on his subject's emotional, intimate side and how it affected his scientific discoveries. It turns out that while Einstein was a cad with women and a lousy father, he stayed faithful to his ideas about the universe. Last year in these pages, Jim Holt found ''the scientific exposition in this book'' to be ''almost as racy as the biographical bits.''    HOOKING UP, by Tom Wolfe. (Picador USA, $13.) The targets in this collection of essays include the death of the American novel, millennial self-absorption and -- in a vintage 1965 sendup -- the mummified New Yorker of William Shawn. Last year our reviewer, Maureen Dowd, found this a mixed bag, but allowed that ''whenever some big bizarro thing happens . . . I want the man in the white suit to do his usual exhaustive reporting, turn the labels inside out and the hypocrites upside down'' and ''tell me what's what in one of those jittering, dazzling riffs of his.''    THE REVISIONIST, by Helen Schulman. (Bloomsbury, $14.95.) A young neurologist, distracted and adrift, becomes obsessed with a Holocaust denier who changed his mind. He tracks down his doppelg* nger, believing he has found a kindred spirit whose example will inspire him to transform his own life. The result is ''an original, bold and often moving'' novel, Brian Morton said here in 1998.    ARTEMISIA, by Alexandra Lapierre. (Grove, $15.) Set in 17th-century Italy, this French novel tells of the twisting fortunes of two real-life artists -- Orazio Gentileschi and his daughter, Artemisia -- and the rapacious art collectors and wealthy patrons they dealt with. The tale ''employs admirable artistry in depicting the turbulent life and times of two great painters,'' Peter Bricklebank wrote here in 2000.

''It was given to her as a wedding present by Colin Tennant, who also owns a place on the island. There was a bit of a scandal a few years back, but nobody on the island talks about it. I can promise you that there won't be any scandal on Mustique when you come.'' I didn't know whether to be glad or sorry, but jumped at the chance to visit, especially after I read the brochure:   ''The very name conjures up a picture of chaste beauty. Until recently, that beauty has been known only to a handful of the privileged.'' The brochure continued, intriguingly: ''The villa owners of this uncommonly exclusive retreat are international notables in the fields of art, science, industry and the aristocracy. To them Mustique Island is tanned and barefooted liberation from responsibilities at home. Once there, they're free to bask in each other's colorful company . . . and revel in the unruffled days of the Island's simple life.''

The son, away at college for some years, returns and falls in love with a chorus girl. This is against the wishes of Julianne, who attempts to dissuade him first by words and then by persuading the girl to resort to borrowing the money she owes the modiste from an elderly gentleman. The boy, of course, misunderstands, but things are explained.The film is neither good nor bad and succeeds in running along its mediocre path with some degree of suspense. Its variety is probably its saving grace, for the scenes include night clubs, fashion salons and rich interiors.Miss Rich's performance is somewhat indeterminate. Whether she is liberal in permitting her son to have his way at last or a hard woman who knows when she is beaten remains a matter of speculation. Her overacting in the earlier sequences was in part responsible for a sense of wishy-washy characterization.By far the best performance in the film is that given by a blonde switchboard operator who answers only \\"Yop\\" or \\"Nope\\" to any question put to her.

Lovers got used to holding hands again And children played by streetlamp light. We rummaged in the closet For baseball gloves, light jackets, And the secret places where we'd stored Our daydreams. Everyone walked outside To moonbathe, forgetting what They'd been angry about inside. I stumbled on a shadow, Took root in the curb strip, And sprouted shiny and green again. -- LEWIS GARDNER                      . . .         Elizabeth Hunter is in a cubicle at her health club toweling her hair. She hears a woman in the outer room say, \\"Sasha finally put her foot down yesterday.\\"   A second woman exclaims, \\"It's about time!\\" Ms. Hunter stops toweling so she won't miss the next part.   Then she hears the first woman say to a third person, \\"My dog, Sasha, had her foot operated on three weeks ago, and I've been waiting for her to put her foot down.\\"   Ms. Hunter resumes toweling.                    . . .       BUYING GLOVES    I recently went to Saks Fifth Avenue for a glove sale. Recession or no recession, customers were two and three deep in front of the counter. I made my way up to the boxes piled high with gloves of all styles, colors and sizes. After digging through several of them, I found exactly what I wanted. I waited --and waited -- for the salesclerk to accept my purchase but was repeatedly bypassed by more aggressive bargain hunters. While waiting, my mind wandered back to when I was a child accompanying my mother to the same store to buy gloves.   We sat on chairs in front of a low, well-polished wood counter. A salesclerk appeared immediately","excerpt":"she politely asked what she could show us. My mother stated her desire, and the woman brought out a small cushion on which my mother rested her elbow, hand and raised fingers. The woman measured the width of my mother's palm with a tape measure, turned to a wall covered with tiny drawers and headed straight to the desired size and color. She inserted an instrument resembling a wooden curling iron into each finger of one glove and gently stretched it. Once again my mother put her elbow on the cushion and raised her hand. The clerk put the glove on, easing it down from the finger, not pulling or stretching the cuff. Her expertise was such that my mother usually bought the first pair of gloves shown.   My reverie was interrupted by, \\"Miss! Miss! Do you want these gloves? There are lots of people waiting.\\" -- CAROLINE GHANI                    . . .           Dear Diary:     I was walking along Central Park South when a disheveled-looking chap approached me and politely asked for some spare change. He was a pleasant fellow, the day was lovely and, feeling generous, I reached into my wallet and handed him a dollar.   \\"Thank you, sir,\\" he said, \\"but could you make that four quarters?\\"   \\"What's the difference?\\" I asked.   \\"The attendant in the men's room at the Plaza doesn't make change,\\" he replied. -- MICHAEL ROJAK                    . ..           Dear Diary:     Snugly ensconced on an Upper East Side corner is a delightful shop featuring doll houses and doll house miniatures. Decidedly upscale, the shop has an incredible array of small esoterica, ranging from stately formal dining room suites to gaily flowered patio chaises -- earmarked, undoubtedly, for the house in the Hamptons.   It came as no surprise, therefore, when I peered into a display case of gold-fauceted bathroom fixtures, to see neatly arranged on a marble vanity those medicine-chest indispensables for daily living -- tiny soap in a tiny soap dish, a tiny toothpaste tube alongside a tiny toothbrush, tiny tissues, a tiny Band-Aid box and . . . a teeny, tiny bottle of Valium.   Meant, no doubt, to help one through a teeny, tiny crisis. -- SHARI LESSING                    . . .       RUBBER BANDS   Rubber bands hold things together things that belong the more, the tighter, Neater than paper clips that pinch or staples that leave scars long as an inch. Storable on wrists chewable as gum, they quickly uncoil when rudely twisted. Schoolboys shoot them like Cupid's arrows at girls who keep them for index cards or ponytails or playfully shoot them back. -- AL SPECTOR                      . . .         Sheran James is at the Ronnybrook Farm Dairy milk stand in the Greenmarket at Union Square when a girl, about 10 years old, wanders by.    \\"My mother is over there,\\" the youngster says to the proprietor, pointing to a neighboring vegetable stall. She buys two quarts of glass-bottled milk, then lingers by the fireboard facsimile of a cow roped to the edge of the stand. She looks up dreamily at the farmer and sighs.   \\"Oh, it's so nice to get out of town for a while,\\" she says.                    . . .

Metropolitan Diary"},{"year":"2005","title":"FOUND IN TRANSLATION: The winner of the Newbery Medal -- arguably the most prestigious prize a children's chapter book writer can win -- will be announced tomorrow morning in Boston. Because the Newbery is open only to American citizens or residents, one enormously popular writer who isn't in the running is Cornelia Funke, who lives in Germany and whose books appear here in translation. Funke has long been a phenomenon in her native country, where she has published some 40 books","excerpt":"she popped onto the radar screen in the United States in 2002 when her first novel to be issued here, ''The Thief Lord,'' made her, many young readers have said, the closest thing we have to a ''new'' J. K. Rowling. (Funke's latest book, ''Dragon Rider,'' is No. 1 on this week's children's chapter book list, which appears on Page 16 of this issue.) Books in translation by living writers have rarely made it onto The Times's children's list, and Funke's popularity shows no signs of dimming: both ''The Thief Lord'' and ''Inkheart'' are being made into big-budget films. Funke, who is 46, began her career as a children's book illustrator. She began writing her own books, she has said, because she was rarely fond of the stories she was hired to illustrate. Funke -- her name is pronounced FOONK-eh -- may not be at the Newbery ceremony, but she does like to spend time in this country. As she told The Buffalo News, she gets a thrill out of the way American children say her name: ''funky.''    SOUTHERN COMFORT: Last year's Newbery Medal winner, Kate DiCamillo's novel ''The Tale of Despereaux,'' continues to hold a place on the children's chapter book list -- it is No. 6 after 35 weeks. DiCamillo's book is about a mouse named Despereaux Tilling, a princess named Pea and a rat named Roscuro, and it's a story filled with castles and dungeons. While ''The Tale of Despereaux'' could hardly be more winning, some of DiCamillo's fans -- well, my kids -- prefer the laid-back charms of her first novel, ''Because of Winn-Dixie,'' which is No. 2 on the children's paperback list. The book is set in Florida, where DiCamillo grew up, and it's about a young girl who adopts a mangy dog and names it after the supermarket from which she dragged it home. (A film version of ''Because of Winn-Dixie'' is scheduled to open next month.) On DiCamillo's Web site, she offers children a few facts about herself: ''I am short. And loud. I hate to cook and love to eat. I am single and childless, but I have lots of friends and I am an aunt to three lovely children . . . and one not so lovely dog.'' DiCamillo, who now lives in Minneapolis, adds that she wrote ''Because of Winn-Dixie'' during a long, hard winter. ''I was cold and lonely and homesick for Florida. . . . I couldn't afford to go home, but I could write a book that took me there.''

By Jonathan Dee. (Ticknor & Fields, $19.95.) In his first novel, \\"The Lover of History,\\" 28-year-old Jonathan Dee has much to say, as well as a story to tell. Conjuring up a vividly evoked Manhattan where \\"yellow taxis darted in and out of each other's company like fish,\\" Mr. Dee constructs a cat's cradle of connections out of three characters' relationships to one other, to their personal histories and to events unfolding in the world around them. Diane Kendall and her roommate, Robert Warner (always referred to by their last names), live a cold existence where \\"eating alone seemed the norm.\\" Although they've occupied a thinly partitioned bedroom for two years, they barely know each other. Kendall hates her job as an engineer at an all-news radio station and grows weary of her lover Julian's lack of ambition to move beyond singing advertising jingles. Then the American Secretary of State is assassinated in the tiny island nation of Colozan and the United States declares war -- and the murder and its formulaic reportage in the media become catalysts for varying degrees of growth in each character. Julian, the innocuous charmer who signs petitions without reading them, grows least. Kendall, however, sees links between her alienation from her personal history and her estrangement from the larger currents of life","excerpt":"she recognizes that \\"the source of things might be found outside herself\\" and starts edging beyond Julian's sphere. Most intriguing is the high-minded if sanctimonious Warner, the lover of history of the title, a teacher who urges his pampered prep-school students to see their role in and responsibility for the larger world, yet is himself adrift in time and place. Some of Mr. Dee's pre-Iraq political gambits now seem obsolete, but more often they prove prophetic. This gifted young author, acutely aware of how lives intersect with history, himself weds art to wisdom with admirable authority.

It is entirely English in production and cast, with the exception of the lead, which is happily played by Dorothy Gish. The faults of most historical pictures, cluttered up as they usually are with scenery which producers seem to think the audience should see because it existed at the time in which the story is placed, is conspicuously absent, and \\"Nell Gwyn\\" is a smoothly developed and charming presentation of one of the most picturesque persons who ever intrigued the British court.The brattish, lovable, whimsical and generous nature of Nell, mistress of the King and idol of all London, gives the picture its flavor. It is impossible to think harshly of her. She found her way out of an alley to the theatre, where her droll humor made the city laugh, by the only means at her command. She never forgot her friends, her charities were boundless, she loved her royal patron and, if history is to be credited, remained faithful to his memory after his death. It is this Nell which the picture shows, a delightful hoyden, even in Whitehall. Majesty never had any terrors for her","excerpt":"she retained her fascination by being herself.With such a character it was possible to produce a picture full of whimsy and drollery. Nell meets the King at the door of the theatre in Drury Lane, that quaint old street full of pushcarts and theatrical history, and presents him with an orange \\"to sweeten the company he keeps.\\" Her vivacity attracts him, and when the audience is driven from the unroofed building by the rain he invites her to the inn opposite. Nell dines sumptuously, waving a chicken bone under the nose of her royal companion or poking him in the ribs with her elbow with a frank camaraderie which appeals to his weary senses.And when his companions have not sufficient money to pay the bill, Nell does so with an amusing appreciation of her position, which is infinitely attractive to Charles. He promises that she shall have her chance to be an actress, and sends her silken substitutes for her torn stocking, and buckled shoes to take the place of her shabby footgear.Whether Nell entered the theatre through Charles, or received her opportunity through earlier admirers, hardly matters. Once in the theatre her fortune was made, for her fame as a comedienne is fully as great as her fame as the King's favorite. She used the stage as the means to discountenance her rivals, and one of the most amusing scenes in the picture is the way in which she subjects Lady Castlemaine, her chief antagonist, to the ridicule which no favorite can withstand. Nell has been forgotten at a reception in Whitehall, where she had been lately installed, embarrassed and unhappy, while her royal lover hastens to the side of Castlemaine, gorgeous in a huge hat which is the centre of attraction. Nell pouts and then laughs, and the next night at the play comes on dressed in a hat so huge it might be an umbrella, under which her antics reduce her rival to impotent anger.But that is not all of Nell. When two of her old friends visit her at the palace she drags in the King to make him promise that he would give the palace he was building for her at Chelsea to the disabled soldiers of his kingdom. Tradition has it that that is the origin of Chelsea Hospital. And on Charles's deathbed, when with a wry smile he apologizes to his brother for taking so long to die, it is Nell who hurries to him and comforts him.\\"Don't let poor Nell starve,\\" he tells his brother, and then asks her, as the tears stream down her cheeks, to laugh one of her gay laughs for him, and to that laugh, joining in its infectious merriment, he dies.That was the end of Nell's career. For although King James obeyed his brother's wish and provided for her, she did not long survive her lover. But the picture of Nell ends with her scornfully disdaining King James's outstretched hand, and blowing a kiss to the bust of Charles.Whatever may be the shortcomings of English motion picture producers. If they can put together other pictures as simply and with as much dramatic effect as this story of Nell Gwyn they should have no difficulty obtaining a showing for them anywhere. The story moves quickly and surely, with nothing to strain one's credulity, and the acting of Miss Gish and Randie Ayrton, who takes the part of Charles, is excellent. So is that of Juliette Compton as Lady Castlemaine. The immorality of the period is suggested without being offensive, and for the second time this Summer a good picture has not been spoiled by prudery. The titles are unusually good and frequently amusing, that dear old gossip Pepys being resorted to for purposes of verisimilitude.

By Paule Marshall. (The Feminist Press, $8.95.) Paule Marshall's muses, she tells us, are ''the poets in the kitchen,'' West Indian immigrants like her mother who spent their days ''scrubbing floor'' for white housewives and then came home and talked away all silence, spinning language into richly patterned quilts. Invisible by race and invisible by sex, these women ''fought back, using the only weapon at their command: the spoken word.'' If their new country denied them, they would remake it in their own words: ''In this man world,'' they told each other, ''you got to take yuh mouth and make a gun!'' Like her muses, Paule Marshall lives in language","excerpt":"she retells the world in order to make it new. Her three novels span the last 25 years; the current collection - five short stories, an autobiographical essay and a novella, ''Merle,'' based on her superb 1969 novel, ''The Chosen Place, The Timeless People,'' Miss Marshall's finest book - is something of a sampler, offering an uneven but always rewarding introduction to her work. Unlike so much modern fiction, which often seems to be inscribed on the inside of a skull, Miss Marshall's tales are panoramic; her carefully detailed portraits are framed by restless social landscapes. In my favorite story, the autobiographical ''To Da-Duh, In Memoriam,'' a 9-year-old Brooklyn girl visits her grandmother on Barbados. The old woman, awed and terrified by rumors of New York, points out breadfruit, mangoes, fields of cane and asks triumphantly, ''Tell me, have you got anything like these in that place where you were born?'' When the child insists that New York has a building taller than the island's tallest palm or highest hill, the old woman and the old world are defeated.

In a tight gubernatorial race, Neil Hartigan, a Democrat who promised tax cuts, battled James Edgar, a Republican who emphasized the need for money for better schools. Mr. Hartigan is the State Attorney General and was a two-term Lieutenant Governor, while Mr. Edgar, the Illinois Secretary of State, is a former state legislator and aide to Gov. James R. Thompson, who is retiring.    Representative Frank Annunzio, a 75-year old Democrat who is a senior member of the Banking Committee, won his 14th term, fighting off a challenge from Walter W. Dudycz, 40, a Republican State Senator who portrayed Mr. Annunzio as a lax regulator who ignored wrongdoing. Mr. Annunzio said he had been working to bring to justice those who looted the savings and loans.    In the 16th District, John Cox, a county prosecutor, faced State Representative John Hallock, a Republican.   INDIANA    Although it appeared for a time as if the Democrat, Baron Hill, would mount a serious challenge to Senator Daniel R. Coats, the incumbent battled back with commercials that raised questions about Mr. Hill's consistency in opposing new taxes.    Representative Jill Long of Fort Wayne, a Democrat who won Mr. Coats's seat in the House, was challenged by a television evangelist, Rick Hawks. He attacked the incumbent as a big-spending liberal","excerpt":"she retorted that she had consistently opposed new taxes.   Representative John Hiler of the South Bend area, a Republican, faced Timothy J. Roemer, a former aide to Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona. Mr. Roemer tried to link Mr. Hiler to the savings and loan crisis: the Republican sits on the House Banking Committee, which oversees the industry. But Mr. Roemer's former boss, Senator DeConcini, has been linked to the scandal as well.  IOWA     Tom Harkin, a Democrat, met the difficult challenge of being re-elected Senator in Iowa; six years ago Mr. Harkin ousted the Republican incumbent, Roger Jepsen, who himself had ousted the Democratic incumbent six years previously.     Mr. Harkin spent more than $5.5 million in a successful bid to blunt the campaign of Tom Tauke, a six-term Rep resentative from the \\"Field of Dreams\\" country of northeastern Iowa.  Mr. Tauke said the incumbent backed liberal spending policies, abused mailing privileges and spent too much time outside Iowa.   Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican seeking a third term, defeated Donald Avenson, Speaker of the State House.   KANSAS    Gov. Mike Hayden, a Republican, lost to Joan Finney, who has spent the last 16 of her 65 years as State Treasurer. As in the Democratic primary, Ms. Finney stormed from far behind in the polls, making much of the Governor's tax changes, which hit small businesses and homeowners hard.    Kansas' junior Senator, Nancy Landon Kassebaum, a Republican, reconsidered her promise to serve only two terms, and her resulting campaign had history on its side. For one thing, Kansas last elected a Democrat to the Senate in 1932. For another, she faced Dick Williams, who backed into the race when the primary winner, Bill Roy Sr., declined his victory, citing fatigue. She won.  MINNESOTA    Minnesota proved to be one state where the heralded anti-incumbent mood took hold. State politics, once as homespun as the fictional Lake Wobegon, turned melodramatic as Peyton Place this year.   The Democratic Senatorial candidate, Paul Wellstone, claimed victory over the incumbent Republican, Rudy Boschwitz. Mr. Wellstone held a small lead, but many votes were still uncounted.    In the governor's race, the incumbent, Rudy Perpich, had a harder time after the Republican candidate, Jon Grunseth, made a last-minute exit from the race while dogged by accusations of sexual improprieties. Mr. Grunseth's replacement, Arne Carlson, gave Mr. Perpich a strong challenge.   In the Seventh Congressional District, State Senator Collin C. Peterson beat the Republican incumbent, Arlan Stangeland. The Democrat took advantage of disclosures that Mr. Stangeland had made hundreds of calls to a woman who is a lobbyist. Mr. Stangeland said the calls were business related.  MISSOURI    Two House races and an environmental measure dominated this state in the absence of campaigns for governor or the Senate.   Representative Jack Buechner, a Republican seeking his third term in the western St. Louis suburbs, faced Joan Kelly Horn, a Democratic campaign consultant and former head of the Missouri Women's Political Caucus. Ms. Horn sought to make abortion rights a major issue against Mr. Buechner, who opposes abortion.   In southeastern Missouri, Representative Bill Emerson, a five-term Republican who represents the Eighth Congressional District, was re-elected despite a challenge by Russ Carnahan, a Democrat who tried to ride the anti-incumbency issue. He is the son of Mel Carnahan, the Lieutenant Governor.   MICHIGAN    The governor's race seemed a straightforward waltz to re-election for the two-term incumbent, James J. Blanchard, but the 48-year-old Democrat managed to tread on a few toes. He dumped the popular 78-year-old Lieutenant Governor, Martha W. Griffiths, from the ticket, and his two terms coincided with the worsening of the state's economy.   But the Republican, John Engler, did not capitalize on the economic issue, and his opposition to abortion rights brought out legions to campaign for Mr. Blanchard.   NEBRASKA    Senator Jim Exon, the Democrat who won narrowly six years ago against a little-known challenger, faced another tough race, this time against Hal Daub, who was well known after four terms in the House of Representatives.    Gov. Kay A. Orr, a Republican, has been criticized over her refusal to block a proposed radioactive-waste warehouse that would store low-level waste from five states. Ben Nelson, the Omaha lawyer who ran against her, won the Democratic nomination by only 42 votes.   In the Omaha area, Representative Peter Hoagland, a freshman Democrat, campaigned in dozens of town meetings and mailings to fend off a challenge from Ally Milder, a former Senate aide. NORTH DAKOTA    The state's only member of the House of Representatives, Byron L. Dorgan, easily won re-election against his Republican challenger, Edward T. Schafer, heir to a detergent fortune.   While Mr. Schafer tried to tie the Democratic incumbent to the savings and loan crisis and criticized Mr. Dorgan's reliance on out-of-state campaign funds, the Democrat offered himself as a populist who would fight to preserve family farms and expand health care programs in rural areas.   Three ballot initiatives would allow gambling in the state, including the use of video gambling machines. OHIO    Republicans gained the Ohio Statehouse Tuesday when George V. Voinovich, the former Mayor of Cleveland, overcame a late surge of support for Anthony J. Celebrezze, the Attorney General. Gov. Richard F. Celeste, a Democrat, was required to step down after two terms.    Several House races were close. In the Eighth District, State Representative John A. Boehner, Republican, defeated Gregory V. Jolivette, a former Mayor of Hamilton. This is the seat once held by Donald E. Lukens, who was convicted in 1989 of sexual misconduct. In the First District, the Democrat, Charles Luken, the Mayor of Cincinnati, ran against former Mayor J. Kenneth Blackwell.  SOUTH DAKOTA    In the Senate race the incumbent, Larry Pressler, narrowly defeated two opponents: a well-financed Democrat and a vituperative newspaper.   Although the challenger, Ted Muenster, a Sioux Falls businessman, was well connected politically and commanded campaign funds approaching $1.6 million, Mr. Pressler mustered enough money to pay for a media campaign that stressed his independence from Republican Party politicking.   Mr. Muenster, who served as chief of staff under Richard F. Kneip when he was Governor, seemed to take his campaign script from The Sioux Falls Argus Leader, the state's largest newspaper. At times the Senator reacted more stridently to the newspaper's criticisms than to his opponent's.    The Democratic candidate was identified with the state's largest city, Sioux Falls, his biggest obstacle to unseating Mr. Pressler, who was strong in rural areas. Mr. Pressler regularly reminded the electorate of his 4-H membership and his John Deere tractor, which he uses to till his 80-acre farm. WISCONSIN     Wisconsin's popular Governor, Tommy G.  Thompson, a Republi can, swept to victory over his Democratic challenger, Assembly Speaker Tom Loftus. Mr.  Loftus was unable to mount much of a challenge, despite cam paigns stands that would seem to appeal to much of the state's normally liberal electorate.     Representative Rob ert W. Kastenmeier of the Madison area, a Democrat who was first elected to the House 32 years ago, was challenged by Scott Klug, a newscaster.   Representative Toby Roth, a conservative Republican from the Green Bay area, defeated State Senator Jerome Van Sistine, overcoming the Democrat's well-financed campaign.    Mr. Van Sistine, popular in organized labor circles, had questioned whether Mr. Roth, a member of the House Banking Comittee, which oversees savings and loans, should bear some responsibility for the industry's crisis.

Levi, who died in 1987, is perhaps the darker subject, though he provides a rare New York opportunity to catch the marvelously protean British actor ANTONY SHER, last seen here in the bioplay ''Stanley'' in 1997. But ''PRIMO'' is a much more personal endeavor. Mr. Sher himself has adapted the 90-minute monologue from several of Levi's books, most prominently the Auschwitz memoir ''If This Is a Man.'' The process wasn't easy. As described in ''Primo Time,'' a companion book, Mr. Sher had to overcome not only a crippling bout of stage fright but also the justifiable resistance of Levi's estate. In the end, the heirs understood that Mr. Sher was not going for Holocaust kitsch: shaved heads and ''striped uniforms, artfully dirtied.'' Instead, he appears in ''Primo'' as the professorial Levi, observing a world that is no less real for being mostly invisible to us now.

While it might be perverse to expect Ms. Somers's show -- called ''The Blonde in the Thunderbird'' -- to plumb Leviathan depths, her story is also about survival.

Knowing that the operators are often being monitored and timed for efficiency (and therefore want to get me off the phone as quickly as possible), I usually start by using their names whenever they are offered. My personal approach has sometimes won me a \\"Have a nice day,\\" or the supreme surprise: having the number I've requested read to me by the operator rather than the corn-belt-accented computer simulation.   But one recent conversation surpassed my greatest expectations.   Operator: Directory assistance. Joyce speaking.   Me: Hey, Joyce. I need the number for Chelsea Place. It's a bar on Eighth Avenue.   Joyce: And what if I don't want to give it to you?   Me (thinking quickly): Well, I'll just have to call your supervisor, won't I?   Joyce (playing along): Oh, you will, will you?   Me: Whoa! Someone's not being monitored today!   Joyce (laughing): Oh, who cares about that anymore. Anyway, I don't see a listing for Chelsea Place.    Although I never got my number, my day was made.

Squirrels, most certainly, have hearts  and hopes and tree-trunk homes  but if they could they probably would  laugh out loud at mortgage payments and  flat out scoff at overdrawn bank accounts.  Squirrels, no doubt, would surely ignore  early-hour alarm clocks and late-night  messages on fancy phone machines. Instead  newborn acorns and spring rains flower  their fantasies and seed their dreams. ROGER GRANET                    . . .       Dear Diary:   I was on a crowded elevator at the 92d Street Y when the doors opened and she stepped on. Blond, lovely, her face somehow familiar. But where, exactly, had I seen her? A magazine cover? A TV commercial? Her eyes met mine. \\"Hello,\\" she said. My heart stopped. \\"Hi,\\" I responded a little too loudly. Everyone in the elevator was listening. My mind was racing. That face! That face!   She spoke again: \\"Have you seen my father? I've been in the garden.\\" It all washed over me. A studio in Carnegie Hall some 15 years ago. A Phillip Barry play. That was my scene partner standing there in front of me. \\"Sarah?\\" I said tentatively. What a compliment: she had recognized me. And she had not only remembered the face, she remembered the lines.   I felt aglow, picked out of the anonymity of the crowd by someone so lovely. It was then that she said it: \\"I'm sorry, but I can't remember your name.\\"   \\"Gerry,\\" I offered.   \\"Oh.\\" The elevator door slid open and we stepped off together.    \\"So long,\\" she said softly.   \\"Goodbye,\\" I called after her.

Following are excerpts from Caryn James's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 3, 1990. The film, in Finnish with English subtitles, opened yesterday at the Lincoln Plaza Cinema, Broadway at 63d Street.                    . . .         For Aki Kaurismaki, being laconical and deadpan is high art. The downtrodden heroine of \\"The Match Factory Girl\\" spends most of the film looking pathetic and sad with excellent cause. But a glimmer of a smile crosses her face when she dilutes rat poison in water, for reasons the audience will soon discover. The film is a magnificent conclusion to a trilogy about Finnish working-class heroes that includes \\"Shadows in Paradise\\" and \\"Ariel.\\" This virtuosic work is heartbreaking until it turns outrageously funny.   The film begins with a log in a factory and follows the stages by which wood emerges as a box of matches. At the end of this long mechanical chain is a pair of hands hovering over a conveyor belt, making certain the mailing labels are stuck securely on the boxes. The hands belong to Iris, a wan blonde with circles under her eyes whose life threatens to remain as mundane and sterile as her job.   She pays rent to sleep on the couch in the apartment of her mother and stepfather, who do little more than eat and smoke. She puts on blue eyeshadow, goes to a dance and at the end of the evening is the only woman left sitting against the wall. And in a small act of heroism, she defies her parents and takes part of her paycheck to buy a cheap-looking red-flowered dress in which she is finally asked to dance.   As Iris, Kati Outinen has a slight, angelic smile as she rests her head on this strange man's shoulder. Her beautiful, unsentimental performance is all the more remarkable because so far Iris has not said a word on camera. No one, in fact, says very much in this film. Music and noise are everywhere, but dialogue is a luxury in Mr. Kaurismaki's spare esthetic.   Iris is no saint","excerpt":"she sleeps with the stranger that night and later finds herself in the kind of mess that makes her want to poison ratty humans. And the more rebellious she becomes, the more Mr. Kaurismaki provokes viewers to cheer her antisocial behavior.    The director's style is ruthlessly pared down, every scene edited to its core, every lingering shot of an empty room used to good effect. Yet Mr. Kaurismaki's buoyant energy fends off any hint of a mannered or minimalist approach. He keeps viewers trailing after him by unsettling every expectation.

She: Oh, please. Not a chance.   Me: You have nothing in a seven and a half?   She, with a vague wave toward a woman trying to put on a pair of rubber shoes: Just those. And they're going fast.   Me: No. Those won't be much help in the snow.   She: They'll do fine.   Me: Not in four inches of snow. The snow would come right in the top.

She played very smart, and I got tired. And impatient.\\"   More interested in prolonging points and retrieving balls than trying to outgun Capriati, Sanchez Vicario goaded the 15-year-old into 32 unforced errors, thwarted her pace with a hefty dose of powdery topspin and confused her with an unpredictable array of drives and drop shots.  Lost Opportunities    This knockout combination cost Capriati the opportunity to reach her first final in 1992 as well as a career-high ranking of fifth in the world.   \\"She was not in position to hit, and if she's not in position, she can't hit the ball hard,\\" said Sanchez Vicario, who will face third-ranked Gabriela Sabatini on Saturday in a final that Seles had won the last two years. Seles had reached 21 straight finals, in fact, before Capriati eliminated her on Wednesday, ending a string of 27 match victories as well.   Tonight Sabatini turned in a 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-1 comeback performance against Steffi Graf that was nearly a replica of their semifinal clash here last year, when Sabatini dropped the opening set without taking a game and then struck back, 7-6 (8-6), 6-1, in the next two.   \\"I never thought I was going to lose the match,\\" said Sabatini. \\"It was the most important moment when I was losing, 3-1, in the second set, but I kept attacking and coming to the net and, well, I came back.\\"   All crisp precision as this year's rematch began, the second-ranked Graf was drenched in indecision by the time it ended with her double fault on Sabatini's second match point.    \\"My serve was terrible today,\\" said Graf, who unraveled after the tie breaker and later said she was suffering from fatigue by the third set.   Once Sabatini began to ambush Graf's passing shot and charge in on nearly every return, the German was paralyzed, the Argentine energized.   Sabatini said she knows what to expect from Sanchez Vicario, whom she has beaten in 11 of 14 meetings: \\"She's a big fighter, and she runs everything down.\\"    Capriati expected that, too, but didn't have the energy to make her opponent fight her favorite way. It's Not Easy to Hit It Hard    \\"She likes a lot of pace, and I didn't play like that,\\" said Sanchez Vicario of Capriati, who saved two match points on her own serve but at 40-0 dropped a backhand into the net as the Spaniard served out the match. \\"I think she didn't know what to do.\\"   That's a problem that Capriati, like most girls 10 days from their 16th birthday and enduring the mood swings that accompany the age, is busy confronting on every front.   Today, she had trouble with her tennis. Instead of adjusting her game plan to the windy conditions, she tried to play the same swashbuckling style that served her so well against Seles, and when those high-minded shots went astray, she became frustrated and tentative, not inventive.   Tomorrow, tennis could be the last thing on her mind: \\"School, friends, and stuff,\\" said Capriati.   She's not a ponytailed prodigy anymore. Instead, she is an intermittently sulky superstar whose hair has turned a shade lighter than her disposition","excerpt":"she sneaked her favorite color, black, onto the court today in the form of a headband.   Although a smile comes more naturally than a frown, she is adamant about the fact that she's \\"not a baby\\" anymore and no longer feels comfortable cooing and gurgling in the spotlight.   Like all teen-agers, she spars with her parents; unlike most of them, she has to account for her growing pangs in public, which occasionally makes her irritable.   But Capriati, who already possesses the natural talent and mental tenacity of a champion, came to Lipton ready to compete, even if she was too bone-weary to show it in this semifinal.    \\"I was coming in here willing to play,\\" said Capriati, who two months ago wasn't. \\"I'd been working hard, my coach told me I was playing well, and I didn't want to let that go down the drain.\\" Capriati Too Tired For Pace"},{"year":"1998","title":"Lori Smith prowls East Village, SoHo and other 'hot' places, spotting trends for Givaudan Roure, one of the world's largest makers of perfumes","excerpt":"she sniffs out what is going on in the street, in fashion and in the culture generally for insights that perfumers can distill into marketable products; photos (M) Catching a Whiff of the Future; For a 'trend trekker,' if SoHo is today's destination, its aroma might be tomorrow's perfume"},{"year":"1927","title":"On Dr Laidlaw's statement on alleged connection with N Y S Census MRS.

The appetite in the print trade is presently for real stuff — the dirt, the poop, the nitty-gritty — and not for the obliquities and tenuosities of fiction. A writer is almost never asked to write a story, let alone a poem; instead he or she is invited to pen introductions, reviews, and personal essays, preferably indiscreet. (Pen them, then fax them. Instant modemed communication and rapidly overlapping semes are à la mode.) Human curiosity, the abettor and stimulant of the fiction surge between Robinson Crusoe's adventures and Constance Chatterley's, has become ever more literal-minded and impatient with the proxies of the imagination. Present taste runs to the down-home divulgences of the talk show — psychotherapeutic confession turned into public circus — and to investigative journalism that, like so many heat-seeking missiles, seeks out the intimate truths, the very genitalia, of Presidents and princesses. It is as if, here at the end of a millennium, time is too precious to waste on anything but such central, perennially urgent data. And so it has come to pass that, in the 1990s, as I turned sixty and then reached sixty-two (senior discount at the movies!) and then passed retirement age, instead of devoting myself wholly to the elaboration of a few final theorems and dreams couched in the gauzy genres of make-believe, I have cranked out, in response to many a plausible request, the mass of more or less factual matter, of assorted prose, which Knopf has herewith heroically, indulgently printed and bound, my fifth such collection and — dare we hope? — my last.

They had no children. Although at the time of her death Alice had no close living relatives, she was blessed with many close friends who will miss her dearly. For over 40 years, Alice worked for Ogilvy & Mather, an advertising agency in New York City, and, at 90 years of age, was a full time employee there until September of this year when she became ill. A very private person, modest and unassuming in her manner, Alice was a woman of diverse accomplishments and interests. She had a bachelor's degree from Wellesley College and a master's in psychology from Columbia University. An avid reader (especially of good mysteries), Alice was a regular visitor to the Mercantile Library. She took great pride in successfully completing the New York Times crossword puzzle every day. Alice was also an intrepid traveler and had been to many countries","excerpt":"she spent a lot of time in Greece and the Mediterranean.

Such is her personality, her charm, her reputation that long before the Capitol opened its doors on Saturday there was a long line of the Garbo public waiting to get inside. After seeing the picture they did not appear disappointed. They accepted everything—even the single standard, even the baby's reaching out its chubby arms in an effort to keep its home intact. Young women went away looking sad; young men went away looking wistful.\\"The Single Standard\\" is based on a story by Adela Rogers St. John, and tells of Arden Stuart and of her efforts at self-entertainment. It points out that while three gentlemen were able by the Newport (or wherever it was) code to go out with girls of the chorus, Arden was frowned upon for going with her chauffeur. So much were such actions frowned upon, indeed, that the chauffeur killed himself.After that, Arden brooded for a time, and then, on a rainy day, went for a walk. She ultimately wandered into an art show and met Packy Cannon, ex-sailor, ex-pugilist and at the same time one of the better known painters. Packy owned a yacht, and it was the next day that he and Arden sailed for the South Seas.Packy, however, had ideals about love, so he turned the yacht around and set Arden ashore to face her outraged friends. One of them, Tommy Hewlett, married her. During the course of the next three years, while Packy ambled about China looking for art and finding only \\"the memory of you,\\" Arden had a baby. So when Packy finally returned to America the matter was complicated.Arden went out to see Packy and promised to go away with him again; and Tommy heard of it and promised Packy that he would commit suicide to make a plane of the eternal triangle. But Arden remembered the child and canceled her booking on the \\"All Alone.\\" She saw the yacht depart from the shelter of her husband's arms.The rest of the Capitol's program includes the Movietone news, an \\"Our Gang\\" comedy in sound and dialogue and Dave Schooler and his \\"Capitolians\\" on the stage.

The text -- by Duncan's grandniece, Doree Duncan; Carol Pratl, a dancer and teacher; and Cynthia Splatt, the author of \\"Isadora Duncan and Gordon Craig\\" -- is, while graceful, a hit-and-run affair that gives minutiae nearly equal rank with major events and screens out such material as Duncan's besotted, suicidal states of mourning. For the grainy details of truth that bring a reader close to this mesmerizing figure, there's still no book to compare to Francis Steegmuller's \\"Your Isadora.\\" There one finds Gordon Craig, the actor and theatrical producer, commenting to Duncan on a photo of her and their daughter, Deirdre -- on how it misses perfection because mother is not looking down at daughter, but straight ahead at the camera.

She was candid -- for example, about her many lovers -- only as far as it helped drive up the price of her dresses.    One of the finer pieces in ''Chanel,'' the exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, illustrates how Chanel's ruthless instincts could result in outright moral corruption. The 1939 evening dress in ivory cotton organdy, with red, white and blue embroidery, was part of a ''tricolor'' collection celebrating French nationalism. But two years later, with the Nazis occupying Paris, Chanel cozied up to power, becoming the lover of Walter Schellenberg, an SS officer. She used the connection to keep her residence at the Ritz, home of ranking Nazi officials stationed in Paris.    Most biographies say only that she retired to Switzerland during the war and returned to Paris triumphantly in 1953. The Met's catalog alludes to these events ever so slightly. What it doesn't explain is the reasons for the exile. The Resistance was shaving the heads of women who had slept with Nazis and parading them in the streets; Chanel, who was arrested and released, fled before she could be subjected to that level of indignity, or to formal charges.
