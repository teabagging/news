This is one of the oldest productions the Met keeps on hand, and on Tuesday night, when it made its first appearance of the season, the rather amateurish backdrop with its cartooned landscape, the painted trees with absurdly pasted cherry blossoms and the sometimes awkward staging became far less important than what was happening to the jilted Japanese teen-ager.   It was also, of course, a tribute to the soprano Yoko Watanabe, who was returning to a role she has sung with success at the Met. The innovation of this production 35 years ago was its use of a Japanese director (Yoshio Aoyama) and set and costume designer (Motohiro Nagasaka) in an attempt to give a twist to the drama about the tragic meetings of cultures. Ms. Watanabe, who is also Japanese, provides a more genuine authenticity.

And it documents an odd, archaic fetish of feminine virtue which is quaintly picturesque.But for all its rather naive story-telling, it is one of the best of the Mexican films that we have yet seen, especially in the quality of its production, performance and musical charm. Much of the film was photographed in the colorful province of Tehuanchitan, and there is a visual integrity about it which is impressive and stimulating. Jorge Negrete is lusty and melodic as the romantic Robin Hood, and Margarita Mora is bland and beautiful as the maiden whom he passionately adores.

At least as long as those found in lesser Mexican dining spots, Camino Real's list includes many sophisticated Mexican dishes and specials influenced by the Southwest as well as the usual Tex-Mex offerings here composed with care  and without the sloppy gloppiness found in most other places serving them.    DINING OUT","excerpt":"Mexican-Spanish Cuisine in Pleasantville"},{"year":"1992","title":"NOT surprisingly, faux adobe arches and equally faux cactuses set the Mexican-Spanish tone for the large, convivial space of Camino Real, an expanse that seems made for the larger-than-life, eye-catching wall decor. At the entrance hangs a massive picture of an elaborately costumed dancer performing to the strains of a guitar strummed by a handsome, full-winged angel.\\n\\nAt the far end of the lounge, a dramatic mural offers personal glimpses of Mexican history and life and sweeps across at least 60 feet of wall. We were informed that employees and others connected with the restaurant contributed to this panorama, which owes more to Russian Realism than to Diego Rivera. Their distinct styles, nonetheless, provide much of the charm of the collage.

He promptly led them to qualification for the European Nations Cup of 1988 and the 1990 World Cup, where the Irish made the quarterfinals without winning a game (four ties) and despite scoring only two goals. In 1966, Charlton was a center-back for England's World Cup winning team, with his more famous brother, Bobby.\\nSTYLE Hustle, hustle and more hustle. Ireland plays no fancy soccer -- the green-shirted guys harass the opponents, rag the ball and, when they win it, clobber long passes down the wings, then cross it into the middle, hoping an Irishman will head it in before someone else heads it out. Midfielders tend to think defense first, so Ireland's own half of the field is often packed when the opposition tries to penetrate.\\nTOP PLAYERS About half of Ireland's squad is older than 30, including several key men: the goalkeeper, Packie Bonner (34); the team's best defender, Paul McGrath (34); midfielder Ray Houghton (32), and forwards Tony Cascarino (31) and John Aldridge (35). Bonner is Ireland's most-capped player, with 73 appearances for his nation since 1981. He's reliable, but has had trouble playing the ball out of danger with his feet (instead of scooping it up) as required under the new rule on back-passes from teammates. The versatile McGrath can play midfield or defense but will probably stay back, leaving leadership of Charlton's defense-minded midfield to Roy Keane, a 22-year-old who stars for Manchester United in the English top league, Houghton and Andy Townsend.\\nOUTLOOK With 3 points for a first-round victory and 1 for a tie, the Irish will be out of luck if they play as they did in 1990. In such a tough group, with Italy and Mexico capable of scoring a few goals, and with heat and humidity taking a toll on older players, Ireland must make its defensive style produce victories this time.\\nItaly\\nCUP APPEARANCES 12, or every tournament except 1958\\nLAST CUP 1990 (lost to Argentina on penalty kicks in the semifinals)\\nBEST SHOWING Champions in 1934, 1938 and 1982\\n\\nFIRST ROUND Ireland, June 18 in East Rutherford, N.J.; Norway, June 23 in East Rutherford, and Mexico, June 28 in Washington\\nCOACH Arrigo Sacchi took over the Italian national team in November 1991 after substantial success -- including two European Champions Cups and two World Club Championship Cups -- as head coach of AC Milan, one of European soccer's powerhouse clubs. Italian soccer had been stuck in a suffocating defensive style, and his Milan teams are sometimes credited with reviving energetic, attack-minded soccer (without abandoning rigid defense). Whether he'll be able to do the same with the Azzurri remains to be seen.\\n\\nSTYLE Sacchi expects his team to pressure almost constantly, which means the fullbacks often surge forward to join the attack, and the midfielders are on the ball as much as possible. He has players with the technical skills to win the ball often and to create dangerous opportunities often.\\n\\nTOP PLAYERS Italy has one of the world's best players in Roberto Baggio. The 27-year-old striker/attacking midfielder -- it's impossible to pin down his position, other than all-around creator -- plays for Juventus in the Italian league and was voted world player of the year for 1993. He has scored 19 goals for his country in only 33 games. Even when an opponent marks him man-to-man all match, Baggio has an uncanny ability to thread passes through a thicket of legs or squirm free himself, ball at his feet, for a brilliant shot or pass. Dino Baggio (no relation), a 22-year-old midfielder, scored the goal that beat Portugal in Italy's final qualifying match. Others to watch include Giuseppe Signori, who led the Italian first division with 23 goals last season; Daniele Massaro, an AC Milan forward, and Pierluigi Casiraghi. Italy has two other stars who could play for any team in the world: sweeper Franco Baresi and left fullback Paolo Maldini. Goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca rarely makes a mistake.\\n\\nOUTLOOK Italy must find other goal-scorers besides the Baggios. Most experts name Italy among the teams with good chances to win.\\nMexico\\nCUP APPEARANCES Nine (1930, 1950, 1954, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1978, 1986) \\nLAST CUP 1986 BEST SHOWING Quarterfinals in 1970 and 1986, each time as host.\\nFIRST ROUND Norway, June 19 in Washington; Ireland, June 24 in Orlando, Fla., and Italy, June 28 in Washington.\\nCOACH A former pro in the Mexican league and a certified dentist, Miguel Meijia Baron was an assistant coach to Bora Milutinovic, now the United States coach, in 1986 when Mexico made it to the quarterfinals. Baron took over the top job in January 1993 and led Mexico to startling success -- not only did the Mexicans win five of six qualifying-round matches, but they made it to the finals of the 1993 Copa America, the South American championship, before losing, 2-1, to Argentina.\\nSTYLE Skillful, fast, attractive. Mexico scored 17 goals in six qualifying-round games, but opposing defenses weren't high-caliber. Led by captain Ignacio Ambriz, Mexico has a veteran midfield and a solid, mobile defense corps that can join the attack readily.\\nTOP PLAYERS Mexico's greatest player ever, the striker Hugo Sanchez, is hanging on for one last try at age 35 (36 on July 11) but a knee injury has thrown doubt over his prospects.  Other talented attackers include Luis Garcia, Carlos Hermosillo and Luis Roberto Alves, better known by his nickname of Zague. Zague (whose Brazilian father had the same nickname as a pro player) has a zigzagging style of play, with unusually deft dribbling skills taking him at an opposition defense from all angles, and a powerful left-footed shot finishing off the job. The Acapulco-born surfer Jorge Campos is regarded as one of the world's best goalkeepers, and one of the most unusual. Not just for his glaringly bright jerseys, but for his forays upfield -- he has been known to surge out and play as sweeper, even to go forward and shoot.\\nOUTLOOK Mexico suffers by being in the toughest group but could surprise more favored Italy and is certainly capable of beating Ireland or Norway. Two big questions: whether the defense can hold up, and whether Mexico's adventurous style can be successful against veteran European teams in its group.\\nNorway\\nCUP APPEARANCES One (1938)\\nBEST SHOWING First round, 1938\\nFIRST ROUND Mexico, June 19 in Washington; Italy, June 23 in East Rutherford, N.J.; Ireland, June 28 in East Rutherford.\\nCOACH Egil Olsen has been in charge since late 1990 and freely admits to copying the English style of play. He is credited with organizing a thorough, if boring, defensive style that enabled Norway to win its qualifying group handily, featuring a 2-0 defeat of England in Oslo and draws against England and Holland on the road.\\nSTYLE To call Norway's style dull is probably charitable, but Olsen doesn't care. He insists all that matters is winning. His team mimics the English style of relentless running, rugged defense and, for offense, relying on a few long balls kicked way upfield in the hope of finding a scoring chance. Olsen also prides himself on producing what he calls the only team in the world with total zonal, and no man-to-man, defense. Whether zonal or not, it's certainly total; Norway usually plays a 4-5-1 formation, and the five midfielders are as likely to be playing defense as the four defenders.\\nTOP PLAYERS Fittingly, most of Norway's regulars play their club soccer in England. Best known are the lanky, 6-foot-5-inch center-forward Jostein Flo, who plays for Sheffield United, and the goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt, 31, who plays for Tottenham Hotspurs. Rune Bratseth, the team's 33-year-old sweeper and defensive anchor, plays for Werder Bremen in Germany and has helped that club win two league title and a Cup Winners Cup. \\nOUTLOOK Norway could steal games by playing its total defense if Flo, Jan Age Fjortoft or Kjetil Rekdal can also steal a goal. But if the Norwegians' style forges too many ties, they will have trouble reaching the next round because victories are now worth 3 points. Norway and Ireland are similar; Italy should finish ahead of both. If Mexico can solve the defensive shells, it, too, might beat both.

People spoke of \\"colombianizacion.\\" Then the gunmen of drug gangs shot a Roman Catholic Cardinal 14 times in a battle outside a busy airport last month, and the fear was no longer so abstract: Were the traffickers not starting to menace Mexican society, people asked, the way the cocaine suppliers in Colombia menace theirs?   The investigation into the killings of Juan Jesus Cardinal Posadas Ocampo, his driver and five other people in Guadalajara has again exposed a significant difference between the two countries. The greater threat to Mexico, it would seem, is not a war against the state waged by drug lords, Colombian style.

Such a move would greatly increase the probability that the North will go ahead with its first test firing in eight years.   A1    Environmental Danger in Iraq  Iraqi officials say that in a desperate move to dispose of millions of barrels of an oil refinery byproduct called black oil, the government pumped it into open mountain valleys and leaky reservoirs next to the Tigris River and set it on fire.
