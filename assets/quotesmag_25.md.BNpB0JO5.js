Reasonably enough, I didn't worry too much about it at the time. True, the baby had AIDS, but you don't transmit the HIV virus by sticking yourself with a clean needle when there's an AIDS patient in the room. I started to get paranoid in the bleary hours of the morning, when I found myself, as usual, sitting in my rocking chair and nursing my daughter. What if somehow the virus had gotten into that tiny hole made in my skin by that sterile needle?

Bowles, whose writing career was over by the time she had a stroke at the age of 40 and who died in 1973 at 56, was everything she said and more, including the wife of the novelist and composer Paul Bowles (\\"The Sheltering Sky\\"), with whom she fashioned a now-legendary open marriage in the sybaritic expatriates' colony of Tangier.   An original and independent woman, yet one who never escaped her demons or her husband's orbit, Jane Bowles was born to be a heroine for our time, if only a cult figure in her own. She'd be fascinating with or without her limp, as those who have read her letters, her biography (by Millicent Dillon) or Michelle Green's recent group portrait of the Tangier crowd (\\"The Dream at the End of the World,\\" published by HarperCollins) can attest. Her own literary output, however, was tiny: one novel, seven short stories and one full-length play, \\"In the Summer House,\\" which was revived at the Vivian Beaumont Theater last night.

She is perfectly natural during the happy stages of this production, but when tears well from her long-lashed eyes one is apt to think of the onion or the crocodile.During his experiences with the United States Navy Mr. St. Clair must have encountered ???me distinctly original types. In this film there is a commander who appears to be quite distressed because one of his seamon is in love The realism of this episode is one that will appeal strongly to the navy, for it cannot happen very frequently that an executiv officer of a battleship is so deeply loved by the story of a sailor's sweetheart as is this commander. Edward Briggs, seaman, is told by the three-striper that after he finishes his watch he will be permitted to go ashore again and patch up the differences between Trixie Deane and himself.Trixie is another of those sweet and pure little dancing girls in a hall frequented by Uncle Sam's blue-jackets. She isn't quite sure of herself when she is the source of admiration of half a dozen sailors, but when s??? real???s that Edward Briggs has gone back to signaling, thinking only of her, she is supposedly quite distressed. And as for Edward, he can't think of anything else but ???uteous Trixie. Even in signaling to another warship he winds up his message with references that his heart dictates to Trixie. This results in a puzzle for the recipients of the orders from the flagship, for t???ey???d ???quite understand the words conserned with Edward's g??? t???affec on for the chaste young dancing girl.Now and ???n, b??? unfortunately rarely, there are flashes of good humor in this produ??? which begins with glimpses of a fleet of warships. The story, however, is such that it makes about as much impression on one's mind as a colored comic strip. Its scenes in the dance hall are like dozens of other similar sequences and the actual work of the players is as harmless as the narrative.James Hall is the fitful Edward Briggs, who is most careful about having his white cap on at the correct angle. Mr. Hall does not exactly impress one as a seaman. Dan Wolheim officiates as a stern petty officer.Chicago has evidently won back Paul Ash, for he is not at the Paramount this week. But the audience there appeared to enjoy his successor Dave Apollon, an expert Russian dancer, who has a ready wit and a keen ear for music. His show is one of the best entertainments of its type that has been seen at the Paramount for some time. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Motion Picture Sailors. The Football Feud. A Moon and a Mirror.

The black record producer and song writer Berry Gordy Jr. started the company in Detroit in 1960 with an $800 loan from his family. By 1963, Motown was selling so many single records that it had only two serious competitors -the corporate giants CBS and RCA. In 1963, Motown's artist roster included Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Martha and the Vandellas, the Temptations, the Supremes with Diana Ross and Stevie Wonder. It was in that year that Berry Gordy established a traveling show that brought Motown's top stars and its up-and-comers into theaters and stadiums across the United States and Europe. The show was called the Motortown Revue.   Tomorrow night at the Palladium, on 14th Street between Third and Fourth Avenues, some of the brightest stars of the original Motortown Revues are getting together to perform their Motown hits again. David Ruffin, who was the distinctively gritty lead vocalist on the Temptations' ''Ain't Too Proud to Beg'' and ''(I Know) I'm Losing You,'' will be there. So will Martha Reeves, who sang ''Dancing in the Street,'' ''Nowhere to Run,'' and ''Love Is Like a Heat Wave'' as lead vocalist with Martha and the Vandellas.

The English electronic musician Kieran Hebden, better known for his recordings as Four Tet, comes out of late-90's experimental dance music, and seems to be formed more by his record collection. He is a quick-connection maker, a mixologist, a kind of excited librarian.     That they are improvising together as a duo -- in the studio, for two volumes of the recent ''Exchange Session'' albums (Domino) and on their current mini-tour, which took them to the Mercury Lounge on Monday -- is not the great surprise some have taken it for. Mr. Hebden has been folding snippets of free-jazz drumming into his recordings as Four Tet from the beginning, and so much of the music he admires, whether that of Karlheinz Stockhausen or the German rock band Can, involves long, real-time improvisation.

In the vastness of its scale, in the breadth of its humanitarian aims and in the simplicity of its language, this is music intended to move large numbers of listeners at first hearing and at no sacrifice of original intentions to mass appeal.   The \\"War Requiem\\" marked the reopening of Coventry Cathedral in 1961, and the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch, played it eloquently at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night. Destroyed by German bombs, the cathedral had been rebuilt. Britten's manipulation of the requiem format -- in which the generalized mourning of the Latin liturgy is alternated with the factual horrors of Wilfred Owen's war poems -- constituted a mending process of its own, a backward look at war that sighs with deep regret and offers bruised, tentative hopes for the future.

The central event, the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., had happened earlier that year.

As a rabbi, he offended me, symbolizing a fanatical bend to Judaism that frightened and isolated me. As a politician, he insulted me, offering solutions not only unacceptable, but also beyond implementation.   So why this sense of sadness? Perhaps because to me as a Jewish boy growing up in a tough Bronx neighborhood, Rabbi Kahane was a symbol of hope. At times, the mere mention of his name and the Jewish Defense League served as an effective deterrent against the local youths who would harass and fight with me almost daily. I swelled with pride at the thought that Jews were fighting back.   In the beginning at least, Rabbi Kahane touched a nerve in many American Jews. I remember my grandfather condemning J.D.L. violence and praising the J.D.L. in the same sentence. Meir Kahane symbolized a different Jew or, as he liked to say, a \\"new Jew.\\"   Where Rabbi Kahane erred, often in the United States, and always in Israel, was his inability to set limitations. He condemned without distinction, placing equal blame on Palestinian radicals and Jewish moderates.   When I joined the J.D.L., I wanted to stand beside Rabbi Kahane as he protected inner-city Jews who were no different from me. As he grew more radical, and I could no longer subscribe to his philosophy, I felt betrayed, as if his racism denied me the right to feel the strength and pride he had once helped instill in me.   He was once my hero. Although his assassination has stunned me, I cannot bring myself to mourn. I have been mourning the loss of Meir Kahane for years.
