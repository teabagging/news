Without consistent rainfall or regular irrigation from a sprinkler system or hose, a lawn will naturally go dormant.

Worth Reading    Although it's a busy time outdoors, several important new books should be mentioned because they are about plant choices. ''Plants That Merit Attention'' is the culmination of a three- year task taken on by the horticultural committee of The Garden Club of America. Edited by Janet M. Poor, the book brings to the forefront many little known trees with superior characteristics. This volume I is not based on the opinions of club members, but the recommendations of hundreds - horticulturists, botanists, taxonomists, dendrologists, nurserymen and landscape architects who responded to the committee's questionnaires and supported its desire to preserve diversity in the horticultural world. (Two more Volumes are on the committee's agenda: shrubs and herbaceous material).

But it is undeniable that American trade leverage over the Soviet Union has greatly decreased. In fact, recent history has shown the West to be more economically vulnerable to the Soviet Union than it seems to be to us. This has not been the result of the inherent nature of trade with the East, but rather of our failure to organize adequately to insure that such trade is mutually beneficial.

The top-seeded Runnin' Rebels (33-0) will face the third-seeded Pirates (25-8) on Saturday here in the West Regional championship game.    Beginning in mid-February with a 7-point victory over Oklahoma, Seton Hall has beaten virtually every team in its path. The Pirates have won 12 of their last 13 games, including a 12-point victory over Georgetown in the Big East tournament championship game. On Thursday, they overpowered second-seeded Arizona, 81-77.   The Runnin' Rebels are trying to become the first team since U.C.L.A. in 1973 to win a second consecutive national championship. But after routing opponents by an average margin of 29 points during the regular season, U.N.L.V., which defeated Utah, 83-66, on Thursday has appeared vulnerable. Seton Hall, with both a fearsome defense and an explosive offense, appears to have the weapons to stop the Rebels. Dehere Keys Offense     Seton Hall's offense is ignited by Terry Dehere, a sophomore guard, who is almost impossible to defend off the dribble. A good part of the Pirate offense is built around Dehere's ability to break down a defense and then either dish the ball off to Anthony Avent, a 6-foot-9-inch center, or pull up for a jumper.   Dehere is also the point man in Seton Hall's suffocating half-court defense, along with Oliver Taylor and Bryan Caver, who round out Seton Hall's outstanding backcourt. On Thursday, the Pirates at first appeared to have trouble with Arizona's big front line, but as the game wore on, they took Arizona's breath, and heart, away primarily with that defense.    Like Georgetown, which lost to U.N.L.V. in the second round by 8 points, Seton Hall is not in awe of the Rebels.    \\"Vegas is a good team, but there's no way in the world I think Vegas would go undefeated in the Big East,\\" Avent said today.    Clearly, the aura of invincibility surrounding U.N.L.V. has diminished. While that may not prove to make the Rebels beatable, it has certainly enlarged a psychological opening that did not appear to exist a few weeks ago.    \\"In the past, when people would ask me how great is this team, the thing I would always refer to is that the kids at times play with such a degree of intensity it's almost unbelievable,\\" said Jerry Tarkanian, the U.N.L.V. coach. \\"Right now, it's not unbelievable.\\" College Basketball: N.C.C.A.

Presented by Home for Contemporary Theater and Art, Randy Rollison, artistic director; Barbara Busachino, producing director. WITH: Chuck Coggins, Karen Levitas, Thomas Pasley and Lisa Welti.   There actually is no place like home in David Greenspan's \\"Son of an Engineer,\\" that is to say, home as a fixed institution doesn't exist. The story of a young man who returns to the suburban house of his childhood to discover his parents have \\"moved on,\\" this labored fable presents the nuclear family as a sinister disappearing act. And when a character turns on the radio, a voice announces, with comically frantic desperation, \\"All these people come and go from our lives, and we don't know them anymore.\\"   This is not very surprising news. Nor are the devices Mr. Greenspan employs -- a jumble of classic Albee-esque absurdism and imagery drawn from fairy tales, the Bible, Shakespeare, 1950's domestic sit-coms and apocalyptic science fiction -- particularly original.   As a result, \\"Son of an Engineer,\\" which has received a fairly skeletal production at the Here arts center in SoHo, often feels like a flat-footed, catch-all parody of vintage, symbol-laden avant-garde theater. It is unclear as to just how ironic Mr. Greenspan, who achieved a certain notoriety for his work with the New York Shakespeare Festival, is in his manipulation of this material. But there seems to be an agonizingly personal sense of anomie behind it.   The play's passive hero, identified only as the Killian Boy (Chuck Coggins), finds his old home inhabited by Tom (Thomas Pasley), a shaggy bear with a goofy, Disneyesque voice; Tom's wife, Phoebe (Karin Levitas), who dresses like Donna Reed and speaks with velvety ominousness; and Phoebe's mostly invisible daughter (Lisa Wells).   Directed with a cloudy mix of archness and anguished earnestness by Mr. Greenspan, \\"Son of an Engineer\\" includes a scene in which the naked son performs fellatio on the monstrously endowed paternal bear, while Phoebe ruefully washes her breasts in a Martian wilderness. It is that sort of evening.
