We lead them into it. For example, if someone is bothered by the fact that their son or daughter is running around the house touching everything, getting into everything, we explain that this is part of their natural urge to explore the world around them at that age. We show the mothers what to expect from their children and how to enhance their development.\\"\\n\\n A Different Start was founded by Irene Groban, a social worker from Hartsdale, and Joyce Smith, a producer of videos on health topics who recently moved from Larchmont to the Middle West. For 17 years, Mrs. Groban worked at the Youth Counseling League, a nonprofit organization in White Plains that deals with adolescents' issues. She frequently met pregnant teen-agers","excerpt":"often they would express need for baby food, diapers and other items, but, Mrs. Groban said, a broader approach was necessary.\\n\\n One day she read some newspaper articles about an organization called Avance based in San Antonio, Tex. Avance serves primarily Mexican-American women in their teens and 20's who had babies but re not sure about how to cope with raising them. The Avance theory, Ms. Groban said, is that a mother is a child's first teacher, and must attend to basic nurturing, education and discipline.\\nSan Antonio Example\\n\\n Mrs. Groban recalled, \\"I read the following words about Avance in a New York Times editorial: \\"Social dynamite is one way to define poor children who lack education and sound parental supervision. Overwhelmed is the way to define poor mothers who lack education and self-esteem. How to help the chldren and the mothers is a question that can overwhelm, too - so much that it may induce paralysis even among the most well meaning. To look at a parent-child education program in San Antonio called Avance, however, is to get an answer. You start when the baby is born.\\"\\n\\n Mrs. Groban said, \\"I thought to myself, this is it. This is the way to go. We teach mothers to be parents and teachers from the moment the baby is born.\\"\\n\\n Mrs. Groban's son, Robert, a lawyer, provided legal advice on starting a nonprofit organization. Her daughter, Betsy, a publishing executive, obtained a grant for a library of children's books. Mrs. Groban and Ms. Smith raised $250,000 for the first year of operation from foundations, corporations and individuals. \\n\\n They also searched for a place to set up the pilot project, which began this winter. At first they considered working with the homeless in Yorktown, but decided that population was too mobile to establish a continuing program. Eventually, they met with Peter Smith, director of municipal housing in Yonkers, and he offered space in Cottage Place, a subsidized project near North Broadway.\\nWednesday Sessions\\n\\n Mable Norman, a social worker who had worked at the Westchester County Penitentiary and in the AIDS unit of Montefiore Hospital, was recruited as the director. Annette Thomas was brought in as the teacher, and Ms. Burch as the community worker. Initially, Ms. Norman and Ms. Burch went from door to door in Cottage Place, asking young women if they would like to take part in the free program. Some said they were too busy, others promised but never showed up; 19 said yes and were there for the first class in December.\\n\\n Mothers drop off their children in the child-care room each Wednesday and go to the nearby community room, where they make toys. In addition to the scent books, they have created beanbag drums, dolls and happy-sad pillows - when a child cries, show him the side with the teardrop and the frown embroidered on it; when he is happy, flip to the smiling face. Sometimes Ms. Bolling takes videos of mothers and children playing at home, then discusses at a later session what they did and how they might encourage their children to explore even more.\\n\\n Ms. Norman and Ms. Thomas then spend an hour teaching. The curriculum, bought from Avance, covers 29 lessons. Among the topics are an overview in parenting, including mothers do make a diffrence and family structure; cognitive development, with stress on how children learn, master the environment and develop language, emotional needs, like the needs for love, belonging, success and attention, physical needs; discipline, including strategies for altering behavior; social needs, like group socialization and parental role and social confidence, and a unit on birth control.\\nNurturing Children\\n\\n \\"I compare a child to a plant,\\" Ms. Norman said. \\"I tell the mothers, a plant needs healthy, fertile soil and sunlight to grow. If you don't make sure the soil is healthy and gets a lot of nurturing, there is a strong possibility that the plant will not grow. Each plant has potential, but you have to nurture it.\\"\\n\\n \\"Mothers are like nurses, teachers and cooks; they have many roles,\\" she continued. \\"These mothers have expectations for their children - a few have told me for example that they would like them to be lawyers - but they don't always know how to best fulfill their expectations. There is a lot of frustration in a lot of these young women's lives. You try to show them the best way to enhance their children's development from a very early age.\\"\\n\\n For the women at A Different Start, this may mean something as abstract as \\"learning about my child's potential to be a good human being.\\" in Ms. Kelly's words, or as concrete as physical facts. \\"I didn't know that a child's foot grows so rapidly,\\" she said. \\"They tell me that age 1, his foot is one-half the size of what it will be when he is an adult.\\"\\n\\n And then there is graduation. At a recent class, the women were sewing their own gowns - white, with white caps and red tassels. Each will receive a certificate, as will the children, and there will be a party afterwards.\\n\\n \\"I'm really happy with this program,\\" Ms. Kelly said. \\"I feel it has prepared me so much for bringing up a child.\\" THE VIEW FROM: COTTAGE PLACE GARDEN;\\nClass That Teaches About Children and How to Raise Them"},{"year":"1994","title":"Ingmar Bergman once described to the critic Charles Thomas Samuels a passion \\"to create light: light and faces surrounded by shadows.\\" The great director told John Simon that he wanted audiences just \\"to sit down and look at the human face.\\" Many of these all-too-human faces -- often tragic, sometimes comic","excerpt":"often tormented, sometimes at peace -- are on display in INGMAR BERGMAN: Film and Stage (Abrams, $45). The subtitle is misleading: Robert Emmet Long's sensible text briefly summarizes and analyzes every film Mr. Bergman has written or directed, but only those stage productions that have traveled to New York in recent years receive more than a polite nod. The book contains plenty of shots of Mr. Bergman at work, though most of the more than 200 photographs are taken from his movies. \\"Fanny and Alexander\\" and \\"The Magic Flute\\" are amply illustrated, in color as well as in black and white, while masterpieces like \\"Winter Light\\" and \\"The Passion of Anna\\" are slighted. There is a splendid two-page reproduction of the dance of death from \\"The Seventh Seal,\\" yet turn the page to \\"Wild Strawberries\\" and you won't find a single image from the opening dream sequence. \\"Now About These Women,\\" which Mr. Long says \\"is commonly considered Bergman's worst film,\\" gets more picture space than \\"Persona,\\" which is possibly his best. The captions are occasionally instructive and occasionally erroneous (if that's Erland Josephson on page 119, I'm August Strindberg). Mr. Long, the author of \\"The Films of Merchant Ivory,\\" writes about Mr. Bergman's \\"intense preoccupation with women, perceived with a ripe sensuousness.\\" Thus it is no surprise that the stars of this book are remarkable actresses like Liv Ullmann and the magnificent Anderssons, Harriet and Bibi. Ingmar Bergman's God may be silent, but those three deities are pure eloquence.
