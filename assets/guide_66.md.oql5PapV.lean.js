A brilliant colorist whose work is often seen as falling somewhere  between representation and abstraction, Mr. Hodgkin \\"does not allow illustration to interfere with the making of a painting,\\" Mr. Auping writes. \\"Memory and metaphor are his preferred terrain.\\" Mr. Auping finds that Mr. Hodgkin's paintings of the last two decades have forged the unlikely pairing of Intimism and Expressionism from wildly diverse influences like Henri Matisse, douard Vuillard, Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns and Willem de Kooning. Or as the cultural critic Susan Sontag puts it in her illuminating meditation: \\"Hodgkin has understood that if the pictures are dense enough, they can go in two directions, doing justice to intimate textures as well as to emotions of a large expressiveness. (Both Vuillard and opera, so to speak.)\\" Along with 80 color illustrations are an erudite and informative epistolary exchange between Mr. Hodgkin and John Elderfield, the chief curator at large at the Museum of Modern Art, and the first catalogue raisonn of Mr. Hodgkin's oil paintings, compiled by Marla Price, the director of the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.
