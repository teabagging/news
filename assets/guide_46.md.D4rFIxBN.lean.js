A study of insinuating suspicions and mounting passions, this search for a murderer, executed on the same plane with a love affair between two of the principals, is engrossing if not precisely taut all the way.John Gilling, who wrote and directed \\"Murder Will Out,\\" was not niggardly with the red herrings dropped about but a fairly complex plot is made more involved by what appears to be a second murder and a confusing shift of sympathy from his heroine once it has been built up. His suspects, however, are not too numerous once the killing of a London publisher's secretary by a mysterious visitor is made known. There is the publisher, himself, who was being blackmailed by the lady","excerpt":"Jonathan Roach, a literary giant and her self-styled \\"father confessor,\\" and Hugh Allen, an aspiring but unheralded mystery writer, who was about to break their romantic liaison before she met her untimely end.Almost simultaneously the growing romance between Mrs. Roach, the attractive and intelligent wife of the top-flight author, and the unsuccessful Hugh Allen is made clear. Not so lucid, at first, are the designs of Jonathan Roach, whose cardiac disease leaves him the dire prospect of a very short life, nor the schemes of his beautiful wife, who is constantly harassed by her patronizing and domineering husband. Her desire to make her lover famous constitutes a sub-plot, a plan whereby he broadcasts over the B. B. C. stories written by her noted mate. In all, these schemes make a meticulously woven pattern but one that becomes a mite too intricate for easy viewing.James Robertson Justice is excellent in the role of the explosively articulate husband, a sophisticated, brainy man craftily devising just desserts for the erring people around him. Valerie Hobson is beautiful and sensitive as his badgered wife, a lady who finds that the wages of sin are unchanging. But while she is tormented enough to try murder, her switch in character seems unexplained. Edward Underdown is largely placid as her romantic vis-à-vis, while Henry Kendall, as the publisher, and Garry Marsh, as the Scotland Yard man, offer standard portrayals in standard assignments. To quote one of the principals, \\"Murder Will Out\\" illustrates \\"the pleasures of uncertainty\\" in an adult, innuendo-filled, often tense but overly complicated style.Also on the program is \\"Giselle,\\" a British-made, half-hour subject featuring Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin.

But the importation, which began its stand at the Rialto yesterday, is not only reminiscent of the law-comes-to-Tombstone variety of adventure but also combines with its melodramatics a visually impressive portrait of an underprivileged, tradition-shackled people and their rugged, Sicilian homeland. Against these attributes are ranged a sometimes discursive script, an improbable romance and a climax which seems contrived in view of the generally persuasive goings-on that precede it.The proceedings depicted center around Guide Schiavi, a 26-year-old magistrate sent to tackle the snarled legal affairs of a Sicilian village held in thrall by the Vigilante-like Mafia and the Baron, owner of the town's shutdown mine. Despite the opposition of a sullen peasantry and the conniving leading citizen, the Judge wins the admiration of the impoverished populace by forcing legal action to open the mine and courageously arresting a member of the Mafia suspected of murder. But his bravery and sincerity is ineffectual and it is only the murder of a youth who has befriended him which keeps him from resigning from his thankless assignment. And, in a climactic tirade against the townsfolk assembled in the public square, he not only converts the Mafia to the side of justice but succeeds in taking the culprit in the name of the law.Massimo Girotti gives a genuinely restrained portrayal as the youthful, beleaguered limb of the law who is willing to face possible death to bring order to his bailiwick. And, while his love for the unhappy Baroness, seems somewhat extraneous to the principal matters at hand, his decision to stay with the job and forego taking the lady away with him, also appears to be a courageous act.Charles Vanel is excellent as the leader of the Mafia, a hard but somewhat glorified figure who finally desists from his private and bloody law practice in favor of the real thing. And, Camillo Mastrocinque, as the crooked Baron","excerpt":"Jone Salinas, as the unhappy Baroness and Saro Urzi, as the Judge's brave and faithful police assistant, add competent characterizations in the other principal roles.But despite the English subtitles which make the plot lucid, \\"Mafia\\" is no definitive study of a feared organization. It is, however, robust, if not novel, melodrama, in which the faces of the sturdy peasants, fearful of and resigned to the Mafia, and the well-photographed background of their stark, arid and sun-drenched countryside, are often more striking than the story.

The individual responsible for the diabolical plot deserves commendation for having been able to carry out his ideas so perfectly, and his victims are as foolish as he is clever.The evil genius of this shocker telephones a telegram to be sent to eight different persons inviting them to dinner in a penthouse. These messages are signed \\"Your Host.\\" Curiosity tempts the recipients of the telegrams to accept the invitations. One gathers that the \\"host\\" has rented the penthouse for the evening and also engaged (through an agency) a chef, a butler and an assistant butler. This he accomplishes without being seen by any of the persons involved. He also reveals a marvelous ingenuity by his arrangements. A voice talks to the guests over the radio and apparently the slayer hears all that is going on in the place. Each one of the eight guests—it is not disclosing anything important to say that the ninth guest is referred to as death—is presumed to have some reason for killing one of the others.When the men and women decide that they would prefer not to stay in the place, the radio voice warns them that there is no safe way out. They will be killed if they tamper with the radio and the iron gates outside are charged with a high voltage of electric current. In getting rid of five of the persons poison, bullets and electrocution are employed.As comedy relief there is the conduct of Vincent Barnett, the assistant butler, who during one episode tackles a large piece of ice, which he finally gets rid of by putting it in the oven. He is obviously too stupid to be the \\"host.\\" Another man looks as though he might be the fellow who has arranged the little death party, but it chances that he is one of the first to die.No murder mystery is complete without its lovers and here with five bodies spread around various parts of the penthouse one hears the protestations of affection between a young man and a pretty girl. Who they are does not matter, but the audience knows full well that neither of them will perish and that they have nothing to do with the expert who arranges an evening of murders.The surrounding program includes \\"Bees and Bears,\\" a Walt Disney \\"Symphony\\" cartoon, and a short subject called \\"What Does 1934 Hold?\\" On the stage is a Fanchon & Marco revue, with Kramer and Boyle, Rodney and Gould, Falls, Reading and Boyce","excerpt":"Jones Preble, Elka, a violinist; Renoff and Renova, Rube Wolf and his band and the Gae Foster dancers.

Died on December 28 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York of complications from leukemia, for which he had undergone a bone-marrow transplant in March. Born in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1943, Mr. Wheelock attended the Tower Hill School and the Canterbury School, New Milford. He graduated Magna Cum Laude from Yale University in 1965, receiving a B.A. in Italian Studies. Fluent in three languages, he had a passionate interest in Italian medieval and humanist literature, in particular Dante and Boccaccio, which inspired an impressive career as a scholar. In 1971 he received a Ph.D. from Columbia University, where he received the Woodbridge Distinguished Fellowship and a Fulbright Fellowship. After living in Milan, Mr. Wheelock joined the faculty of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and became the youngest department chair in the university's history. In 1980 he made a significant shift in his career, leaving academia to focus on real estate development, in particular historic preservation in the Capitol Hill section of Denver where he lived. Mr. Wheelock was also a founding board member of Opera Colorado and co-founder and board member of the Colorado Wagner Society. Mr. Wheelock returned to New York in 1986. After years of full-time volunteer work at the GMHC, he became Assistant Director of the Legal Department and then director of both Intake and Client Services. In 1996 he began JTSW Consulting, specializing in data management for not-for-profit medical organizations. Among his clients was the AIDS Institute of the New York State Department of Health, for which he developed, under the federal Ryan White CARE Act, an electronic records system to improve medical care and treatment for children with AIDS. The system is currently being used throughout New York State and Kenya. His clients also included The League for the Hard of Hearing and the Medicare Rights Center. In addition to Thomas Padon, his partner of eighteen years, Mr. Wheelock is survived by his son, James T.S.

It is, instead, a show-biz saga of lost innocence, the story of how a modest, tuneful little musical from the 1960's grew and grew, through successive incarnations, into an oversized, glittering symbol of the Age of Hype.   \\"Joseph\\" began life 26 years ago, when Mr. Rice and Mr. Lloyd Webber were 19 and 23, respectively, as a 20-minute cantata for an English boys' school choir. In short order, it was revised and expanded, turning into the sort of unpretentious, inexpensively mounted musical that relied mostly on its infectious melodies and young, enthusiastic casts. An understandable favorite of schools and stock companies, it received a fondly remembered, intimate production at the Entermedia and Royale Theaters in 1982.

S. S. four years ago in a frank \\"cloak and dagger\\" melodrama which went by the title \\"O. S. S.,\\" is being recalled to duty—in combative sprit, at least—in the Paramount's latest offering, \\"Captain Carey, U. S. A.\\" But the old fire is obviously missing, not only in Mr. Ladd but in Paramount's swivel-chair scriptwriters. Captain Carey is a disappointing dud.To be sure, he is now operating entirely on his own—and on a mission for which he has slight stomach, considering developments in the case. Seems that this Captain Carey, a former O. S. S. officer, has returned to northern Italy to settle a wartime score, to seek out the underground traitor who betrayed him and a pal to the foe. And hardly has he started when he discovers that his old sweetheart, whom he thought dead, is married to a local of dark appearance. Quite enough to deflate any man.But that isn't the fault with the picture. Captain Carey—or rather, Mr. Ladd—has often surmounted disappointments much more depressing than this. The fault is that the activities of Captain Carey and the others in the piece are much too lethargic and discursive for any interest to accumulate. In the first place, the plot is thickened to the density of a bucket of tar and, in the second place, the solving of the mystery is about as compelling as a slap on the wrist. Only in the final sequence, when Captain Carey gets his man in a basement room, do the fists really fly, the daggers whistle and the furniture dissolves into kindling wood.In the role of the moody Captain Carey, Mr. Ladd weaves a melancholy course through a great deal of fake Italian scenery and actors in fake Italian roles. It appears (and for very good reason) that he has little interest in the job. When he comes out of that last contusive battle, he perceptibly heaves a sigh.And no wonder. The least prepossessing of his playmates within the heavy cast is Wanda Hendrix, who is supposed to be the lady—the Italian countess—to whom he has given his heart. But neither as countess nor as heartthrob does Miss Hendrix convey any more than a vague thought of a high-school drama heroine. And she fresh from \\"The Prince of Foxes\\" and the Renaissance!Francis Lederer, as this lady's black-browed husband","excerpt":"Joseph Calleia, as a doctor in the town; Virginia Farmer, as a grim Italian peasant, and many more perform in secondary roles.
