It documents the ways in which companies can make their employees feel appreciated, from having a chief executive stop by to pay compliments for good work to giving everyone, including receptionists, a business card to featuring workers in commercials or giving them cars.

Young, blonde and French, she has no desire to spend any more time with ''an over-the-hill Don Juan.''      And who would? But more to the point, who uses words like ''bachelor'' and ''Don Juan'' -- or any of a number of similarly quaint synonyms (rake, rogue, roué, ladies' man) -- anymore?

The film, which opens the Joseph Papp Public Theater's 1994 Italian Summer Festival tonight at 8:05, is remarkably similar in look and pacing to the Broadway musical adaptation except for one crucial difference. The character of Fosca, the ugly, ailing woman who conceives an obsessive passion for Giorgio, a handsome 19th-century cavalry officer, was softened for the Broadway musical.   The difference between Valeria D'Obici's movie portrayal of Fosca and Donna Murphy's performance is the difference between commedia dell'arte and Chekhov, between Margaret Hamilton in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and Olivia de Havilland in \\"The Heiress.\\" The scenes in which Miss D'Obici's bony, hollow-eyed Fosca throws herself at Bernard Giraudeau's dashing Giorgio lend the film an undertone of gallows humor. The character is a leering, voracious symbol of death. Ms. Murphy's lush voice and air of mournful abjection, deepened by Mr. Sondheim's yearning music, makes Fosca seem more romantically tragic than scary. The two performances are equally powerful in their very different ways.
