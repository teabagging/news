TODAY'S TOP STORIES  The authorities detained the governor of the Nenets Autonomous District in the Russian Far North, Aleksei Barinov, making him the first governor in the Russian Federation's history to be deprived of political amnesty, according to several newspapers that featured the case prominently. Mr. Barinov is under investigation for what officials said was fraud and the misappropriation of land. Most newspapers were more skeptical, saying Mr. Barinov's detention had more to do with his politics than the law.      Kommersant said that the governor's refusal to acquiesce to Moscow's demands to dismiss the region's representative in the upper house of parliament, Aleksandr Sabadash, might have caused authorities to move against him. The newspaper said that the timing of his refusal and subsequent arrest was \\"hardly accidental.\\" Mr. Sabadash tendered his resignation on Tuesday anyway, saying that he \\"did not want innocent people to suffer,\\" Kommersant reported. Trud, normally a pro-Kremlin paper, echoed criticism that authorities could be punishing Mr. Barinov for refusing to comply with the demands to remove Mr. Sabadash.     Another explanation, the papers reported, was that the Kremlin might have been retaliating against Mr. Barinov for his criticism of domestic energy policies, which he said recently were draining the resource-rich region of its gas and oil revenues. The governor, on the eve of his detention, accused the prosecutor general of acting in accordance with \\"commercial structures that have oil interests,\\" according to Gazeta. The governor has also filed suit against energy companies, including the state oil giant Rosneft, which has very close ties to the Kremlin. The region's deputy governor, Vladislav Peskov, told Kommersant that Mr. Barinov was really being persecuted for trying to ensure that \\"gas dollars stay in his region\\" and out of the Kremlin's hands. He said that the case against Mr. Barinov was intended to be a message to defiant politicians across the country, in an effort to silence them. The vice governor of Volgograd, Aleksandr Shilin, however, expressed faith in the country's judicial system. \\"A thief should sit in jail,\\" he told Kommersant.    OTHER NEWS    KOMMERSANT  LUKASHENKO STATE OF NATION ADDRESS: President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus gave his state of the nation address on Tuesday.

But even though there are many attractions to the adjustables - including lower initial interest rates than the fixed varieties often carry - there are also many pitfalls. Among the pitfalls: the uncertainty regarding total payments over the years, and ''payment shock'' if rates rise significantly during the term of the loan.
