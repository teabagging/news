He showed the kind of clothes the French seem to appreciate the most: provocative and seductive without being vulgar. It's a hard line to follow, but the designer managed with a well-tempered wink.    The good news is that he's constantly growing as a designer. Just a few seasons back he was wrapping and draping his dresses tautly around the torso. Women loved them because they were blatantly sexy. But fashion changes, and this time he's far more subtle. His long torso line, in suit jackets as well as dresses, hangs straight but still manages to suggest curves underneath.

Kismet and selah.Statement: Skiing is a joy to behold, but you won't catch us trying it. Mountain goats, avalanches and people like the film's Guzzi Lantschner, Walter Riml and Hella Hartwich were meant to frolic on trackless snowslopes, leaping from crag to crag, weaving past ice-bitten boulders, zipping over gorges and canyons and gullies. We were meant, by nature and preference, to sit in one of the Playhouse's comfortably upholstered seats, in a snug steam-heated atmosphere, with an excitable matron behind us to raise an appropriate clamor (on our behalf) whenever the persons with the wooden overshoes did anything particularly daring—which was constantly.\\"Slalom,\\" with a reasonably imperceptible story to bind it together, is a truly magnificent series of studies of some of Europe's greatest skiers, ski-jorers, skaters and bob sledders in action. It was filmed in Switzerland—with the usual Alps providing their usual splendid backdrop—by a trio of camera men who must have been hanging by skyhooks to get some of their action shots. Whether you know anything about the sport or have been in the habit of regarding it, as we do, with philosophic detachment, you will find it an exhilarating, lovely and thoroughly amazing picture. We still refuse to believe that people can do such things on skis. And, even though the Lantschner-Riml-Hartwich trio makes them look easy, we don't intend to try.
