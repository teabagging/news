Ruth W. Messinger (D-L) is the incumbent.     1st COUNCIL DISTRICT  MARGARET S. CHIN (D) Director, Chinatown Center of La Guardia Community College","excerpt":"member of Community Board 1; a candidate for City Council in 1991. KATHRYN E. FREED (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; tenant lawyer and former counsel to New York State Assembly Consumer Affairs Committee. JUDITH JOICE (D) Businesswoman; co-owner of the Lion's Head, a restaurant and bar on Christopher Street; member, Greenwich Village Chamber of Commerce; member, Mayor's Small Business Advisory Board; former member, Community Board 2. THE CAMPAIGN: Lower Manhattan Democrats have a rematch from 1991, but with strategic realignments. Councilwoman Freed won a four-way race two years ago by nearly 1,000 votes. Ms. Chin, the runner-up, is renewing her bid to become the Council's first Asian-American member. But 1991's two other losing candidates support Ms. Freed, a veteran party official and legislative aide who won many endorsements from political clubs, unions and elected officials. Ms. Chin's base is Chinatown. Ms. Joice, the new entrant, draws support from Greenwich Village. All are spending heavily. In their Aug. 13 financial filings, Ms. Chin led with $63,910 raised to $45,913 for Ms. Fried and $39,371 for Ms. Joice. 2d COUNCIL DISTRICT  MIRIAM FRIEDLANDER (D) Former City Council member who served for 18 years until 1991; created and was chairwoman of the Council's Committee on Women. SYLVIA M. FRIEDMAN (D) Housing policy analyst with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development; former teacher; member, Community Board 6; chairwoman, Housing and Homeless Committee, Community Board 6. ANTONIO PAGAN (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; former executive director of Coalition Housing, a nonprofit developer of low- and moderate-income housing; former member, Community Board 3. THE CAMPAIGN: At the age of 79, Ms. Friedlander is fighting to regain her seat from Mr. Pagan. She was the only Council member to lose in the 1991 primary, by barely over 100 votes out of 12,000 cast in the ethnic and political cauldron of Gramercy Park, the East Village and Lower East Side. While Mr. Pagan is gay, the city's other two gay legislators, Councilman Thomas K. Duane and Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, pointedly backed Ms. Friedlander. Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan also mobilized support for her. Mr. Pagan also has a long list of endorsements, and benefits from popularity with Hispanic voters. By Aug. 13, Ms. Friedlander had raised $64,960, compared with $56,509 for Mr. Pagan. Sylvia Friedman, a newcomer to the race, who could siphon votes from Ms. Friedlander's base as a liberal Jewish woman, raised $41,530. 3d COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Thomas K. Duane (D-L) is the incumbent. 4th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Andrew S. Eristoff (R-L) is the incumbent.  5th COUNCIL DISTRICT  BARBARA W. KLOBERDANZ (D) Political consultant; former teacher; former member, Community Board 8. SAMUEL D. MORELL (D) Liquor sales, wine imports; former salesman in wholesale and retail clothing; a candidate for City Council in 1980, 1982 and 1985.  No Republican primary. Charles Millard (R-L) is the incumbent.  THE CAMPAIGN: The Democratic winner here faces the unenviable task of running in November's election against Charles Millard, the Republican-Liberal incumbent. Ms. Kloberdanz, City Council President's liaison to the Council, is backed by several political clubs and legislators. She stresses quality of life issues and Council oversight powers. Mr. Morrell, who proposes a medical van for the elderly, Upper East Side jitneys and using vacant lots for parking, has run several times before. 6th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Ronnie M. Eldridge (D-L) is the incumbent. 7th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Stanley E. Michels (D-L) is the incumbent. 8th COUNCIL DISTRICT  WILLIAM DEL TORO (D) Minister, Chapel of the Sacred Heart of Jesus; chairman of the Community Housing Anti-Crime/Anti-Drug Task Force; a candidate for City Council in 1991. FRANCISCO DIAZ JR. (D) District Manager, Community Board 11; former Housing Development Adviser for Homesteading Coalition; community organizer in East Harlem. ADAM CLAYTON POWELL 4TH (D-L)City Council member elected in 1991; son of Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the late Harlem Congressman; former assistant district attorney in the Bronx; worked for Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman. THE CAMPAIGN: Adam Clayton Powell 4th, 31, is struggling to keep his seat in this district that encompasses part of the South Bronx. In 1991, William Del Toro squeezed by Mr. Powell with 34 votes in the first tally but lost to him in a court-ordered runoff after hundreds of voting irregularities were found. Mr. Del Toro has returned to challenge Mr. Powell. The Del Toro name carries clout in East Harlem, where most of the district's residents live. Mr. Del Toro is a minister and the brother of State Assemblyman Angelo Del Toro.   A wild card in the race is a third candidate, Francisco Diaz Jr. Mr. Diaz, who is on leave from his job as district manager of Community Board 11, has the backing of Congressman Charles B. Rangel.    All candidates claim to have toiled in different arenas to help solve the district's most pressing problems: drugs, crime, poor services and a housing shortage. But the outcome may be decided less on issues than on political alliances and the influence of the candidates' supporters. 9th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. C. Virginia Fields (D-L) is the incumbent. 10th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Guillermo Linares (D-L) is the incumbent. BRONX BOROUGH PRESIDENT  MONICA BRAGGS (D) Real-estate saleswoman; co-founder and chairwoman, CENBRO Local Development Corporation, a community outreach organization in central Bronx; member, N.A.A.C.P.; Executive member (Secretary), Community Board 4 and serves on its Economic Development and Youth committees. FERNANDO FERRER (D-L) Borough President since 1987; former City Council member, served five years; former chairman, Council Health Committee; former Housing Director in the Bronx Borough President's office; member, N.A.A.C.P. THE CAMPAIGN: Fernando Ferrer, one of the most powerful Hispanic politicians in the city, is seeking a second full term as Borough President. He was first elected to the post in 1987 to fill out the term of Stanley Simon, who resigned in a corruption scandal. Mr. Ferrer's opponent is a political newcomer, Monica Braggs, who works in real-estate sales.   11th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. June M. Eisland (D-L) is the incumbent. 12th COUNCIL DISTRICT  CAROLYN J. ALESSANDRO (D) Computer specialist; graduated from Brooklyn College; involved in successful campaign by husband, Francis, for Civil Court Judge in the Bronx in 1990. SAMUEL BURKE (D) Supervisor of transportation, Montefiore Hospital; former legislative aide to Senator Jeff Korman; member, Community Board 10, serves on Health and Human Services Committee; member, Public School 178 Parents Association; member, N.A.A.C.P. LAWRENCE A. WARDEN (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; former health care administrator; member, N.A.A.C.P. THE CAMPAIGN: Old political scores are being settled here. Councilman Warden was first elected in 1991 with the help of the Bronx Democratic chairman, George Friedman, but then backed an insurgent bid led by Larry Seabrook to oust Mr. Friedman. That failed, and now Mr. Warden now finds his renomination challenged by Mr. Burke, a party district leader endorsed by Mr. Friedman. Both candidates are black, but Mr. Burke's home base is Co-op City, which has a heavily voting white population. But Mr. Warden also has support in Co-op City, the advantage of incumbency and the Seabrook faction's backing. 13th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Michael DeMarco (D-R-C) is the incumbent. 14th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Israel Ruiz Jr. (D-L) is the incumbent. 15th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Jose Rivera (D-L) is the incumbent. 16th COUNCIL DISTRICT  WENDELL FOSTER (D-L) City Council member elected in 1978; minister, Christ Church; Chairman, International Intergroup Relations Committee; member, Finance, Education and Parks Committees; member, N.A.A.C.P., World Peace Council and the Urban League; Founder, Bronx Shepherds Restoration Corporation, which builds low-income housing. CARMELO SAEZ JR. (D) Community advocate; management consultant; President, School Board 9; former member, Community Board 4; former director, Development of Youth Inc., a private nonprofit center for youth; former executive director, Alianza, a federation of Hispanic organizations in the Bronx.  THE CAMPAIGN: This contest pits a longtime minister against the chief of a scandal-ridden school board. The Rev. Wendell Foster has served on the Council 15 years. His challenger, Mr. Saez, was removed as school board president in District 9 last year, accused of mismanaging funds and using school equipment for private business.    The district suffers from low reading scores. Nine board members have been arrested in cases involving theft, extortion, kickback and abuse of office. Denying wrongdoing himself, Mr. Saez won re-election to the board this year. Mr. Foster raised a hefty $76,088 campaign chest by Aug. 13. Mr. Saez did not file a financial report by the deadline. 17th COUNCIL DISTRICT  RAFAEL CASTANEIRA COLON (D) City Council member elected in 1981; Chairman, Civil Service and Labor Committee. DAVID ROSADO (D-L) New York State Assemblyman (74th Assembly District), elected 1990; former district leader; former member, Community Board 2 and Area Policy Board 2; former member, Community Board 1; Youth Coordinator, New York City Youth Bureau; administrative, alcoholism rehabilitation program; former machinist and garment worker. ANDREW EATMON JR. (D) A Legal Aid lawyer. THE CAMPAIGN: Despite a 704-count indictment accusing Councilman Colon of stealing $389,000 in city funds, he proclaimed his innocence and continued his reelection bid. Prosecutors said he cashed paychecks for phantom employees and also voted from a false home address.    Before being indicted, his career was already troubled. Democratic leaders and Ramon Valez, the powerful local head of private social service agencies, abandoned Mr. Colon after his girlfriend accused him of assault in a child support dispute. There were accusations that he lived outside the council district. Earlier, Mr. Colon's ex-wife said his failure to pay alimony forced her onto welfare. The new candidate backed by the party and Mr. Velez is Assemblyman Rosado.    Andrew Eatmon Jr. ran for this seat in 1991, but Mr. Colon prevailed.   A fourth contender, Rafael Mendez, a perennial candidate from the radical New Alliance Party, was removed from the primary ballot for lack of sufficient signatures in August, but he remains on the ballot in November as an Independent. Financial filings on Aug. 13 showed Mr. Colon had raised $39,1756. State filings showed that Mr. Rosado had $1,300 in loans and contributions. 18th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Lucy Cruz (D-L) is the incumbent. QUEENS BOROUGH PRESIDENT   There is no primary. Claire Shulman (D) is the incumbent.   19th COUNCIL DISTRICT    ANTHONY P. AVELLA JR. (D-L) Columnist, \\"The Courier\\"; president, Joint Community Council of College Point; former Queens coordinator, Mayor's Community Assistance Unit; former member, Community Board 7.   EDWARD S. GITKIND (D) Special projects manager, New York City Department of Environmental Protection; former production manager; executive member, Bayside High School P.T.A..  No Republican primary. Michael J. Abel (R-C) is the incumbent. THE CAMPAIGN: Whoever wins this race faces a bigger challenge in November, opposing Mr. Abel in this district dominated by Republican voters. Democratic leaders are lined up for Mr. Avella. In the 1991 primary, Mr. Avella placed second among 10 candidates, the Council's most crowded contest that year. This time he faces only Mr. Gitkind, a business and government manager. 20th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Julia Harrison (D-L) is the incumbent. 21st COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Helen M. Marshall (D-L) is the incumbent. 22d COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Peter F. Vallone (D) is the incumbent. 23d COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Sheldon S. Leffler (D-L) is the incumbent. 24th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Morton Povman (D) is the incumbent. 25th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. John D. Sabini (D-L) is the incumbent. 26th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Walter L. McCaffrey (D-L) is the incumbent. 27th COUNCIL DISTRICT  GARTH MARCHANT (D) Former radio reporter, WLIB; former assistant to the Superintendent, Community School District 23.  ARCHIE SPIGNER (D-L) City Council member elected in 1973; chairman, Housing and Buildings Committee; member, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Spigner, who in 18 years in office has risen to deputy majority leader, trounced Mr. Marchant in 1991 with 70 percent of the vote. For this return match, Mr. Spigner had $111,975 in campaign funds on hand on Aug. 13, one of the largest campaign treasuries in the Council, while Mr. Marchant had $1,022.    28th COUNCIL DISTRICT  ALLAN W. JENNINGS JR. (D) Former investigator, New York City Department of Correction; former Democratic district leader, 31st Assembly District; former legislative adviser to New York State Assemblyman John Duane. THOMAS WHITE JR. (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; founder and chief executive officer, Jamaica Community Adolescent Program (J-CAP); member, Aging, Contracts, Economic Development and Environmental Protection Committees. THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman White swept nearly half the total vote when he won in 1991 against five primary opponents. Mr. Jennings, a district leader at odds with the county party, placed fourth with 9 percent of the vote. This time he is the only challenger.    Mr. White is a district leader, too, and is outspending his opponent. Mr. White, who runs a state-financed drug rehabilitation program, denied critics' charges that he pressured clients and workers to do political chores. He said there were 27 campaign workers, all voluntary, from 500 people in the program.  29th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Karen Koslowitz (D-L) is the incumbent. 30th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Thomas V. Ognibene (R-C) is the incumbent. 31st COUNCIL DISTRICT  EDWARD J. LEWIS (D) Business developer; marketing specialist; former director, Mayor's Office of African-American and Caribbean Affairs; member, N.A.A.C.P.; board member, Southeast Queens Park Association; vice chairman, Area Policy Board. JUANITA E. WATKINS (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; former Commissioner, New York City Civil Service Commission; former schoolteacher; former editor, McGraw-Hill Inc. THE CAMPAIGN: Councilwoman Watkins eked out an initial victory of a few dozen votes out of 9,000 cast in 1991. The margin was so thin that a judge ordered a runoff with the runner-up from her eight opponents. She won that second primary by more than 1,200 votes. This time her only challenger is Mr. Lewis. By Aug. 13, her campaign had raised $41,476 to his $3,530. 32d COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Walter Ward (D-C) is the incumbent. BROOKLYN BOROUGH PRESIDENT   There is no primary. Howard Golden (D) is the incumbent. 33d COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Kenneth K. Fisher (D-L) is the incumbent.     34th COUNCIL DISTRICT  F. LOUIS CARABALLO (D) Lawyer in private practice. Candidate for State Assembly in 54th District in 1992.   VICTOR L. ROBLES (D-L) City Council member, has served nine years; chairman, Youth Committee; supports creation of all-civilian complaint review board. THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Robles has served nine years on Council and six in State Assembly. In four-way primary in 1991, he swept half the vote and led nearest rival by 2,600. His sole opponent this time, Mr. Caraballo, is a lawyer and community activist who ran unsuccessfully for Assembly last year. 35th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Mary Pinkett (D-L) is the incumbent. 36th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Annette M. Robinson (D-L) is the incumbent. 37th COUNCIL DISTRICT     No primary. Martin Malave-Dilan (D-L) is the incumbent. 38th COUNCIL DISTRICT  JOAN GRIFFIN McCABE (D) City Council member elected in 1991; former policy analyst, Public Education Association; member, Public School 154 P.T.A.; opposed Brooklyn Navy Yard Incinerator. JOHN K. O'HARA (D) Lawyer in private practice; former cabdriver; member, Community Board 7 and Area Policy Board; chairman, Youth Services Committee of Community Board 7; candidate for City Council in 1991. MIGDALIA RIVERA (D-L) President, New York Paralegal School, a private school she co-founded; interior designer. THE CAMPAIGN: This strangely shaped district was designed to give Hispanic voters a majority and a Council member. But nine contenders crowded the 1991 ballot, including three Hispanics and a black who split the minority vote. The upshot was that Ms. McCabe, who is white, won with 22 percent.    This time the contest's ethnic makeup is reversed. Hispanic groups unified behind a single candidate, Ms. Rivera, who also has important union support. The second challenger, Mr. O'Hara, competes with Councilwoman McCabe's ethnic base. He drew 10 percent of the 1991 vote. Party organization leaders also oppose Ms. McCabe, who says she is too independent for their liking. Despite the odds, she is running hard, has her own organization and by Aug. 13 had raised $47,979, more than double the total for her two opponents. 39th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Stephen DiBrienza (D-L) is the incumbent. 40th COUNCIL DISTRICT  UNA CLARKE (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; former educational consultant, Human Resources Administration; supports creation of all-civilian complaint board; member of Committee on Youth, Health and General Welfare. ERNEST N. FOSTER (D) Businessman, has worked in catering and restaurants, real estate and building management; member, N.A.A.C.P.; supports creation of all-civilian complaint board; former member, Area Policy Board 14. THE CAMPAIGN: Ms. Clarke became the first Caribbean-born Council member when she narrowly won a three-way primary in 1991. This year she has one challenger, Mr. Foster, an American-born black. He has allied himself with Alton Maddox and Al Sharpton and contends that blacks in Flatbush are \\"under 100 percent white control.\\" Ms. Clarke claims broad support and by Aug. 13 had raised $52,195, compared with $3,300 for her opponent. 41st COUNCIL DISTRICT  ATCHUDTA BARKR (D) Union organizer; organizer, National Union of Health and Human Service Employees; former P.T.A. president, Boys and Girls High School. ENOCH H. WILLIAMS (D) City Council member for 15 years; former executive director, Housing Development Corporation; member of the Brooklyn chapter of New York City Council of Churches; member, N.A.A.C.P. and New York Urban League; chairman, Health Committee. THE CAMPAIGN: Mr. Williams, a longtime Council member and chairman of its Health Committee, won the 1991 primary by a ratio of 2-to-1. But his challenger this year, Ms. Barkr, is supported by several liberal and labor groups. Their Aug. 13 campaign financial filings showed him far ahead, with $30,250 to her $1,795.  42d COUNCIL DISTRICT    SANDY BENDER JR. (D) Administrative assistant to New York State Assemblyman William Frank Boyland; former civil servant, worked in Department of Social Services; former day care teacher; regional representative of Community Action Board for Area Policy Boards 5 and 16; former chairman, Area Policy Board 16.   DIANE GORDON (D)  PRISCILLA A. WOOTEN (D-L) City Council member since 1982; former assistant to the Board of Education; chairwoman, Education Committee; member, Finance and Land Use Committees; member, N.A.A.C.P.  THE CAMPAIGN: After a decade on the Council, Ms. Wooten faces two challengers. She is supported by the party organization, unions and the local United States Representative, Edolphus Towns. One opponent, Mr. Bender, has been outpacing her in fund-raising. By Aug. 13 he had raised $25,888, exceeding her $19,675. The other challenger is Diane Gordon, who is backed by a party district leader who has a longstanding rivalry with Ms. Wooten. 43d COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Sal F. Albanese (D-L) is the incumbent. 44th COUNCIL DISTRICT  SANDY ABBY ABOULAFIA (D) Businesswoman; personnel agent and data processing manager; member, Community Board 12; endorsed by Brooklyn Women's Political Caucus, Kings County Democratic Coalition and Progressive Democratic Club; candidate for City Council in 1991. NOACH DEAR (D) City Council member since 1983; chairman, Transportation Committee; former district manager, Community Board 12; endorsed by Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden. THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Dear, who nearly lost in 1991 to Robert J. Miller, is breathing easier this year. He has one opponent, Sandy Abby Aboulafia, who drew 7 percent of the vote as the third-place candidate the last time.    Mr. Dear is counting on his many endorsements, party organization support and an extraordinary campaign treasury of more than $90,000 as of Aug. 13, compared with $24,465 for Ms. Aboulafia. His July 13 financial report showed he had spent another $99,363, ranking him among the top Council campaign spenders, according to the New York Public Interest Research Group, which monitors the filings. 45th COUNCIL DISTRICT  LLOYD HENRY (D-L) Headmaster, St. Augustine's Day School; rector, St. Augustine's Church; member, Community Board 17, N.A.A.C.P., Kiwanis and the Boy Scouts of America.  COLIN A. MOORE (D) Lawyer in private practice; former Assistant District Attorney in the Bronx; former Law Clerk with State Attorney General's Office; member, 29th Street Block Association. JANICE L. ROBERTSON (D) Community organizer; founder and president, East 49th Street Block Association of Flatlands Inc.; member, 63d Precinct Community Council; member, Public School 203 P.T.A.; endorsed by Kings County Democratic Coalition; candidate for City Council in 1991. THE CAMPAIGN: This is shaping up as one of the city's most contentious Council battles. Carved out two years ago to encourage minority candidates, the largely working-class district is 75 percent black. Susan D. Alter, who is white, managed to keep the seat in 1991 by capturing the Jewish vote in the primary; she is abandoning her seat to run for Public Advocate and is endorsing Ms. Robertson, a black American-born community advocate.    Colin Moore, a 52-year-old Guyana-born lawyer who has developed a citywide reputation through his involvement in high-profile cases, came in second to Ms. Alter in 1991 and considers himself the logical heir to both the seat and the support of Democratic Party officials in Brooklyn. But the party has instead backed Lloyd Henry, a 45-year-old Belize-born Episcopal minister and newcomer to politics. An unusually wide array of elected officials are stumping for Mr. Henry, including the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, a United States Representative, Edolphus Towns, and Mayor David N. Dinkins.  46th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Herbert E. Berman (D-L) is the incumbent. 47th COUNCIL DISTRICT  HOWARD L. LASHER (D-L) New York State Assemblyman since 1972; lawyer; chairman, Assembly Committees on Child Care, Housing and Insurance; member, Fraternal Order of Masons. JOEL M. MICHAELS (D) Lawyer; former executive director, Jewish Community Council of Greater Brighton; member, Brighton Neighborhood Association and Nottingham Association; former social worker; a candidate for City Council (48th District) in 1991. SHELDON PLOTNICK (D) owner of bookkeeping and financial services company; member, Community School Board 21; current member, Community Board 13; former Democratic State Committeeman. THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Samuel Horwitz's retirement set off a brutal fight to succeed him. For 21 years Mr. Plotnick served on the community board and as school board president and local party leader. For 21 years, Mr. Lasher served as the local Assemblyman, gaining seniority to head committees.    Both sides are slinging charges: That Mr. Plotnick used the schools for patronage and nepotism, including a job for his mother and promotions for his wife; that Mr. Lasher took donations from insurance companies when he headed the Insurance Committee, and that he keeps a one-bedroom apartment to qualify for the Council district but his four-bedroom home is a few blocks over the border.    Although their Aug. 13 filings showed that Mr. Plotnick outspent Mr. Lasher by nearly double, $55,017 to $28,213, Mr. Plotnick said Mr. Lasher used his Assembly apparatus for mailings to voters. The third candidate, Mr. Michaels, said the others represent the abuses of entrenched politicians. Brooklyn's Democratic chairman, Clarence Norman, calling the contest \\"a slugfest all the way,\\" made no predictions or endorsements. 48th COUNCIL DISTRICT  ALEXANDER STABER (D) Retired businessman, appliance repair; co-chairman, Brooklyn-wide Interagency Council of the Aging; vice president, American Association of Retired Persons, Flatbush Chapter; member, Straphangers Campaign; opposed rebuilding the Southwest Brooklyn incinerator. ANTHONY DAVID WEINER (D) City Council member, elected in 1991; former aide to Representative Charles E. Schumer.  THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Weiner squeaked into office in the six-way 1991 primary by a margin of slightly more than 100 votes. He faces only one challenger this time, Mr. Staber, a longtime activist on health, the elderly, war veterans and housing who has run for office often but unsuccessfully. Their Aug. 13 financial reports showed Mr. Weiner had raised $26,675 and Mr. Staber $7,737. 50th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. John A. Fusco (R-C) is the incumbent. STATEN ISLAND BOROUGH PRESIDENT   There is no primary. Guy V. Molinari (R) is the incumbent.   49th COUNCIL DISTRICT   No primary. Jerome X.

Dr. Coulston was born December 4, 1914 in New York City to Samuel and Celia Goldstein. He attended Syracuse University where he received his Bachelor's Degree in 1936, his Master's Degree in 1939, and his Doctorate in 1942. During WWII, he was active in the Human Malaria Project, a research program to discover new drugs for malaria. He developed and taught the concept that the malaria parasite acted on the host through its chemical action, both pharmacologically and toxicologically, and the host in turn acted upon the parasite through humoral and immunological mechanisms. This was the beginning of his introduction into modern toxicology. Dr. Coulston had a long, awardwinning career, including Director of Experimental Pathology and Toxicology at the Steeling-Winthrop Research Institute. For the Albany Medical College he served as Director of the Institute of Experimental Pathology and Toxicology, Professor of Pathology, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Director of the Animal Research facilities, and assisted in the development of the first hepatitis vaccine. He founded and served as Chairman of Coulston International Corporation and Coulston Products, Inc. which developed and marketed Permanone, used during Operation Desert Storm by the U.S. military. He served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Coulston Foundation which performed research on HIV, various vaccines and hepatitis C. He also served as Chairman of the Board of Diagnostic and Technology Center, Inc. Dr. Coulston was a unique individual who believed strongly in education and was continuously teaching people to the very end of his life. He taught many of today's scientists in the fields of toxicology, parasitology and pharmacology. He was a man with many, many accomplishments, honors and awards, but foremost a dedicated scientist. Through his research work, Dr. Coulston has touched the lives of many human beings throughout the world. He dedicated his life to the health of mankind. He published countless scientific articles and was editor for several scientific journals. His many professional honors included Co-Founder and President of the Society of Toxicology","excerpt":"member of the World Health Organization; member of the International Atomic Agency Commission of the United Nations; President of the International Society of Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety; co-Chairman of the Human Health Aspects to Accidental Chemical Exposure of Dioxins; recipient of the Arnold J. Lehman Award; President of the International Society of Regulary Toxicology and Pharmacology; co-author and sponsor of banning cyanide gold processing; and recipient of Businessman of the Year in 2002, given by President George W. Bush. Survivors include his son, Craig Wynn Coulston of Tularosa; his daughter, Cynthia Ann Oxley and her husband Lloyd of Dallas; two grandchildren, Eileen Marie Coker and her husband Christopher of Garland, Texas, and Michael Lloyd Oxley of Dallas; and two very special friends, Robbie Kayhart and Mary Villegas of Alamogordo. Funeral services will be conducted Monday, December 22, 2003, in the HamiltonO'Dell Chapel with F. Randolph Burroughs officiating. Interment will follow in Monte Vista Cemetery.

Two girls at the school have died.   The school, run by the Faith Tabernacle Congregation, was shut down Friday by the city Health Department. On Monday, after health officials telephoned more than two-thirds of the families at the school, 90 suspected cases of measles were found, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported today.   The school in North Philadelphia has 204 students, representing 72 families.    A measles epidemic in Philadelphia has caused four deaths so far this winter, said Robert Sharrar, assistant city health commissioner for disease prevention. There were 266 confirmed cases of measles in the city in 1990 and 107 already this year.   Health officials fear that the disease, which is highly contagious, has spread to the families of the school's students.   \\"Right now, we have to get this thing controlled,\\" Robert Ross, the city's deputy health commissioner, said, adding that the city was ready to go to court to force families to get medical care for the sick children.   Mr. Sharrar said health officials would not allow the school to reopen until there was no evidence of measles for at least two weeks.  A Group's Beliefs     The Faith Tabernacle Congregation, founded here in 1897, bases its beliefs on a strict interpretation of the Bible. Among its tenets is the avoidance of all medical and surgical practices","excerpt":"members believe that healing will come from God.    Health officials say that both girls died of measles and that neither was immunized.    The most recent victim here, 9-year-old Monica Johnson, was pronounced dead on arrival Sunday at the Medical College of Pennsylvania. Police officers took her to the hospital after her parents called for help, saying she had difficulty breathing and had a rash.    The other victim, Karen Still, 9, was pronounced dead on arrival Thursday at Albert Einstein Medical Center. Her parents told the police she had been vomiting for four days.   Charles Reinert, presiding elder of the church, has declined to comment to reporters but has been cooperating with inquiries of health officials.
