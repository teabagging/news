The Metro picturization of the Negro fantasy, which settled down at Loew's Criterion yesterday for what should prove to be a long tenancy, is every inch as sparkling and completely satisfying as was the original stage production back in 1940. On the trip to Hollywood the script was juggled around somewhat and in deference to the Hays office the character of Georgia Brown was toned down, yet she is a bewitching temptress as interpreted by Lena Horne. But essentially the story line remains intact and \\"Cabin in the Sky\\" still is the delightful fable about a battle of wits between the soldiers of heaven and the devil's henchmen over the soul of Little Joe Jackson, the rascally but likable spouse of the righteous Petunia Jackson.Ethel Waters and Rex Ingram alone of the play's cast are in the film as Petunia and Lucifer Jr.Since Dooley Wilson apparently wasn't around to be Little Joe, Metro made a very happy choice In Eddie (Rochester) Anderson. But the main thing is that Miss Waters is on hand, for there are songs to be sung in \\"Cabin in the Sky,\\" and in that respect she is incomparable. \\"Taking a Chance on Love\\" is a song that has worn well in three years, but it is sung so refreshingly and with such plaintive feeling by Miss Waters that it sounds like a brand new number. She does equally well with the title song and two others written especially for the film, \\"Happiness Is Just a Thing Called Joe\\" and \\"Life's Full o' Consequences.\\" The magic spell Miss Waters's singing casts over an audience is so enthralling one is apt to unintentionally slight her acting ability. Her portrait of Petunia is magnificently limned, however.\\"Cabin in the Sky\\" is by turn an inspiring expression of a simple people's faith in the hereafter and a spicy slice of their zest for earthy pleasures. With his weakness for dice and the wiles of that shameless seductress, Georgia Brown, Little Joe has a 1-A classification on the devil's registry until the Lord, in answer to Petunia's \\"powerful\\" praying, grants him six months more on earth to mend his ways. Thus the public relations department of hades, directed most amusingly by Mr. Ingram, sets about planning the downfall of the bewildered Little Joe, who tries hard to be good, while the soldiers from heaven struggle valiantly to keep him on the straight and narrow path. When Metro finally decides to redeem Little Joe, it does so with a bang, dragging in a tornado that levels Jim Henry's wicked dance hall. Before the big blow strikes, the place is pretty nearly wrecked anyway in an old-fashioned chair-and-table throwing slugfest, so that production touch seems a little superfluous.Mantan Moreland, Willie Best, Fletcher Rivers and Leon James are delightfully wicked as Mr. Ingram's assistant \\"idea\\" men","excerpt":"Kenneth Spencer is excellent as the Rev.

It also ascertains, if further proof is necessary, that a low-budget in adult hands can outstrip the most spectacular commercial tonnage.Contrasted to the usual panting tabloid expos√©, Filmakers' case seems a markedly genteel criterion for evaluation. While the story, relayed in flashback to an adoption investigator, is framed in a sternly objective scolding, this particular dilemma happens to stem from one man's altruistic pity. Or so it would seem.For quibbling's sake, it's hard to fathom why a realistic road salesman, whose flourishing business has been partnered for eight years by a casually adoring wife, should annex secret martyrdom by legalizing his pregnant mistress.

Yet for all the enterprising repertory that Alun Jones has attempted since 1978, when he became the troupe's artistic director, he obviously needs to meet the demands made on virtually all regional ballet companies in America. That is, he has had to stage a full-length 19th-century classic.   It was, moreover, at the request of the Colden Center for the Arts at Queens College that the Louisville Ballet presented its 1988 version of \\"Swan Lake\\" on Saturday afternoon. Another mixed program might have been better suited to the dancers' abilities, but there is no doubt that this production was true to the essence of \\"Swan Lake\\" and incorporated many interesting new ideas.

It's a gorgeous drive when you're in the delightful gaps between the billboards, trailer courts and motel signs that have proliferated in recent years. Driving along the highway, particularly around sunrise and sunset, with the sky and surrounding waters changing color every minute and the sea birds diving for fish, I've always been seized, mile after mile, by a visual euphoria. The trouble is that a lot of other drivers react the same way, making the crowded, narrow road one of the deadliest in the United States. Experts believe it will take something heavier than a station wagon to cause the collapse of any of the 42 crumbling bridges in the Keys &#8212;something as heavy, say, as a hurricane&#8212;but chunks of concrete falling away can leave holes in the roadway where there's no room to dodge oncoming traffic.
