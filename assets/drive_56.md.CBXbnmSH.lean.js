The irrepressible Ms. San Juan, a Spanish nightclub performer, plays a transsexual named Agrado and is the film's biggest treat (Janet Maslin).    * ''AMERICAN BEAUTY,'' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse Mr. Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a teenage cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing, especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces for a devastating finale (Maslin).

Now Playing    * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael García Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes","excerpt":"in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952, Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon.

In her second novel, Steinke has resurrected a genuine Personality, a stylish eccentric who might have been a staple of the tabloid gossip columns, had they existed a century ago. Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven was a real-life German émigré turned baroness","excerpt":"in Steinke's fiction, her adventures begin in 1904 when she's an impoverished naïf working as a ''living statue'' at the Wintergarten Cabaret in Berlin. After many lovers, two marriages and a tempestuous union with the penniless Baron von Freytag-Loringhoven, Elsa finds herself alone in a jail cell in Greenwich Village. Undaunted, she goes on to become the Courtney Love of her time: hanging out with Marcel Duchamp, composing poems that are like ''small explosions'' for The Little Review, parading through the streets in outrageous costumes (a car's blinking tail light for a bustle, a dress covered with bits of newspaper) -- and trying not to succumb to the madness that destroyed her mother. All this is presented in the kind of detail that might easily seem precious but is redeemed by Steinke's talent for description. Unapologetic and unabashed, her Baroness Elsa is a woman who does what she has to do -- and doesn't always mind doing -- to survive.       THE PORTRAIT. By Iain Pears. (Riverhead, $19.95.) Those too embarrassed to admit they enjoyed ''The Da Vinci Code'' will welcome Pears's smart little psychological thriller about a twisted but gifted Scottish painter living in exile off the coast of Brittany. Narrated by the artist, Henry McAlpine, ''The Portrait'' unspools from his final confrontation with an influential art critic named William Nasmyth, long an uneasy acquaintance. As he does in his Jonathan Argyll detective novels, Pears (best known for his historical mystery ''An Instance of the Fingerpost'') draws on his experience as an art historian.

It closed the week at a bid of 1 3/8.\\n\\nRecalling those days, John J. Atencio, the company's vice president, secretary and treasurer, said, ''There was no way we should have been selling that high. It made no sense whatsoever.

Merrill Lynch brokers, all of the big boys in New York were calling, the phone was ringing off the hook. Everyone wants to jump on that bandwagon.  Volume just feeds on itself.''\\n\\nDenver Western was the object, and in this case a victim, of a rather simple follow-the-leader theory of investing in common stocks: aggregate trading volume - the total number of shares changing hands - is a likely indicator of what the biggest institutions or company insiders are buying.

''The joke is that it's a 12-step program -- take 12 steps, and you are a snowshoer.''     Some 4.7 million Americans clamped on snowshoes at least once in 2004, nearly 2 million more than in 1998, when the Outdoor Industry Association, which follows leisure trends, began tracking the sport. The snowshoe is a lightweight platform with crampons on the bottom and a binding system on top that attaches to a shoe or boot, ideally a waterproof hiking boot or a trail-running sneaker, Ms. Walter said. Generally the heavier the person and the more powdery the snow, the bigger the ideal snowshoe, but ''22 to 25 inches long by 8 or 9 inches wide is the golden mean for size,'' Ms. Walter said.

They could live in new luxury buildings in desirable locations for rents of about $400 or $500 a month because other tenants were willing to pay two or three times as much to live in the same building.   Now this so-called 80-20 housing is having a harder time getting into construction, although builders with sites are available. The main problem is that banks have drawn away from construction lending.

Its strategies for conserving water and electricity have met with some success, but problems caused by garbage and traffic congestion have proved much more troublesome. In the long run, Long Island's experience may serve as a guide for other areas of the country that are grappling with the same issues.   Managing the existing resources, rather than banking on an endless supply, is not unique to Long Island: power and water companies have conservation programs across the metropolitan region, and the state has imposed mandatory recycling throughout New York. But on Long Island, whose nearly 3 million residents have had to come to grips with the fact of their clearly limited physical resources, policy, attitudes and, more important, behavior are changing.

They tone down the hostile rhetoric, avoid abusive actions and intensify their search for areas of accord as the date approaches. As one of President Reagan's advisers observed some years ago, it is most fruitful to be ''always on the verge of a major undertaking'' with the Russians","excerpt":"in such a moment, the Kremlin is about as amenable as it ever gets.   When President Reagan met last November with the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, there was considerable hope on the American side that a schedule of future summit meetings could be used to keep the two countries on that verge for at least several years. After the 1985 encounter on neutral ground, Geneva, 1986 was to see a Gorbachev visit to the United States, and in 1987 Mr. Reagan would travel to the Soviet Union. Between those high-level talks, officials would try to hammer out agreements on a range of bilateral matters, from the exchange of dance troupes to the reduction of nuclear missiles.

In recent years I have sought to emphasize this chain of command by stating in my letter to new ambassadors that the line of authority for any action or decision on your part flows from the President to me and from me through the Assistant Secretary to you.   Therefore, you will receive instructions only from or through the department.

Officials maintain that the increases are justified by rises in land values and the increased need for recreation for a growing population. Developers, however, charge that higher fees are only another attempt by towns to discourage development, particularly of affordable housing.   According to state law, towns and villages are empowered to require that developers of subdivisions and multifamily housing donate to the town 10 percent of the land being developed, presumably to provide recreation for the additional people the new development brings to the town. Often, however, the parcel is too small or too remote from other park land to be useful to the town","excerpt":"in such cases, the town and the developer agree that a fee should be paid in lieu of land. The town can then use the fee money for capital improvements in recreation areas. It is that fee that has become controversial.

In the British writer Anita Brookner's four previous novels, a recognizable vision of society, of the interactions between men and women, has been elegantly mapped out. It's a vision of the world as a dangerous, predatory place, peopled by two sorts of individuals - sophisticates and innocents. And while Miss Brookner always sides with her naifs - in each case, a Pym-like spinster, diligent, correct and impeccably earnest -she also makes it clear that she regards them as losers in society's hypocritical games. It's the careless, tempestuous people who get ahead and who win the love of others - not her discreet little heroines, who seem doomed by their own good intentions.   In her finest work, in this reader's view, ''Look at Me,'' Miss Brookner has used her keen sense of irony to limn this deeply felt, if somewhat limited, theme with clarity and moral vigor","excerpt":"in such lesser performances as ''Providence'' and ''Hotel du Lac,'' a certain attenuation sets in; a tendency to identify too closely with her heroines leads Miss Brookner to slip, from time to time, into sentimentality and self-pity, and the solitary predicament of her characters also threatens to become predictable and routine.

Over the course of the next several years, the man who made ballet a modern art enshrined the woman who would become his fifth wife in a series of roles that bear her imprint to this day.

But has attendance kept pace with the hype, despite the new $20 fee? Six months in, the answer on all fronts seems to be yes","excerpt":"in that time, the museum has had more visitors than in all of 2000, the last year it was fully operational in the old building, and membership has more than doubled. ''We're way ahead of anything that we had imagined, even in our wildest dreams,'' said Glenn D. Lowry, the director.    From the restaurants -- serving nearly 2,000 people a day, up from about 500 -- to the gift shops, which have sold 20 times as many postcard box sets, the museum is booming. Mr. Lowry said that visitors spent twice as long in the building and that there were lines nearly daily, especially on Friday nights, when Target sponsors free admission. (The museum used to have a pay-what-you-wish policy on Fridays, with slightly more limited hours.)    The museum's neighbors on 53rd and 54th Streets seem to be benefiting too, albeit to a less dramatic extent. Local hot dog stands, knickknack booths, stores and restaurants report increases in business of 20 percent to 60 percent. ''We're getting very nice overflow from the Modern,'' said Susan Flamm, public relations director for the adjacent American Craft Museum. People waiting on line at MoMA sometimes pop into the Craft Museum's gift shop for a break, or quit the queue altogether in favor of the less crowded galleries next door. Norman Sweeney, who has sold jewelry and art at a table across the street since 1987, said, ''As soon as MoMA came back, it's like a metamorphosis took place.'' And on Tuesdays, when MoMA is closed, unsuspecting tourists' loss is everyone else's gain. (One vendor, Hassan Mehmoud, who runs the Pita Garden stand on 53rd Street, was less enthusiastic, complaining that his business had dropped off since the post-renovation heights last winter.)    Mr. Lowry does not expect his good fortune to last. ''We're very realistic that we're still in the surge mode, and that will last for a while, and then we'll settle into a pattern that will be more typical,'' he said, adding that the slowdown could happen within the next six months. In the meantime, those wishing to avoid the lines can ante up for one of the special V.I.P. passes that local hotels offer. Or they can take the advice Abraham Bolzman, a concierge at the nearby Hilton, gives people interested in visiting the museum: ''Be very patient.''   MELENA Z.

Full of variety in itself is a recording of songs by Ernest Chausson (RCA/Erato figital NUM 74059), beautifully sung by Jessye Norman. It contains songs with piano, orchestral and chamber ensemble accompaniment, thus providing a cross-section of the composer's solo vocal music, even a viable one-disk library of these songs.

So Sandy Koufax had a 17-2 career won-lost record against the Mets (Question Box, Jan. 14). How did they manage to beat him that many times?      A. They accomplished it in somewhat highly irregular fashion, with consistent pitching, solid relief and opportunistic hitting, at a time when Koufax's Dodgers were finishing atop the National League and the Mets were still scraping bottom. The victories came almost a year apart at Shea Stadium in games in which Koufax entered as a 21-game winner and was opposed by the left-handed Tug McGraw, who later became a premier relief pitcher.   When the Mets beat Koufax, 5-2, on Aug. 26, 1965, it ended quite a four-year hex by a pitcher who had a 13-0 record versus New York, with one no-hitter, five shutouts, an earned-run average of 1.15, and 130 strikeouts in 117 innings. The Mets spotted Los Angeles a 1-0 lead, then rallied behind key hits from Roy McMillan, Jim Hickman and Ed Kranepool and chased the Dodger starter after seven innings. The Mets sealed matters with eighth-inning home runs from Joe Christopher and Ron Swoboda off Johnny Podres, and Jack Fisher preserved McGraw's victory by getting the last five Dodger outs.   Koufax beat the Mets four more times before the rematch with McGraw on Aug. 30, 1966. This time, neither starter lasted long as McGraw was knocked out in the second inning and Koufax departed during a five-run Mets' third. Ron Hunt, Ken Boyer and Swoboda had the hits that did the most damage against Koufax, who allowed nine hits and six runs before making his earliest exit ever against the Mets. Bob Friend, a veteran right-hander, held the Dodgers in check over the last seven and a third innings to earn the 10-4 victory. Koufax never pitched against the Mets again, for he retired after the World Series. Doubled Up    Q.    With one out and the runners on first and second leaving on the pitch, the batter hits a blooper over the head of the third baseman that the shortstop manages to reach. In one leaping motion, without his feet touching the ground, the shortstop gloves the ball, then turns and swiftly fires it in the direction of second base in an effort to double up that runner before he gets back to the base. If the ball bounces to the second baseman, who clutches it in time for the out, does the double play count, or is everybody safe because the shortstop never had control of the ball before the ball hit the ground?      A. It's a double play, and a sensational one at that. A fielder in baseball does not have to have his feet on the ground to make a legal catch, nor does the fielder have to demonstrate clear-cut possession of the ball. The fact that the shortstop was able to throw the ball to second in this example demonstrates that he had caught it by baseball's definition. Or as the rule book puts it: a catch is legal if the fielder's \\"release of the ball is voluntary and intentional.\\" Giants Get Even   Q.    All three National Football League teams that beat the New York Giants this past season also were beaten by the Giants -- Philadelphia in the regular-season opener, San Francisco in the N.F.C. title game and Buffalo in the Super Bowl. Was that oddity true when the Giants won the Super Bowl four years earlier?      A. It was half true. On their way to defeating Denver in the 1987 Super Bowl, the Giants stumbled just twice in 17 games, both times early in the season. In the 1986 opener, they lost to the Dallas Cowboys, 31-28, in Texas on a 10-yard touchdown run by Herschel Walker in the last two minutes. Six weeks later in Seattle, the Seahawks were 17-12 winners from the Giants.   The Giants never lost again that season, capturing their last nine regular-season games, then all three in the post-season. Along the way, they avenged the loss to Dallas with a 17-14 victory at Giants Stadium in game nine. But it took another three years to right the wrong wrought by Seattle because the teams did not meet after 1986 until game 11 of the 1989 season. In that rematch at Giants Stadium, the Giants settled a score by a 15-3 score. Field Goals vs. Touchdowns    Q.    Are there more touchdowns scored than field goals made in the National Football League?      A. Not in every game, but for the entire 1990 season, the touchdowns outnumbered the field goals, though by less than 2 to 1. There were 1,035 scores made worth 6 points and 590 kicks made worth 3 points. That ratio held in each conference, too, with the National Conference apparently having a firmer toehold on accurate place-kicks than the American Conference. In the N.F.C. there were 520 touchdowns scored and 303 field goals booted","excerpt":"in the A.F.C. the numbers were 515 and 287. Going, Going Gray   Q.

For people who love poetry, landscape, exercise and good company, the conference is held in Grasmere in the Lake District, where so many of the poets and painters gathered during the early years of the 19th century.   It is held for people of all ages, from all over the world. The conference offers a combination of study and play, with lectures by international scholars, seminars, discussions and various entertainments including poetry, play-readings and an auction.

It belongs in the age when Thoreau stood in the swamp the better to commune with nature","excerpt":"in the age when every writer tried to turn out a portrait of the noble savage.The era has mostly gone, and it is no longer the thing to point out that civilization is amiss, that the uncultivated and rough peoples in the far away corners of the earth have found a happiness—merely through their primitiveness—that the educated cannot reach.A translation of such a theme is always hard, especially if any attempt is made to preserve the idea as well as the outward form. This, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has endeavored to do in its picturization of Frederick O'Brien's book. Whether it is dangerous to stress the white man's failings and the nobleness of the savage in an age which no longer cares much about such things remains to be seen.\\"White Shadows\\" can be called a fair picture without quite deserving an appellation of either good or bad. It is different from the ordinary movie, of course, in that it takes an unusual story, gives it an unusual setting and treats it with above-the-average photography. But there are many lapses.It has an acknowledged cast of but three persons—Monte Blue as Dr. Matthew Lloyd, Raquel Torres as Fayaway, Robert Anderson as Sebastian. All the rest of those taking part are natives of Tahiti, the South Sea island, where, under the direction of W. S. Van Dyke, the film was made.Mr. Blue and Miss Torres do their parts acceptably, although the former occasionally has a tendency to be a bit vague. Their scenes together run off smoothly, with the possible exception of prolonged close-ups in which Miss Torres is shown learning to whistle. The silly situation which results is made even more so by the fact that this is a \\"sound\\" film.At various points in the play there are unusual scenes. One is of a group of islanders diving for pearls; another is a picture of a heavy storm at sea. Throughout there are good camera touches whenever the occasion demands—or can use—something a little out of the way.The unfortunate sections of the picture deal primarily with the lives of the island residents. They dance and sing a little too much, and apparently take things very seriously. Pastoral effects are indicated at times when pastoral seems to be the last thing imaginable. There are also, perhaps, too many scenes given over to the feasting and dancing activities of the island residents—forgetting the plot momentarily for a travelogue variation.\\"White Shadows\\" is Metro-Goldwyn's first \\"sound\\" film and it deserves nothing on that score save the word \\"average.\\" The theme song is pretty, but when shouts and wailings are introduced the effects become bathetic. Mr. Blue, trying to attract attention, once calls \\"Hello,\\" but, not being much above a whisper, the result is a bit ridiculous. A group of male voices heard every now and then is also unfortunate.The story is about Dr. Matthew Lloyd, once a man of culture, but when the story opens a beachcomber on an island in the Pacific. He intercedes for the natives, and Sebastian, a pearl trader, has him shanghaied on a pest ship. He drifts around for some weeks and then is finally blown onto a virgin island. He is the only white man and the islanders think he is a god.For a time Lloyd is happy. He leads a carefree life and falls in love with the daughter of a chieftain. Everything is going well when he discovers pearls. Then the white man's greed seizes him, so he builds a fire to signal a ship. Fayaway, the girl stops him, but it is too late. Sebastian has seen and comes ashore. Lloyd is killed, and the final scenes show the \\"white shadows\\" crossing the island where all had been happiness before.

Fashion","excerpt":"IN THE BLACK, AND WHITE, OF THE NIGHT"},{"year":"2005","title":"From ''To Kill A Mockingbird'' to ''Law & Order,'' Hollywood has conditioned real-life jurors to expect a lot from courtroom proceedings: high drama and lawyers willing and able to deliver it. Neal Howard brings the process full circle. He uses his experience as a Hollywood screenwriter to help prosecutors weave compelling stories for their 12-person audiences. ''The jury really is just an audience, and every trial is drama,'' said Mr. Howard, 46, who has written for shows like ''The King of Queens'' and ''The Love Boat: The Next Wave'' and for the last three years has been a litigation consultant for the law firm Zagnoli McEvoy Foley in Chicago. ''You have your protagonists, your heroes, your victims. The trick is to help ensure that the things that are going to move the story emotionally don't get lost in the legal shuffle.''    Coincidentally, several of the cases he has worked on were so dramatic that they inspired films. Most recently, he consulted for the prosecution on the trial of Edgar Ray Killen, the 80-year-old Klansman who was convicted of manslaughter in the deaths of three civil rights workers, dramatized in the 1988 movie ''Mississippi Burning.'' His first courtroom experience came working alongside the veteran jury consultant Andrew M. Sheldon in the 2001 trial of Thomas E. Blanton Jr., who was eventually convicted of the 1963 Birmingham church bombing that was the subject of Spike Lee's documentary ''4 Little Girls.'' Mr. Sheldon, 63, who said he quickly saw that Mr. Howard's skills would be ''incredibly useful,'' estimated that of the 800 or so professional jury consultants in the United States, fewer than 20 had a background in film or theater. ''Lawyers are generally not instructed in storytelling,'' he said. ''If you create a story structure for jurors to hang their facts on, they are much more likely to remember things clearly and the way you want them to.''    Mr. Howard said he was always looking for ways to turn a piece of evidence into a dramatic device","excerpt":"in the Blanton case, when an F.B.I. report said that the church bomb was most likely equal to 20 sticks of dynamite, he interpreted it this way for the prosecutors: ''That's five sticks per girl. That's how many sticks of dynamite it takes to kill hope, that's what it takes to kill a dream.'' But he has not abandoned his first career. He and his writing partner are developing a ''realistic comedy'' pilot called ''From This Day Forward,'' in which a marriage is seen simultaneously at three different points in its lifespan. So which gig pays better? ''In terms of remuneration, Hollywood's got most jobs beat,'' Mr. Howard said. ''If you can stay employed, television writing definitely pays better. As a steady gig, jury consulting's pretty good.'' But he added: ''Don't confuse that for rewarding. I doubt even an Academy Award for something as good as 'To Kill a Mockingbird' could be as rewarding or gratifying as working on some of these cases.''

Throughout the history of this sort of emergency, waterborne disease has been the major killer, more deadly than bullets are to civilians caught in armed conflicts. The vast majority of victims are children under 5. The World Health Organization warned that disease could kill more people than the tsunami itself.     There were good reasons to fear that standing water could be as deadly as moving water. Normal water supplies had been destroyed","excerpt":"in the capital of Indonesia's Aceh region, 70 percent of the water supply system vanished.

The organization said it would contest the decision in court. The German authorities seem determined to maintain pressure on Scientologists here and limit their activities. In the past Government surveillance has been largely focused on extremist political groups.   1    Croatian Candidate Attacked  The chief rival to President Franjo Tudman in Croatia's presidential elections was punched and whipped with a belt by a man in an army uniform. Vlado Gotovac suffered head injuries and was hospitalized after the attack, which took place during a political rally in Pula. Mr. Gotovac often said his campaign for the June 15 election was futile in the face of opposition by the machinery of state.   6    Blair Lectures Socialists   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain brashly counseled European Socialist leaders at a meeting in Sweden to discard ''old style'' ideas, predicated on more government spending and regulations, ''or die.'' But Lionel Jospin, the Socialist who recently became Prime Minister of France, praised public services and warned against reliance on market forces. Mr. Blair, who British polls show has a record approval rating of 82 percent, went on to tell Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany that the European Union was out of touch with its own people.   6    Congress Moves Up China Vote  Republican leaders in Congress rescheduled the annual vote on whether to renew China's trading status, moving it to late June, a month earlier than planned, so that it takes place before the transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese rule on July 1. President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said that a close vote, even if it preserved China's trading status, could weaken the Administration's China policy.   7    U.S. Pressures Congo  President Clinton's special envoy to the Congo, Bill Richardson, arrived in Kinshasa and told President Laurent Kabila that American aid for the country was dependent on the new Government's progress on human rights issues, particularly the treatment of tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees wandering in the eastern part of the country. Mr. Kabila has denied reports that Tutsis among his troops have killed thousands of refugees.   4    No Surprises in Algerian Vote  Algeria's parliamentary elections were dominated by the National Democratic Rally, a party created two months ago to represent the interests of President Liamine Zeroual, a retired general, and the military. Opposition parties claimed widespread fraud. Fewer than two-thirds of eligible voters went to the polls","excerpt":"in the capital, Algiers, under half did so, apparently responding to calls for a boycott from the banned Islamic Salvation Front.   3    NATIONAL   8-10, 25    Defense Lawyers Plead For Sparing McVeigh's Life   A lawyer for Timothy J. McVeigh pleaded with jurors who had convicted him of bombing the Oklahoma City Federal building to avoid being influenced by the emotional impact of the case and to spare him from execution. In the first day of the defense case in the penalty phase of Mr. McVeigh's trial, the lawyer told jurors that the Federal raid on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., made Mr. McVeigh think that the Government ''had declared war on the American people.''   1    First Father Gives Address   President Clinton spoke at the graduation of his daughter, Chelsea, from Sidwell Friends School in Washington. He mixed political and familial sentiments.   1    Teamster Ally Is Charged  A fund-raiser for Ronald Carey, the teamsters' president, was charged with mail fraud, in what Federal prosecutors said was a scheme to embezzle union money for Mr. Carey's re-election campaign in 1996. The charges are expected to step up pressure on the Federal election monitor to order a new election.   1    Appeal to Court on Notes  The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to order lower court judge to balance the interests of attorney-client privilege and the needs of the Whitewater counsel in deciding whether notes of Hillary Rodham Clinton's conversations with White House lawyers needed to be turned over to investigators. The Justice Department's petition increases the chances that the Court will agree to hear the case and delay the investigation by as much as a year.   10    General's Chances Lessen  Senators spoke more critically of Gen. Joseph W. Ralston of the Air Force, whose candidacy to become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is threatened because of an adulterous affair he had in the mid-1980's.   9    Immigration Law Criticized  A bipartisan Federal advisory panel sharply criticized a new immigration law, saying it did not provide adequate protection for genuine refugees seeking asylum in the United States.   9    NEW YORK/REGION   21-24    Former Student Sought In Murder of Teacher  Police searched three boroughs for a former student of a murdered Bronx high school teacher, calling him a prime suspect in the slaying. Investigators said they had lifted a fingerprint of the suspect, Corey Arthur, 19, from duct tape that was used to bind the teacher, Jonathan M. Levin, before he was tortured and shot in the head in his Upper West Side apartment last Friday. Mr. Arthur also left a partial message on Mr. Levin's answering machine shortly before a surveillance camera recorded someone using the teacher's bank card to withdraw $800 from an automated teller machine near his apartment, investigators said. Many students at the school where Mr. Levin had taught said they could not believe a former student could be involved in his murder.   1    Hospital Contract Is Ended  The city ended Montefiore Medical Center's contract to run Jacobi Medical Center, saying Montefiore's cuts in staff and failure to expand some outpatient services had jeopardized care. Officials said Montefiore flouted the contract almost from the day it was signed. The president of Montefiore denied that his medical center had violated its contract ''in any material way.'' This was the first year that the city tied payments under such contracts to performance.   21    Sale Is Near for Helmsley  Leona Helmsley is close to selling her family's real estate company, Helmsley-Spear, to the partners of her late husband, ending a long-standing feud with the two men.   21    Shabazz Hearing Delayed   The need for more psychiatric evaluations again delayed a hearing in Family Court at which lawyers from the Westchester County Attorney's Office would lay out allegations against the grandson of Malcolm X, who is accused of setting fire to his grandmother, Betty Shabazz. A lawyer for the boy, Malcolm Shabazz, asked for an independent psychiatric examination.   23    Officer Who Was Shot Dies  A police officer died after being in a coma since he was shot last month while driving his car in the Bronx. Investigators said the officer, Brian Fasack, who was off duty at the time, had been the victim of a robbery. But many of the circumstances of his death remain murky.   22    BUSINESS DAY   31    Joblessness at 4.8 Percent  The nation's unemployment rate fell to its lowest point in 24 years last month, 4.8 percent. Hourly earnings continued to rise.   1    The Dow Jones industrial average reacted buoyantly to that and other economic news, soaring 130.49 points to 7,435.78, 13 points shy of a 1,000 point gain this year.   31    Business Digest   31    SPORTS   26-30    ARTS   13-17, 20    Missing Paintings Found  The F.B.I. has recovered two paintings, Claude Monet's ''Customs Officer's Cabin at Pourville'' and Pablo Picasso's ''Nude Before a Mirror,'' that a Los Angeles doctor reported stolen in 1992.

At worst, Israel is accused of insincerity and intent to undermine the peace process.   It is difficult for Westerners to understand that despite 43 years of Israel's solid presence and growing power, the Arab world still deems it a passing, aberrational and illegitimate phenomenon. That is why, while professing a desire for peace, the Arab regimes are unable to do what any nation would do if it genuinely wanted peace: sit down with its adversary, hammer out differences and reach an agreement.

He's a pesty, obsessive autograph hound who lives for show business and show business alone, and ''The King of Comedy'' is his story. But why?

Nearly all of his films have revolved around largely unsympathetic male characters of violent, unstable temperament, and that is particularly true of the films on which he has collaborated with Robert De Niro. The jittery hoodlum of ''Mean Streets,'' the mercurial big band musician of ''New York, New York,'' Jake LaMotta (''Raging Bull'') and Travis Bickle (''Taxi Driver'') all share a fiery, unpredictable nature that is fascinating without necessarily being endearing.

As the right tackle, Keith Fahnhorst was blocking Ed (Too Tall) Jones of the Dallas Cowboys in the 1981 National Conference championship game. During the week, Too Tall Jones had been quoted as not having much respect for Joe Montana as a quarterback. But on this play, even at 6 feet 8 inches, Too Tall had not been tall enough to prevent the 49er quarterback from firing a pass by him for a first down.   ''After that pass,'' Keith Fahnhorst recalls with a smile, ''Joe looked up at Too Tall and told him, 'Respect that.' ''   Respect. Of all the players on a football team, a quarterback must be respected more than any other - by both his teammates and his opponents. Without that respect, a quarterback can't possibly take command of his offensive unit, or intimidate the opposing defensive unit.

Her head is thrown back, her long hair tumbles over her shoulders, her hoop earrings glimmer.

During this period, they claim, the elemental passions were diluted by psychobabble, the charming old songs were replaced by rock music, and certain graceful and unquestioned habits, like cooking well or dressing attractively, became infected by a painful self-consciousness. Yet one region, the Marches, is widely believed by Italians to be far less \\"contaminated\\" than other, equally prosperous areas. Situated between Umbria and the Adriatic Sea, the Marches has a long coast, filled with fashionable beaches, resorts and hotels. But if the coast is sophisticated, the ancient virtues of familial piety and spontaneous generosity may still be encountered in the sparsely populated hill towns a few miles inland, where the earth's crust rumples into hills like shirred green velvet. \\n\\nThe curious name \\"Marches\\" is related to the German word \\n\\nmark\\n\\n, meaning frontier domain","excerpt":"in the Middle Ages such territories were ruled by marquesses, margravines and other picturesquely titled feudal worthies. For long periods the Italian Marches lay along the outer rim of the Papal States, but in the 1860's, when Italy was conclusively reunified, they were grouped into a single region. Cut off by the Apennines, the Marches is readily accessible by car from only one major Italian city, Bologna, and so is not as popular with tourists as the other regions of central Italy. It is Tuscany, however, that the Marches most resembles, with its hazy sunlight, gray-green tonality -- perhaps less gray than around Florence, since the olive is not widely cultivated here -- and fortified hill towns bristling with churches and palazzi. The region is a sort of eastern companion piece or pendant to Tuscany, as visiting Tuscans readily observe; and if it is not so splendid or various, it still offers a parallel sense of civilized refinement, of cultural achievement at the highest level. Bramante was born in the Marches, as were Raphael and Barocci; one of Italy's greatest poets, Giacomo Leopardi, was a Marchigian; so were Rossini and Beniamino Gigli. Of the many gifted outsiders lured into the region, one, Lorenzo Lotto, stands out: this Venetian master left a large number of pictures both in Recanati and in the pilgrimage town of Loreto.

The area is crowded with people, pushcarts and parked vehicles, and the buses must thread their way between rows of taxis before finding a place where they can unload passengers. The last bus, far older than the rest, looks as if only a miracle could have got its weather-beaten carcass up the hill to Bethlehem. Its pilgrims look weather-beaten, too, and as they mass on the street waiting for their guide, who is arguing with a guide from another tourist company, to usher them to the holy sites, they look uneasily across Manger Square. All of them are wearing the glazed, startled look of people who are at once awed, tired and disappointed. The Bethlehem they have found looks nothing like the town the son  of God might want to be born in. But that's the whole point. Everything here is  meant to test your faith.         The pilgrims, mostly women, will soon recover from the shock, but as they take in the unfamiliar place, with its light rain and glistening pavement teeming with boys who scurry about Manger Square brandishing open and mostly broken umbrellas for the tourists, they cannot believe that this may be the holiest moment in their lives. This, the most un-Christmaslike spot in Christendom, is what they will take with them and remember. Many will come to celebrate Christmas this year, as so many pilgrims do, but the festivities will  have a different tenor: barring some last-minute hitch, this is the first time in 28 years that Bethlehem will celebrate Christmas without an Israeli presence.

The difference in how David Stern handled two disturbing, image-fracturing events will explain why his one-year suspension of Sprewell was as much a slick public relations coup as it was an example of a commissioner acting in the so-called best interests of his sport.    If Feerick is true to his reputation as an arbitrator who is intolerant of self-interest, the longtime dean of Fordham University School of Law will uphold the Golden State Warriors' revocation of Sprewell's contract but allow him to play for another team by the start of next season. Lopping a little more than a month off the suspension will be no great victory for Sprewell -- and he doesn't deserve one -- but will send a firm message to Stern that justice should be consistent and not, in part, based on how it will affect Nielsen ratings and network contracts.

A governess has come to an isolated English estate to care for two children. She soon suspects that they have been sexually corrupted by her predecessor and a manservant, both of whom have died, both of whom seem to have returned as ghosts to haunt their once innocent charges. The composer and his librettist, Myfanwy Piper, undercut the ambiguity cultivated by James","excerpt":"in the opera these ghosts are as real as their corruptive effects. At the beginning of the second act they triumphantly sing a line from Yeats: \\"The ceremony of innocence is drowned.\\"   But from that moment on, as the opera proceeds through its compact, beautifully orchestrated scenes, ambiguities begin to accumulate and the work itself begins to seem a strange ceremony of innocence. We begin to doubt some perceptions of the Governess, whose melodic lines echo and anticipate the singing of the demonic servant, Quint. The score, which turns church bells ominous and nursery rhymes into signs of corruption, sometimes seems as if it is being strained through the Governess's psyche. Britten's ceremony marks not the dissolution of innocence in the children, but the growth of an uncertainty that innocence is even possible.

The panel's blunt critique came last week in a 79-page report based largely on confidential interviews with rape victims, their parents, faculty members and administrators.    The panel found, for example, that the university's processing of rape charges was too slow and a deterrent to reporting. \\"In a recent case involving an attempted rape, the disciplinary process took more than two months, during which time the victim and accused remained living in the same residence hall,\\" the report states.   The panel's six members, who have no formal connection with the university, said they hoped the report would become a model for the prevention and handling of sexual assault on campuses around the nation.   \\"I feel this is the blueprint that other schools will follow,\\" said Gail Abarbanel, chairwoman of the panel and director of the Rape Treatment Center at Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center. \\"If they implement all of it, they'll have the strongest program in the country.\\"    James M. Dennis, the university's vice president for student affairs, said the administration was committed to adopting most of the suggestions by the end of the year.   In two recent lawsuits, rape victims -- a student and a university employee -- said the university shared responsibility for their assaults off campus because, they said, it had not taken adequate action to prevent dangerous conditions or warn of them.   The administration countered that circumstances outside the campus were beyond its control.    The university's insurer settled the student's case for $1.5 million","excerpt":"in the other, the university is appealing a $1.8 million judgment awarded the university employee.  Guide for Other Colleges    Other schools, worried that they may be liable in rape cases, will probably study how the University of Southern California has handled such cases, said Sheldon E. Steinbach, general counsel for the American Council on Education, an association of 1,700 schools and colleges. \\"They may try to use it as exculpatory evidence that they've done everything they should have done,\\" he said.   \\"What you have there are runaway juries looking for deep pockets,\\" Mr. Steinbach said, adding that similar judgments against institutions of all kinds are increasingly common. \\"With an urban campus, it is impossible to protect students and employees without turning it into a police state.\\"   The committee report suggests improvements in security, but notes that date rape and other rapes by acquaintances are more common than the attacks that resulted in the suits. The best preventive measures the university can take, the report suggests, is to encourage victims to report rapes and to take quick and decisive action against the rapists.   The report emphasizes the need for a well-defined, well-publicized rape policy, and an equally clear and well-known protocol for handling rape cases. \\"It lets victims know what their rights and options are, and makes them more likely to come forward,\\" said Ms. Abarbanel.   The report by the panel cites cases in which the absence of a stated policy or procedure resulted in confusion, delays and ill treatment of victims. In one case, a university official told the victim of a nighttime rape that she would have to wait until the next day to receive counseling when, in fact, counselors were on call after hours.   Mr. Dennis offered only mild objection to the wide range of criticism in the report. \\"Where they are harsh, it may not feel very good,\\" he said. \\"But we asked them to be harsh, and we're very pleased with the result.

The civic leaders who thought New York should have a great library - who were moved in part by the example of Boston, whose great McKim, Mead & White-designed library had opened on Copley Square in 1893 - hardly thought of themselves as radicals, of course. Their goal was not so much bringing books to the masses as it was confirming their city's might. The library, like an art museum, was part of a larger vision of civic grandeur and civic order.   That vision - which yielded in New York as fine a work of architecture as it had in Boston - does not fit terribly gracefully into the city of today. The concept of monumental civic architecture is rare enough for private purposes right now","excerpt":"in the public realm it has become virtually nonexistent.

Kierkegaard, Donald W. Goodwin writes in his new book, ''discovered anxiety in 1844.'' Surely, there were individuals before that who suffered from the unfortunate afflictions of anxiety - what Rollo May called ''a nameless and formless uneasiness,'' a vague, persistent feeling of ''uncertainty and helplessness.'' In 1621, Robert Burton expounded upon similar varieties of psychic distress in ''The Anatomy of Melancholy''","excerpt":"in the same century, Pascal wrote of the despair that accompanies man's realization that his life is ''swallowed up in the eternity before and behind it.''

And now that it is calmly and comfortably settled at the Park Avenue Theatre, where it opened yesterday, it is safe to proclaim that it is merely a superb piece of motion picture art and, beyond doubt, one of the finest screen translations of a literary classic ever made.That is not put forth lightly nor without consideration of the fact that the original creation of the producers has been judiciously trimmed. To meet the objections of those critics who felt that Fagin was portrayed a bit too obviously for complacence along the pictorial lines of a notorious anti-Semitic stereotype, some considerable footage in which the character appeared in the original has been dropped and particularly a section demonstrating his instruction of young thieves has been telescoped.But, as one who has seen the picture in both its original and its present lengths, this reviewer can confidently assure you that its quality has not been impaired—nor, indeed, has the character of Fagin been appreciably Bowdlerized. Except in so far as the appearance of Fagin in point of time has been reduced, his motivating influence and his impact upon the story have been preserved.And that is both just to the purpose of the producers and considerate of those who might take reasonable exception to an excessive portrayal of a stereotyped Jew. For, of course, the character of Fagin and the fact that he is a Jew (though that is never mentioned in the picture) are mere part and parcel of the whole canvas of social injustice and degradation which is so brilliantly filled out in Charles Dickens' great work. And it is this extraordinary canvas, this vast picture of the poverty and greed which oppressed nineteenth-century England, that has been magnificently reproduced in this film.Indeed, the simile of a canvas is an appropriate one to apply to this fine drama which David Lean has directed and Ronald Neame has produced. (They are the gentlemen, incidentally, who did Dickens' \\"Great Expectations\\" before this.) For the visual design of the picture and its striking photography have the rare characteristics of fine painting in their brilliant creation of mood. And within the narrow range of lights and shadows there have been captured an infinity of tones. Pictorial design and execution are as important as the characters here.In the opening scene, for instance, against a montage of gathering storm clouds, bare branches and rain-swept waters, Mr. Neame establishes the somber mood in which the poor boy who is later known as Oliver comes into the world. And in all of the subsequent episodes—in the dismal workhouse scenes, in the scenes of Oliver's apprenticeship to Sowerberry, the undertaker","excerpt":"in the scenes of London, to which the youngster flees, and in the whole visual elaboration of the underworld in which he is caught—there is an extraordinary richness of flavor, suggestion and atmosphere.Along with this graphic achievement, Mr. Neame and Mr. Lean have contrived to present the story and characters of Dickens with incredible fidelity. In a youngster named John Howard Davies, who has already been seen hereabouts in a film called \\"The Rocking-Horse Winner\\" (which he made subsequent to this), they have a frail, sensitive, spirited little fellow who is Oliver Twist to a T. All of the poignancy, courage and humor of the famous orphan are projected by him.Robert Newton's Bill Sikes is a hoodlum of contemptible cunning and fear, Kay Walsh is pathetic as Nancy and Ralph Truman makes a dark and vicious Monks. Francis L. Sullivan is tremendous as Mr. Bumble, the workhouse warden who is full of stupidity and greed, and Henry Stephenson is warm and gentle as Mr. Brownlow, the old gentleman who gives Oliver a happy home.As for Alec Guinness' performance as Fagin, it is a vastly clever one—harsh, ugly, sly and unwholesome, yet curiously appealing withal. In the strange sort of loyalty and kindness that are shown by the ghetto Jew toward the poor boys he obviously exploits, an affinity of social outcasts is implied. And when Fagin screams at the rabble which finally closes in on him, \\"What right have you to butcher me?\\", the moral of the story is expressed.

Certainly the pretty production and top performance that these two stories receive would scarcely seem worth the investment if the stories weren't important to the Swedes. But, for the American public, accustomed to stronger modern themes, these two costumed tales of marital problems will seem musty and slowly paced antiques.First item in the package is a solemn and heavy account of a frigid young woman's tormenting of her husband, an older man, Haughtily, she avoids him, until she wants some feminist favor of him, then she yields to his entreaties.

As it is, it somewhat reminds one of an old two-reel silent comedy, which it could be if it moved a little faster and they removed the Swedish dialogue, leaving the English subtitles, reduced about 50 per cent.It tells of a handsome naval officer and his deliciously pert and pretty wife who have a wonderful time love-making when he is home on leaves.

In a string of hits since 1985, and in her concerts, Ms. Houston's power and agility have always been exhilarating, although they didn't always connect with the shape of the songs. But at Radio City Music Hall on Friday night, opening a seven-night engagement through Sept. 27, she harnessed her vocals to her material for a concert that was not just flamboyant but often moving.   Ms. Houston sang two sets of love songs. In the first, she was backed by her band and flanked by four athletic dancers","excerpt":"in the second, she was a diva backed by a small orchestra. The two sets represented both sides of a successful career strategy that has kept her frisky enough for young pop fans yet respectable enough for their parents.   The first half was a tour de force. Ms. Houston had routines to run through: dance steps, a disco segment, and a denunciation of tabloid rumours about marital trouble (which followed two ardent kisses from her husband, the singer Bobby Brown). But she could easily wing it; when her daughter toddled on stage, she sang \\"Old MacDonald\\" to her, with the sultriest \\"e-i-e-i-o\\" imaginable. Ms. Houston tore into her hits with a playful virtuosity.   In uptempo songs, her three female backup singers took care of the straightforward choruses while Ms. Houston volleyed responses. She tossed around syncopations, percussive or soaring, using every repeated lyric as a springboard for a new improvisation. In a medley of ballads, she caressed and savored every line. She sounded tenderly tremulous as she asked, \\"Where do broken hearts go?,\\" affectionate and satisfied as she declared, \\"Nobody loves me like you do.\\" \\"Love,\\" a word that reappears countless times in her songs, could be an airy note, a voluptuous glide, a joyful cascade. Where she once lavished ornaments at random, she now puts across sentiment as well as showiness.   For the second half, Ms. Houston belted ballads, predictably bringing down the house with songs that moved from aching verses to surging choruses. A medley of hits from Dionne Warwicke, Ms. Houston's cousin, lacked Ms. Warwicke's lightness, but Ms. Houston made \\"Alfie\\" sound like the ethical wrangle it is. Ms. Houston dedicated \\"I Will Always Love You\\" to her father, who she said had gone to the hospital that afternoon. Her tearful voice -- it even broke on one note -- gave the song more immediacy than the stentorian recorded version.   The concert's catalyst was gospel, the music Ms. Houston grew up on. Between ballads she broke into a gospel song, moving across the stage like a singer getting the spirit. Her call-and-response arrangements, and some of her best improvised moments, also came directly from sanctified singing. \\"Sometimes the church comes out and I can't help myself,\\" Ms. Houston said at one point. Gospel links musical display to getting a message across, so Ms. Houston shouldn't hold back: the more she lets loose her gospel heritage, the better she sounds.

It may even seem encouraging to some who associate the hordes of suspender-clad young M.B.A.'s with the financial excesses of the 1980's that left the economy fragile and businesses unable to pay their bills.   But on Wall Street, there are few things as horrifying, and not just because of the suspicion it will be difficult to train such people for productive work. The old joke, about a recession meaning your neighbor is out of work and a depression arriving when you lose your job, may help to explain the dismal economic forecasts now pouring from brokerage houses.   If so, then perhaps there is reason to hope that all is not as bad as it seems, that, as Prudential Bache's Ed Yardeni puts it, \\"to a large extent, this is a yuppie recession\\" that won't have a cataclysmic effect everywhere else in America, even if the New York economy is in for a rough spell.   One measure of Wall Street's mood is in the earnings estimates issued by brokerage house analysts. Since Iraq invaded Kuwait and recession woes started to escalate, analysts have been vying with each other to see how fast they can slash forecasts. In October, reports Rick Pucci of Institutional Brokerage Estimate System, an index of earnings estimates for companies in the S.&P. 500 showed that for every estimate raised, almost four were lowered. The ratio, of 0.26, was down sharply from September's 0.39.   Mr. Pucci sees hope in those figures, simply because the analysts, as a group, have a record of being wrong whenever they are so unanimous. In the decade that the statistic has been kept, the only other times the index got so low were in July 1982 and January 1985. In the first case, the bull market of the 1980's was about to begin","excerpt":"in the second, the first significant correction of that bull market had just ended. On the other hand, it was up to 1.49 in August 1987, just before the crash.   That is not the only reason to hope that, in the stock market at least, the worst is over. Renewed hopes for Fed easing played a role in Friday's rally, which almost offset earlier weakness and left the Dow Jones industrial average down just 2.23 points for the week, to 2,488.61.   \\"If the Fed really is coming around now to recognizing that the economy is falling into a recession, we'll have a big drop in interest rates that I think will revive consumer spending by the first quarter,\\" said Mr. Yardeni. \\"The recession is almost over.\\" He thinks stocks and bonds can advance even if the real estate market remains depressed for several years.   Long-term interest rates have been declining, but not as much as might have been expected, given the dramatic rally since the end of September in the Dow Jones utility average, which has a reputation as a leading indicator of bond prices. But last week that index slipped 2.6 percent, giving back a third of the advance.   If the utilities do not start moving up again, the hopes for the entire market may be premature.

This revue was staged by Le Roy Prinz and the various numbers were received with no little enthusiasm by those in the packed theatre on Saturday night.The feature film is far from edifying, but it has a few effective moments. Clara Kimball Young impersonates Daisy Bowman, the keeper of a boarding house where anything is liable to happen. As a touch of pathos and hoped-for drama in this sordid tale, Daisy has a blind son, who is able to find his way about the house, even to putting his hands on a pistol and shooting Jake, a member of the gigolo fraternity.Jake is impressed by the good looks of a girl named Betty, whose sweetheart, Eddie, is sentenced to a prison term for having undertaken a bootlegging mission for an individual known as Pete. Betty imagines that Eddie is away on a business trip and she is deeply chagrined that he does not write.One sequence is quite imaginative, for it depicts Betty's worried thoughts, with the shades of various persons repeating what they have said to her about Eddie. The multiple exposures in the camera work, coupled with the recording of the lines, is similar to that which the British director, Alfred Hitchcock, did in his film, \\"Blackmail,\\" some time ago.Miss Young does good work as Daisy Bowman in most of her scenes.

Rubinstein, Ph.D., a scientist who was an authority on the effects of TV violence on children, was born in New York City on April 27, 1919. He died at Carolina Meadows in Chapel Hill, NC on May 15, 2006, at age 87. His last formal position was as Adjunct Research Professor of Mass Communications, School of Journalism, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC from 1971 to 1978, he was Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology at the Health Sciences Center, State University of New York at Stony Brook, New York. He received his Ph.D. in psychology at the Catholic University of America in 1950. He served for twenty years in various senior research and administrative positions in federal agencies in Washington, D.C.","excerpt":"in the Veterans Administration, from 1950 to 1958, and then at the National Institute of Mental Health, from 1958 through 1971. At the time he left federal service, he was the Assistant Director for Extramural Programs and Behavioral Sciences at NIMH and the highest ranked psychologist at that Institute. One of the last major responsibilities he had in that federal position was the coordination of a three-year national program of research on television and social behavior. The results of that research program were summarized, in 1972, in a comprehensive report by the Surgeon General's Scientific Advisory Committee on Television and Social Behavior, assessing the effects of televised violence on the behavior of children. Dr. Rubinstein served as Vice-Chairman and project leader for that Committee, representing the Surgeon General. Five volumes of technical reports, published under Dr. Rubinstein's guidance, served as scientific documentation for the Committee report. Subsequently, Dr. Rubinstein was a senior advisor and contributor to the tenyear update of the Surgeon General's report, published in 1982. Over his entire scientific career, Dr. Rubinstein published more than 100 articles and books on such diverse topics as: research in psychotherapy, the status of mental health manpower, the qualities of science administration, and developments in the behavioral sciences, in addition to his editing of the original five volumes of technical reports on television and social behavior. His major publications since 1975 were on policy issues relating to findings on the effects of television on the viewer. He was the co-editor of a book, published in 1985, on ''The Media, Social Science and Social Policy for Children.'' He was coeditor of ''Big World, Small Screen,'' a book published in 1992, which examined the research and scientific conclusions on the effects of television viewing on various segments of the viewing public. He testified before various congressional committees on the effects of televised violence and on policy issues related to that public problem. On the less serious side of his career, Dr. Rubinstein prided himself on having been the master of ceremonies at many retirement parties at the NIMH. His doggerel and sharp comments at these events were always enjoyed by the audience. At his own retirement party from the NIMH in 1971, he was given a plaque naming him ''Poet Laureate Emeritus.'' His federal career was distinguished by the fact that he began in 1940 as the lowest grade clerk, working in the 1940 decennial census. Through a series of promotions and advances because of his graduate work, he ended his federal service, thirty years later, at the highest grade level, GS18, one of only a handful of federal civil service employees to have ever accomplished that feat. Dr. Rubinstein was a Fellow of the American Psychological Association. He had been a consultant to many private and federal agencies concerned with research in the behavioral sciences. He was also a consulting editor for various scientific journals. In 1967-1968, he was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, CA. Dr. Rubinstein is survived by three children; two sons, Dr. Lawrence V. Rubinstein of Rockville, MD, and Dr. Donald H. Rubinstein of Guam and one daughter, Betsy Rubinstein of Chevy Chase, MD and three grandchildren.

High on the Administration's 10-worst list is an item in the House version that would index capital gains after 2001 to offset the effects of inflation.    By encouraging taxpayers to make a one-time payment in 2002 to qualify for indexing, the provision would generate substantial revenue in 2002 -- and thus allow the House to lower other taxes even as it meets its legal obligation to produce a balanced budget. But indexing would lead to large and growing revenue losses thereafter unless more generous treatment of capital gains unleashed a frenzy of productive investment. ''It's just a cynical budget gimmick,'' concluded Len Burman, an economist at the Urban Institute.    That is not quite the end of the story, however. While the battle over tax cuts is being fought with smoke and mirrors, many experts who are removed from the politics see merit in adjustments for inflation. ''If you're going to tax income, you certainly ought to measure it properly,'' argued David Bradford, an economist at Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton.    The more difficult question is whether indexing one component of income without indexing others would increase the fairness and efficiency of the tax system as a whole. ''In the imperfect world of taxation, those who start from first principles have an awfully hard time figuring what to do,'' said Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan Business School.    Both the House and Senate tax bills would reduce the top effective tax rate on capital gains to 20 percent from 28 percent. But under the House tax bill, gains on the sale of assets bought after Jan. 1, 2001, would be taxed only on ''real,'' inflation-adjusted appreciation.     Indexing plainly reduces future tax revenue unless it somehow induces far greater realizations of capital gains. How, then, was the House able to declare the indexing provision a revenue winner for the 1997-2002 budget years?    Under the proposed law, investors sitting on capital gains earned before 2001 would become eligible for future indexing if they chose, in that year, to pay the taxes accrued until then on the paper appreciation. Budget alchemists figure that this inducement to pay some taxes sooner in order to reduce taxes later would generate $6 billion extra in revenue in 2002. But the indexing provision is expensive in the long run, adding billions to the cost over the next decade. That explains President Clinton's preference for the Senate approach. However, it does not touch the question of whether indexing is good or bad for the economy.    Most economists would undoubtedly prefer a tax system in which inflation had no effect on how much taxes are paid or when. And in flush times, Congress apparently shares the sentiment: Legislation passed in 1981 indexed tax brackets to prevent inflation from pushing families into higher marginal rates.    Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy at the Cato Institute in Washington, sees a similar logic in indexing capital gains today. ''It's just not fair to tax people on inflationary gains,'' he argued. What's more, he notes that indexing is a more progressive way to grant tax preferences to capital gains than simply cutting rates, because a relatively high proportion of the gains realized by middle-income Americans is linked to inflation. Indeed, a study by the Congressional Budget Office showed that the average taxpayer with total earnings below $50,000 who declared capital gains actually suffered a capital loss when the asset value was adjusted for inflation.    Other economists who glimpse virtue in capital gains indexing see it as a way to reduce investment risk. Under the current system no one knows what the effective rate of taxation on capital income will be because no one knows what the rate of inflation will be. Indexing would eliminate this risk -- and in the process probably make stock prices less vulnerable to the vagaries of changing inflation rates.    But Herbert Stein, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, wonders whether this would amount to overkill. He noted that with money pouring into the stock market, ''we don't seem to be suffering from excessive aversion to risk.''    Besides, indexing one part of the tax code without indexing the rest can produce some decidedly odd results. Under the House bill, investors would be able to claim full deductions against ordinary income for interest payments on loans used to buy assets, even though their tax liability on capital gains from the sale of these same assets would fall. In fact, if the inflation component of both interest and capital appreciation were high enough, said William G. Gale, an economist at the Brookings Institution, ''you could end up with an effective capital gains rate of less than zero.''     Then there is the question of complexity. ''In the computer age,'' Mr. Moore said, adjusting capital gains for the effects of inflation should be ''no big deal.'' But there would inevitably be ambiguities in sales of partnerships and other, less tangible assets","excerpt":"in these situations, what was actually owned and when would become key issues. And the House provision that gives investors an incentive to declare asset values without actually selling them could help many a tax accountant meet his mortgage payments.    Given the choice, Mr. Moore would start with indexing and then cut rates if it still fit the budget. Indeed, some economists would happily trade the whole mess of preferences now accorded to capital gains in return for inflation indexing. But tax intellectuals are not likely to play a key role in deciding the outcome of this latest skirmish over capital gains.     For supply-side ideologues, any reduction in the effective capital gains rate would bring the economy a step closer to nirvana.

Bastienne, as distraught as Juliet, relies on Colas, a magician, to help her win Bastien back.

One month later, the board rejected us with no explanation. The owner of the apartment refuses to return our down payment. Is this legal? . . . Nancy Smith, Manhattan   Answer: No. Arthur Weinstein, a vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, said there is a standard provision in all co-op sales contracts that provides for cancellation of the contract and the return of the down payment if the board rejects the buyer.    Mr. Weinstein added that since it is not unusual for a board to reverse a decision, a court might give a seller a reasonable amount of time in which to try to persuade the board to change its mind.   \\"But reasonable does not mean indefinitely,\\" said Mr. Weinstein. \\"Two weeks seems equitable in cases like these.\\" Joint Ownership  Question: My wife and I are considering buying a two-family house in New Jersey with another couple. What are the options and considerations -- and complications -- of such an arrangement? . . .Rob Regan, Little Falls, N.J.  Answer: Buying property in partnership with others must be approached with great caution. According to Michael Finder, a lawyer who specializes in real estate matters, it is advisable to have your lawyers prepare joint venture or partnership papers before you sign any sales contract.    These documents should establish the financial obligations for each party, the ownership interests and the rights and obligations of each partner, Mr. Finder explained.   \\"Another very important provision,\\" Mr. Finder said, \\"would be a mechanism for either partner to get out of the deal. You need to determine what happens if the partnership runs into difficulty.\\"   You should be aware that if one partner runs into financial problems the other would still be obligated to meet the expenses. It is always a good idea to consult a lawyer before buying property","excerpt":"in this case it would be particularly important.  Co-op's Improvements  Question: My co-op recently spent about $500,000 on building repairs and improvements like roof repair, new storm windows and aluminum siding.   Since homeowners are entitled to deduct the cost of capital improvements against their profit when they sell, I was wondering if similar deductions are available to shareholders of co-ops? . . . Ruth Lebowitz, Jamaica, Queens   Answer: Maybe. According to Neil O'Keefe, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, improvements that are made to the building by the corporation in a co-op could under some circumstances be applied to the cost basis of a residence by shareholders. This is the amount paid for the residence, plus the cost of specifically allowable improvements.   A special assessment on a shareholder for $2,000 for, say, new windows, Mr. O'Keefe said, is the equivalent of a homeowner's investment in improvements, and the shareholder would thus be entitled to add that $2,000 to the cost basis of his home.    But regular maintenance or repair expenses would not qualify as an addition to the cost basis, Mr. O'Keefe said.

So, for that matter, does the film, which sets out to be a romantic melodrama but never achieves the tone or tautness of one","excerpt":"in this critical Summer it seems decidedly old-fashioned.Around the misadventures among thieves of a promising young French diplomat in the prewar years, the authors have tried hard to create a suspensive and, slightly bizarre tale which all too frequently wabbles between styles. Because of that, and despite the competent performances of Mr. Powell and Hedy Lamarr, \\"Crossroads\\" is little more than an antiquated charade which never quite makes up its mind how serious it wants to be.Briefly, it tells the story of a young French foreign office careerist whose recollection of his previous life stops at a railway accident which occurred more than a decade ago. On the eve of a promotion and shortly after his marriage, there emerge out of his unknown past Basil Rathbone of the chilly stare; Claire Trevor, as a cheap little night-club singer, and Margaret Wycherly as a lady who claims to be his mother. This blackmail ring manages to convince the diplomat that in reality he is a former petty thief and murderer. And out of Mr. Powell's uncertainty as to the truth comes the film's small measure of suspense, his visit to a shady side street in search of his supposed mother and his desperate attempt to verify his identity.The answer, of course, is the Capitol's small secret this week. And were it not for the script's clumsy development of David Talbot's dilemma and its total lack of conviction, \\"Crossroads\\" might well have been an intriguing film. Instead, the author and director have been content to do little more than contrive a plot. The performers do better. Mr. Powell, particularly, flawlessly urbane and crisp, is an actor whose talent for under-statement is perfectly adapted for a melodrama of this genre. But there is precious little support from the script or the direction. \\"Crossroads\\" is well named; it never decided which way it wanted to go.

In addition, \\"A First Look\\" welcomes parents.   The 90-minute programs tomorrow and Sunday, led by Lena Masari Sawyer, a museum educator, will examine the art found in Benin palaces through a new exhibition (until Sept. 13), \\"Royal Art of Benin From the Perls Collection: Treasures From an African Kingdom.\\" The program will start with a Nigerian (Benin is in southern Nigeria) storyteller, who is part Benin. The storyteller, Sonala Olumhense, can speak Edo, the Benin language, which he will use with English to tell stories. As a young boy, he competed in festivals as a storyteller","excerpt":"in this program, he will pepper his tales with instruments (drums, bells, a thumb piano) to relate the histories of the rich Benin kings and their iconography.    After Mr. Olumhense's 20-minute performance, the entourage will go to the gallery and, using three or four Benin artworks, like a brass king's head (called an oba), Ms. Sawyer will encourage a discussion between the children and herself. A 15-minute sketching period will then begin (all materials are provided); the work the children draw will be based on the Benin art. Finally, the group will reconvene in the Uris Center where they will embark on an art project; this weekend they'll be given pastels to do coloring in a gallery guide describing the Benin works.    The program, which does not require reservations, is at 11 A.M. and 2:30 P.M tomorrow and at 11 A.M. on Sunday. Ms. Sawyer, who conducts the tour, said older children (the predominate age of participants being 7 and 8) are welcome to bring their younger siblings. This weekend's art project is simple because there will be a storyteller, which is not part of the usual routine. Admission to the museum is $6 for adults and free for children with an adult. Future programs will take a look at, among other subjects, the Abstract Expressionists and French and English period rooms.  'Fiesta Mexicana'  Museum of American Folk Art 2 Lincoln Square Manhattan (212) 595-9533 Recommended for all ages Tomorrow    Argentina Palacios, a storyteller, may be from Panama but she knows her Mexican folk tales. Miss Palacios will tell Mexican tales, sprinkled with Spanish and English (she often influences the English-speaking children to learn Spanish), at this 2 P.M. program, which is part of the Museum of American Folk Art's current exhibition \\"Patterns of Prestige: The Development and Influence of Saltillo Sarapes.\\" Afterward, there will be a pinata party, where children can give the colorful pinatas a bash or two, upon which fruit and nuts will spill out. In addition, there will be refreshments (soda and juice) and a mariachi band. The museum is open daily from 11:30 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. Admission to the party, storytelling and museum is free. 'Peter Pan'  Museum of Television and Radio 25 West 52d Street Manhattan (212) 621-6600 Recommended ages: 3 to 7 Through Feb. 29    In 1954, Mary Martin created the definitive Peter Pan on Broadway; in 1955, NBC produced a television adaptation with the spry actress (and choreography by Jerome Robbins). In 1960, a color version was made. Now children (and adults) who can't get enough of the defiant Peter can watch him in the color rendition at the Museum of Television and Radio, which is screening the 100-minute show in its theater, where the seats are soft and the screen is large.    The television adaptation was produced with actors on a stage, giving the story more of an edge and a stronger sense of Peter's personality than, say, the Walt Disney animated version. Martin is a powerful presence, with her short muscular legs, cropped hair and pixie face. Her Peter is so forceful, you believe everything he says, including, \\"No one must ever touch me.\\" Even Peter's conceited side and pursuit of his shadow (\\"It's mine!\\") is touchingly neurotic. Children seem to like this version for its tart dialogue (Tinkerbell calls Wendy a \\"great ugly girl\\"), pools of color in the Neverland scenes (where the crocodile is an actor in costume but is still threatening) and Captain Hook, who seems as concerned with his looks (his fuchsia hat is adorned with a black ostrich feather) as he is with killing Peter. Captain Hook also dances the tango, and even a tarantella, to keep the crew impressed.    When Peter and his friends sing \\"I Won't Grow Up,\\" their attitude makes absolute sense. And when Wendy asks Peter what his exact feelings are for her (\\"a devoted son\\"), the story offers moments of quaintness missing from more recent adaptations. Tickets to the 1 P.M. Saturday and Sunday programs are $5 for adults and $3 for children. Strollers may be taken into the theater.  'Heidi'  Theaterworks/USA Promenade Theater 2162 Broadway (at 76th Street) (212) 677-5959 Recommended ages: 5 and up Through March 8    In its newest musical, \\"Heidi,\\" Theaterworks shows off its gifts: fine acting and clear presentations. \\"Heidi\\" works on a small stage even though the story is set in two European countries: a Swiss mountain village (the mountain backdrop moves and is pink and dotted with evergreen trees) and in a bourgeois Frankfurt home. Heidi, played by a young-faced Marti McGoldrick, is dressed in a dirndl and wears short, tight braids; the male Swiss characters wear lederhosen-like garments. When Heidi arrives at her grandfather's scruffy home, she's nervous.  And why wouldn't she be? Grandfather acts and looks as if he has been in the Alps too long: his gray goatish beard is unruly, his wild-eyed face is haunting, he has only one stool to sit on, and he lives on hard cheese and hard bread, all enough to make an edelweiss droop. But Heidi, with the help of a goatherd (and a lively yodeling scene), decides she can best ruffle her grandfather's stoic feathers by talking a lot.   Unfortunately, fate -- in the form of Heidi's selfish aunt -- intercedes and Heidi is suddenly in Frankfurt, dealing with another difficult person, Clara. Clara is Heidi's age, but is all curls (she fingers them obsessively), orange froufrou clothes and is in a wheelchair. The scenes with Clara appeal to young theatergoers, who find her churlish, spoiled character something to revel in. When Clara first meets Heidi, she says, \\"Heidi's not a name.\\" Heidi replies, \\"You don't look sick to me.\\"    Heidi may be parentless but she's practical, making her a heroine children respect and like. The play leans on songs, dialogue and the odd characters. But for children, this production shows how a lovely book can be turned into a play. Tickets are $15; shows are tomorrow, Sunday and March 1, 7 and 8 at 12:30 P.M. Children under 5 years old are not permitted in the theater. KEEP IN MIND   \\"UNDERWATER CITIES: THE WORLD OF THE CORAL REEF,\\" an exhibition through March 31 of 60 varieties of coral, tropical fish and invertebrates filling 11 aquarium tanks, including angelfish, lionfish, hard and soft corals and clams.

For the romantic melodrama based on the rather full life of Eugene-François Vidocq, the arch-criminal who became police chief of Paris during the Napoleonic era, is a tale which moves like a minuet and is just about as scandalous.The members of the cast, who have been competent on other occasions, obviously were not helped by the fairly trite and static script of this offering. George Sanders, as Vidocq, the lad who was supposed to have all the fulminous traits of Professor Moriarty and Casanova, is pictured from the time he flees jail with a cellmate, Akim Tamiroff, through an involved career of dalliance and thievery. This includes the filching of a cafe's singer's affections and jeweled garter, a Marquise's expensive baubles and the heart of her granddaughter. And it is the sudden realization of his great love of that innocent lass, which causes Police Chief Vidocq to forego what would have been his most daring escapade—the robbery of the Bank of Paris.Sanders, whose villainies have been blandly and adroitly executed in many a film, saunters through this assignment. His Vidocq is merely a charming poseur given to speaking in epigrams and little else. Signe Hasso, as his true love, Akim Tamiroff, as his unimaginative partner in crime, and Carole Landis as the ill-fated, sultry singer, are no more successful or intriguing in the other principal roles.

You have been misled, Mr. Norman, by the First Authority, lexicographer Samuel Johnson, who mistranslated the Latin in Butler's ''Hudibras.'' The words    internecinum bellum    meant ''bloody war,'' ''war of extermination,'' ''all-out slaughter'' (hence Mr. Norman's apt ''Did you butcher    internecine    . . . ?''). When Big Sam looked at the word, he interpreted the    inter-    to mean ''mutual,'' and defined the word in his dictionary as ''endeavouring mutual destruction.''

Time was when the air was filled with unrated, and mostly uncanned, laughter, written and performed not for the eye but the ear. Many younger viewers within today's television audiences, watching sight gags and slapstick performed on elaborate sets, are unaware that big-name humorists once crowned the airwaves. Hollywood and broadcasting stars, huckstering products linked to their own radio shows, often were one and the same: Eddie Cantor, Will Rogers, Bing Crosby, George Burns and Gracie Allen, Jack Benny and Mary Livingston and, for a mirthful six months in the early 1930's, half of the Marx Brothers, Groucho and Chico.   In Woody Allen's 1987 nostalgic Valentine to his growing-up years, \\"Radio Days,\\" he celebrated the lasting impact of radio on a family. But his movie persona confessed that, with each passing year, those memory-filled voices grew dimmer and dimmer.   Now, one of the funniest \\"lost\\" radio shows of the early 1930's - \\"Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel, Attorneys at Law,\\" starring Groucho and Chico Marx - has been unearthed. Not the voices","excerpt":"in those years radio programs were not regularly recorded. But the transcripts of 25 of the original \\"Flywheel\\" episodes have been found in the archives of the Library of Congress. For viewers and listeners who want to discover - or rediscover - what comedy was all about in those more slaphappy days, the actual scripts of \\"Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel,\\" edited by Michael Barson, will be published in October by Pantheon Books.   It happened that in 1980, as part of his Ph.D. studies, Mr. Barson worked as a specialist in the Deposit Collection of the Library of Congress (which oversees the Copyright Office). In a section called \\"unpublished dramas,\\" he came across the \\"Flywheel\\" scripts. Nobody was aware that they still existed; their copyrights had not been renewed. \\"Flywheel\\" had fallen into the public domain.   Groucho and Chico - along with their other two brothers, the taciturn Zeppo and the silent Harpo - had already become movie stars in four films - \\"The Cocoanuts,\\" \\"Animal Crackers,\\" \\"Monkey Business\\" and \\"Horse Feathers\\" - when they shared $6,500 a week for doing a half-hour radio show about a malpracticing lawyer and his bungling assistant. The episodes were broadcast Monday nights from 7:30 to 8 over WJZ in New York, the flagship station of NBC's Blue Network. At those wages, Groucho and Chico didn't find it a burden to hawk gasoline for Standard Oil for 60 seconds on every show.   Most of the scripts were written by Nat Perrin and Arthur Sheekman, who had done polish jobs on the screenplays for \\"Monkey Business\\" and \\"Horse Feathers.\\" The radio dialogue was so witty and outrageous that some of the material from \\"Flywheel\\" was lifted, word for word, for the Marx Brothers' 1933 starring vechicle, \\"Duck Soup.\\" In fact, the name of Groucho's character in that film, Rufus T. Firefly, resembles the name of his radio character, Waldorf T. Flywheel. Nearly 10 years later, Perrin spun off the department-store setting of one of the radio episodes for the 1941 film comedy, \\"The Big Store,\\" with Groucho as Wolf J. Flywheel, a private detective, and Chico as Ravelli.   On radio, \\"Flywheel\\" was Marxism without tears. Puns, gags and put-downs ran riot. Could this innocent form of original comedy - as well as serious drama - return to the airwaves in fresh formats? It's a definite maybe that remains to be seen or, rather, heard. Meanwhile: Groucho: Yesterday, I went to visit Uncle Charlie and it made him very happy. And that wasn't all. An hour later I left, and that made him twice as happy.   Chico: Yeah, I don't know what to do about Uncle Charlie. He's a case. He's such a crank. Groucho: You mean a crankcase. Well, Essolube, that famous hydrofined motor oil is the best thing in the world for a crankcase.   Chico: Hey, you didn't say nuttin' about Esso, which is more powerful than any gasoline.
