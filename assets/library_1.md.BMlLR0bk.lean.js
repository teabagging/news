Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, after a meeting between Mr. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq. A simultaneous translation by CNN was transcribed by The New York Times.   Please excuse me for having kept you for so long, but I do think that the effort was worthwhile.    The negotiations went for 2 hours, 20 minutes. They began at zero hours, 10 minutes. They finished just 10 minutes ago. Entrusted by the President of Iraq and the Revolutionary Command, the Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, presented the response to the plan put forward by Mikhail Gorbachev.    The response is positive. Those responses, after their thorough discussion and the comparison of the various positions, the two parties came to the conclusion that it is possible to find a way out of the military conflict in the gulf, along the following lines. We see the following approaches being evolved in this process that include the following positions:    First, Iraq states about its full and unconditional withdrawal of its forces from Kuwait.  Pullout After Cease-Fire     Second, the withdrawal of forces begins on the second day after the cessation of hostilities. The withdrawal of forces will take place in a fixed time frame.    Four, after the withdrawal of two-thirds of all the forces, Iraqi forces, from Kuwait, the economic sanctions envisaged by the U.N. would cease to apply to Iraq.    Fifth, after the -- and with the withdrawal of the Iraqi forces from Kuwait, thus the causes will cease to exist -- the causes for the corresponding resolutions of the Security Council. So thus those resolutions would cease to be in effect.    Sixth, right after the cease-fire, all the POW's would be immediately released. Monitoring of Withdrawal     Seventh, the withdrawal forces would be monitored by the countries not directly involved in the conflict, being so entrusted by the Security Council of the United Nations.    And the last point, the work on determining the details and specifications continues. The final outcome of this work will be made public today, on the 22d of February, to the countries, members, present members of the Security Council of the United Nations.    This is what I have to say about the work conducted today. So I do think that I can say a very good morning. I do think we can give some applause here.

For some time now, the German director Jean-Marie Straub has been at work trying to remove the images.In his latest film—it can't be called a movie because virtually nothing moves, neither the camera nor what it is photographing — Mr. Straub has come close to purging the screen of anything to see. At the same time, he will come close to purging the movie theater of anybody to watch.Some kind of anchorite ideal is being approached here: a motionless screen in an empty theater with angry, monotone voices on the soundtrack reading out pamphlets to music.Some people — more in Europe than here—fervently admire Mr. Straub for his aridity. Dryness in our still lush and overnourished civilization can seem a virtue. \\"Aaron and Moses,\\" which will be shown at Lincoln Center this afternoon and Tuesday night as Mr. Straub's entry in the New York Film Festival, is one great Sahara.It is a filmed version of the atonal opera by Arnold Schoenberg, whose work was attacked in its day for uncompromising severity and even now is rarely whistled. Schoenberg, considering himself no minor prophet, modeled Moses upon himself. In the opera his Moses stands for the gaunt, unadorned religious Idea, conveyed solely through words and without images. Aaron argues that a living people needs images—the Golden Calf, for instance—and other aids to be able to grasp and fulfill the Idea.The opera is about the conflict. Schoenberg uses his technique to reinforce it: Aaron's tenor has musical phrases to sing","excerpt":"Moses' bass keeps to an atonal sung speech.Mr. Straub too seems to identify with Moses the image-breaker. He uses his cinema techniques in an attempt to reinforce the musical effect sought by Schoenberg. The first section, where Moses is present, is almost without motion. Moses' opening, lasting nearly five minutes, is rendered by the camera's fixing itself on the back of the singer's head. When he enlists Aaron, a second lengthy scene is done with the two men performing simultaneously, the camera merely showing them face to face.The Chosen People is represented by the Chorus of the Austrian Radio standing in a motionless block, like workers posing for pictures at a factory picnic. At times the screen goes blank or black for minutes on end, allowing the tiny light flaws skipping across to make up one of the film's visual high points.When Moses is up on the mountain and Aaron is in charge, the figures move a bit more. The Golden Calf is set up, there is a bit of dancing and a tiny orgy. It is done in detached, drugged fashion, with deliberate pictorial dullness.Dullness can be a statement, and in the case of Mr. Straub, whose control of his material is not in doubt, it obviously is. (The one major nondeliberate error is the subtitles. With so much emphasis on the singing and talking, and nothing much else happening, they assume a major importance. They are so bad, so Germanic, that sometimes it seems that this is a movie about present participles.)The reason for making dullness into a statement is less clear. But it seems to amount to a radical rejection of the successive cinematic fashions that generally try to heighten or vary the image, not to deaden it.Mr. Straub is making a minimal film, in other words, the equivalent of minimal painting. It is an antimovie and this would be fine except, maybe, for the people who go see it. Could they get in, perhaps, with anti-money?

A sheaf of declassified documents released as part of committee hearings on Robert M. Gates's nomination to become Director of Central Intelligence reflects the debate between Mr. Gates and his staff of analysts over some of the most heated intelligence issues of the 1980's.    Following are excerpts of some of those documents, reflecting internal disagreements over Soviet involvement in the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II, Soviet influence in Iran and elsewhere in the third world and the effect of United States economic sanctions against Libya.   The excerpts reflect debates about the quality of written intelligence analyses that were produced by experts at the C.I.A. or the National Intelligence Council. The council is a senior body of analysts that represents the consensus view of all United States intelligence agencies on world events. From 1982 to 1986, Mr. Gates was both the C.I.A.'s Deputy Director for Intelligence -- the head of its analysis shop -- and chairman of the National Intelligence Council.   Still classified -- and therefore not published here -- are the actual estimates that sparked the debates. The exception is the situation in Iran in the early and mid-1980's, a subject on which many analyses by the C.I.A. and the intelligence council have been made public. Several others were released today. Excerpts from one are printed below. Soviet Role in Third World     Melvin A. Goodman, a deputy division chief in the C.I.A.'s Soviet analytical division, wrote a draft National Intelligence Estimate in early 1982 concluding that Soviet influence in the third world may be reaching its limit. Mr. Gates, then head of the C.I.A.'s intelligence analysis shop, responded with a memorandum on Feb. 14, 1982, sharply criticizing the report.   Per your request, I have read the attached draft and, unhappily, find it to be rather dry and lacking any sense of the dynamics of Soviet involvement in the third world . . .   *. . . one has only a snapshot of Soviet involvement in the third world that tends too much to reflect on present opportunities and power balances and less on the ideological and political motives that have impelled the Soviet Union to an activist role in the third world now for more than 60 years. . . .   This section would then draw the distinction between the policies that the Soviets pursued until the mid-1970's and then the different kind of involvement that the Soviets have sponsored since that time, including a modernization of the Cuban armed forces to encourage Cuba's greater role abroad. . . .    In sum, this estimate misses the whole historical significance of Soviet involvement in the third world and the ways in which their tactics and approach have changed in the postwar period. The reader cannot understand Soviet activities in the third world without some understanding of these changes. The importance of the changes is reflected by the fact that the Soviets have allowed their relationship with the United States to founder in many respects over the last eight years over the question of their involvement in the third world. . . .    *On page 10 the estimate draft contends that Moscow believes that the U.S. is now more willing to counter Soviet activities in the third world than during the immediate post-Vietnam years. I think it is not possible yet to draw that conclusion and I think the Soviets themselves have not drawn that conclusion. So far, except in El Salvador, the Soviets principally have seen American rhetoric since 1975 and very little action. . . . The only place they know we are involved to any degree at all is in Afghanistan. . . .    *On page 24, the draft indicates that Soviets will have more difficulty in gaining new clients than after first becoming active in the third world in the 1950's. Again, this does not reflect the change in Soviet tactics. It is much easier for the Soviets to let the Cubans or the Libyans or others develop such clients and to support them indirectly than it is to do so directly. Examples include Grenada and potentially Suriname. . . .   *The estimate seems to conclude that fewer opportunities will present themselves to the Soviets in the 1980's than before for a variety of reasons and that the opportunities the Soviets have exploited will begin to present them with increased problems. I think this overlooks the creativity of the Soviet approach . . . I see a lot more trouble for us in the third world in the years ahead because it's easier to make trouble than it is to solve it.  Libya Analysis Assailed     On July 12, 1983, Mr. Gates sent a memo to the director of the C.I.A.'s Near East and South Asia analysis division, criticizing a report that    concluded      United States economic sanctions against Libya were ineffective.   1. This seems to me too narrow a cut at this subject and presumes an important lack of sophistication . . . it is fairly well documented that few, if any, expected the sanctions to have a significant economic impact . . .   2. It seems to me that they went ahead as a political gesture to dramatize Qaddafi's behavior,  [ Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya's leader ]  rivet attention on his activities, and try to ostracize him. . . .   3. I have three additional problems with the paper:   *Most importantly, the paper conveys (unintentionally or not) a strong bias on the part of the author against economic sanctions. The analysis simply does not sound objective.   *Second, I believe the paper is too generalized for those interested in the topic.   *Finally, the paper has the underlying but unproven assumption that Libya has been pushed further into the Soviet camp by our sanctions. No attempt is made to prove this . . . These references add to an aura of slanted analysis.   4. In sum, the paper reads like the author had reached his conclusions at the beginning and then researched and wrote the paper to substantiate the conclusions.   Analysts' Response     On July 21, 1983, the analysts defended the report.   We disagree that few, if any, policymakers expected the sanctions to have a significant economic impact or to cause Qaddafi to change his stripes. . . . This is evidenced by:   *A 17 December memo from  [ censored ]  to the D.C.I.  [ William J. Casey, then Director of Central Intelligence ]  . . . This memo states: \\"To sum up, the Intelligence Community unanimously feels the proposed sanctions would be counterproductive. If they are applied, their symbolic nature must be clearly understood. I do not believe the policy level task force personnel  [ the Reagan Administration policymakers who decided to impose sanctions ]  are seized with this fact.\\"   *A draft of the discussion paper from a 4 February N.S.C.  [ National Security Council ]  meeting which states \\"Economic sanctions . . . as well as other economic and military measures are intended not only to signal Qaddhafi about our displeasure, but to pressure him as well to cease his policies of international terrorism and aggression.\\" *A 1 September 1982 meeting of the Libyan Working Group called by  [ censored ]  to \\"review the effects of our economic measures.\\" If the sanctions were only a symbolic gesture, why hold this meeting?   We agree that the author and reviewers of the paper pretty well knew the conclusions the paper would reach before it was written and in fact do have a bias against economic sanctions as applied against Libya. We fail to see any problem with this, however, since this simply reflects the experience, knowledge, and judgment of the individuals involved.   Attempted Assassination of Pope     In early 1985, Director Casey ordered Mr. Gates to review intelligence on the shooting of Pope John Paul II four years earlier, with the stated aim of making the strongest argument that the Soviet Union had masterminded the assassination attempt. A review of the evidence in 1983 had concluded that the Soviets were not involved in the shooting by Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman.   Mr. Gates assigned three analysts to prepare the case, entitled \\"Agca's Attempt to Kill the Pope: The Case for Soviet Involvement.\\"    The report      was not among the documents made public today.   Some five months later, an internal C.I.A. review panel produced a report      that found \\"serious shortcomings\\" in both the 1983 and 1985 analyses, as well as other C.I.A. reports on the assassination attempt.    Key Findings    *Our review of the product record on the Papal assassination attempt reveals some serious shortcomings . . .    *Alternative explanations were not adequately examined . . .    *The widespread perception that upper management had strong and in some cases conflicting views on the issue had a pervasive effect on the analytic and production process.   *Senior management may want to take some steps to dispel the perception in some quarters that the issue has become politicized . . .    I. Nature of the Case and the Analytic Environment   The environment with C.I.A. -- particularly the reorganization of the D.I. in late 1981, the mindsets prevailing in various offices, and the \\"hot potato climate\\" associated with the  [ Papal shooting ]  case -- also influenced the amount and quality of D.I. production.  [ Mr. Gates and other senior officials had overhauled the C.I.A.'s analysis division. They also created new offices, covering such subjects as terrorism, that crossed both geographic and topical lines, sparking turf fights among analysts. ]   Responsibility for the case initially went to the Terrorism Branch. . . . .   As time went on and the Italian judicial investigation increasingly pointed to Bulgarian involvement, the case became the responsibility of one analyst in O.G.I. This analyst was eventually designated by the D.D.I.  [ Deputy Director for Intelligence ]  as the key person responsible for the case within the D.I. . . . As a result, incentives for interoffice cooperation began to evaporate.   Even more important appears to be the view expressed by some analysts interviewed that most SOVA  [ Office of Soviet Analysis ]  analysts and managers preferred, at least in the early years, not to consider the \\"seamy\\" side of Soviet policy -- wet operations  [ assassinations ]  and the like. . . .   Perhaps the most important factor contributing to this climate was the perception by analysts and managers that the seventh floor  [ the C.I.A.'s executive offices ]  had strong views on the case. Most thought that the D.C.I.  [ Mr. Casey ]  had a strong gut feeling that the Soviets were involved","excerpt":"most also were convinced that the D.D.C.I.  [ then John McMahon ]  for a long time was persuaded that the tradecraft exhibited did not bear the marks of a Soviet operation.   II. Setting the Stage: Moscow and the Polish Pope   By early 1981 . . . several D.I. products warned that Moscow might be growing \\"disillusioned with the utility of its connection\\" because it had not led to greater calm in Poland and since the Soviets were unhappy with Walesa's  [ Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader ]  highly publicized meetings with the Pope. In retrospect, we would have expected that this latter reporting would have set the stage for analysts at least to consider Soviet motives for getting rid of the Pope. In fact, they continued to see the Pope as a moderating force . . .    III. The Production Record   Looking first at the internal agency documents and responses to specific external questions (30 documents covering September 1982 to June 1985), several patterns emerge:   *As in the current and serial publications, the tendency is to cast doubt on Bulgarian complicity.   *The major recurrent reasons for this position are the agency's inability to obtain specific evidence of a Bulgarian/Soviet link,  [ and ]  the supposedly \\"sloppy\\" tradecraft in the operation.   *The nearly complete absence of consideration of alternative scenarios to explain the Papal shooting.   Noteworthy by its uniqueness in mentioning alternative scenarios is a memo on 17 September 1982 from the D.D.I. to the D.C.I. titled Status of the Investigation of the Attempted Assassination of Pope John Paul II. After discussing in considerable detail what the agency knew about the case, the memo concluded that \\"hard information . . . supports several scenarios not all of which are mutually exclusive:   *That Agca's plans . . . were known beforehand, perhaps to one or more of several parties including the Bulgarian service and rightist Turkish terrorists.   *That Agca attempted to assassinate the Pope without sponsorship and for his own reasons . . .   *That Agca was a hired assassin.\\"   But the memo then went on to judge that if Agca was a hired assassin, Turkish terrorists were probably his paymasters, because the Soviets would have regarded him as having \\"too high\\" a profile and being \\"too risky an instrument.\\"   Despite the unidimensional thrust of much of the ad hoc production, the D.I., in our judgment, took a balanced, objective -- and agnostic -- view of the case in the three instances in which it addressed a wide or important external audience.     Of the three formal Intelligence Assessments  [ I.A.s ]  the D.I. has produced since the assassination attempt, two address the question of bloc complicity. These are \\"The Papal Assassination Attempt: A Review of the Record\\" (May 1983) and \\"Agca's Attempt to Kill the Pope: The Case for Soviet Involvement\\" (April 1985). Both papers are impressive efforts to bring some order out of the fragmentary and often contradictory data on the case. Judging from our own review of the two papers and from our interviews with key participants, however, both assessments were troubled by problems in coordination and sourcing.   The 1985 I.A., a joint effort by O.G.I. and SOVA, is the agency's most comprehensive look at the case to date. By any standard, it is an impressive compilation of the facts and marshalling of the evidence and reasoning for Soviet involvement. . . .   The I.A. breaks new ground by taking the agency's first comprehensive look at the possibility of Soviet complicity. But many of the people we interviewed thought the paper had an unusual thrust for an intelligence assessment. They thought that calling the paper \\"The Case for Soviet Involvement\\" and marshalling evidence only for the side \\"stacked the deck\\" in favor of that argument and ran the risk of appearing biased. This impression was further reinforced, they thought, by the \\"unbalanced\\" treatment of counterarguments in the text.   Many participants in the process thought that without the qualifiers, particularly on source reliability, the Key Judgments give readers the impression that the agency is saying -- more definitively than the paper intends or the evidence warrants -- the Soviets were responsible. At the very least, the sourcing in the Key Judgments is inconsistent with the D.D.I. guidance in 1982 to \\"focus on the weakest element in the collection chain in terms of reliability\\" when referring to D.O.  [ Directorate of Operations ]  sources in D.I. publications.   The sourcing issue was at the heart of complaints about coordination from officers in D.O./S.E.  [ the C.I.A. division that runs clandestine operations in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ]  and D.O./EUR  [ the Agency's European operaitons division ] . S.E. officers said their reservations about the sourcing chain on the original raw reports were serious enough that they might not have disseminated the reports had it not been for the high interest in the subject. In their view, the paper was deliberately skewed to make the case for Soviet complicity look more solid that it is; they thought the author(s) had been \\"manipulated.\\"   The concerns about \\"balance\\" and about readers misinterpreting the paper might have been eased by the inclusion of a Scope Note saying that the paper deliberately does not try to make the counterargument against Soviet complicity. Absent such a Scope Note, this paper, like its 1983 counterpart, would have been strengthened and made more balanced by consideration of alternative scenarios.   But we would not exclude the possibility that the agency might not, in the final analysis, be able to choose any single theory as the most plausible; in this case, we would serve our readers well by emphasizing the complexity of the case, the contradictory nature of the evidence, and the difficulty of arriving at any firm conclusion. As the D.I. record stands now, our readers are left to gues what the Agency poistion is on this issue, or, indeed, whether we have a position. The definitive piece is yet to be written.   IV. Problems in the Analytic Process   . . . Another external influence was the \\"perception in the trenches that there was a mindset at the highest levels\\" in the U.S. Government and the agency that the Soviets were behind the attempt on the Pope's life. In one manager's opinion, the effect of this perception on analysts was either to intimidate them or (in our view, more often) to push them into a defensive posture. . . .    In the early phases of the case, however, there appears to have been a conscious effort on the part of upper management -- the D.D.I., at least -- to keep hands off the D.I. product in order to avoid the appearance of manipulating the analytic process. . . .    Largely because of the sensitivity of the issue, however, we found that most ad hoc production was initiated from on-high or in response to outside request rather than from below. So, despite the D.D.I.'s best efforts, there was a perception among analysts of upper-level direction, which became more pronounced after the new evidence of Soviet complicity was acquired. In the event, however, our interviews suggested that it was not so much D.C.I. or D.D.I. direction as it was an effort on the part of some D.I. managers at the next one or two layers down to be responsive to perceived D.C.I. and D.D.I. desires.   V. Conclusions    *Throughout the case, greater emphasis should have been placed on analysis of alternative scenarios . . .   *Finally, senior management could have provided clearer and more explicit guidance -- to all of the relevant players -- on how it viewed this problem . . . The last point may hold the key to where the agency goes from here in dealing with the case. . . . As things stand now, there is a deeply rooted perception at the working level that senior management:   *Regards this as a politically sensitive case that requires special handling.   *Leans toward the view that the Soviets were involved.   *Takes a special interest in the content and timing of what is published on this issue.   *Has \\"anointed\\" one office, and indeed one analyst, with principal responsibility for the problem and has therefore discouraged others from taking initiative on the issue. Changing U.S. Policy on Iran     On May 17, 1985, the chief Middle East analyst for the National Intelligence Council, Graham E. Fuller, sent Mr. Casey and Mr. McMahon one in a series of memoranda arguing that the United States and the Soviet Union were reaching a crossroads in their competition for influence in Iran. Critics say that this and other C.I.A. and intelligence council analyses helped create the view of Iran within the Reagan Administration that led to the arms-for-hostages scandal. In Senate hearings today, they contended that Mr. Gates suppressed dissenting views of other C.I.A. analysts.       1. The U.S. faces a grim situation in developing a new policy toward Iran. Events are moving largely against our interests and we have few palatable alternatives. In bluntest form, the Khomeini regime is faltering and may be moving toward a moment of truth; we will soon see a struggle for succession. The U.S. has almost no cards to play; the U.S.S.R. has many. . . .   2. The Twin Pillars of U.S. Policy. U.S. policy at present comes down to two major pillars.   *We will respond with force directly if Iran should undertake another terrorist outrage against the U.S.   *We seek to choke off all arms supplies to Teheran wherever possible.   3. Terrorist Attack: We can and must have some policy against terrorism. We must also recognize that this cannot represent the bulk of our policy toward Iran. Furthermore, radical forces in Teheran may welcome a direct confrontation with the U.S. -- including U.S. military retaliation -- in the hopes of replaying its extraordinarily successful gambit against the U.S. in the 1979 hostage crisis. ..  .   5. These two pillars of U.S. policy -- both sensible while Iran was in a vacuum and Khomeini was strong -- can no longer serve as the primary vehicle for U.S. policy toward Iran. Both are entirely negative in nature and may now serve to facilitate Soviet interests more than our own.    6. Some Broader Policy Considerations. Nobody has any brilliant ideas about how to get us back into Teheran. Nearly all tentative proposals require uncomfortable choices and clear-cut downsides. Nonetheless, we need to review a broad spectrum of ideas. I submit below a range of thoughts, carrots and sticks -- all of which are flawed -- but which might assist in sparking better and more refined positions to meet our needs.   a. Work with Iraq to bring Teheran to its knees. We could consider moving much closer to Iraq to bring the war to a quicker end -- particularly by way of encouraging crippling attacks on Kharg Island and key Iranian economic facilities. . . . Disadvantage: We have no knowledge about who would emerge victorious from such shambles; it could well be radical elements filled with hatred of the U.S.    b. Open up Iran to friendly state influence. We could tell all our European allies, as well as Israel, Turkey, Pakistan, China, Japan, Brazil and Argentina that Western influence must develop a paramount position during this critical period in Iran. We would remove all restrictions in sales -- including military -- to Iran. . . . Disadvantage: Possible encouragement for Iranian perpetuation of the war.   c. Go after Iran's radical allies. While direct U.S. assault against Iran could bring about the very thing we wish to avoid, i.e. Soviet domination of Iran, direct attack on Iran's radical allies, Syrian and Libya, would probably sober Iran and weaken its support from those quarters. . . . This \\"indirect strategy\\" would demonstrate U.S. resolve against radicalism without directly pushing Iran in the wrong direction. Unlike Iran, we have nothing to lose in Libya and everything to gain.   d. Battening down the hatches in Turkey and Pakistan. Assuming that we may be heading for a major Soviet gain in Iran, we may need to greatly step up our ties with Turkey and Pakistan. . . .   e. Getting the Message Through to Teheran.. . . There is room for such broad, public statement on a regular basis to ensure Iranian moderates -- and opportunists -- that we are not dedicated to the overthrow of the Islamic Republic or the collapse of Iran. . . .   f. Massive reassurance to Iran of U.S. intentions. . . .    g. Bargaining with the U.S.S.R. We have little leverage here.   7. On reflection I believe that the option most constructively oriented is that of inserting Western allies and friends into Teheran quickly through the arms door.    8. Our tilt to Iraq was timely when Iraq was against the ropes and the Islamic revolution was on a roll. The time may now have come to tilt back -- at least via our allies -- to ensure the Soviets lose both attraction and potential access to the clergy. Chance of Soviet Invervention     After the arms-for-hostages affair became public in late 1986, the C.I.A.'s chief Soviet analyst, Douglas J. MacEachin, reviewed the agency's own studies of Soviet influence in Iran and sent his conclusions to Mr. Gates.   1. . . . Attached is a package containing Key Judgments and summaries of various SOVA  [ Office of Soviet Analysis ] , joint NESA-SOVA and NIC or  [ National Intelligence Council ]  products since 1980 dealing with Soviet-Iranian issues. 2. The record shows that except for a \\"swerve\\" in 1985, . . . both the D.I. and community products have followed a pretty consistent line.   *The sharp increase in Soviet planning since 1980 for major military campaigns against Iran has been examined in great detail, . . . The judgment -- not just ours but the Community's -- has been that, on balance, the U.S.S.R. is unlikely seriously to consider intervening military unless the Soviets believe the U.S. is about to do so, or central power in Iran breaks down, or a leftist faction seizes power and appeals to the Soviet Union for help.

The realities of life on the street are not the least bit romantic, but to a teen-ager who feels trapped and rejected, running away may feel like the only option.   The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that up to 1.5 million American children run away from home each year. About 200,000 are on the streets at any one time","excerpt":"most are 16 years old.   \\"Fifty percent of the children who run away are back before the night's over,\\" said Dr. Mark-David Janus, a Paulist priest and a clinical psychologist at Indiana University Medical School in Indianapolis who has studied runaway youth. \\"Most of the remainder,\\" he said, \\"are back within two and three days.\\"   Far more children threaten to leave home during an argument than actually try it. Preschoolers and children in elementary school are almost always acutely aware of how dependent they are on their parents. But even a young child's threat to run away should be taken seriously, mental health professionals say.   \\"Threatening to run away is often a call for attention or help,\\" said Dr. John A. Calicchia, a child psychologist at McLean Hospital in Boston and a psychology instructor at Harvard Medical School. \\"It's a way of expressing a problem that the child is having that he or she can't say directly.\\"   Pre-adolescents and adolescents are less reliant on their parents for their basic needs. Their threats to leave home can be carried out more easily. Even when they don't leave, children who make threats are giving their parents important information about how they feel and the limited options they see. Their threats can serve as a springboard for discussing those emotions and searching for other options.   Among runaways are some, especially those who run more than once, responding to abuse by adults.   Dr. Janus's study of chronic runaways in Toronto found that 73 percent said they had been physically beaten and 51 percent said they had been sexually abused. Because these were chronic runaways who sought help at a shelter, those percentages are higher than for the general population of runaways.   More common for first-time runaways and those who threaten to leave are feelings that they are no longer respected or wanted. They feel their parents are unwilling to listen to them and to acknowledge how they are changing.   \\"They see their families as having high expectations for them and very rigid rules, but not giving them the emotional support they need,\\" said Dr. Arlene McCormack, a professor of sociology at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell and a co-author, with Dr. Janus, of \\"Adolescent Runaways: Causes and Consequences\\" (Lexington Books, 1987).   What parents may intend as protective acts, like setting rules about how late their children can stay out, these adolescents interpret as rejection.   \\"Remember that the child doesn't want to leave home,\\" Dr. Janus said. \\"He or she wants the relationship to be different, but doesn't see any other solution. Running away is an impulsive, emotional solution to not seeing any other way of changing the relationship.\\" DEALING WITH THE THREAT TO RUN AWAY    MOST of the time children threaten to run away in the middle of an argument with their parents. It is a time when neither side is likely to be thinking clearly or looking beyond the moment. If a child does say he wants to leave, here are some ways to analyze and approach the problem:   Take seriously, not literally, what young children say.   Almost all young children will talk about running away at some point. Sometimes young children will use such a threat to express anger at you. They may also be use it to test your love. Let the child know you can see he's very upset. Tell him that you love him even when he gets angry or sad. Simply acknowledging his feelings will often allow him to talk about the underlying problem.    Recognize that a threat to run away is a sign of a communication problem, at the very least.    \\"Help your child articulate his complaints,\\" said Dr. Howard Liddle, a professor of counseling psychology at Temple University.   \\"Listen without cutting him off,\\" Dr. Liddle said. \\"If you start with honesty and good intentions, that can bring about the same approach from your child.\\"    Never dare your child to make good on his threat.   Remember that running away from home is an impulsive act.   \\"With pre-teens, say something like: 'Listen, I'm not going to let you run away. It's not safe,' \\" said Dr. Bennett L. Leventhal, director of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Chicago. \\"Don't tease them by packing their bags or telling them to leave. That's humiliating and scary.\\"   Dr. Mark-David Janus, a Paulist priest and clinical psychologist who works with runaways, said: \\"State clearly that you want your child to live at home. Also, let him know that if he leaves home, you're going to look for him.\\"   Don't feel you have to handle the problem by yourself.    It is often helpful to have an experienced therapist act as an intermediary. It is much easier for a teen-ager to hear criticism from an outside adult. That therapist also becomes an advocate for the child in setting appropriate family rules that recognize both his growth and his limitations.   Look for a safety valve.    Sometimes children (and their parents) need a cooling-off period. If a child is threatening to run away, consider arranging a place for him to run to, where he can be with a surrogate parent like an aunt or grandparent. Don't simply let him run off to be with a friend; that suggests that you feel he no longer needs the support and protection of adults.   \\"If you work with your child on planning some time apart, he's less likely to see your actions as a rejection,\\" Dr. Janus said.

By Charles E. Little. (Johns Hopkins University, $22.95.) Our system of land use may have lost much of its legitimacy and the planning profession may have few new ideas to offer, but Charles E. Little sees greenways as a grass-roots source of positive change. Greenways are protected natural areas","excerpt":"most are used for recreation such as hiking or biking, although some are designed primarily to protect environmental resources. Central to the greenway concept is the idea of linkage: creating connections among recreational resources, natural resources and communities. Mr. Little, whose previous books include \\"Challenge of the Land\\" and \\"Green Fields Forever,\\" sees such networks as providing the framework for regional planning. \\"Greenways for America\\" makes clear that greenways have provided recreation, environmental enhancement, economic stimulus and civic pride in widely varied situations. Mr. Little concludes that to make a greenway is to make a community. The projects that the author visited are located across the country, from the San Juan Islands in Washington to the Hudson River Valley, and are \\"as rich and diverse as human ingenuity and topographic opportunity could make them.\\" Mr. Little is an enthusiastic journalist with both an eye and an ear for local history and politics. With a few colorful strokes he brings to life the unconventional people he met along the way. His text ranges from the history of the greenway concept to an examination of the types of greenways he identified. During his greenway reconnaissance, Mr. Little found the tenacity and ingenuity that we want to believe continue to define the American character. And he provides many practical ideas for people who would follow suit.

It has remade itself radically in recent years \\"because of the changing picture of society,\\" as Mr. O'Brien put it.\\n\\nThe Fuller Brush Company today is not the male bastion immortalized by Red Skelton in the 1948 film \\"The Fuller Brush Man,\\" dedicated to \\"those unsung heroes with the flashing smiles.\\" Perhaps a film of two years later, \\"The Fuller Brush Woman,\\" starring Lucille Ball, gave a hint of what was to come.\\nFewer Knocks on the Door \\n\\n Today the Fuller Brush man is much more likely to be a woman, as are 90 percent of the roughly 200 sales representatives in Westchester County, said Marilyn Berman, the company's regional sales manager. Most of them work part time, selling more than 300 products, from the 85-year-old company's famous brushes to cleansers, detergents and degreasers. \\n\\nMany of the women weave their selling hours around the time they spend caring for their young children, Mrs. Berman said. And only occasionally do they knock on doors","excerpt":"most build a clientele by leaving catalogues with friends and at the office or in places like bowling alleys or beauty parlors, she said. \\n\\nMost sell out of their homes as independent contractors, said Nancy Young, a Fuller Industries spokeswoman. They start with little more than a skeleton line of Fuller products, a telephone and perhaps a reverse telephone directory. With enough persistence, they can earn several hundred dollars a week, she said. Salesmen and women who earn that work about 20 hours a week, they said.\\n\\nThere are additional opportunities for salespeople who bring friends into the company, Mrs. Berman said. One woman, Louise McNamara, a 77-year-old Valhalla retiree, earned about $16,000 last year by bringing in, or sponsoring, more than 50 new salesmen and women, she said.\\n'Mention the Fuller Name' \\n\\n \\"One of the advantages is that people already know the name,\\" said Mr. O'Brien, who does go door-to-door and began selling Fuller products to supplement his income as a letter carrier in New Rochelle. \\n\\n\\"I find you aren't always welcome going door to door,\\" he said. \\"But mention the Fuller name and at least people will let me talk. After a while, most are pretty congenial and sometimes they end up buying some products.\\" \\n\\nMr. O'Brien said most people over 40 instantly know the name, while younger people might not have heard of it. \\n\\nNeil Offen, president of the Washington-based Direct Selling Association, said, \\"In direct sales, you must look to integrate telemarketing and direct-selling techniques. Fuller is managing to meld together these different channels, which is a very 90's concept. It's an exciting time at Fuller Brush.\\"\\n\\nCarol Jean Damon, a 30-year-old Yonkers mother with two small children, started selling Fuller Brush products after seeing a Fuller advertisement in the newspaper. Today, she sells the products to a steady clientele of a dozen people, composed mostly of family and friends. \\n\\n\\"What appealed to me was being able to earn some extra money without having to leave my children,\\" Mrs. Damon said.\\nA Product That 'Sells Itself' \\n\\n Laura Estremera, a 35-year-old Elmsford social worker and the mother of two small children, said she sells Fuller products mostly through word of mouth.\\n\\n\\"What I enjoy most is the flexibility,\\" she said. \\"I can stay home, help to raise my children and do this on the side. You find the product sells itself.\\" \\n\\nThat is what Alfred C. Fuller had in mind when he started the company that bears his name, in the basement of his sister's house in Boston.\\n\\nTo Mr. Fuller, nicknamed Dad by reverential employees, brushes were more than mere cleaners. They were \\"specialized tools obtainable nowhere else.\\" Mr. Fuller made his first house calls in 1906, giving brush demonstrations in which he did everything from washing babies' bottoms to cleaning radiators. In return, customers not only bought his products but gave him ideas for new and improved brushes. \\n'Know Your Product' \\n\\n In time, Mr. Fuller had more customers than he could handle, so he ran a $10 magazine advertisement for salesmen. One month later he had 260 dealers nationwide and the Hartford-based company was well on its way to becoming an American institution. Mr. Fuller's advice to salesmen: \\"Know your product well and it will sell itself.\\" \\n\\nMr. Fuller died 18 years ago. In 1968 the company was sold to Consolidated Foods Corporation, which later became Sara Lee Corporation, and moved to Winston-Salem, N.C. Last year, the company was sold again, to Lee and Besty Turner of Great Bend, Kan., who renamed the company Fuller Industries.\\n\\nIn the old days, Fuller Brush salesmen depended on finding housewives at home. But with many women now out working, Fuller representatives sell products at their other jobs and work the telephone, calling first and rarely soliciting business by just knocking on doors, Mrs. Berman said.\\n\\nMrs. Estremera, for instance, had a paperboy deliver a few of her brochures, while Mr. O'Brien handed out catalogues at the post office, taking orders after business hours. \\n\\nWithin the last few years, the company has added a mail-order catalogue and several stores in Texas, Alabama and Michigan.

The children who were left behind in hiding learned quickly not to talk about the deportations, never to ask why they occurred or when their parents would return. For most the silence has been endless, the French psychiatrist Claudine Vegh writes. As adults they do not discuss the war: ''It is taboo.''\\n\\n''I Didn't Say Goodbye,'' published in France in 1979, is an extraordinary collection of interviews with 17 French men and women who lost one or both parents in the deportations - and never talked about it. They agreed to be interviewed by Mrs. Vegh because she is one of them. Her father was deported, and talking to her was like ''giving blood to a friend,'' as one man explains. But most could only tell their stories in darkened rooms; they spoke in monotones and whispers, often with their backs to her. These interviews, which have been gracefully translated by Ros Schwartz, are like monologues. Talking about their war experiences for the first time, these people seem to be talking to themselves, exorcising memories they have never been able to share.
