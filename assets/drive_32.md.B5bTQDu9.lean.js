In THE GAME THAT WAS: The George Brace Baseball Photo Collection (Contemporary, $35), Richard Cahan and Mark Jacob, two editors at The Chicago Sun-Times, have taken photos from Mr. Brace's collection of hundreds of thousands of negatives (most of them made by Mr. Brace himself) and organized them into the kind of offbeat categories -- sluggers, players wearing glasses, players with funny names -- that card collectors love. The authors chose only black-and-white images taken from 1929 through 1960, and they provide ample baseball lore in their captions. Mr. Brace, who was born in 1913, documented many aspects of baseball, but his portraits and his grand views of the Chicago baseball parks, where he was based, hold the most interest. His best portraits are distinguished by the openness and humor of the  players' faces","excerpt":"his images are suggestive of rural America of years past. In his close-ups, the visors of the head-hugging baseball caps serve to frame the faces, drawing the viewer into the animated exchange between photographer and subject. Yogi Berra becomes all grins and ears, Carl Hubbell's intense stare is  riveting, and the young Ted Williams radiates self-assurance. When Mr. Brace turned his viewfinder toward Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park, the ball fields were rendered as vast, almost sacred places. Altogether, the book has the feel of a family album -- an intimate and glowing view of a comforting past.

It opened yesterday, already bearing the laurels of a hit in its native France.But the film as presented by André Cayatte, the lawyer-turned-director, is both fervent in its espousal of a strange, tragic love affair and precise in its spotlighting of the vagaries of the law. His love story and the law's intransigence are compelling and stark as befits an adult view of a shattering experience.In essence, Mr. Cayatte is relating (as a complete flashback) the true saga of a 32-year-old high school teacher, who quite naturally and tenderly falls in love with a pupil, a tall, handsome, bearded 17-year-old, who appears to be a good deal more mature than his years.His parents charge her with seducing a minor despite his insistence on continuing their relationship. And it evolves basically as the story of her jailings","excerpt":"his incarceration in psychiatric clinics and schools and with relatives. By these methods, the lovers are kept apart legally (although they manage clandestine, bittersweet meetings) until, in final desperation, she commits suicide.As the creator of such memorable features as \\"Justice Is Done\\" and \\"We Are All Murderers,\\" Mr. Cayatte this time was inspired by the actual case that was a \\"cause scandale\\" in 1969, involving Gabrielle Russier, a Marseilles school teacher, and her lover, Christian Rossi. The story was detailed in \\"The Affair of Gabrielle Russier,\\" the book published here last year.The director has switched his locale to Rouen and he has made other changes. The young man's parents, for example, are seemingly bourgeois, adamant bookstore owners in the film whereas they were actually teachers, as was Gabrielle Russier herself. And, although her divorced husband remained close to her during her trials, he only appears fleetingly in the movie.Through the performances, direction and intelligent dialogue, what could have been a treacly romance becomes a tale of genuine love, implied sex, stultifying despair and a compassionate observation of man's inhumanity to man.In Annie Girardot, \\"To Die of Love\\" has its most valuable asset. Hardly the classic personification of beauty, she nevertheless projects the feeling of an intelligent girlish woman rediscovering love, ready to sacrifice herself for it. And she subtly conveys a change to despair as she is buffeted by legal ploys she cannot comprehend and by the destruction of her teaching career. It is an understated and forceful portrayal.Bruno Pradal, a newcomer who is reminiscent, of the late Gérard Philipe, is equally memorable as her lover, boyish yet grown, a man affected by mental and physical turbulence he cannot fully comprehend but is ready to conquer at all costs.Mr. Cayatte also has derived natural performances from François Simon and Monique Melinand, as his parents; Claude Serval as a magistrate, and, among others, a covey of young, intense \\"pupils\\" who look as though they're ready to take part in another student protest.A poster in the modern living room of Miss Girardot's film \\"home\\" proclaims a Paul Valéry phrase, \\"living is a state of mind.\\" Mr. Cayatte and his convincing company may confuse us by not presenting us with the official source material, but the film delves deeply and often movingly into the states of mind of both the obdurate lawmakers and the tragic principals.

Mr. Jannings has contributed a number of excellent performances to the screen and until this present offering he has not been seen in any picture that did not possess considerable merit. He was splendid as Louis XV in \\"Du Barry,\\" known over here as \\"Passion\\"","excerpt":"his interpretation of the old porter in \\"The Last Laugh\\" was an achievement; his characterization of Peter the Great was powerful; his portrait of the bank clerk of German origin in \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" possessed no end of imagination; he was fine as Stephen Huller in \\"Variety.\\" Then, in his previous picture, \\"The Last Command,\\" he not only gave a most forceful performance but he lent to the rôle of the Russian General the traits of a fallen aristocrat, both in expression and gesture.In \\"The Street of Sin\\" Mr. Jannings is for the first time out of his element, for evidently his knowledge of London's underworld is limited. As Basher Bill he endeavors to live up to the coarseness of this artificial yarn, which strikes one as having been inspired by Thomas Burke's \\"Limehouse Nights.\\" The strength of Mr. Burke's short stories was in his remarkably faithful description of the persons and of the district. He even studied the spelling of the pronunciation of the dark characters of Limehouse. \\"The Street of Sin,\\" which is accompanied by some of Albert Chevalier's old costermonger songs and \\"Old Chinatown,\\" from the first Charlot Revue, was said some time ago to be a story of Soho, but on the screen the district of London remains unnamed. It does not bring to mind any spot of the English metropolis any more than Basher Bill rings true as an English type. Aside from his actions, Mr. Jannings is too well shaven to look like a cockney crook. A mustache might have helped matters and also a soft pedal on some of the actions; not that London's burglars are any better than the burglars of any other country, but one might spend many a sleepless night in the dives and dens of Limehouse, Lambeth, White-chapel or Soho without ever seeing a suggestion of any of the incidents depicted in this picture.Even to those who may not appreciate the weaknesses of the characterizations and the inaccuracy of the atmospheric effects the story itself is none too inviting. It is a lumbering affair that might have been told in one reel instead of six. There is a Salvation Army lassie, impersonated by the charming Fay Wray, who is hardly the type of girl that would be sent with one timid and frail man on a mission to such a district. She is a theatrical Salvation Army girl who has not missed an opportunity to make herself attractive. The beauty of this young woman causes the renowned Basher Bill for the time being to renounce his pals and help in the Salvation Army shelter. He is so infatuated with Elizabeth, the gentle Salvation Army worker, that he deserts the frowsy Annie, with whom he has been living.Mauritz Stiller, who looks at London through Swedish glasses, fancies that piles of bank-notes are to be found on Hampstead Heath or not far from it. There is a burglary there and the malefactors come away with a wad of money. Mr. Stiller does not trouble to show the burglars traveling from their retreat, where-ever it is, to Hampstead, which would probably make one of the most interesting stretches in the picture. Neither does he give the slightest idea how they return to their hangout. They flit in this film to Hampstead and then, after a fade-out, come back to count up the haul.To show his strength, and Mr. Jannings is exceptionally powerful, Basher Bill holds arm high the Salvation Army man, the poor chap not being permitted to struggle while he is in Basher Bill's clutches. It is in this same \\"pub\\" that Elizabeth goes around soliciting money with her tambourine, and Mr. Stiller decides to have some of the disgusting crew expectorate in the instrument while another man gives this attractive girl the remnants of his cigar.Mr. Jannings's acting is sometimes as forced as the chronicle. He is fierce and forbidding, cruel and coarse, and the character always seemed strained.A Distressing Chronicle.In \\"Dawn,\\" a British production, Sybil Thorndike, one of the really fine artists of the English theatre, gives a sterling and disgnified impersonation of Edith Cavell. The picture itself is quite cleverly produced; in fact, it is easily the outstanding achievement to come from Great Britain, sad and painful chronicle though it is. It is a film that ends with a flash of Miss Cavell's grave, and the suggestion of the shooting of Miss Cavell (the actual scene has been excluded) is another of the depressing incidents.This picture begins with glimpses of Miss Cavell's hospital in Brussels. The actual scenes are shown in some instances, the exteriors having been filmed in the Belgian capital. Some of it is done extraordinarily well, although there are times when the settings appear to be cramped, especially in those passages depicting the fugitives awaiting a chance to steal away with the assistance of Nurse Cavell and Mme. Bodard and Mme. Rappard.Mr. Wilcox tells his gruesome story with proper suspense and he depicts adroitly the dread of discovery. Except for a few instances, he portrays the Germans in sensible, restrained fashion, some of them being filled with sympathy for Miss Cavell. But although this film holds the attention it is a grim, disheartening echo of the war. And it should be remembered that Miss Cavell's last words were:\\"Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness for any one.\\"In a letter regarding this picture, Lord Birkenhead wrote:\\"Does any one suppose that the woman who, at the very moment of her agony, could speak like this [referring to her last utterance] would permit her death to be commercialized, with the certain result that the bitter memories associated with it would be kept alive and fertilized so as to prevent the sweet restoration of friendship and good relationship between the nations of the world?\\"A Mechanical Story.WITH all its possibilities for a picture, Herbert Brenon has fashioned from \\"Laugh, Clewn, Laugh!\\", the play by David Belasco and Tom Cushing, nothing more than an unimaginative series of scenes, which, although some of them are effective units, leave one cold. It has neither heart nor soul and there are quite a number of absurdly extravagant sequences.In one episode the girl, Simonetta, whom the clown, Tito Beppi, has rescued as a waif, hurts her leg. The young waster, Count Luigi Ravelli, discovers Simonetta and, filled with compassion for her evidently slight injury, he carries her into his palatial house. He does not stop in the drawing room, or the library, but goes all the way to his own room, where, after he has bandaged the injury, he imprints kisses on Simonetta's pretty foot.The dinner party in another scene is a thoroughly moviesque affair, but even such ideas would be pardonable if the action of the drama were more human. The old, old story of Grimaldi comes forth as if it were thought by the producer to be something new, and Nils Asther's portrayal in one chapter of the giggling nobleman is by no means effective. Luigi, through wine and women, is supposed to be in a highly nervous condition and Tito, played by Lon Chaney, has lost his grip on life so that he sobs. They, the laughing count and the tearful clown, go to the same nerve specialist and both are recommended the same prescription—a wholesome love. Simonetta, so it happens, is the girl with whom the young nobleman and the middle-aged clown are infatuated.Rajah Menjou.A LITTLE levity fell on Broadway last week in the shape of \\"The Tiger Lady,\\" wherein the dependable Adolphe Menjou plays an exceedingly amusing part, that of a stage super, named Henri, who falls head over heels in love with the imperious creature who reigns over the show. The background is Paris and the story is farcical, but nevertheless quite intriguing It has moments that are delightful, especially an episode where this super, arrayed in his glittering Rajah's stage costume, invades a restaurant with all the aplomb of an Eastern potentate. He must have a certain table (because it is near the one at which are seated the Tiger Lady and her entourage of a Duke, a Marquis and a Count) and insists that a regular patron of the restaurant, now busy refreshing the inner man, shall resign in favor of himself. Once the man has been prevailed upon to move, Henri, looking like the wealthiest of Rajahs, languidly takes his place. He is a pale Hindu, but that does not influence the Tiger Lady against him. She is, in fact, so interested in this begemmed and turbaned knight of a torrid land that she, after a look or two, goes over to the Rajah's table. Soon her escort joins her and all are impressed by the Rajah's in-difference to everything, except the Tiger Lady.When the waiter hazards offering the Rajah the check, a mere matter of 19,587 francs, the Rajah does not quite conceal the shock. But the Duke, the Marquis and the Count are so eager to foot the bill that the good-natured (for the nonce) Rajah decides that they shall be delighted and forthwith hands them the disturbing piece of paper. He then decamps with the placidly beautiful Tiger Lady, who in the privacy of her apartment confides to Henri, as the Rajah, that what she admires most in a man is courage. Offhand, she says that she tests her suitors by seeing whether they are brave enough to enter a tiger's cage and rescue her immaculate gloves.It is a new angle on Francis R. Stockton's classic, \\"The Lady or the Tiger.\\"Mr. Menjou is admirable as the masquerading super. Evelyn Brent is stunning as the Tiger Lady. MR.

Up to that point Mr. Lin, who was born in Taiwan not quite 21 years ago, had sailed through the challenges of Stravinsky's ''Suite Italienne'' and Beethoven's ''Kreutzer'' Sonata, as well as all but the final minute of the Prokofiev, with no mishaps worse than an occasional raw tone and one or two dropped notes.   In short, his playing had been brilliant in all the accepted senses, as it continued to be once he got his instrument restrung for the final measures of the Prokofiev and three well-chosen, and welldeserved, encores.

J. O'Rourke. Atlantic Monthly, $13.    A political satirist and free-market enthusiast finds much to zing in this animated tour of the global economy, from Sweden's welfare wonderland to Albania's disastrous flirtation with capitalism. The result is ''a delightful collection of anecdotes and one-liners,'' Peter Passell wrote here in 1998.    Collected Fictions  By Jorge Luis Borges.  Translated by Andrew Hurley. Penguin, $16.95.     The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986) was renowned for his strange, knotty fiction","excerpt":"his jewel-like stories -- ripe with labyrinthine imagery, arcane knowledge and mythological overtones -- often resemble cruel fairy tales in which magic is evil and bad deeds routinely go unpunished. This collection, the first complete translation into English of his work in a single voice (that of Andrew Hurley, an English professor at the University of Puerto Rico), ''is testimony to hard labor and devotion,'' Mavis Gallant wrote in the Book Review last year.    Three Continents  By Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Counterpoint, $14.    In this dark novel, wealthy American twins relinquish their freedom and fortune when they come under the thrall of a quasi-religious group called the Fourth World Movement and its leader, a minor Indian king with grand ambitions. ''As a meditation on the twin themes of inheritance and family, 'Three Continents' is a significant achievement,'' Peter Ackroyd wrote here in 1987. The same publisher has reissued one of Jhabvala's earlier novels, Travelers ($14), which tracks the lives of four wanderers -- two English, two Indian -- who meet, judge and fall in and out of love with one another in India. In 1973 our reviewer, Dorothy Rabinowitz, admired the author's ''grace of mind'' and said the book ''compares well with the best social novels in contemporary fiction.''    Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years  of Life on Earth  By Richard Fortey. Vintage, $15.    A British paleontologist combines his own experience with a sweeping knowledge of the facts of life in the first popular but scholarly account of life's history written by a professional. His narrative, selected as one of the best books of 1998 by the editors of the Book Review, ''is not a boring slog through the strata, but an eclectic waltz among organisms at once extraordinary and extinct,'' Jerry A. Coyne wrote here. At the Water's Edge: Fish With Fingers, Whales With Legs, and How Life Came Ashore but Then Went Back to Sea, by Carl Zimmer (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14), discusses the origin of tetrapods and whales, evolutionary events involving creatures with backbones. ''Zimmer does a good job of explaining how profoundly different are the physiological and structural requirements of life in water compared to life on land,'' Philip Gingerich wrote here last year.    The Mourners' Bench  By Susan Dodd. Morrow, $13.    This novel explores the tangled fortunes of two working-class Southern women and the New England teacher with whom they become involved; stung hard by misfortune, the characters rely on courage, irony and humor to pull them through. ''The book finds its considerable power in Dodd's patient excavation of the complex aftereffects of tragedy on the lives of the people who emerge . . . on the other side,'' Elizabeth Graver said here in 1998.    Lindbergh  By A. Scott Berg. Berkley, $16.    This Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Charles Lindbergh, drawing on newly accessible private papers, ''provides enough fresh detail to trace the roots of Lindbergh's personality, its strengths as well as its maddening flaws, all the way back to his turbulent boyhood,'' Geoffrey C. Ward wrote here in 1998. In Under a Wing: A Memoir, by Reeve Lindbergh (Delta, $12.95), Lindbergh's sixth and youngest child recalls a loving, active father who sought a rigidly ordered life and absolute control over events and people. Last year in these pages, Ward called this a ''wonderful family memoir.''    Zarafa: A Giraffe's True Story, From Deep in Africa  to the Heart of Paris  By Michael Allin. Delta, $9.95.    In 1826 the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt sent a 12-foot giraffe to King Charles X of France, and the beast's 550-mile trip from Marseilles to Paris captivated the nation. ''Allin does a terrific job of chronicling the giraffe's remarkable pilgrimage . . . as well as analyzing the profound effect the animal had on the French people,'' Carolyn T. Hughes wrote here in 1998.    My Sister From the Black Lagoon: A Novel of My Life  By Laurie Fox. Scribner, $13.    The narrator of this unusual coming-of-age story is forced to grow up in the shadow of her mentally ill older sister, whose ravings torment her family. ''The novel is honest, entertaining and, in parts, downright wacky,'' Valerie Frankel wrote here last year.    The Extra Man  By Jonathan Ames.  Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.

But the tale of \\"Lola\\" and the peripheral people who cross her path in this microcosm rarely reaches poetic heights. Mr. Demy's sensitivity is strikingly apparent, but his subject matter is closer to soap opera than to powerful, persuasive drama.He is concerned basically with Lola, the seemingly carefree entertainer of a sleazy waterfront cabaret, pining for the father of her young son, who has deserted her. As counterpoint Mr. Demy develops the character of Roland, a disillusioned, young intellectual whom she once knew and who meets her again and falls in love for the first time.There are subsidiary roles for a lonely, middle-aged genteel widow and her teen-age daughter whom he befriends","excerpt":"his landlady, who is seeking her long-lost son and an American sailor, to whom Lola submits because he reminds her of her departed lover.Paths cross here in mazelike fashion, but Mr. Demy's jockeying of his story line smacks more of contrivance than of natural happenstance. He may be forgiven for this on the excuse that it justifies his ends. But the ends are not especially moving except for his glimpses of young people articulately voicing a desperate need for happiness.A tender good-by between Lola and the rootless youth to whom she admits mere friendship, not love, has honesty and impact. Another sad adieu, between the widow and this same troubled youth, is subtle and mature. And scenes in the cabaret, featuring skimpily clad entertainers and American sailors, underline their mechanical, depressing gaiety.As the pitiable belle of the cabaret, Anouk Aimée, who is remembered for her portrayal of the sybaritic, man-hungry heiress in \\"La Dolce Vita,\\" is properly gaily superficial and openly feminine. Honestly eager to be truthful with her admirers, she is nevertheless vulnerable enough to break down in despair at being ill-used by destiny. Her climactic happy reunion with the father of her child, now a rich man anxious to love her and his son, should be strictly satisfying only for afternoon television viewers.Mr. Demy does give this final scene a touch of genuine sadness, however, as he shows his hero walking out of her life in the distance.Marc Michel, as the confuseo young man who adores her, is serious, attentive and understanding in the role. If he is a mite too full of weltschmerz for comfort, it might be attributed to Mr. Demy's script, which permits little opportunity for other emotions. Elina Labourdette is restrained and effective as the well-bred widow trapped by circumstances that frighten her.Alan Scott does well in a few brief scenes as the American sailor, as do Annie Dupéroux, as Miss Labourdette's daughter, and Margo Lion, as the cafe owner who also happens to be the mother of Lola's lost lover.Mr. Demy has directed \\"Lola\\" with an even, professional pace that is creditable. In filming against the waterfront and the highly photogenic balconied streets of Nantes, he has given his film authentic, picturesque touches. His script, however, serious though it is in its effort to take up the cause of trammeled young people, often has a manufactured effect. If \\"Lola\\" is not a-masterwork, its general polish and intent augur a bright future for the 31-year-old Mr. Demy.

Known for such hits of the mid-80's as \\"Cuts Like a Knife,\\" \\"Run to You\\" and \\"Summer of '69,\\" Mr. Adams wasn't exactly making a comeback","excerpt":"his last album was released in 1987. But in those four years between hits, he was rather easy to forget. There was something disposable about his songs, something generic.   At the Ritz on Friday night, Mr. Adams made \\"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You,\\" which is the second-best-selling single of all time, the obvious centerpiece of his set. The lights came down low; the singer mumbled something about a \\"happy accident\\"; the keyboardist, Tommy Mandel, struck a few fat notes on his synthesizer, and women in the sold-out crowd began shrieking as one. The show was carefully paced around the ballads. Mr. Adams opened with a string of uptempo rock tunes -- \\"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\\" and \\"Hey Honey -- I'm Packin' You In!\\" from his latest album, \\"Waking Up the Neighbors,\\" a version of the rhythm-and-blues classic \\"I Hear You Knocking\\" -- that sounded enough like the Rolling Stones in the \\"Sticky Fingers\\" era to be a bit spooky. The only difference was that the relatively clean-cut Mr. Adams and his lead guitarist, Keith Scott, are too polished to miss notes the way the Stones do.   Pounding out tracks like these, wearing a no-frills gray T-shirt streaked with sweat and new-looking blue jeans with the cuffs rolled up, Mr. Adams strove to fit the most basic archetype of a rock-and-roller: unpretentious, hard-working, sincere. Even the title of his new album seems to suggest that he's just a good old boy who wants to have fun.   But what kept his rocker act from being convincing were the ballads. Their unapologetic mushiness and glossy pop production are the antithesis of rock-and-roll. \\"Everything I Do\\" and \\"Thought I'd Died and Gone to Heaven\\" could easily have been hits for Michael Bolton or Whitney Houston, and the raunchy chords and stomping rhythms can't disguise the fact that hits like \\"Somebody\\" and \\"Run to You\\" are hollow at the core. Mr. Adams is all form and no content. His songs are catchy and shallow, like pop. They're neat.

Months, years from now, the pottery you acquire will adorn your table with flowers that will not fade, leaves that will not sere, fruit that will not perish, and will remind you of the pretty towns you bought them in, by sea or mountainside.   Even as you approach them, plates and vases beckon from little shops and stalls. They are an arresting sight, these handmade terracottas; they seem to have captured the sun. They gleam like the fruit and flowers they often represent and may soon hold. Off the road, down ravines and along river beds, is the clay that the potters use, which for centuries was carried up to the villages on oozing, dripping, horse-drawn carts, and now by truck. Nearer the center of these towns, the shops thicken. The town squares blaze with color.  You wonder if there's some festival going on, some fair or special show.

He was going to conduct an ''audit'' at the Yale University School of Medicine: He would spend some hours interrogating and examining the laboratory records of an associate professor there, one of whose published research papers on insulin metabolism had been called fraudulent by another researcher.

The New York Philharmonic deeply mourns the death of Maestro Isaac Stern-renowned violinist, master teacher, beloved colleague and dear friend. Mr. Stern's remarkable career, which spanned more than sixty years, was inextricably linked with the Philharmonic since his debut with the Orchestra in 1944 in a Sunday radio broadcast featuring the Sibelius Violin Concerto, led by Dimitri Mitropoulos. His solo appearances with the Philharmonic numbered more than 100, including the 1960 gala concert led by Leonard Bernstein to benefit Carnegie Hall after its rescue from demolition, an effort spearheaded by Mr. Stern. In 1980 the Philharmonic was honored to celebrate his 60th birthday with a televised concert featuring Mr. Stern as soloist as well as his protegees Pinchas Zukerman and Itzhak Perlman, evidence of the breadth of Mr. Stern's legacy. In 2000, musicians of the Philharmonic also participated in the joyful celebrations marking Mr. Stern's 80th birthday, as well as his 40th anniversary as president of Carnegie Hall. He had most recently appeared with the Orchestra in September 1998 as the special guest soloist for the Philharmonic's Opening Night Concert conducted by Kurt Masur. In recognition of his many decades of outstanding music, as well as his peeless efforts to advance music and its message throughout the world, in 1992 the New York Philharmonic named Mr. Stern an Honorary Member of the Society, the highest honor the organization bestows. From his devotion to saving and sustaining Carnegie Hall to his vital role in the establishment of the National Endowment for the Arts to his enthusiastic dedication to the education of young musicians, Mr. Stern set an exemplary standard for musicians and arts organizations everywhere. He will be greatly missed, but we are grateful for his music, his teaching, and his friendship, lasting legacies that will continue to enrich and instruct us all. The entire New York Philharmonic family-Board, Orchestra, and Administration-extends its heartfelt sympathies and warmest regards to his entire family. Kurt Masur, Music Director Members of the Orchestra Paul B. Guenther, Chairman Zarin Mehta, Executive Director     STERN-Isaac. The Board and staff of Carnegie Hall join the rest of the world in mourning the death of our beloved Isaac. The loss of Isaac Stern for Carnegie Hall is the loss of our musical family's beloved patriarch. Isaac Stern was a great violinist and musician as well as a great educator and communicator. First and foremost, he graced the stage of Carnegie Hall more than 200 times between 1943 and 2000. In the prime of his career, the 39-year-old Isaac Stern devoted himself to saving this building-not only for its acoustics but also for its legendary history and its centrality in the musical world. He persuaded the public sector to buy Carnegie Hall as a crown jewel of the City of New York and the private sector to operate and administer it as a non-profit institution. He has served Carnegie Hall as President of its Board from that first day in 1960 until his death, nurturing its growth for over four decades. For more than 60 years as a professional musician, he appeared on the world's most prestigious concert stages, guided the careers of countless young musicians and devoted himself to the advancement of the arts nationally and internationally. On a personal level, there was no one more stimulating, effervescent or generous in heart. Isaac Stern's indomitable spirit inspired us all and made us all better. If there is any solace to be found in his loss, it is in his extraordinary legacy-a legacy that forms the very foundation of Carnegie Hall today: an uncompromising artistic excellence, an abiding commitment to music education, and an adventuresome spirit that informs all we do. He dared to think big and challenged us to soar-to dream the impossible, take risks, embrace new ideas, and to enjoy our success. Sanford I. Weill, Chairman Robert Harth, Executive and Artistic Director     STERN-Isaac. The Kennedy Center mourns the loss of Isaac Stern, one of the most extraordinary musicians of our time and a dear friend to the Center during its thirty year history. Mr. Stern played an integral role during the Kennedy Center's first year. We will always remember his exceptional skill as a solo violinist with the National Symphony Orchestra in the official opening of the Concert Hall on September 9th, 1971 & two nights later in the Inaugural Founding Artists Concert featuring the Istomin-Stern-Rose Trio, the first chamber music performance to be held in the Concert Hall. He performed with Mr. Eugene Istomin in the first benefit concert establishing the Abe Fortas Memorial Fund and the Fortas Chamber Music Series, and Mr. Stern's extensive contributions as a member of the Fortas Concerts Advisory Board have been essential to the success of the series. He was a treasured guest of the National Symphony Orchestra, making his debut with the NSO in 1949 at Constitution Hall, and he appears with the Orchestra in more than forty concerts. We were proud to recognize Mr. Stern as one of the recipients of the 1984 Kennecy Center Honors, and we will greatly miss his talents, wit, and warmth. James A. Johnson, Chairman Michael M. Kaiser, President The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Leonard Slatkin, Music Director The National Symphony Orchestra     STERN-Isaac. With profound sadness, the Board and staff of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc., mourn the passing of our great friend, musician, humanitarian and national treasure, Isaac Stern. During his more than 60 years on the world's concert stages he was an inspiration to audiences and to all who knew him. Through his leadership he redefined what it meant to be a musician. While he once described Carnegie Hall as ''an affirmation of the human spirit,'' he himself was the incarnation of the human spirit. His vision and energy had a profound impact on the cultural life of this great city, an impact that will be felt for generations to come. He led the fight to save Carnegie Hall confirming New York's position as the capital of the music world. Isaac paid no attention to obstacles in his life's many passions, in particular in his support of the State of Israel and to arts education. He touched countless lives","excerpt":"his legacy is immeasurable. Lincoln Center joins with Carnegie Hall and the global family of music makers and music lovers in mourning his loss.

The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sorrow the passing of our dear friend, the renowned violinist, Isaac Stern, on Saturday, Sept 22nd in New York City at the age of 81. One of the last century's preeminent virtuosos, Mr. Stern's influence extended far beyond the concert stage. He was a cultural activist and educational mentor whose inspired stewardship of Carnegie Hall will be forever cherished. His acclaimed discography and his support as mentor to many of the world's leading concert artists will keep his memory alive for generations to come. His confidence in the arts as a positive force and his abiding affection for New York City will sustain us, especially at this time, as we rebuild our city and reinvigorate our national spirit.

Goodrich, Vice President Concert and Artist Activities     STERN-Isaac. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of Isaac Stern, a towering figure in the classical music world. His untiring efforts to preserve Carnegie Hall in the face of imminent destruction earned our respect and everlasting gratitude, and his deep commitment to his art and his extraordinary gifts as a musician stand as a beacon to all of us. As President of Carnegie Hall, he exercised great influence over New York's musical life, and we are proud that in the years of his leadership, the MET Orchestra began a hugely successful collaboration with Carnegie Hall, giving to this day regular and immensely popular concerts in that great hall. We will sorely miss his inspiring presence and devotion to the cause of great music, but his legacy to our city and the world remains for future generations.

Thankfully, he and his music will live on through his legacies of Carnegie Hall and hundreds of superb recordings. John L. Tishman, and his many friends at Tishman Realty & Construction Co., Inc.     STERN-Isaac. We are so sad as we mourn the death of Isaac Stern. He was truly great and his impact on the world of music will live on as his everlasting legacy. At a time when musicians were busy trying to dazzle, he insisted on something else, something better: a musical rule which demanded that technique be only in the service of the music. He helped to shape our lives by setting the standard for us to follow. He was a mentor who always had time for us, he was a true friend. The world will miss him, we will miss him. Our heartfelt condolences to his entire family. Toby and Itzhak Perlman     STERN-Isaac. The musicians, Board and staff of the Los Angeles Philharmonic mourn the loss of an American hero-Isaac Stern.

Chapman J. Root 2d, an heir of a Coca-Cola bottling empire (his great-grandfather's company designed the classic Coke bottle), bought a modest, funky cottage that was built in the early 1900's as housing for hotel workers (the Breakers is just down the beach). He had no wish to turn the house into a mini Mar-a-Lago. Instead, he called Steven Harris, a New York architect and fellow Floridian who designed a house near Daytona Beach for Root. ''Chapman and I both grew up in north Florida,'' notes Harris, ''and this house has some of that vernacular. He knows that old floors are supposed to slope, and screen doors are supposed to slap when you close them.''     Harris restored the house structurally, and replaced the plumbing and wiring. Otherwise, apart from moving a few interior walls, he did nothing to change several decades' worth of modifications.

It's clear that the raider-turned-executive has been straining to devise a battle plan to protect his $350 million gamble on T.W.A. And now he has a plan, a risky one with outlines that are still emerging. Yet the plan - and Mr. Ichan's actions thus far as chairman of the troubled airline - reveal an executive every bit as daring and ruthless as the more familiar figure, Mr. Icahn the raider.   When he took over T.W.A. earlier this year, after a long and complex series of financial maneuvers, it was clear that the 50-year old Mr. Icahn was in for trouble. The industry was suffering the sting of intense competition, the company's profits had slipped into the red and Mr. Icahn, the aggressive corporate raider who turned his Brooklyn street smarts into a lucrative takeover empire, had never run an airline - or much of anything else - before.

Turner is perhaps best known for his alchemical fusings of fire and water, sky and sea, in spectacular atmospheric images in which solid forms, be they ships or castles, seem nearly to dissolve in light and color. To different critics at different times, his monumental canvases have prefigured a range of later styles, from Impressionism to Abstract Expressionism. But it is not the more familiar, grand pictures -- of Parliament on fire or Trafalgar battleships -- that are the main subject of this small and charming book, TURNER ON THE THAMES: River Journeys in the Year 1805 (Yale University, $45). Instead, David Hill, an art historian at the University of Leeds, takes the reader on an intimate excursion into a small domain within Turner's work -- the many beautiful, serene sketches he made of the Thames in his first years at Syon Ferry House, which had a view of the river. During that time, Turner escaped from the entangled politics of London's art world, where the Royal Academy was marooned in petty disputes, to paint alfresco on the riverbanks. From his boat, he made oil paintings as well as watercolors","excerpt":"his lustrous oils are delightfully sensuous, with brush marks in thin paint following the grain of the mahogany boards. With an imagination primed with verses by Virgil and Dante (Turner had also been trying to write poetry), the painter transformed many of England's plain and rustic spots into classic idylls, as in \\"Isis\\" (1806). Painted at Weymouth, the canvas depicts an elegiac vista of arching trees silhouetted against a golden Italianate sky, with a silvery thread of water winding past. But the reader is not forever lost in Turner's ennobling vision; Mr. Hill's animated and meticulous descriptions of Turner's working methods, often including a contemporary photo of the landscape pictured, provide the perfect counterpoint to the artist's dreamy impressions of a great river on its seaward journey.\\nSIRI HUNTOON IN SHORT: NONFICTION;\\nDown by the Riverside"},{"year":"1929","title":"King's horse wins Prince of Wales Stakes KING'S HORSE WINS ROYAL ASCOT RACE","excerpt":"His Lyme Regis Captures the Prince of Wales Stakes as Meeting Opens.

The show opened with a projection of Mr. Murphy's most recent album cover, \\"Holy Smoke\\" (Beggars Banquet/RCA), onto a screen at the front of the stage. An invisible keyboardist played a surreal instrumental introduction. Mr. Murphy stepped in front of the screen, and as the band struck up \\"You're So Close,\\" from \\"Holy Smoke,\\" he began a weird little interpretive dance. He held his arms straight out, crucifix-style, and wiggled them like waves. He stuck out his chest like a ship's figurehead. He moved his face in and out of the light like a mechanical fish. If Mr. Murphy hadn't seemed so deadly serious, he might have made a very funny Monty Python skit.   As it was, Mr. Murphy became increasingly pretentious as the show wore on. The former lead singer of Bauhaus, the early-80's group whose morose theatrics are generally regarded as the apotheosis of the goth movement, Mr. Murphy has allowed his music and stage presence to lapse into a pale imitation of his former self.

The players who contribute the outstanding performances in this yarn of robbery, murder and the death cell are George Bancroft and Clive Brook. Mr. Bancroft portrays the fearless burglar and killer, \\"Bull\\" Weed, and Mr. Brook impersonates a grateful derelict, a man humbled through his steadfast association with John Barleycorn.Although there are several episodes in this picture that could have been improved upon by a little more thought and study, it is a compelling subject, one that has a distinctly original vein. It was directed by Josef von Sternberg, who gained notoriety by his work on that disagreeable production \\"The Salvation Hunters.\\" Here, however, largely through the competent work of Messrs. Bancroft and Brook, Mr. von Sternberg gives a better idea of his powers as a director. While Mr. Bancroft's acting is possibly not quite as intriguing as it was in James Cruze's film \\"The Pony Express,\\" this stalwart player is nevertheless so well suited to his part that one does not care so much about his guffawing when a smile would be more effective.\\"Bull\\" Weed is feared by all who know him, especially by \\"Buck\\" Mulligan, the oily rascal who camouflages his nefarious activities by spending some of his time in a florist's shop. \\"Bull,\\" one can imagine, has a voice like thunder and a temper like the animal from which he derived his sobriquet. To flirt with \\"Bull's\\" girl is just asking for a bullet through the heart, for \\"Bull,\\" a well-dressed crook, like \\"Wild Bill\\" Hickok, is wont to shoot from the hip. He is a burglar with a sense of humor who smiles when others might frown, but his smile may be caused by the pleasure anticipated over the idea of snuffing out a life, robbing a bank or grabbing a diamond necklace.You see him in one scene smiling meaningly as he gazes at an electric sign of the \\"A. B. C. Investment Company,\\" over which flash the words:\\"The world is yours.\\"It is to \\"Bull\\" that \\"Rolls Royce\\" (Mr. Brook), the drink-sodden exlawyer, is grateful. When \\"Rolls\\" was shuffling about without a nickel. \\"Bull\\" pressed a good, thick roll of bills into the astonished derelict's hand. In this part Mr. Brook is always restrained and natural","excerpt":"his make-up, whether his stubby beard in the initial scenes or an idea of a blotchv countenance in others, is most effective. \\"Rolls\\" is as true as steel to \\"Bull,\\" but \\"Feathers,\\" \\"Bull's\\" girl, has eyes for \\"Rolls,\\" that is, after he has pulled himself together. And \\"Rolls\\" is by no means indifferent to \\"Feathers.\\"When \\"Bull\\" puts a bullet through \\"Buck\\" Mulligan and is sentenced to be hanged, \\"Feathers\\" and Rolls\\" scheme to help him to escape. The police get an inkling of what's going to happen and they are prepared, which causes \\"Bull\\" to believe that he has been double-crossed by \\"Rolls\\" and \\"Feathers.\\" In the end \\"Bull\\" is satisfied that they have both done their best to help him.There are a few strained incidents, including one where \\"Rolls\\" dashes across the street when a house is surrounded by police, and another where \\"Feathers\\" publicly wears the diamond necklace that \\"Bull\\" had that afternoon stolen with other valuables from a jeweler's. The story, however, contains a good deal of sound drama.Evelyn Brent is very attractive and she gives a capable performance as \\"Feathers.\\" Sometimes Mr. von Sternberg shows that he is too fond of posing her looking away from the persons with whom she is supposed to be conversing, but that is his fault. Larry Semon springs into this story as a comic character, but his efforts are a monkey wrench in the machinery.John Murray Anderson's stage presentation, \\"Tokio Blues,\\" is an exceptionally artistic piece of work.

Ryan, the former governor of Illinois, says, referring to his state's past record in imposing the death penalty. This important, sometimes heartbreaking documentary is about Mr. Ryan's decision, just before leaving office in 2003, to commute all death sentences in his state, saving the lives of more than 160 inmates. It all started when some journalism students from Northwestern University decided to try to prove the innocence of condemned men as a class project (yes, a class project) and succeeded. Mr. Ryan appointed a commission (above) to study Illinois's criminal justice system, and their findings were devastating. Katy Chevigny and Kirsten Johnson directed.    HE YES MEN (2003)  Tuesday at 8 p.m. on Showtime and Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. on Showtime 2  Mike Bonanno and Andy Bichlbaum (top, with Mr. Bonanno) have a rather low opinion of the World Trade Organization. But when they created a Web site to make fun of the group, it was mistaken for the real thing and the two men were soon accepting international bookings as W.T.O. spokesmen.

SOME CAME RUNNING (1958)  Saturday at 8 p.m. on TCM  This was steamy drama for its day, based on James Jones's novel and directed by Vincente Minnelli (who didn't always do musicals, you know). Frank Sinatra stars as Dave Hirsh, a gifted but unsuccessful author just back from the war. In his Indiana hometown, he embarrasses his respectable jeweler brother (Arthur Kennedy), hangs out with a professional gambler named Bama (Dean Martin), submits a story to The Atlantic and finds himself conflicted by that good-girl-bad-girl thing that was so big in the 1950's. Martha Hyer plays an icy blond schoolteacher who melts a little with Dave. Shirley MacLaine (left, with Sinatra and Martin) is the tramp, who drinks too much, does her nails at the bar and loves Dave so much that she decides to settle down in his hometown (there are good jobs at the brassiere factory). Ms. MacLaine injects real poignancy into what could have been a laughably stereotypical role, but her character still has to be punished for being sexual.

His records are played automatically by radio stations and scrutinized by critics, and he has had more than a dozen hit singles. Tour after tour, he has sold out the world's largest auditoriums. In the 1980's, he emerged - for better or worse - as the primary influence on scores of young American and British rock singers, who copied his haircuts, wardrobe, vocal phrasing and air of deeply committed irony. Right now, no doubt, imitations of Mr. Bowie's latest album, ''Tonight,'' are in the works.    Yet despite his impact, and the fact that his albums invariably turned a profit, Mr. Bowie did not become one of rock's multimillion-selling acts in the 1970's.

By ALEXANDER THEROUX   Cape Cod - a gull's view instantly shows it a patchwork quilt of marshes, beaches, heather, forest, bog, salt pond and sea - means many things to many people. Throughout the length of that sickleshaped peninsula of Massachusetts, there is a marked difference - in style, if you will -between one town and another, between one community and another and between sub-groups even within these. These distinctions are sociologically diagnostic, and even the most casual visitor - even the day-tripper -will soon come to know them.   Now there are 15 towns in Barnstable County - with Barnstable and Falmouth the largest towns - and these, taken all together, constitute the entire Cape, whose year-round population of 150,000 (it was half that in 1960) swells in the peak months of July and August to close to 500,000 with an influx of tourists -the locals call them ''sea gulls.'' These flocks of visitors bring with them interests as varied, each to each, as one from another. It's pretty subjective, all in all.

The orchestra, with an operating budget of $22.5 million, has a projected annual deficit of $3 million.

And he is playing them all.    \\"Richard is looking back at his working-class life -- his father was a truck driver","excerpt":"his mother is a secretary -- not in anger, but with affection,\\" said Jonathan Slaff, a spokesman for the new play. \\"He has no social or political agenda.

The ad, a 30-second spot, will be shown on cable and network television and will run through Aug. 29. Mr. Weiner is spending $686,178 to show it.    PRODUCER -- GMMB.    ON THE SCREEN -- The ad opens with Mr. Weiner standing over a manhole cover outside his childhood home in Brooklyn, and hitting a Spaldeen down the street with a stickball bat. There are also scenes of Mr. Weiner speaking to a group of people","excerpt":"his mother, Fran, teaching at Midwood High School; and a slow zoom in on a photo of the candidate standing with Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, his former boss. The middle scenes show Mr. Weiner describing his proposals to cut taxes 10 percent for the middle class, raise taxes on high earners, pay teachers more and cut government waste. The ad ends with Mr. Weiner back on his childhood street.    THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Weiner, standing over the manhole cover, narrates the beginning of his ad, telling viewers, ''When we played stickball growing up, this was home plate.'' A narrator then takes over, saying: ''Anthony Weiner. From middle-class Brooklyn, his mom was a public school teacher. As an aide to Chuck Schumer and as congressman, he's fought for our neighborhoods. Now, he's the only candidate for mayor who will cut middle-class taxes.'' Mr. Weiner then reappears, saying: ''If you make $150,000 or less, you get a 10 percent tax cut. We pay for it by asking multimillionaires to pay a little more and by slashing waste. And in our schools, we'll raise teachers' pay and bring back discipline. Real ideas for real people.''    ACCURACY -- It is misleading for Mr. Weiner to claim that he is the ''only candidate for mayor who would cut middle-class taxes.'' Although the congressman is alone among the Democratic hopefuls in proposing a cut to the city's income tax rate for middle-income earners, City Council Speaker Gifford Miller has proposed a tax credit equal to 3 percent of annual rent to all households that make less than $100,000 a year but do not qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit. Moreover, New York City mayors do not alone have the power to change the city's tax structure. Mr. Weiner's tax proposal, like those advanced by other mayoral contenders, would have to be approved by Albany.    SCORECARD -- By emphasizing his biography and focusing on what he would do as mayor -- rather than highlighting specific past accomplishments -- Mr. Weiner's ad plays it safe. But the ad is not intended to win arguments or deflect specific criticisms that Mr. Weiner has faced during his campaign. Rather, it is intended mainly to introduce the candidate, who is the least well known of the four Democratic contenders, to primary voters, emphasizing aspects of his life and platform that the campaign hopes will appeal to middle-class New Yorkers who live outside Manhattan.

Mr. Amy is a disciple of Pierre Boulez","excerpt":"his music partakes of the rigor, severity and complexity, and also in some measure of the assurance, invention and grace, of his mentor's.     But the assurance of this work is in the expression of revulsion, shock, despair and undefinable yearnings. Mr. Amy's composition combines taped narration and electronic sounds (the composer was at the controls Monday) with a live soprano (Fusako Kondo) and a complex battery of percussion (Gaston Sylvestre) and piano (Carlos Alsina).    The text - its meanings and the actual sound of its words being read - dominates for most of the piece, and not knowing the poem well in French made it hard to maintain engagement with the music through its 45-minute span Monday night. Listening to the recording afterward with a translation in hand revealed powerful correspondences and images. In this Mr. Amy's work is different from, say, Mr. Boulez's ''improvisations'' on Mallarme, where a musical beauty draws one in, and is only enhanced by learning the texts.

But if the Hall of Fame succeeds, it will have spurned the wishes of the late Bart Giamatti, the commissioner who suspended Rose, that the defrocked Cincinnati Reds' manager be voted upon like any other eligible candidate.   Whether baseball's brassy collector of 4,256 hits deserves to be bronzed at Cooperstown is not the issue now. That continuing controversy is scheduled to be debated in 1992.   No, the issue now is that the Hall of Fame, suddenly but not subtly, has decided to review its eligibility guidelines. If its board of directors decides that someone serving a lifetime suspension from baseball should not be eligible for a Hall of Fame vote, Rose would find himself outside a Cooperstown door that might never be opened to him.   Equally transparent is the Hall of Fame's fear that, if Rose were to be elected, his presence on the Cooperstown stage might embarrass Commissioner Fay Vincent, who presides over the induction ceremony.   But throughout Vincent's reign as commissioner, he has always talked about doing things \\"the way Bart would have done them.\\" And after announcing Rose's lifetime suspension on Aug. 24, 1989, Giamatti was asked how the ban would affect Rose's candidacy when Jack Lang, the executive secretary of the Baseball Writers Association of America, mails the 1992 ballot to some 450 voting members.   \\"When Pete Rose is eligible, Mr. Lang will count the ballots, and you,\\" Giammati said, pointing toward those voting members at the news conference, \\"will decide whether he belongs in the Hall of Fame.\\"    Despite all of Rose's sins against baseball and the Internal Revenue Service, he deserves the opportunity to be voted upon. If he doesn't poll the necessary 75 percent of the ballot, so be it","excerpt":"his name goes on the 1993 ballot. If he's elected, so be it. If the commissioner is embarrassed, so be it.   But judging by Giamatti's words, if he had lived to preside at Rose's induction as the commissioner, he sounded as if he would have accepted and tolerated it rather than being embarrassed by it.   If Rose were elected in 1992, he might even decide not to attend the induction ceremony at which Tom Seaver, as a 311-game winner, is expected to be bronzed in his first year on the ballot. Remember that when the Reds played the annual Hall of Fame game the day after the 1989 induction during Giamatti's investigation of Rose's gambling habits, the Reds' manager chose not to accompany his team to Cooperstown.   \\"Pete has told me,\\" Jack Lang said, \\"that he wouldn't do anything to detract from Seaver's induction.\\"   But with the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum apparently scheming to undermine Rose's eligibility by attempting to review its guidelines, it seems fair to ask: exactly what is the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum and where does it get its authority?   More than anything else, it's a romantic red-brick shrine to nostalgia and memorabilia that has prolonged the weakly documented theory that in 1839 Abner Doubleday, later a Union general during the Civil War, invented baseball in Cooperstown, N.Y.   When baseball decided to celebrate its centennial in 1939, Stephen C. Clark, a Cooperstown millionaire who had accumulated his wealth with the Singer Sewing Machine Company, donated the land for the Hall of Fame, thereby inspiring the first baseball writers' vote in 1935 that elected Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson as charter inductees. Its current president is Edward W. Stack, the administrator of the Clark estate.   Its 206 members have been elected by the Baseball Writers Association of America, a Veterans Committee that considers executives, managers and umpires along with deserving candidates that were not elected by the writers, and a committee on the old black leagues.    According to Lang, the Hall of Fame has never complained about the procedure or the results of the writers' vote despite its inherent controversy. But not long ago Stack informed Lang that the guidelines of the Veterans Committee needed to be reviewed. In its inconsistency, the Veterans Committee in 1989 reportedly produced enough votes to elect Vic Willis, a 248-game winner who pitched at the turn of the century. But in that year's vote, Willis finished third. Since only two candidates can be elected in any one year by the Veterans Committee, Willis was sidetracked. As if that weren't bad enough, he was shelved in this year's vote.   The Veterans Committee has also chosen not to elect such candidates as Phil Rizzuto, Tony Lazzeri and Leo Durocher while selecting Rick Ferrell, a durable but weak-hitting catcher who had received a total of only five votes on the writers' ballots.   To review the Veterans Committee, the Hall of Fame has appointed a nine-member committee that, coincidentally, will also review the writers' voting procedure. Although the Hall of Fame has no direct connection with baseball, this new committee is connected to the baseball establishment. Its members are Lee MacPhail, Chub Feeney, Dr. Bobby Brown, Bill White, Charlie Segar (once an executive in the commissioner's office), Buck O'Neil (a black league slugger and manager who is now on the Veterans Committee), Stack, Lang, and Frank Dolson, a Philadelphia Inquirer sports columnist.   \\"This committee,\\" Dolson has charged, \\"is just a thinly veiled attempt to keep Pete Rose out of the Hall of Fame.\\"   But if Pete Rose had the right to defend himself against the commissioner's investigation and the right to his day in court against the I.R.S., he deserves the right to be on the Hall of Fame ballot. Bart Giamatti even agreed with that.

As a cautionary paradigm of the fickle, brutal ways of our culture's star system, Inge's life may have a tragic dimension. It remains to be seen whether the sentimental realism of his work will ever again be in fashion, except on television. Perhaps there is a case to be made for ''Top of the Stairs'' and its immediate predecessors, ''Picnic'' and ''Bus Stop.''

It is a study of a beleaguered democracy in the dark days after the Nazi Austrian putsch, in the still darker days after Munich. It ends with the betrayal of the republic, with the streets groaning under the dirgeful tread of bewildered men and women marching, singing, sobbing, protesting, looking forlornly for a leader. Mr. Kline went no further, nor had he need to: the things he had shown forecast the future. A separatist movement, dismemberment—these already were on the horizon.Mr. Kline and his crew have succeeded remarkably, where most documentarians fail, in stating the issues and taking their own stand without forgetting the objectivity that is the primary attribute of good reporting, whether it be with words or pictures. His camera is dispassionate","excerpt":"his narrative text, written by Vincent Sheean and spoken by Leif Erickson, is expository rather than exhortatory. His film is no less bitter toward Hitler and Henlein, no less accusatory in its summary of the Pact of Munich; but it is an adult bitterness, an adult indignation grounded on the pictorial material at hand and it does not stoop, as most documentaries do, to childish hissing and name-calling. Facts invariably speak more eloquently for themselves than any one can for them.What are the facts of \\"Crisis\\"? Nothing probably not already known. Mr. Kline makes no great revelations. He studies the maps after Anschluss and observes, with Bismarck, that Bohemia is the key to Europe. He considers, with his camera's aid, the growth of the Henlein Sudeten party before it became outspokenly Hitlerite and then pounces on the State funeral at which Henlein walked, flanked by two German military attachés, and he observes the wreath bearing the ribboned name of its donor, Adolf Hitler. He wonders whether it is true, as Henlein claimed, that the Sudeten Germans were unrepresenestablishested in government, schools trade unions and press. He establishes graphically that they were not. He goes to the polls on election day, to party rallies, to scenes of riot, to the bristling frontier, to Berchtesgaden, to Munich and back.He has achieved, in brief, a con-cise, complete, obviously authentic and extraordinarily graphic record of a significant and tragic historical event—all of which is excellent from a documentary point of view. But he has also—and this is of equal importance—created a dramatic beautifully photographed and highly interesting motion picture. Its plot, of course, is absurd: how could any dictator tell England and France where to head in and take over a free country?At the Teatro HispanoSpanish-speaking Harlem has a chance this week to see itself through the eye of a movie camera by visiting the Teatro Hispana. For the transparent plot of \\"La Verbena Tragica\\" (The Tragic Festival) is woven around the life of a family living in that district and many of the \\"shots\\" were made there and incorporated in the completed picture on the West Coast. Charles Lamont gave smooth direction to this Cantabria Films production, which is being distributed by Columbia.Fernando Soler, one of the \\"Mexican Barrymore Family,\\" is entirely convincing as a prize-fighter driven mad with jealously when he returns from a short jail term to find his beautiful young wife (Luana Alcaniz) seriously involved in an affair with his best friend (Juan Torena). The popular Pilar Arcos is excellent as the wife's mother. While the film is well done, its only novelty consists in the ending, something quite different from the usual \\"cliché.\\"At the Polish TheatreIf pretty Elzbieta Barszczewska, one of Poland's most appealing screen actresses, is ever brought to Hollywood she probably will be used in roles calling for plenty of graceful suffering, but no director there would be likely to treat her as cruelly as Henry Szaro does in \\"Dzien Upragniony\\" (The Anticipated Day), the Starfilm production now at the Polish Theatre in lower Second Avenue.The audience is bound to sympathize with Jerzy Sliwinski, as the rich boy, who loses his poor, but honest sweetheart through the machinations of a nasty business enemy (Jacek Woszczerowicz) and the opposition of his parents (K. Junosza-Stepowski and Mieczyslawa Cwiklinska). The whole cast acts well in a rather routine piece.At the 86th St. Garden TheatreA none-too-comfortable auto-trailer (or \\"Wohnwagen\\") plays an important part in \\"Diskretion-Ehrensache\\" (Discretion with Honor), the new UFA comedy, directed by Johannes Meyer, at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre. While the spectators know from the start that the likely young man (Hans Holt) who \\"compromises\\" a madcap heiress (pretty Heli Finkenzeller) during a trip in rural England is a talented inventor and not a gigolo hired for the job, the development of the situation is amusing enough to keep one laughing just the same.Ralph Arthur Roberts, Ida Wuest, Fita Benkhoff, Theo Lingen and Rudolf Platte are prominent in the large and capable cast employed in the making of a minor screen effort.

Trigamy, of course, may be a rather rare social phenomenon, but it's a delightful, legitimate dramatic device in Mr. Germi's hands.Ugo Tognazzi is the hardworking, eternally optimistic hero of \\"The Climax,\\" the story of a musician who attempts to maintain concurrently three idyllically happy households.With the face and physique of a sort of middle-aged teddy bear, Mr. Tognazzi seems the perfect Germi protagonist, so intensely sincere in his mad pursuit of domestic bliss that he is both funny and touching at the same time. When an astonished priest upbraids him for his deception, Mr. Tognazzi can admit with complete conviction: \\"Lies, lies, lies. But not for fun — for the happiness of others!\\"The others, in Mr. Tognazzi's case, are his wife, Renee Longarini, a beautiful and understanding woman by whom he has three children","excerpt":"his No. 1 mistress, Maria Grazia Carmassi, by whom he has two children, and his No. 2 mistress, Stefania Sandrelli, a pretty young harpist, by whom he fathers his last child.Mr. Germi is at his most hilarious and perceptive in detailing the ways in which the joys of maintaining one family can be turned into nightmarish horrors when multiplied by three. There are all those birthdays and anniversaries to remember, to say nothing of shoe and dress sizes and which toys were bought earlier for which child.The ladies, obviously, are a remarkably pliant and understanding lot, though each likes to be reassured of Mr. Tognazzi's affection by telephone several times a day. When his newest mistress asks him to call, as he goes off to work, his cry is one of desperation: \\"Another telephone maniac.\\"This desperation, which increases throughout the film, is the dark side of Mr. Germi's comedy. However, the denouement, though well projected in advance, does not seem so much an inevitable, logical climax as it does a cop-out.Like Mr. Tognazzi, the picture at that point suffers a heart attack.Nevertheless, there has been so much wit and wisdom going before it, so many fine performances and so much rich cinematic detail that the attack is not—as it is in Mr. Tognazzi's case—fatal to the picture. It is, rather, a superficial seizure.

Robert Burns wrote:\\"O wad some pow'r the giftie gie us To see oursels as ithers see us?\\"The answer comes from California, and it is a question whether the Wallaces, the Bruces, the Watts and the McTavishes will smile with any satisfaction upon it. Not that they are intentionally maligned in this story, but that the men from the land of the heather are portrayed with studio-blanched complexions and, in one or two instances, wearing brocaded silk dressing gowns. Marshall Neilan, the director of this celluloid effusion, in his desire to depict Lady Grayle as a plucky person at the eleventh hour of a fast life, shows her ladyship smoking a cigarette before she breathes her last.Ronald Colman is undoubtedly a bonnie actor, but you just know that he never was born to wear a kilt, but he does for a few scenes. He impersonates Donald McAllen, frequently alluded to as a commoner. Donald and the capricious lassie, Lady Gwendolyn, are happy in Scotland until the coming of Prince Carlos of \\"Portugania.\\" This Prince, played by Lew Cody, is a man of many debts and a faithful valet. His creditors see only one way to get back their money, and that is to have the oily gentleman marry a wealthy wife. Lady Gwendolyn (Blanche Sweet) is at first a solid, sincere type of girl, and it strikes one that Donald has too much imagination and too little common sense. After a delightful period in Scotland, Donald goes to France to fight, and when he returns on leave he shows himself extremely gullible in believing the Prince's story to the effect that that more or less delightful debtor is to wed Lady Gwendolyn. The Prince has a photograph of Lady Gwendolyn on which is inscribed, \\"With all my love.\\" It was sent by her to her father. Seeing it convinces Donald.Donald is talking to Lady Gwendolyn, at a ball, when the calculating Prince interrupts them, claiming the next dance. One would imagine that as Donald had been fighting in the trenches Lady Gwendolyn would have made some excuse to rid herself of the company of the persistent Prince. Nevertheless, as the audience is in possession of all the information regarding the happenings, there is hardly a vestige of suspense. It is certain that the Prince will not wed Lady Gwendolyn, but as she becomes such a flighty young woman who gambles in millions of france one feels almost as if Donald ought to be warned.The young hero goes back to France, and as a surgeon makes a great name for himself. He purchases Grayloch, the great estate of the Grayles. When Donald encounters Lady Gwendolyn with the Prince, this young Scottish girl pokes him in the ribs with her parasol. By that time her engagement to the scamp has been announced, more in pique than anything else.There is one sequence in which Lady Gwendolyn over the telephone thanks the Prince for sending her flowers every morning. He asks his valet about this, and the menial asserts that her ladyship received the best flowers obtainable. Mr. Neilan arranges that the valet is seen later stealing the blossoms from a cemetery, a bit of doubtful humor which does not help the story.With the background of Scotland, Mr. Neilan ought to have been able to make a production far stronger than this effort, which at best is only a mediocre diversion. It is true that it has some beautiful scenery and the settings are quite pleasing. There are too many movie ideas. In one stretch in Scotland the indomitable Lady Gwendolyn insists on riding a fractious horse. A runaway would have been enough to please the majority of spectators, but Mr. Neilan ends this sequence in having the horse and rider fall into the river, and then has Donald diving in after the girl.Mr. Colman is quite effective in many of the scenes, but his performance is not as sincere and thorough as the one he gave in \\"His Supreme Moment.\\" Miss Sweet's characterization of the headstrong girl is splendid, spoiled only by the direction and the scenario writer's ideas.

Set in a plush community on Florida's Gold Coast, the novel is centered around the baffling behavior of a ''hypersexual'' 8-yearold, Lucy Bending. As the story opens, Lucy's obsessively affectionate attentions toward older men have become an embarrassment to her parents, and neither her philandering father nor her ostensibly prudish mother admit any knowledge of the source of the child's aberration. Child psychiatrist Theodore Levin is called into the case and - primarily through Levin's interviews with Lucy, her brother and her parents - the trauma that accounts for Lucy's behavior, as well as a raft of information about the dark side of her parents' life and the lives of others in their exclu sive community, begin to emerge.

Each time he says it, Mr. Rasky provides the same kinds of generalized shots of the skyline. It is possible to feel, after a while, that one is getting at least as well acquainted with the Chrysler Building as with Mr. Miller. The less said about Mr. Rasky's visual ingenuity, the better.The film includes excerpts from movie and television productions of some of Mr. Miller's works, timed to the author's comments on each piece","excerpt":"his observations about the ways \\"Death of a Salesman\\" continues to affect audiences are particularly acute. There are also clips from \\"A View From the Bridge\\" (Mr. Rasky provides footage of the Brooklyn Navy Yard) and \\"The Crucible\\" (shots of primitive-looking New England dwellings in the snow). Mr. Rasky has also filmed new material to illustrate a story of Mr. Miller's, and one soliloquy from \\"The Price,\\" although neither snippet is much of a success.Mr. Miller, whose manner is affable and whose remarks are consistently interesting, discusses his childhood, his career, his travels and, very briefly, his perception of Marilyn Monroe. Mr. Rasky, who near the end of the film asks Mr. Miller if he personally has indeed paid A Price, keeps most of his questions mercifully brief.The atmosphere of the interviews is businesslike-bordering-on-friendly, which means that when the camera wanders in for a close look at Mr. Miller's art collection late in the film, the intimacy and curiosity come as a mild surprise. The rest of the documentary seems a lot less actively involved with its subject. The film, which is interesting but not particularly insightful or informative, doesn't have the substance of an inquiry, or an explanation. It's the work of a good listener.

The focus is on clinical views of births, but the total effect is a pastoral vignette as natural and picturesque as the film's snowy landscapes.\\"Front and Back,\\" a succession of postcards backed by narrations of vacationers' messages, made by Lynne Cohen and Andrew Lugg, is a clever idea that succumbs to redundancy. Another 9-minute subject, \\"Frank Film,\\" a collage of biographical animations by Frank Mouris, has been shown here previously. And also seen here last year is Joseph Pipher's 25-minute \\"6344,\\" a moving, yet amusing, record of a Fairfield, Ohio, family and the demolition of their ancestral home.These \\"American Moods\\" may make a slightly flawed film package, but it does captivate the eye and ear and is a tribute to the talents of some sensitive and perceptive movie makers.

Even though WYNY-FM (103.5) is one of the biggest country stations in America, it is pretty much the only game in town, and its playlist is limited to a narrow range of new-fangled contemporary stars.    For a hard-core country fix, listeners should turn to Laura Cantrell's \\"Radio Thrift Shop\\" on WFMU from 1 P.M. to 3 P.M. on Saturdays. Ms. Cantrell moves deep into the heart of honky-tonk, western swing, barn waltzes and rodeo songs. She concentrates on the classic period from the 40's to the 60's, when kings and queens like Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Bob Wills and George Jones ruled the Grand Ole Opry and continuously redefined the style for a changing rural America.    Like the best disk jockeys, Ms. Cantrell is part historian, part fan, part philosopher. While she has an active weakness for big names like Williams and Jones, she also has the breadth of knowledge to unearth plenty of forgotten gems. She is at her most revealing when she emphasizes the women of country: sassy mamas like Kitty Wells and Tammy Wynette, hot rockers like Wanda Jackson, unsung heroes like Molly O'Day and Dale Evans. Country music is a stereotypical bastion of conservatism, but Ms. Cantrell shows that these women were feisty long before feistiness was fashionable.    \\"The Radio Thrift Shop\\" presents country music as a living oral tradition. Ms. Cantrell is happy to throw in the occasional tidbit of juicy gossip: \\"Hubert Davis was a drunk old banjo player around Nashville for a long, long time,\\" she said after playing his ineffable ode to illicit romance, \\"I Know You're Married but I Love You Still.\\" And her taste extends beyond country into folk, blues, gospel and swing. When she juxtaposes a big band tune like Lee Wiley's \\"I've Got a Right to Sing the Blues\\" with Bob Wills's \\"San Antonio Rose,\\" she not only provides appropriate context, but brings unseen connections to light. At its best, country music can be as mean as the blues, as raucous as rock-and-roll, as romantic as the sweetest pop standard. Ms. Cantrell knows this, and she wants to share it. KAREN SCHOEMER SOUNDS OF YESTERDAY    In the wee hours of the morning, when WQEW, \\"the home of American popular standards,\\" ventures a little too far into Barry Manilow and Billy Joel territory, turn your AM dial a few notches to the left to WEVD (1050) and \\"The Danny Stiles Nostalgia Extravaganza.\\" Seven nights a week, from about 11 P.M. to 5:30 A.M., WEVD stands for \\"wonderful, entertaining vintage disks,\\" as Mr. Stiles digs up some of the coolest, strangest, funniest and most obscure recordings of the pre-rock era. He also broadcasts on Saturdays from 2 P.M. to 5 P.M. on WNYC-AM (820).   Mr. Stiles -- who refers to himself variously as the \\"vicar of vintage,\\" \\"the raja of rare records\\" and \\"the doctor of archeological discology\\" -- has a fascination for the forgotten: his area of expertise spans more than 100,000 albums, singles, 78's and old-time radio broadcasts from the late teens through the 50's.    Mr. Stiles, who has been a D.J. for 47 years, owns several different versions of Cab Calloway's \\"Minnie the Moocher,\\" and he remembers when Frank Sinatra was known as \\"The Voice\\" and \\"Swoonatra.\\" He holds names like Connee Boswell near to his heart, and reveres Al Jolson as the king he once was. Sometimes, just for a kick, Mr. Stiles will throw in an old country tune like Ray Price's \\"Crazy Arms,\\" because his program has no boundaries, playlists or limitations","excerpt":"his only guideline is his own idiosyncratic passion for a moment in pop history that is little more than a shadow.   Mr. Stiles's show harkens back to a time when radio was the mouthpiece for a national subconscious. He reads his own commercials for restaurants, pastry shops and plumbing supply stores, and he broadcasts from a make-believe art-deco studio on lower Broadway. Coming through the hazy AM band in the middle of the night, the needle of his turntable scratching through the grooves of ancient vinyl artifacts, he really does seem like the ghost of a lost but grander time.    There is a song that plays at the end of the film \\"The Shining,\\" a wierd, otherworldly tune called \\"Midnight\\" by the Ray Noble Orchestra. Like Jack Nicholson's character in the film, Mr. Stiles sees himself in the past. When he plays \\"Midnight, the Stars and You\\" on his radio show, he brings something long dead back to life. K. S.

Steven Isserlis, the winner of the conservatory's newly established Piatigor sky Artist Award for younger cellists, will play the solo part.

I believe that Harold himself often didn't know whether he was being serious or figurative when he said such things. In any case, he was so handsome and distinctive looking that I sometimes found myself searching my mind for who it was he really resembled -- what star or genius -- only to recognize that the personage I was trying to remember wasn't anyone like Sean Connery or Jimmy Stewart but was Harold Brodkey, a one and only if ever there was one.         Harold Brodkey died on Jan. 26 at the age of 65. He was a tall man, about 6-2, slender, with elegant hands. He had fine features, a large forehead -- the  kind that really does seem to indicate enormous intelligence -- and grizzled, cropped-short hair and a grizzled beard. His face at rest looked a little angry, or at least glum, with the corners of his mouth turning down. In conversation, his expression became animated, and he had a brilliant smile, with a touch of goofiness in his eyes sometimes, and a wonderful chuckle -- a minor explosion of genuine mirth when he was really amused. He generally wore black or other dark colors, and his wardrobe was informal, though in the last five years or so of his life it became pricier looking than it had before. Armani? Wouldn't know. When he walked, his shoulders were a bit hunched, which made him somehow seem even taller, more imposing, just short of looming. When he sat, he draped himself in his chair, inclined back but with his head forward, one long leg crossed over the other. When he spoke with feeling or conviction he often leaned forward, leaned into the discussion, which, even when it was friendly, was often an argument or at least a debate. A great deal of what Harold said took issue, set you straight, provoked, criticized, debunked.

(Three Rivers Press, paper, $13.95.) This is Brite's third novel about the gay New Orleans chefs Rickey and G-man -- partners in business and love -- and we are told that she is at work on a fourth. Can the franchise sustain itself? The answer is yes. To begin with, a high-end restaurant is -- for any competent novelist -- a gift that keeps on giving. The heat, the bickerings and intrigue, the pursuit of perfection, the dodgy money keeping it all afloat: the setting spawns plots. Further, the gentle G-man and his more highly strung partner, Rickey, are distinct but mutually dependent characters, fervently monogamous but with a restlessness in their relationship that keeps things moving. Here, the boys are knocked off balance when their restaurant, Liquor, is given a terrible review, then maintained in their disequilibrium by a curious invitation for Rickey to go to to Dallas and help organize the menu of a troubled fellow chef named Cooper. A decayed charmer and sexual predator, Cooper is a figure of some interest","excerpt":"his palate may still be acute, but his taste for life has coarsened. His rueful but too forgiving sense of himself and his collapsible morals are well caught by Brite.    With Rickey anxiously marooned in Dallas, fending off Cooper, and G-man bossing the kitchen at Liquor, the plot thickens in an unhurried way, and the city of New Orleans -- always a major character -- displays its corrupt and generous heart. Economically written, with only occasional lapses into the blandly ornate style we'll call menu prose -- ''this veal cheek in front of him, shredding at his fork's touch like a tiny pot roast, caressing his tongue with its deep, gelatinous texture and flavor'' -- ''Prime'' is saved from being mere canny careerist fiction by the pleasing complexity of the characters.    THE OPTIMISTS. By Andrew Miller. (Harcourt, $24.) Clem Glass, photojournalist, is living in London in a state of calamitous aftermath; an atrocity he witnessed while on assignment in Africa has emptied his life of meaning. ''It was his heart he needed now and his heart had locked fast the night he had straddled the dead with his lenses.'' Shut down, unable to speak about what he has seen, he gives himself over to random big-city drift, going to the movies in the afternoon and bumping about with prostitutes. A call from his father, with the news that his sister, Clare, has been reclaimed by a depression that first engulfed her 20 years before, sets him moving. He travels north to visit his father at a lay Christian community, a place ''neat as a barracks,'' on a small island, where old men pray and grow vegetables. But the religion of this ''remote and elderly man in a corduroy suit'' -- somehow still looming colossally in the psyche of his daughter -- looks like frail protective magic, and is of no use to Clem. Traveling on and scooping his sister up from the clinic, he removes her to a rural cottage where they both attempt recovery.

Once again Mr. Arliss wins the honors and provides the entertainment for those who go to see the picture.\\"The Ruling Passion\\" is a pleasant comedy. His photography is excellent throughout, for which Harry A. Fishbeck should be given credit, and its settings have been well done by Clark Robinson. Also, some of those in the cast besides Mr. Arliss do satisfactory work, especially Doris Kenyon, Ida Darling, Edward J. Burns and Harold Waldridge. It drags, however, in a number of places, principally, it would seem, because of padding and sequences of scenes not vitalized by any particular meaning as motion pictures. As a whole, it may be said, the picture consists of many bright flashes, with duller stretches between them.Sometimes the flashes come in rapid succession and sometimes they are further apart, but whenever they come they are genuinely enjoyable and well reward the spectator waiting for them. And they are almost invariably due to the work of Mr. Arliss. Like all finished actors, Mr. Arliss is a pantomimist. By what he does and the way he does it, you know what he is feeling, often what he is thinking, and always what kind of character he is. If, in the story, he is supposed to be tired he makes you know that he is tired, not by stock gestures and studied expressions that make you say to yourself, \\"That man is acting as if he were tired,\\" but by giving, with his whole body, such an impression of tiredness that you say to yourslf, \\"That man is tired.\\" Whatever in his character he may be thinking, however he may be feeling, he is convincing. You follow him and feel with him and see with him as long as he is on the screen, because he always means something","excerpt":"his pantomime is always truly expressive.In \\"The Ruling Passion\\" his rôle is that of a tired business man who retires on his doctor's orders, and then finds that, with nothing to do except rest, he is wearing himself out. He feels that he is just waiting for the undertaker, and hasn't long to wait unless he can find something to do that will keep him interested and alive. So, being familiar with automobile engines—he made his fortune by inventing one—he decides to become a mechanic, incognito, and opens a garage. Every day he leaves his luxurious home of idleness, slips away to his garage, gets into overalls and spends the day mending engines and selling gasoline. A contest with an unscrupulous competitor sharpens his interest in his work, and, before long, his doctor tells him how much good his \\"rest\\" is doing him.It's a human story, and humanly done by Mr. Arliss. But why is it called \\"The Ruling Passion\\"-There's nothing passionate in the picture. Theer is a \\"love interest,\\" to be sure, but it is very mild, and, save for the fans, entirely non-essential.

DREAMS of bygone glory dominate the lives of a diverse group of Alabamians in John Logue's intriguing novel, set in the capital city of Montgomery in 1967. The populist Governor, Jesse Stuart, recalls his youthful hopes that his gifts as a baseball hero would lift his family from rural poverty. A cynical newsman, Jack Harris, yearns for the passion and commitment that had distinguished his coverage of the famous bus boycott. A black clergyman, James Boone Jr., guiltily regrets his loss of faith","excerpt":"his parishioner, Arabella Jackson, whose son has died in Vietnam, wants to bury him on a beloved hillside, now annexed to the city's whites-only cemetery. In covering this dramatic story, Jack Harris runs into an even more explosive one: the Governor is secretly selling criminal pardons to secure his family's fortune before news of his mortal illness becomes public.   There is material here for several novels. Mr. Logue, who is the creative director of Southern Living magazine, nicely catches the inky ambiance of the newsroom before the computer terminal took over, and he has created a persuasive narrative voice for Jack Harris, the editor-narrator. Yet the author allows Harris to tell only portions of the story, disconcertingly shifting in and out of third-person narration in ways that sever the dramatic links his complicated tale requires. Moreover, perhaps his experience as the author of three mystery novels has led Mr. Logue to take technical shortcuts in which violent action substitutes for acuity in characterization.   The story is set precisely in January 1967, yet the mood of the novel seems distinctly late 1970's. Harris walks in front of Martin Luther King Jr.'s church on Dexter Avenue, musing about ''a movement now as forgotten as the river,'' without mentioning the great Selma march past that very spot not two years before. Boone complains that the burial of a black soldier shouldn't cause an uproar because ''nobody here wants to think about this war anymore,'' a sentiment that seems totally wrong for Alabama in 1967. Similarly, the police are stern with the surprisingly small number of redneck opponents of the soldier's burial and astonishingly courteous to the black mourners.   As the soldier's family watches his internment, an angry white family scrambles in the clay to remove a coffin from the adjacent plot. Having failed to rouse a violent protest, they have obtained a court order allowing them to open the grave rather than allow their mother to be buried near a Negro. Despite the historical discontinuities of the mood, Mr. Logue has written a powerful epitaph for the social conflict that still gripped Alabama in 1967."},{"year":"1925","title":"Lewisohn Stadium concerts JOHN M.

To be filed under \\"V\\" for Various Varmints with whom we share our transit system, a conversation overheard by S. Gannon on an Upper East Side sidewalk between two women, one of whom has just stepped off a crosstown bus and is wincing with disgust:   Woman One: What's wrong?   Woman Two, trying to bring her cringes under control: I just saw a bug on the bus. I hate when I see a bug on the bus. Have you ever seen a bug on the bus?   Woman One, thoughtfully: No, but I've seen the rats on the tracks.                    . . .       MORNING STRANGERS   There are people I've seen for years   As they buy a buttered roll at the deli,   Walk a spaniel at the corner,   Board the 8:06 bus.   There's the girl who reads hardcover books,   The man who stares intently,   The woman who does the Sunday crossword   With a purple felt-tipped pen.   As they move through the morning routine,   Are they remembering scenes of passion,   Worrying about symptoms or their children,   Or planning the morning's phone calls?   And what do they think about me   When they see me in the morning? -- LEWIS GARDNER                    . . .       Dear Diary:   Two women, friends from the hills -- one Short Hills, N.J., the other, Forest Hills, Queens -- met, as they often did on weekends or school vacations, to patrol the city in search of a cultural adventure. The 50-block walk was invigorating and gave them a chance to catch up on each other's lives and make predictions for the coming baseball season.   As they approached the entrance to the Guggenheim, they spotted the large standing sign announcing that, for budgetary reasons, the museum would be closed on Thursdays. The two women were disappointed, of course, but, undaunted, they did find some interesting art to examine in the museum's gift shop.   Their next plan was to stroll 14 blocks down to the Whitney. The sign on the front doors was readable only at close range: the museum would be closed until the end of February. The ladies' room, however, was open. And the walls leading to it exhibited a small but impressive collection of Edward Hopper paintings.   As they were leaving, one woman asked the security guard to recommend another closed museum. They were up for another New York City challenge. -- SUE GOLDBERG                    . . .

It is set in the last months of the German occupation of France. A doctor in a provincial hospital, a comfortable family man whose aid to the Resistance is a matter of careful balancing, turns into a one-man death squad after a group of drunken and demoralized German soldiers murders his wife and daughter.Prowling through the cellars and back halls of his chateau, where the Germans are bivouacked, the doctor exterminates them messily, one by one. His anguish and desperation are set in a framework of ironic futility: Even while he is going about his mission the Resistance has taken over the village.The movie has a cast, but for all practical purposes it seems to have only one actor in it: Philippe Noiret. Mr. Noiret is a decent actor","excerpt":"his performance as the soft, plump, comfortable doctor whose fire is betrayed only by tiny sparks until it bursts into conflagration is sometimes funny, sometimes moving. It is overdone at times.It is not, however, as horribly, crushingly overdone as the use of the camera by the director, Robert Enrico, makes it seem. The camera virtually never leaves Mr. Noiret's round; puffing face; when it does, it is only to take in a slightly larger view of his round, puffing figure. We are smothered by him.Mr. Enrico's major mistake, however, is in using what must be at least a dozen flashbacks to tell his story. Almost at the beginning, we meet Romy Schneider, as the doctor's wife, burned to a cinder. The flashbacks are a way of seeing more of her, but they are no way to make a movie.Once he has come upon his dead family, the doctor can hardly take a few steps or make a move without everything shifting back to scenes that range from a childhood hunt, to the courting of his wife, to a confusing moment during a village festival in which she takes refuge, for no apparent reason, in a cellar.Whatever coherence or interest the main action might have is shattered by the technique. The intention may be to render even more dreamlike and unreal the doctor's unaccustomed essay into violence; it becomes unreal, all right, and enormously irritating.

Mr. Pryor has a gift for being almost effortlessly amusing, so much so that movie audiences often burst put laughing at the mere sight of him. The first few minutes of \\"Greased Lightning\\" are a little dicey for that reason, until it becomes clear that Mr. Pryor is out to give a coolly sustained dramatic performance, even a rather subtle one. After that, it's smooth sailing all the way.\\"Greased Lightning\\" is a winning biography of Wendell Scott, the first black stock-car racing champion. Mr. Scott started out driving a taxi after World War II, learned his craft by briefly running moonshine in the backwoods of Virginia. By the mid-1960's he was a veteran driver who had won his battles with those white racetrack owners and law officers who once hoped to cramp his style.The film notes this passage of time inexpensively, mostly through everchanging car models and different amounts of talcum powder in Mr. Pryor's hair. But it lavishes a great deal of energy upon tracing Mr. Scott's evolution from a secretive figure, both frightened and exhilarated by his own ambitions, to a hero a little saddened by the fact that his triumphs are mostly behind him. Mr. Pryor is especially successful in presenting Mr. Scott as a man who guards his energy and intelligence carefully, betraying very little to his enemies and saving a great deal for the moments that matter.Michael Schultz, the erratic and innovative black director responsible for both the verisimilitude of \\"Cooley High\\" and the jive of \\"Car Wash\\" is this time at his most quietly telling, as he incorporates a warm sense of Mr. Scott's family ties into a broader, slightly harsher portrait of the era in which he came to maturity. The film perceives a symbiotic relationship between black and white cultures of the day, and it presents racism almost matter-of-factly, as a by-product of cross-cultural confusion.In one scene, Mr. Scott became so furious that he calls a white man a \\"nigger.\\" Beau Bridges, as a white driver who taunts Mr. Scott at their first meeting, is shown to be an all-around sorehead who uses racism as a convenient outlet for his otherwise-undirected rage. He and Mr. Scott soon become fast friends, the early trouble between them apparently forgotten. In one of the film's most crowd-pleasing episodes, they use a steak dinner and a Confederate flag to hold at bay a restaurant full of white patrons, who clearly find Mr. Bridges' character the more dangerous and unsavory of the two.Mr. Bridges has been giving all the right performances in all the wrong movies lately, but this time he comes into his own","excerpt":"his performance here, which recalls his brother Jeff's in another movie about a racing driver, \\"The Last American Hero,\\" has a crackling vitality, especially when he banters with Mr. Pryor. Mr. Schultz has taken chances in his casting, with performers ranging from Julian Bond to Richie Havens, but everyone does.Cleavon Little is especially effective as Mr. Scott's friend and confidant. Pam Grier, as Mr. Scott's preternaturally patient wife, manages at times to make herself seem almost inconspicuous, which constitutes a triumph of willpower over natural assets even more impressive than that of her costar.\\"Greased Lightning\\" is rated PG (\\"Parental Guidance Suggested\\"), partly because of the words that are tossed around when tempers flare, and partly because of the sweet, low-key sexual chemistry that seems to exist between Mr. Pryor and Miss Grier.

Donald Calthrop is completely out of his element as the young man's valet, a part which should have been more laugh-provoking than it is.

Professor and former chairman of the Geography Department at the University of Texas, died on March 30 in Austin at age 64. He first joined the UT faculty in 1963 and over the years served the University in several capacities. From 1973 to 1979 he was Director of the distinguished UT Center of Middle Eastern Studies, and Professor English had earlier established his reputation as an expert on Iran and Afghanistan. His 1966 book, ''City and Village in Iran,'' won the Herfurth Award, and in 1977, at the age of only 41, he was given a Golden Medallion for ''outstanding contributions to Iranian geography'' by the Association of Iranian Geographers. He was also an extraordinary and charismatic teacher. His introductory course in world cultural/regional geography, which he taught at UT for 35 years, became legendary among UT undergraduates. Innovatively taught, with abundant visual and auditory aids, the course was the subject of an article in ''Alcalde,'' the UT alumni magazine, as early as 1968 and was instrumental in Dr. English being named one of the most outstanding college teachers in America by ''Change'' magazine in 1978. Each semester saw hundreds of UT students enrolled in this class. Its legacy lives on as part of their education and in two widely used textbooks, at the college and high school levels. Upperclass and graduate students perhaps treasure most highly his seminar in the Geography of Religion, a course that many found truly inspirational. Paul also helped launch the Oxford Summer Program in Geography, in which UT undergraduates and graduate teaching assistants spent six weeks exploring the wonders of England. Paul was a frequent participant in this program and was particularly drawn to Glastonbury, where his Celtic spiritual heritage remains so pervasive. Born February 20, 1936, in Worcester, Massachusetts, Paul was an unreconstructed Irish Catholic Yankee. In mindset and dialect, he remained true to this heritage and was totally impervious to the regional Texan culture. He sounded like a Boston Kennedy and played touch football with the same reckless abandon. His parents, Mary (nee Riley) and James (''Mickey'') English, preceded him in death, as did his dear young daughter, Elisabeth Ann. Paul received a bachelor's degree from Clark University in his native Worcester-an institution most famous for its geography program, a master's degree from Johns Hopkins University, and his doctorate from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. We will sorely miss his wit, intellect, and expertise","excerpt":"his personal magnetism, friendship, loyalty, and tolerance; the twinkle in his Irish eyes. Paul is survived by two sons, Dr. Paul Ward English II, with wife Leslie, of Houston and Dr. Peter Herbert English of Washington, DC, by two grandchildren, Ava Elaine and Paul III, and by his loving devoted fiancee, Annie Delano, whose constant presence and care comforted Paul in his final month and eased his passage.

As a composer, theorist and saxophonist, Mr. Braxton, above, exemplified the brazen intellectualization of jazz's avant-garde","excerpt":"his pieces often included instructions in the form of geometric pictographs, and his process revealed an affinity for classical conceptualism. This was a compelling enough alternative -- in the era that officially gave rise to jazz repertory on the one hand and commercialized fusion on the other -- to sustain the support of a major label and the attention of the mainstream media, at least for a few heady years. Mr. Braxton has been tirelessly prolific since that cultural moment, but he has also become something of a recluse, establishing himself at Mills College in the 1980's and Wesleyan University since the 90's. Last fall, Wesleyan, in Middletown, Conn., toasted Mr. Braxton's 60th birthday with a three-month series of performances and lectures, including a colloquium discussing his influence. The ensemble that Mr. Braxton leads here could serve the same purpose, stocked as it is with younger players fluent in his language; some, like the cornetist Taylor Ho Bynum and the saxophonist Steve Lehman, are Wesleyan alumni who have been applying Braxtonian methods to their own projects. But of course, the reason not to miss this engagement is Mr. Braxton himself, whose playing is as terse and riveting as ever, and whose concept has never faltered in its evolution.

With this newest tale of family and sexual complication bloodied by murder, you may feel like he's doing it in our sleep — or at least causing it. The movie starts with a grim tableau that has the suffocating potent accomplishment of classic Chabrol. The camera moves through a large, warm home peering into rooms, passing a young woman curled up on the floor in a ball of guilt before coming to rest on a sprawled corpse, blood pooled under its head.  The movie slips back to the familial difficulties involving François (Benoît Magimel) and the odd bond he has with his luminously beautiful stepsister Michèle (Mélanie Doutey) who's returning home to France after having lived in Chicago for a few years. Meanwhile, François's stepmother's campaign for mayor is reaching a crucial point","excerpt":"his piggish father's tolerance for her career has died out years ago. Minimal and inexorable, &quot;Flower&quot; wanders rather than moving chillingly toward its climax. The movie gets by on a few deadpan satirical brushes on politics and the performance by Suzanne Flon as Tante Line. Tante Line, who is eventually revealed to be the heartsick conscience of her family that is holding it together, comes from an actress working at the peak of her gifts.

Mr. Ughi did draw a sumptuous tone from his Stradivarius, but otherwise his recital - despite considerable audience enthusiasm - seemed disappointing.

Frankly, I don't see how ''As might be expected from this description,'' it follows that ''the poems too often simply report, stopping short of the work etc.'' In fact, it is the reviewer who stops short; for when he comes to give an example of what he considers to be ''The raw material - incidents and names of persons and places - is asked to do poetic duty,'' he quotes, out of context, only the first three lines of the last stanza from the poem titled ''All the Way From There to Here,'' choosing to omit what precedes and follows those three lines:   v.   hat I remember of my nine- story fall down through the great fir is the rush of green.

Bored and disillusioned, he has come to view his life as a \\"vast plain of drudgery and normality.\\" He is ripe for an escape. When he inadvertently causes a car wreck, he ends up taking a more than casual interest in his victim, a pretty young woman who says her name is Sara. But why doesn't she have any ID or anyone to look out for her? Why won't she tell him where she's from? Ignoring the warning signs that Stephen Amidon sets off like flares, David grows more involved with Sara. By the time he has cracked her duplicitous code, he has become his victim's victim, ceding to her the control over his life he desperately wants to exert. The author intends for Sara to be an enigma, but he ends up sacrificing her motivation on the altar of her mysteriousness -- creating, finally, a character with puzzling inconsistencies. Similarly, David expresses surprise at his own actions","excerpt":"his poor self-awareness is substituted for a deeper exploration of his character. Nevertheless, the novel manages to be absorbing on another level, splashed as it is with amusing anecdotes and reflections on the consumer culture in which David is trapped.

All of the late 19th- and early 20th-century works to be auctioned in the sales, which begin on Monday night, go on view today at the two houses.   At Sotheby's, many of the most important paintings and sculptures to be auctioned are from collections -- each comprising works by a variety of artists -- formed by the rich and famous. Greta Garbo collected paintings by Renoir, Bonnard and Alexej von Jawlensky. Henry Ford 2d roamed more widely, buying art by Renoir, Cezanne, Modigliani, Picasso, Matisse and Chagall. Jerome K. Ohrbach, of the retailing family, acquired mostly landscapes, still lifes and genre scenes by 19th- and early 20th-century French artists. And Catherine Schlumberger Jones of Washington, an heir to a French fortune in oil-well drilling equipment, focused on Surrealist paintings by Rene Magritte and the Art Brut works of Jean Dubuffet.   Sotheby's four-day sale of 370 artworks, estimated to total $198.7 million to $266.6 million, begins at 7 P.M. Monday with its auction of the Ford artworks, valued at $66 million to $86 million. The most important painting, Renoir's \\"Cup of Chocolate,\\" from 1878, is expected to bring $15 million to $18 million. Owned by the Ford family since 1937, this portrait of a woman in a high-collared black dress pausing over a cup of chocolate was a favorite of the artist. Renoir exhibited the portrait frequently and would not part with it until 1897, when he sold it to his dealer, Galerie Durand-Ruel, which held on to it for 40 years. Two of the more unusual works in the Ford collection are by Picasso: \\"Glass of Absinthe,\\" a Cubist sculpture from 1912, which is expected to bring $800,000 to $1 million, and \\"Bohemian,\\" a pastel on paper painted in 1900 in Bareclona, depicting a woman looking out to sea, estimated at $3 million to $4 million.   The most important paintings from Garbo's estate, which are to be auctioned at Sotheby's at 7 P.M. on Tuesday, include Renoir's \\"Secret\\" (estimated at $2 million to $3 million), from 1897","excerpt":"his portrait of his nephew Edmund Renoir, from 1889 ($4 million to $6 million), and Bonnard's \\"Corn-Poppies,\\" from 1914-15, ($1.5 million to $2 million). This session, expected to total $91 million to $124.6 million, also includes French paintings from the Ohrbach estate (up to $17.9 million) and from the Jones estate (up to $6.8 million). Outstanding among the Jones paintings is Magritte's darkly witty 1951 painting \\"Perspective,\\" depicting a coffin on a couch, a work based on Jacques-Louis David's portrait of Madame Recamier ($600,000 to $800,000).   Both houses are offering an example of Manet's 1882 flower paintings, completed when the artist was in great pain in the last few months before his death from syphilis. The version at Sotheby's in the sale on Tuesday night is a vibrant image of flowers in a round glass vase. The one that Christie's is to auction at 7 P.M. on Wednesday is a muted study of flowers in a rectangular glass vase. The painting bears Manet's dedication to Dr. Thomas W. Evans, a Philadelphia physician, who acquired it from the artist.   Christie's two-day sale of 241 works, estimated at $160.6 million to $199.5 million, includes major works by van Gogh, Fernand Leger, Picasso, Chagall, Miro and Alberto Giacometti that have been in private collections for many years.   Van Gogh's \\"Vase With Cornflowers and Poppies,\\" from 1890, a glowing still life in reds, greens, yellow, white and brown painted one month before the artist's suicide, is expected to bring $12 million to $16 million, the highest valuation in Christie's sale. The artist's boldly drawn \\"Garden of Flowers,\\" from 1888, was executed in brown and black ink over pencil with a reed that van Gogh cut himself. Acquired in 1906 from the widow of the artist's brother, Theo, the drawing changed hands again in 1960 when it was bought by the Swiss father of the present owner, Elizabeth Sigrist-Nathan. The presale estimate is $5 million to $7 million.   Two double-sided paintings from before World War I are among the more interesting works in this sale. Leger's abstract landscape \\"Houses Beneath the Trees,\\" from 1913, a study of interlocking volumes in green, red, blue and gray, is backed by a bolder, darker abstract image in black, red and gray, dominated by a large figure. The presale estimate is $10 million to $12 million. The expressionist style of Ernst Ludwig Kirchner is seen twice in 1912 landscapes -- lovers courting on the front, a Gauguinesque scene on the back. The two-sided work was explained by Michael Findlay, who heads Impressionist and modern-art sales at Christie's. \\"Kirchner was still very poor in 1912,\\" he said. \\"Hence the double painting.\\" The presale estimate is $800,000 to $1 million.   Three offbeat paintings by Miro, Chagall and Picasso, expected to bring $17.5 million to $24.5 million, are being auctioned from an estate that Christie's has not identified. Picasso's \\"Woman Resting Before a Mirror,\\" from 1932, a sensuous study of a favorite model, is expected to sell for $7 million to $10 million. Chagall's painting \\"Drunkard,\\" from 1912, combining Cubist imagery and Fauve colors, is expected to sell for $6 million to $8 million. Miro's \\"Women Listening to Music,\\" from 1945, alive with moving images against a black background, hung in the bar at the Stanhope Hotel in New York in the 1950's when it was in the collection of the hotel's owner, Evelyn Sharpe. The presale estimate is $4.5 million to $6.5 million.   Giacometti's soaring bronze sculpture \\"Standing Woman No. 1,\\" from 1960, a study of an isolated woman, is the second tallest, at more than 105 inches, of the five figures Giacometti submitted in a rejected proposal for One Chase Manhattan Plaza in lower Manhattan. The figure, one of an edition of six, is expected to bring $4 million to $6 million. Contemporary Totals     The contemporary-art sales ended late yesterday with totals well below the expectations of the two houses. Of the 379 artworks offered in the two-day sale at Sotheby's, which was expected to bring $59.7 million to $78.4 million, 175 were sold for a total of $27.7 million. At Christie's, in the two-day auction of 313 works, expected to bring $59.9 million to $81.7 million, 157 were sold for a total of $42.3. SOTHEBY'S, York Avenue at 72d Street (212-606-7245).

Although it was photographed in pleasingly vivid hues by Vladimir Rapoport, it only occasionally manages to be truly colorful and striking.Perhaps Sergei Gerasimov, one of the Soviet Union's leading movie men, who adapted and directed \\"Don\\" in 1957, was overwhelmed by the wealth of material at his disposal. Out of the saga's first two novels, \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" and \\"The Don Flows Home to the Sea,\\" each of which was well over 700 pages (and a third book), which have been compared to the works of Tolstoy and other literary titans, Mr. Gerasimov fashioned no fewer than three features, the first of which is the import now being shown.The richness of his source is only fleetingly captured here. Despite the adequate English subtitles, which toward the film's climax passingly indicate special political pleading, \\"Don\\" is basically episodic fare, highlighted here and there by moments of real drama and ending with seemingly unfinished business that may confuse viewers unaware that Sections Two and Three of this gigantic movie triptych are still to come.As has been noted, Mr. Gerasimov is concerned not with the many characters that populate Sholokhov's books but simply the leading players. In an essentially austere yarn, he illustrates the story of the young, fiery and abundantly red-blooded Grigory, who has romantic designs on Aksinya, the wife of another Cossack","excerpt":"his pre-arranged, loveless marriage; his adulterous relationship with Aksinya; a short glimpse of Cossack lancers clashing with the enemy in World War I; our star-crossed hero's discovery that his beloved has succumbed to the blandishments of the heir to the estate where he works, and his ultimate return to his wife.Mr. Gerasimov has captured the pastoral mood and scenes of the flat Don countryside and the quaintness of its village in his opening sequences, and some excitement when our rebellious Grigory defies his father and the stern social code of these country folk. One, however, is not particularly aware that these are a freedom-loving, rough-hewn people almost always connected with the military and used for generations as cavalry in the forefront of fighting. This is only briefly and casually shown.The director has elicited animated, if not especially trenchant, performances from his principals. As Grigory, Pyotr Glebov is a handsome, stalwart young bucko whose flashing eyes and flaring nostrils need no subtitles. His transparent emotions are paralleled by Ellina Bystritskaya as Aksinya, a dark-haired buxom type who, on occasion, does manage to make her feelings clear without arm waving and declamation.Danilo Ilchenko does well as Grigory's father, a proud, elderly Cossack shamed by his son's willful indiscretions. Zinaida Kirienko is sweet and retiring, as Grigory's ill-used wife who attempts suicide, and Alexander Blagovestov, as the cuckolded husband, and Igor Dmitriev, as Aksinya's landed, foppish seducer, add adequate supporting stints.From literary and musical points of view (the book also was the basis of the Russian opera, \\"The Quiet Don\\"), \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" is a towering work. This movie edition is a well-made, but uninspired, kaleidoscopic affair that merely skims the surface of the vast impressive original. Screen: 'And Quiet Flows the Don':Russian Production.

In the history of connoisseurship this ploy may be worth recording, but for practical criticism I doubt that it has much to recommend it—ignoring as it does movies that take a while to find themselves (at least in the viewer's mind), and movies that from a position of relative strength work inexorably toward a condition of absolute, unredeemable loss.In the latter category belongs John Mackenzie's \\"Unman, Wittering and Zigo,\\" which opened yesterday at Cinema II, and which begins full of ripe and gruesome promise that very shortly turns overripe and openly ridiculous.Unman, Wittering and Zigo are the last three names on the roll call for Lower 5B, a form full of malignant malcontents at Chantry, a second-rate British public school, where young John Ebony (David Hemmings), fresh from the disillusionments of a job in advertising, has come to teach. His appointment is something of a fluke, his predecessor having died in midterm from a tumble down a nearby cliff, and almost no time at all is lost before the gentlemen of Lower 5B inform their new master that the death was no accident","excerpt":"his predecessor was pushed, and they did the pushing.Ebony's problem, as Lower 5B knows full well, is that if he reports the murder, nobody will believe him (he doesn't, at first, believe it himself), but if he keeps quiet and does a few favors for the class—not much work, decent grades for those who want them, bets placed and winnings collected from the local bookie, etc.—they will protect his academic career and perhaps let him survive the semester as well.A modus vivendi, the boys call it, but one that fails when Ebony learns that his appointment is not to be renewed and that he has, at Chantry, no academic career to protect—but only his own sanity and the well-being and perhaps respect of a wife (Carolyn Seymour) who is not long on wifely indulgence. It is when this happens, when the mood has all been built and the story begins to move, that \\"Unman, Wittering and Zigo\\" really falls apart, though it had never been too well glued from the beginning.But at the beginning it is easy to make excuses. And Mackenzie's spectacularly subjective camera and his Latin-encrusted boys' school and even his Lower 5B, which speaks in unison or to instantaneous cue—like some evil, over-trained minstrel troupe—invite if not the willing suspension of disbelief at least the expectation of pleasurable surrender to efficient nonsense. When that expectation is not satisfied, when the movie becomes too absurd in its inventions and too indifferent in how it works them out, the failure seems of more than ordinary proportions.Most of the performances are good, up to the level asked of them. David Hemmings's neophyte master suggests enthusiasm without sentimentality, and the boys mostly manage to project malevolence minus any regrets for their lost innocence. Nicholas Hoye as Cloistermouth, the prettiest of the fallen angels, is especially scary. Carolyn Seymour plays the young wife as if she were competing for the Glenda Jackson award in emotional reserve. But when the chips are down and she must show some feeling, it becomes apparent that there isn't any reserve; there is only no emotion.

One is a New York tradition. And the other definitely isn't.    The New York tradition is the SIREN MUSIC FESTIVAL, presented by The Village Voice, which will swamp Coney Island for the sixth year on Saturday. The festival, as always, is free and packed full of indie rock acts. One of the oddest things about Siren is that it scarcely seems to reflect the musical or demographic diversity of the city's music scene, even the city's downtown music scene. And compared with the three major indie-rock festivals that will hit Chicago this summer (the recent Intonation, along with the forthcoming Pitchfork and Lollapalooza), this one seems slightly lacking in big names.    Then again, Siren is free, and surely the pink-skinned, glassy-eyed fans staggering down the boardwalk won't be in a mood to complain. This year's headliners include the petulant Canadian indie-pop act STARS, the blithe and absurd British band ART BRUT, the exuberant neo-glam band SCISSOR SISTERS and SHE WANTS REVENGE, the shameless Los Angeles gloom-pop band. (You'd think a self-respecting New York audience would boo those guys off the stage.) The full schedule is at villagevoice.com/siren.    The other, distinctly nontraditional New York concert is KENNY CHESNEY's current tour, which is to touch down at Madison Square Garden on Friday. Mr. Chesney is a laid-back country singer whose obvious influences include Jimmy Buffett and James Taylor","excerpt":"his radio-ready hits (he recently topped the country charts with a sweet, straightforward song called ''Summertime'') and exuberant arena shows have made him one of the country's most popular singers, though he rarely plays Manhattan. On Friday he is to be joined by DIERKS BENTLEY (whose hits include the shrugging break-up song, ''Settle for a Slowdown'') and the ''American Idol'' winner CARRIE UNDERWOOD, who established herself as a country-pop star with the smash ''Jesus, Take the Wheel.'' The concert is sold out, but resourceful New Yorkers should be able to figure out a way in.

Since 1976, when his first album appeared, Mr. Parker has built a dedicated following with songs that lash out at hypocrisy and smugness. He arrived just before punk-rock as part of England's pub-rock movement, which valued the craftsmanship of 1960's soul, folk-rock and country music","excerpt":"his rage never tore apart his songs. And through most of the last two decades, he has been articulately snarling at everyone from estranged lovers to unthinking consumers.    But on Friday night, Mr. Parker had more affectionate tidings. \\"People think I'm filled with hate/ They've got it wrong, that's out of date\\" he sang in \\"Pollinate,\\" from his new album, \\"12 Haunted Episodes\\" (Razor and Tie). One love song proclaimed earnestly, \\"You're my partner for life\\"; another insisted, \\"I am undoing this cruel stage that I've been going through.\\" From his older material, he chose some of his more atmospheric, less combative songs, in gentler new arrangements: \\"Fool's Gold\\" changed from a march to a waltz. For most of the new songs, he strummed an acoustic guitar, and he didn't mind singing 'la la\\" choruses; his new band, the Episodes, would rather lilt than pound.
