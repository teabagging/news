Well, stop worrying. While the question is a legitimate one, the answer is obvious -- even though neither U.S. nor Japanese officials want to utter it aloud. So let me just whisper it here: What will keep the U.S. and Japan together in the coming decade is C-h-i-n-a.         The U.S.-Japan security treaty used to be based on protecting Japan primarily from the distant threat from Moscow. But with the rise of an increasingly powerful and assertive China, and with the spread of Japanese investments all over Asia, Japan now has a much greater threat close to home and much greater regional economic interests to protect. Japan's only reliable partner for deterring China and keeping the peace around Asia is the U.S. (And if China isn't enough of a threat for Japan, then the prospect of a reunited K-o-r-e-a, with a few nuclear warheads in the basement, should be sufficient to frighten anyone here into making certain the Yankees don't go home.)

Mr. Odets' cast was fine, as were several of his scenes. And the same may be said for the screen adaptation of his drama, which turned up at the Paramount yesterday. Barbara Stanwyck, Paul Douglas and Mr. Ryan are veterans who still can handle a line of dialogue and an emotion with facility, but Mr. Odets' play never is the sum of some of its parts. It lacks conviction and distinction despite its hard-working principals.In transferring the scene from Staten Island to a fishing village on the West Coast, the producers have captured both the rugged beauty and the terrible drabness of an environment in which stagnation is all too probable. But the switch in locales has had little effect on the story of the tired, defeated and cynical Mae Doyle, who returns home after ten years to find that life is real and escape is practically impossible. The security she finds in Jerry D'Amato, guileless fishing boat skipper, clashes violently with the attraction thrust at her in the person of his friend, Earl Pfeiffer, a slick, morbid and self-pitying movie projectionist. Although pent-up emotions explode at proper intervals, Mr. Odets and Alfred Hayes, who adapted his play to the screen, seem unable to resolve their drama with believable conclusion.One of Mr. Odets' characters says, \\"Love is rotten when it happens this way,\\" and that about completes the philosophy behind his drama. Barbara Stanwyck, as the harried Mae, is essentially honest when she accepts Jerry as her husband. She says she will try to make him happy, but never declares an abiding love for the man. But her great anguish and indecision when her mate goes berserk on learning of her infidelity and her decision to beg to return to her home and child is a change of heart not easy to comprehend or accept. Miss Stanwyck is professionally realistic in the role. Paul Douglas is a physically convincing portrait of the simple, muscular and trusting Jerry. But it is difficult to take his extreme idealistic devotion.As the lover, Robert Ryan is natural in his depiction of a man groping for a way out of a lonely existence. Marilyn Monroe and Keith Andes, as a pair of embattled young lovers","excerpt":"J. Carrol Naish, as Douglas' lazy, drink-cadging uncle, and Silvio Minciotti, as Douglas' father, strongly indicate that the cast deserved something more pointed than \\"Clash by Night.\\" It is, after all, more like confusion in cannery row than the answers to painful problems.Featured on the stage of the Paramount are Les Paul and Mary Ford, Joey Bishop, Tommy Edwards, Peiro Brothers and Ralph Marterie and his orchestra.
