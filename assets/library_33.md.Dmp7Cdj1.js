The report tracked 17 of the season's biggest contests: three were won by management and three by dissidents. The study's authors, John A. Pound and Lilli Gordon, contend that the score changes if eight other cases, in which dissidents accomplished only some of their objectives, are included. Dissidents racked up complete or partial victories in 11 out of the 14 cases where there has been resolution. The review of the record indicates a surprising beneficiary: D. F.

But difficulty never seems to intimidate the Repertorio Espanol, and its presentation of this classic is a fascinating, if occasionally wobbly, effort.

The author, Frances Wood, head of the Chinese section of the British Library, contends that Marco Polo's account of his trip to China was probably concocted by the scribe who shared his cell in Genoa, where both were taken prisoner in 1296 during that city's war with Venice.         I confess to a personal interest, since I took part last year in a British Museum tour of the supposed itinerary traveled by Marco Polo. Still, judging by  the uproar, Ms. Wood has touched a real nerve. Some fear her thesis will buttress the tendency to dismiss history itself as bunk (as Henry Ford once snorted), or at best as an ultimately unknowable and unprovable fable.

A1    British troops opened fire on civilians in Kandahar, Afghanistan, after a suicide bomber rammed a minibus into their military convoy, wounding three soldiers, officials and witnesses said. At least 3 people were killed and 15 wounded in the bombing and the shooting afterward, hospital officials said.  A14    Toll of Philippine Landslide  Rescue workers began to bury victims of a landslide in the Philippines. The death toll as recorded by the Red Cross stood at 406, but officials warned that it would climb and that there was little hope of finding more survivors. The Red Cross said that with hundreds of people still missing, the final death toll could exceed 1,000.  A6    Poison Inquiry Going to Russia  The investigation into the poisoning of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former Russian K.G.B. operative, will probably broaden, Britain's highest ranking law enforcement officer said. News reports said British counterterrorism officers were planning to fly to Moscow to interview witnesses.  A3    Pinochet in Serious Condition  Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator of Chile, suffered a serious heart attack and underwent angioplasty and another surgical procedure, hospital officials and his family said. The medical team treating General Pinochet said his condition was stable, but ''extremely serious'' and ''life threatening.''  A10    Annan Says Iraq Is in Civil War  Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, said Iraq had descended into a civil war that was even deadlier than the 15-year conflict that tore apart Lebanon. He joined a growing number of foreign and Iraqi leaders, policy makers and news organizations who say that Iraq is in the grip of civil war.  A14    Aid Says Bush Plans Changes  President Bush plans ''significant changes'' in his approach to Iraq after he reviews options drafted by an outside panel of experts and suggestions from others in the administration and Congress, Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, said. A15    OBITUARIES A23    Leonard Freed  A prominent photo journalist and member of the Magnum Photography Collective who was known primarily for his in-depth coverage of African-Americans, he was 77. A23    Jeanne A. Smith  An expert on sickle cell anemia who helped establish broader federal guidelines for testing newborns for the disease, she was 75. A23    NATIONAL A16-22    Video Offers Window Into Terror Suspect's Isolation  Lawyers for Jose Padilla, a Brooklyn-born Muslim convert whom the Bush administration detained without charges for three and a half years, contend that a recently released video showing Mr. Padilla being taken to the dentist while he was in military detention captures the dehumanization of their client.   A1    Pfizer Drug a Total Loss  Pfizer, the world's largest drug maker, has decided to stop testing a drug that cardiologists had hoped would reduce the buildup of fatty plaques in blood vessels that can cause heart attacks. Pfizer's decision to pull the plug on the medicine renders the company's nearly $1 billion investment a total loss.   A1    New Orleans Levee Work Slows  For months, the Army Corps of Engineers raced through New Orleans to prepare for a hurricane season, that produced no hurricanes in the region. The corps has now moved on to the task of strengthening flood protection in New Orleans beyond its pre-Hurricane Katrina level. But the pace has slowed drastically.  A20    Bush Considers Alaska Drilling  President Bush is considering whether to lift the 17-year-old moratorium on energy drilling in the waters off southwestern Alaska, which would allow oil and gas companies to try to tap into more than five trillion cubic feet of natural gas that lies beneath rich fishing grounds.   A16    Unfinished Work in Congress  Congressional leaders said election losses had sapped Republican enthusiasm for trying to finish nine spending measures that were due Oct. 1. Congress will instead pass a stopgap measure to keep the government running until mid-February.   A18    NEW YORK/REGION B1-5    A City Used to Losses Faces Another Round  The prospect of Schenectady, N.Y., a once-thriving city, losing one of its two hospitals, as recommended by a state commission, seemed to some residents like a demotion in municipal rank. It signaled not only the possible loss of hundreds of jobs, but also the threatened loss of a certain civic gravity. B1    Electric Costs Up for Some  Electric bills for Connecticut residents are likely to jump again, with regulators poised to approve rate increases. But residential customers of small, municipally-owned entities across the state will see no price increase.  B1    Old-School School Leader  Kathleen M. Cashin, a superintendent in one of New York City's toughest districts, has seen success that should be an easy reason for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein to gloat. But in many ways, her success raises questions about the thrust of their recent efforts to reshape the school bureaucracy.

One afternoon when I was 4 years old, my mother entered our living room and saw me perched on a sofa, staring at a blank wall. Concerned, she asked what I was doing. I glanced at her, replied that I was watching television, then shifted my eyes back to the wall.         These days, such behavior would be labeled fantasy play, and some good would  be found in it. Back then, in the mid-1950's, my parents were instinctively resisting the invasion of what was fated to be called pop culture, and my mother was horrified by my reply. She and my father, though, reacted with a quick surrender. They purchased a television, and our family became a little more like the families down the street and across the United States.

It was, he later wrote, ''about half the size and of the shape of a pea.'' The mill had been built on the bank of the American River for the purpose of sawing timber, but like nearly every other modest purpose in the territory of California, and indeed in much of the United States, milling lumber at Sutter's Mill was soon set aside in the frenzied search for gold.     All along the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, the landscape was systematically displaced. Riverbeds were bared, and millions of tons of gravel, sand and rock were shifted about. Hillsides were replaced with piles of tailings. On the day Marshall discovered gold, the non-Indian population of the territory was perhaps 20,000. Within a year and a half that number had quintupled, beginning one of the most dynamic population shifts in history.

In the distant year of 1974, when ''Bad Habits'' made its hilarious New York debut, the characters' vices of chain smoking, high-cholesterol gluttony, martini guzzling and sexual adventurism were regarded more as amusingly naughty acts of rebellion, however self-destructive, than as one-way tickets to the grave.

The stores don't open on Saturdays now -- no customers. There used to be five family-owned grocery stores. Gone. Three family-owned drugstores. Gone. On a recent weekend, both the main street and the town square were completely deserted.

Perhaps just as the New York City Opera did on Saturday night: respectful of its sentimentality, alert to its occasional beauties, happy to leave success or failure in the hands of an audience that will inevitably waver between uncritical embrace and guarded contempt.   The distance between us in 1993 and Sigmund Romberg in the early 1920's is more than a matter of 70 years. Even at its conception, this tale of royal heartbreak in old Heidelberg pined for a fanciful and romantic past. What it offered City Opera patrons on Saturday -- and will continue to offer in a near-unbroken two-week string of performances continuing tomorrow night -- is yearning doubled and once removed: a nostalgia for an earlier nostalgia that was powerful enough to keep the original production going for 608 performances.

They still knew the lines, and shouted them out, when the reunited Firesign Theater performed on Saturday night at the Beacon Theater as part of its 25th-anniversary tour.   The material dated to 1968 to 1971, and only the occasional drug jokes fell flat. Although most of the group's material has been audio only, its four members -- Philip Austin, Peter Bergman, David Ossman and Philip Proctor -- can also act. The group staged its sketches with quick-change costumes, hats and wigs, along with an old-fashioned sound-effects setup (squeezing a cornstarch box for steps through snow, popping bubble wrap for a fire). Now and then, there were updates, noting a bumper sticker that said: \\"Are you co-dependent? I can rescue you!\\" or envisioning Rudolph Giuliani battling an armed, seceding Staten Island.

The way the locals figured it, the race could rekindle an old New York tradition, one in which the Hudson River became a hotbed of rowing in the 1820's, when as many as 60,000 spectators lined the banks to watch a race.    Rogers, a private investor who served as coxswain of the 1966 Oxford crew, scuttled that particular vision, however, by staging a race in 1983 on the East River. But it didn't take many pulls of the oars for the crews to discover why their 19th-century precursors had eschewed the estuary in favor of the real river across town. The strong Hell Gate current, coupled with heavy freighter wakes bouncing off the banks of the narrow waterway, all but swamped the low-riding shells and made the going rougher than the oarsmen had bargained for.

The chief feature is called \\"Beyond the Wall,\\" being a re-edited version of Fritz. Lang's production, \\"Between Worlds.\\" It is a tedious flow of symbolism, and by no means as interesting as three other subjects on the bill.A much older film called \\"Ruined,\\" or \\"The Tragedy of a Morphine Fiend,\\" is entertaining if only because of the queer ideas of screen acting. The way in which the villain creates in the more sympathetic person the appetite for morphine is amusing.One of two partners enters his office and the first thing he does is to pick up a photograph of the girl he loves and look admiringly at it. This man is vengeful because his partner, an individual with a beard, wins the girl. So he resolves to tempt the poor chap, first by making him spend money and then by dropping a few \\"pills for a cold\\" into his hand. The bearded person finds himself taking the drug before his child, and one day he has a dreadful dream, which causes him to assert himself and resist the craving for morphine.An ancient Chaplin comedy entitled \\"The Count\\" is another interesting piece of work. Here Mr. Chaplin is introduced as a tailor's assistant, but soon he becomes the unwilling confederate of an imposter. The comedian shows his dexterity with his little cane, by whipping whipped cream off a cake on to the faces of those dancing on a dangerously waxed floor. Then Mr. Chaplin has moments of flight, and sometimes he is not able to make any headway on the slippery boards. He is nimble enough and quite acrobatic during some junctures.Another reel of the Ufa astronomical film, \\"Heavenly Bodies,\\" is on the surrounding program. It is reminiscent of Jules Verne's story, \\"A Trip to the Moon,\\" and is exceedingly cleverly worked out, especially in a sequence in which it pretends to show what would happen to inhabitants of the world if they reached certain planets.

notes indus world seems set for slow and halting recovery that OECD does not believe will make much impact before end of '76 at best; says even limited upturn in world trade could easily be undercut by growing financial plight of less-developed countries; says in last few yrs, poorer countries have taken over from indus nations task of financing oil exporters' huge payments surplus and are rapidly going broke in process; notes most of these countries are no longer able to finance expected collective deficit of $35-billion from reserves or commercial borrowing and their only recourse is to continue to reduce their imports from indus world, which in turn must depress econs of richer countries just when many are hoping for first signs of trade upturn; says OECD forecasts suggest that indus countries might run '75 payments surplus of $10-billion, further reducing income of poor; says instead of starting to recover in '76, danger is that world econ will spiral downward into even deeper recession as less developed countries reduce their demand for mfrd goods from West;

Written and Illustrated by Margaret S. Johnson and Helen Lossing Johnson. 95 pp. New York: Harcourt, Brace & Co. $2."},{"year":"1955","title":"NO one can say those bright librettists Betty Comden and Adolph Green are unaware or unappreciative of which side their bread is buttered on. Having poked fun at early talking pictures in \\"Singing in the Rain\\"—a jovial offense enjoyed especially by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer—they have now made amends, in ample measure, by spoofing the whiskers off TV. They call it \\"It's Always Fair Weather\\" and it opened at the Music Hall yesterday.Howling with derision at such recognizable idiocies of TV as singing and slobbering commercials, audience-participation shows, give-away plugs for mundane products and the wise-talking agency boys, Miss Comden and Mr. Green fling some pretty sharp barbs in this bright film. And they are gaily assisted by a bevy of dandy helpers mustered up by M-G-M.First on the list is Gene Kelly, that veteran of Comden-Green shows whose sly eyes and nimble feet are measured among the happiest adornments of the screen. As his pals in contemporary turmoils are Dan Dailey and Michael Kidd the brilliant choreog-rapher, who is making his acting debut in this film. And then there is Cyd Charisse, performing as an advertising genius who can dance, and Dolores Gray as a siren who shrills weekly on the \\"Throb of Manhattan\\" TV program.Tightness and cinematic cohesion are not the clearest virtues of this show, which is bright in a panoply of color and large in CinemaScope. The authors have let it ramble, and producer Arthur Freed and the directors. Mr. Kelly and Stanley Donen, have not seen fit to discourage their whims. It jumps from a lengthly foot-warming by a trio of returning G. I. Joes (Kelly, Kidd and Dailey) to a tenth-year reunion of the three, and then to a thoughtful contemplation of the career-frustrations of the boys.Mr. Kelly is a cheap prize-fight promoter, Mr. Kidd runs a hot dog stand and Mr. Dailey is an advertising stuffed shirt. The future looks dark for them. But a few quick dashes of sunshine administered by Miss Charisse, right out of the tubs of bright contrivance presided over by Miss Comden and Mr. Green, and the floundering old pals are brought together on Miss Gray's TV show and allowed to work out their frustrations by knocking the whole thing to smithereens.It doesn't matter much that it rambles. So much and so many clever things are happening, one after another, that it consistently entertains. No need to recount them in order. Mr. Dailey plays a wonderful scene as a soused and resentful ad executive at a party of fat hucksters, singing a dandy little ditty, \\"Situation-Wise.\\" Miss Charisse does a darling dance with a gang of pluguglies from Skillman's Gym (\\"our alma mater\\") and otherwise generally keeps herself kissing-sweet. Miss Gray whips out the sparkling lyrics to \\"Thanks a Lot But No Thanks\\" so that this number deserves frequent rehearing. And Mr. Kelly does a great clog dance on roller-skates.As for Mr. Kidd, the newcomer, he is a most natural and agreeable little guy, somewhat in the style of Frank Sinatra, and—needless to say—he can dance. Along with David Burns as a flip bartender, Hal March (\\"The $64,000 Question\\" master-of-ceremonies) as a punchy pug, and two or three others who get into the picture, he helps to make \\"It's Always Fair Weather\\" a winning show.On the stage at the Music Hall is a colorful revue \\"Salut a La France,\\" featuring Jean Dubois, George Sawtelle and Joan Hagen, singers","excerpt":"Rex Ramer and Eilene, and the Glee Club, Corps de Ballet and Rockettes.

Eric Lipton (NYT)    ALBANY: TRIAL JUDGE CENSURED -- The judge who presided over the trial of the police officers who killed Amadou Diallo was censured for misconduct yesterday by a state panel. The panel, the Commission on Judicial Conduct, found that in two cases in 1997, Justice Joseph C. Teresi of State Supreme Court in Albany improperly held people in contempt of court and had them jailed. In two other cases, the commission found, Justice Teresi was ''injudicious, impatient and discourteous.'' The four cases cited were unrelated to the Diallo trial.

Count Almaviva is already a trademark role for Mr. Fl&#243;rez and as expected he was splendid, tossing off Rossinian roulades and runs with agility and exuberance, singing with sweet tone and pliant phrasing.

As Rosina, the essential soprano Ruth Ann Swenson, who is having an exceptionally fine Met season, sang exquisitely and again proved herself a delightfully natural comic actress. Alfonso Antoniozzi, a wiry and vocally robust Italian bass-baritone with wryly understated comic instincts, had a standout Met debut as Dr. Bartolo.
