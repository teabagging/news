Nonetheless, if public posturing by the two sides is dropped, agreements limiting both strategic and intermediate- range nuclear forces may still be possible before the end of 1984. But this will require serious proposals, new negotiating approaches and a commitment by both sides greater than that so far demonstrated.

His campily carnal painting \\"The Fleet's In,\\" a view of full-bodied sailors and women cavorting in drunken revelry, was removed from a show at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington by demand of the United States Navy. The grounds? That it made America's sailors look sleazy. (Nearly 60 years  later, the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe's work got a similar boost when -- at the Corcoran again -- a Mapplethorpe show was canceled on the assumption that some of its images might trigger the wrath of Congress.)         The 1934 incident, snapped up by the national press, put Mr. Cadmus on the map. Going strong at the age of 91, he still acknowledges its impact. In recent  years, with the revival of interest in figure painting and the resurgence of censorship, his life and work have come in for renewed attention, via films, shows, books (one by his late brother-in-law, Lincoln Kirstein, is about to be re-issued). Now Richard Meyer, an assistant professor of art history at the University of Southern California, who is serving as a guest curator at the Whitney, has built a small show around \\"The Fleet's In\\" and several other Cadmus paintings from the 1930's, in which the artist imposes a satirical view of contemporary life on Old Master themes and compositions.

On Thursday \\"Edge of Doom\\" and \\"A Lady Without Passport\\" came to town and yesterday marked the arrival of \\"Panic in the Streets\\" and \\"Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye.\\" As the saying goes, \\"Youse pays yur money and takes yur cherce.\\"The first choice this morning is \\"Panic in the Streets,\\" a Twentieth Century-Fox contribution which Elia Kazan has directed with a keen sense of appreciation for violence and suspense. Now on the Roxy's screen, the film shapes up as a generally gripping entertainment, though there are some stretches when the story loses its tension.A routine waterfront homicide suddenly becomes a source of frightening apprehension to city officials when a United States Public Health Service doctor discovers that the victim was infected with pneumonic plague. The problem of controlling a possible epidemic presents a seemingly insurmountable challenge to the police who have no idea about the dead man's identity much less that of the man or men who shot him. Although the audience knows who the killer is the search is conducted with such forceful pictorial imagery that this information does not detract from the excitement.It is always dangerous to take the audience so much into confidence, but Mr. Kazan is a director who can manage to stay a step ahead of the crowd and in \\"Panic in the Streets\\" he keeps the action going at a pace which seldom permits interest to lag. The fact that the killer and his aides are ignorant of the murdered man's disease and may themselves be carriers of the deadly, virulent germ gives added impetus to the story.Good acting helps out too, and the people who carry the principal roles in \\"Panic in the Streets\\"—Richard Widmark as the doctor","excerpt":"Paul Douglas as the police captain who directs the manhunt with a cynical assurance of its futility with nothing definite to latch onto; Walter Palance as the killer and Zero Mostel as a cringing henchman—all give commendable performances. A newcomer to films, Mr. Palance is a tall, rugged man with deep-set, piercing eyes and a granite-like face that commands attention. Technically there can be no quarrel with Mr. Widmark's performance, but his mannerisms are not precisely those one would associate with a doctor.Although it is excitingly presented, \\"Panic in the Streets\\" misses the mark as superior melodrama because it is not without obvious, sometimes annoying exaggeration that demands more indulgence than some spectators may be willing to contribute. However, there is an electric quality to the climax staged in a warehouse on the New Orleans waterfront that should compensate for minor annoyances which come to the surface spasmodically in \\"Panic in the Streets.\\"The stage bill at the Roxy includes Frances Langford and Peg Leg Bates, plus a new ice show, \\"On the Boardwalk,\\" with Carol Lynne and Skippy Baxter; Joe Jackson Jr. and the Three Bruises.

It's at the Rivoli this week, probably because it is a dull season and the hot weather is expected to continue.When a novel is translated into moving pictures and subtitles it must have some special treatment if it is to seem anything vital, something by way of sharpened characterization, intensification of plot or pictorial enhancement to take the place of the novelist's invigorating words, but in the present case only animated illustrations of no particular distinction have been substituted for the words, and they make a poor substitute.Thomas Meighan, who takes the leading rôle, is a nice-looking fellow and he has a certain whimsical manner sometimes that gives his characters a light and agreeable touch, but he scarcely ever creates a living, human being out of an author's fictitious figure, and in \\"The Conquest of Canaan\\" he does not even bring to his part the easy good humor that, for instance, he brought to his role in \\"White and Unmarried.\\" The others in the cast—Doris Kenyon, as Ariel Taber: Louis Hendricks, as Judge Pike","excerpt":"Paul Everton, as Happy Farley, and so on—are just lay figures without anything to distinguish them from hundreds of others of their kind on the stage and screen. Nor has the director of the production, R. William Neil, given it any cinematographic individuality.There have been much worse pictures than \\"The Conquest of Canaan,\\" and also much better. It's just mediocre. You can't get excited about it either way.Probably many of those who see it will have a general idea of the story. They will remember \\"that it is about a small town—possibly it has been revived because of the popularity of \\"Main Street,\\" which it doesn't resemble very closely—and they may recall that its leading characters are a disreputable young man, a reputable girl who has faith in him, and a hypocritical \\"leadingcitizen\\" whose sense of respectability is so offended by the young man's scandalous behavior that he becomes his vehement enemy. Why Judge Pike should develop such animosity toward as lowly a person as Joe Louden is not explained—at least, on the screen—but he does and Joe is finally provoked to show the town just what an old faker the Judge is. His triumph and the Judge's downfall are supposed to be an exposure, of the tyranny and sham of small-town respectability, but the Judge is made so vulnerable that he's hardly typical. It is easy for Joe to dispose Judge Pike, but he would have an altogether different Job on his hands with a Judge Pike of real life. That's why \\"The Conquest of Canaan\\" isn't convincing. It's too obviously fiction.The Rivoli program opens with an unusually interesting scenic picture entitled \\"The Soul of the Cypress,\\" photographed by Dudley Murphy, its separate scenes are striking photographic works, distinctively composed and expressive, but the story of a dryad and a mortal that is supposed to run through them is too thin and broken to be effective. It lacks the dramatic or lyric quality apparently sought by it.The Rivoli Pictorial is especially entertaining this week, with a Lyman Howe offering of trick photography, called \\"Modern Sculpture\\"; several Kineto studies, and other subjects.The story of the Canadian Northwest with the Mounted Police as the centre of action is becoming to the screen what the cowboy Westerners used to be, and James Oliver Curwood one of the first to supply material for the new melodramas, continues to be one of the most steady providers. His latest, \\"The Golden Snare,\\" is at the Strand thisweek. In substance it is pretty much like the others, telling of an intrepid Seargeant of the Mounted who follows his man over the frozen North and finally gets him, and also the girl, who has remained as spotless as the snow. \\"The Golden Snare\\" differs from the others in being more melodramatic and less logical, but it has Lewis S. Stone, who at least looks 1ike a Mounted Policeman, or as a Mounted Policeman ought to look, and its characterizations are strong, even if they are stereotyped, especially those by Wallace Beery, Melbourne MacDowell, Wellington Playter and Ruth Renick. Also there are lots of snow and ice for a hot day, and the action is action such as only the movies can boast. David M. Hartford directed the production.\\"Jogging Across Sawtooth,\\" an Outing-Chester picture, is also on the program.\\"An Unwilling Hero,\\" with Will Rogers, and \\"Edgar's Feast Day,\\" a Booth Tarkington comedy, are at theCapitol, and Rex Ingram's exceptionalpicture, \\"The Conquering Power,\\" has moved from the Rivoli to the Rialto for the week.6,000 Hear Julia Claussen Sing.An audience of 6,000 heard JuliaClaussen, mezzo-soprano with the orchestra in the Lewisohn Stadium at the City College last night.

And \\"Mr. Orchid\\" (\\"Le Pere Tranquille\\"), the latest import on that theme, which arrived at the Bijou on Saturday, is neither an explosive revelation or a bore. For this adventure about the leader of a small underground group is an interesting and amiable, if transparent yarn, which is content to stress subdued characterizations more than its melodramatics.For this circumstance responsibility must rest with Noel-Noel, who not only stars in the title role but who also is credited with turning in the film's scenario and dialogue. Last seen here as the school teacher in \\"A Cage of Nightingales,\\" M. Noel-Noel, is, in this fiction, a middle-aged, shiffling and apparently timorous insurance agent whose prime passion is orchids. But behind the cloak of exotic horticulture and a slightly contemptuous nickname bestowed by unsuspecting neighbors, he is a fierce patriot who bravely leads self-effacing crews in dangerous sabotage, liquidating Nazi spies and hoodwinking a somewhat comic opera Gestapo.Although none of the portrayals might be termed memorable M. Noel-Noel's portrait of the seemingly ineffectual and harassed husband whose family is ignorant of his war effort, is underplayed and sensitive albeit a mite coy at times.

In a poll of the residents of Moscow and Leningrad shortly after the August 1991 coup attempt, some 70 percent supported Baltic independence. The reason for the smaller percentages among Russians in the Baltic states is that newcomers from occupying countries tend to have a disproportionate vested interest in the colonial-imperial status quo.

The cheese dish, known as raclette, has won growing favor with city people from Geneva and Zurich and with other visitors who flock to the Alpine region around the year.   The name of the dish, derived from the French verb ''racler,'' to scrape, seems to have first been officially used at an exhibition organized by the Swiss Canton of Valais at Sion, its capital, in 1911.   The fat cheese made of unskimmed Alpine milk from the Bagnes Valley, northeast of the Great St. Bernard Pass, is preferred for raclette. Its taste is somewhere between the blandness of Italian cacciotta and the tang of French Camembert. Some sorts of Gruyere come very close. If prepared over charcoal or a log fire the dish gains a smoky flavor that connoisseurs cherish.

Bush of Columbia Going Abroad, Too."},{"year":"1980","title":"IS Gulley Jimson, the rogue-painter in \\"The Horse's Mouth,\\" a genuine genius or a slippery con artist? Few of the other characters in the Joyce Cary novel are ever quite sure. If someone could certify Gulley's genius, they would gladly put up with his whims. Genius gives license to the most maddening arrogance, but without any certification, Gulley's friends must often suspect they are being swindled.Because most of us now believe that Erich Von Stroheim (1885-1957) was a genius, we tend to look sentimentally at his comparatively meager output as a director — nine films, including those that were never finished, that were finished by others and that were radically edited by others after he had completed them. It's easy to say that he was mistreated, ahead of his time, too honest to compromise and so on. All true, perhaps, but he was also, like Gulley Jimson, a con artist of gargantuan proportions, a man whose genius seems to have been nurtured as much by destructive turmoil as by the creative impulse.It's this dual nature of Mr. Von Stroheim that is brilliantly and economically evoked in Patrick Montgomery's excellent \\"The Man You Loved to Hate,\\" the feature-length documentary on Mr. Von Stroheim's career as a director and as an actor, which opens today at the Public Theater. The new film will be shown through Sunday, each day accompanying a different film as part of the Public's Von Stroheim retrospective.The title \\"The Man You Loved to Hate\\" is a play on the phrase \\"the man you love to hate,\\" by which Von Stroheim-the-actor was known starting in World War I. During the war, he gained fame playing German officers who pillaged and raped without conscience. In one memorable moment, the character he played tossed a small baby out a window in his lust to achieve the baby's mother.\\"The Man You Loved to Hate\\" includes extensive and, generally, very good clips and stills from each of the nine films Mr. Von Stroheim directed, dozens of clips from those films in which he was an actor — everything from \\"Birth of a Nation,\\" in which he was an extra, to Renoir's \\"Grand Illusion\\" — bits of a hilarious trailer for \\"The Mask of Dijon,\\" plus interviews with friends, working associates and his wife, whom he married in 1919, and Denise Vernac, the French actress he lived with from 1939 until his death.The great things about the clips Mr. Montgomery has chosen for his documentary is that they not only whet one's appetite for the films in the retrospective, but they also give one an accurate impression of the Von Stroheim style and the massive scale on which he worked in such minute detail. The pictorial quality of most of the clips is first-rate.The life of Von Stroheim-the-man, as recalled in interviews with such people as Hal Mohr, who shot \\"The Wedding March\\"","excerpt":"Paul Kohner, the producer who later became Mr. Von Stroheim's agent; Samuel Marx, Leonard Spigelgass and the others, seems not to have been quite as terrible as legend likes to make the biographies of misunderstood geniuses. Both Mrs. Von Stroheim and Miss Vernac remember him with deep affection, and a lot of the others remember him with humor. There's one especially funny story about Mr. Von Stroheim's troubles with Louis B. Mayer and Mae Murray during the shooting of \\"The Merry Widow,\\" a series of \\"disagreements\\" that led eventually to a physical confrontation.\\"The Man You Loved to Hate\\" is cinema history of both entertaining and high order.

In JOHN SINGLETON COPLEY IN AMERICA (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Abrams, $75), the authors -- Carrie Rebora, an associate curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art","excerpt":"Paul Staiti, a professor of art history at Mount Holyoke College; Theodore E. Stebbins Jr., a curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston; and Carol Troyen and Erica E. Hirshler, an associate and assistant curator there, respectively -- focus on Copley's early paintings because that work \\"issued from a single, unified culture that was very different from the culture that framed his production in England.\\" In a cogent essay, Mr. Staiti argues that Copley \\"became an indispensable producer during a consumer revolution, satisfying the demand for Anglicized cultural goods that helped the elite define who they were.\\" Or who they wanted to be -- for what Copley's customers often requested were idealized versions of themselves. Indeed, the props in the portraits -- the architecture, furnishings, fabrics -- were frequently items that could not have  been owned by his subjects. Another example of Copley's fictionalizing is his 1765 portrait of John Hancock: a wealthy man, Hancock is depicted as poorer than he was, simpler -- a man of the people. After Boston came under siege in 1767, Copley's colors became subdued, his portraits grew increasingly sober, his commissions fell off and he eventually left the country. The anthropological approach the authors adopt toward Copley's art does not obscure his gifts as a painter, of which the lavish illustrations give ample evidence.

Dancing is serious business. Among these realists - it turns out - is Paul Taylor. One had always considered him more of a visionary, but a recent open letter from the choreographer that arrived at t his desk puts him, after all, in the two-feet-on-theground camp. Mr. Taylor, whose company ends a week at the Brookly Academy of Music today, has lectu red his own dancers in the past on the need for ''Zunch,'' his name for a certain spiritual ''oomph'' in their dancing.   Now he is again concerned with commitment to the art. But this time, he has taken care to address all ''Beginning Dancers,'' not his own company. Young dancers, he urges, must make the most of their dancing. A dancer's career is unfairly short (pace Margot Fonteyn and Alicia Alonso). The moment of dancing for Mr. Taylor is a metaphor for every moment in life, it seems. Just as one hopes to live life to the fullest, so one should dance to the fullest. ''Rumination shouldn't be recommended for young dancers,'' Mr. Taylor writes with typical irony, ''It can lead to heartbreak.''

What he meant, he explained, is that while Bach may not have been ''ahead of his time,'' he was great. In other words, he was Bach.   Paul Taylor himself was once considered resolutely avant-garde.  His experiments in nondance, Dada and formal devices once shocked the modern-dance establishment just over 20 years ago. Very possibly, he realized that these formalist experiments could lead to a race in place, and he chose rather to use the results of his investigations as a tool, not an end. Quality is the criterion, and the consensus on the high level of Mr. Taylor's work - especially in the last six years - is simply undisputable.   Without unfurling any banners, Mr. Taylor has nonetheless never really stopped exploring movement. The highly unusual part of the entire Taylor phenomenon is this: Unlike all other major moderndance choreographers, he has never promulgated a ''Taylor technique.'' It is very difficult for dancers to assimilate the Taylor style as other companies doing Taylor works and prominent ballet dancers, appearing as guests, have discovered. Mr. Taylor once said that it took a new member of his own company some two years to capture that style.

Exactly forty-five minutes long, the Squire's new offering was produced by Southern Education Film Production Service of Athens, Ga., for Columbia University Educational Films, under the auspices of the Georgia Department of Health and with the cooperation of the Hall County, Georgia, Health Department. The result holds little in the way of art, or even entertainment, but no one need be ashamed.The story, enacted by townspeople and health workers, traces the case of a young farmer who, after an off-hand tryst with a lonely waitress, unknowingly transmits an infection to his pregnant wife. A local health campaign, emphasizing free blood tests, unearths the couple's plight and the wife, cured by clinical treatment, is finally delivered of a healthy normal child.This delicate but potentially dramatic little case history unwinds slowly, quietly and unimaginatively under the pedantic direction of Bill Clifford. And the scenarist, George C. Stoney, has seen to it that the painfully inexperienced performers have no \\"big\\" scenes, as might be in order here.\\"Birthright,\\" however, rings true on three significant counts, making it exactly right for precautionary distribution in the type of isolated area it depicts.

Like Jasper Johns's paintings based on a standard map of the United States, they are paintings in the form of maps and not maps in the form of paintings. Measuring as large as 9 by 12 feet, the paintings are textured by innumerable hand-painted place names, laced by roads and borderlines and punctuated by all kinds of signs and symbols. Sometimes you find nongeographical information, like statistics from the last presidential election covering Gulf of Mexico waters in a map of Florida (above). Stylistically, the paintings have a zany, Outsider-like quality, though Ms. Scher is in fact a successful graphic designer whose résumé includes record album covers, a stint as art director for Time Inc. and logos for corporations and nonprofit groups. But though the Howard Finster-like naïveté is a sophisticated act, the paintings still look as if they were made by someone who lacks a clear grasp of the real world's geographical makeup. But then again, who does not have that chronically disoriented feeling that uncharted territories are growing at a faster rate than our ability to map them?

The recording, too, has suffered little in its transmutation from the usual megaphonic speeches to such well modulated tones as are heard in this photoplay.As Lady Westbrook, Pauline Frederick is altogether convincing in the rôle of the woman whose husband, an attorney, believes the evidence rather than his wife when suing her for divorce. She has been made the innocent victim of a trap set by a Major Pollock, impersonated by Lowell Sherman, whose love for her prompts him to compromise her and so free her from Lord Westbrook, the man she really loves.She becomes a \\"notorious lady\\" and leaves England for several years. On her return her small son meets her by chance in a park where they have both gone to ride. He is forbidden to speak to her but carries her image in his mind, calling her his \\"princess.\\"Captain Courtenay, friend of the divorced pair, tries to effect a reconciliation but fails. However, Major Pollock, returned from the tropics and with only several months to live, drinks a poisoned glass of whisky and dies with the written confession of his guilt in his hand.The \\"notorious lady\\" shows the document to her former husband, who begs her forgiveness and leaves his son in her custody. Subsequent scenes show the pair together being taken up by society once more.The story might perhaps be made more poignant, and might seem more natural if the husband should surrender his child without, as the child puts it, having to live happily ever after.The screen play is naturally conceived and soberly performed by the capable cast. Lowell Sherman as the disappointed suitor is capital, as are Conway Tearle and William Courtenay. A juvenile player, Freddie Burke Frederick, while sometimes verging on \\"Sonny Boy\\" antics, manages to stay within logical bounds.

Although you never quite believe in the Cockney widow who wanted her son to be a gentleman, Pauline Lord makes the part oddly attractive in her tremulous and hesitant style of playing. The photoplay suffers chiefly from a muddy script which resorts to such pedestrian devices as the death-bed confession and the letters in the trunk. But it has its moments of quiet humor and warming tenderness when it seems almost worth bothering about.Strictly speaking, the gentility of white tie and tails and politely superior patter in Mayfair drawing rooms impresses you as a wretched sort of destiny, and scarcely worth all the sacrifice. But Clarissa Phipps, who runs a bookshop in the London Slums, doubtless has fed her imagination of Michael Arlen, and in any event she is a strange little creature. She fishes an unpressed and alcoholic aristocrat, Basil Rathbone, from a bench in Hyde Park and furnishes him brandy and lodging so that her boy may assimilate his dashing air.Then she does a remarkable thing. When her son comes of age she informs him that his real mother was a celebrated actress who had left him in her care, and she presents the lad with her life savings, £5,000, on the pretext that it had been left for him. Convinced that his mother must be the retired actress, Billie Burke, he takes lodging with the madcap family over which she rules. Eventually he writes a successful play and falls in love with the well-bred daughter of the house. Poor Clarissa Phipps quietly dies on the evening of his great success, blissful in the conviction that her son has become a real gentleman.Only in the delicate mood-drawing of Miss Lord, and not always then, does the film completely capture the quality of MoInaresque fancy for which it seeks. Mr. Rathbone, sensitive to the spirit of the photoplay, is of admirable assistance as the bibulous aristocrats. Louis Hayward is so much more in character as the young gentleman than as Clarissa's ill-born son that her deathbed confession comes as a distinct shock. Nydia Westman gives a touching performance as his cockney sweetheart, and there are good humorous bits by Miss Burke and Victor Varconi.

Near the end of the 130-minute concert, the Parks Department estimated the crowd at 500,000, an increase of 100,000 over the estimate provided when the concert began and quadruple the expectation earlier in the day.

Desdemona's handkerchief was not in evidence during Tuesday evening's concert performance of \\"Otello\\" by the Chicago Symphony at Carnegie Hall, but another famous one, Luciano Pavarotti's, certainly was. That fact frequently worked to the detriment of a rousing but rather bizarre performance led by Georg Solti.   Mr. Pavarotti, who only last week in Chicago took on the title role for the first time, labored under a handicap: a cold that, a Carnegie official said, forced him to \\"drink and eat continually to keep his throat open.\\" The great Italian tenor, obviously in distress, found it necessary to hide his medicating activities under his towel-size handkerchief, finally resorting during Desdemona's touching \\"Willow Song\\" and \\"Ave Maria\\" to covering his head as if under an inhalator tent. He also had to sit much of the time while singing. Such eye-riveting activity could only weaken operatic illusion, though it testified to Mr. Pavarotti's professionalism in going ahead under duress, or handkerchief.
