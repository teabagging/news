Across the New York area and in cities and towns across the country, bells tolled for the dead in Los Angeles, and spiritual leaders expressed sorrow for those who lost their lives or homes or jobs in the orgy of arson, looting and gunfire that followed the acquittal last Wednesday of four white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of a black motorist, Rodney G. King.   Many condemned the acquittal as a miscarriage of justice, but said violence was not the answer to racial injustice. Others called for radical change in a society infected with institutionalized racism. And amid the grief, some spoke of hope, calling the verdict and its aftermath a turning point, perhaps the harbinger of a new civil rights movement in America.   \\"There is a new kind of shame and pain in the white community,\\" the Rev. Cecil A. Williams told his racially diverse parish at the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in San Francisco. \\"It is time to put that to work, to stop watching the television in pain and get off the couch and take some action.\\"   And in Manhattan, the Rev. Dr. James A. Forbes Jr., senior minister at Riverside Church, made an impassioned plea for a new commitment from his racially mixed congregation, just as the church threw itself into the anti-nuclear movement a decade ago. \\"Could we take this one on?\\" he asked.   It was a golden Sunday over much of the nation. The fresh grass, the new leaves, were apple green in the spring sun, and the day's gentle beauty offered stark contrasts with last week's images of burning and looting, of people running in the glare of flames, of smoldering fires in the half-light looking like the approaches to hell.   Except for gunshots fired at a police car in Los Angeles, calm prevailed yesterday in the riot-affected areas and in other cities that had been wracked by anger and violence in recent days, and many Americans took advantage of the respite to attend church services, to hear spiritual leaders and reflect again on the causes and possible responses to the country's racial divisions. 'We'd Like It to Be Over'    In Los Angeles, services at the Greater Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church were just ending when gunfire erupted outside. Congregants waited briefly until the danger passed, then filed out. \\"We'd like it to be over,\\" said Willie Tagger, a 54-year-old aircraft mechanic. \\"I don't think it will end until Chief Daryl Gates is gone and the four police officers are gone.\\"   Nearby, at St. Vincent's Roman Catholic Church, the Rev. Michael Crotty's voice broke as he told his parish of black, white, Asian and Hispanic members that there was no turning back from what had happened. \\"People are saying, 'Oh, good, we're returning, little by little, to normal,' \\" Mr. Crotty said. \\"We cannot accept what was normal before the violence because what was normal was never that. What was normal was never acceptable.\\"   President Bush, at Camp David, Md., for the weekend, proclaimed the first Thursday in May as a national prayer day, and urged Americans on that day \\"to pray for reconciliation and healing.\\" He scheduled a White House meeting with several Cabinet members for today to discuss \\"long-range solutions for some regional and economic problems.\\"   In Boston, 300 parishioners at the Union United Methodist Church, who wore black ribbons to protest the acquittals, applauded loudly as their pastor, the Rev. Charles R. Stith, blamed the President for the verdict and exhorted them to reject Mr. Bush at the polls in November. 'Bush Must Go!'    \\"The jury didn't see Rodney King -- they saw Willie Horton,\\" Mr. Stith declared. \\"George Bush must go!\\" Mr. Horton, a black man who raped a white woman after being furloughed from a Massachusetts prison, was mentioned in a commercial used by the Bush campaign against his Democratic opponent in 1988. The commercial was widely viewed as politically effective, but many believed that it appealed to racial fears.   Mr. Bush was also criticized at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem by the Rev. Calvin O. Butts, who said the President had reassured whites that law and order was being restored but had failed to take steps to address the underlying injustices that had led to the rioting.   Mr. Butts also criticized the Reagan and Bush Administrations for \\"12 years of neglect\\" of the inner cities and urged his congregants to join a May 16 march on Washington.   \\"I want you to take off from work and go down,\\" Mr. Butts said. \\"We should be nonviolent, but we should stand up to Washington and say, 'Enough is enough!' \\"   Elsewhere in New York, at great cathedrals and small churches, there were prayers for an end to violence, calls from pulpits for renewed efforts to fight racism and praise for Mayor David N. Dinkins and community leaders for helping to avert a major explosion of violence in the city.   John Cardinal O'Connor, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, expressed relief that New York was spared widespread violence and credited Mayor Dinkins and Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown for \\"the sensitivity and the prudence of their response to the understandable fear that began to pervade this city.\\"   A largely Korean-American congregation at St. Paul Chong Ha-Sang, a Roman Catholic chapel in Flushing, Queens, heard the Rev. Joe Veneroso refer to the attacks on Korean-Americans and Korean-American businesses by rioters in Los Angeles last week. \\"Koreans and blacks looked at each other and saw not their brothers and sisters, but their enemies,\\" he said. \\"The rioting may have stopped, but the racial problems have not.\\"   In Atlanta, two ministers told congregations at black churches that their anger over the verdict in the beating case was justified, but that violence was neither the proper response nor the solution to problems of racism.   \\"Violence gets attention, but not lasting change,\\" said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and pastor of Cascade United Methodist Church.    And at Mount Moriah Baptist Church a few miles away, the Rev. Orlando K. Winters said: \\"Be angry, but sin not. Be angry, but don't let the sun set on your anger.\\"   As she left the Mount Moriah services, 81-year-old Beatrice Cook shook her head and said she did not think the rioters knew what they were looking for in the streets. \\"All I know is that they were looking in the wrong direction,\\" she said. \\"As for the verdict, it was wrong, but it didn't make me angry. It just made me hurt.\\"   RIOTS IN LOS ANGELES: The Nation","excerpt":"Pleas for Peace and Justice From Pulpits in Dozen Cities"},{"year":"1960","title":"NYS omnibus law in effect","excerpt":"pleas for permits for new branches filed by 1st Natl City, Chem Bank NY Trust, Chase Manhattan, 7 state-chartered NYC banks and 5 banks outside NYC; details EIGHT CITY BANKS IN SUBURBAN BIDS; Applications Are Made to State and U.S. Agencies Under the New Law ROTH SETS LEGAL STEPS Battle Looms as Chief of Franklin National Vows to Try to Stop Drive EIGHT CITY BANKS IN SUBURBAN BIDS"},{"year":"1991","title":"Federal army tanks battered Croatia's easternmost garrisons with shell fire and warplanes struck its Adriatic coastline today as the army launched the civil war's broadest and harshest assault against the secessionist republic.

Those who feel it is, will probably enjoy \\"Lightnin'\\", this week's feature picture at the Mark Strand. Those who do not had better stay away. For \\"Lightnin'\\" just rambles along. There is nothing \\"thrilling\\" or \\"pulsating\\" or \\"nerve-racking\\" about it. \\"Breath-taking climaxes\\" are entirely lacking and nobody risks his, her or its life during the whole course of the proceedings.Instead, \\"Lightnin'\\" simply wanders tranquilly along a path beside which grow flowers of simple human happenings, now and then stopping to pick one. It is a genuine old-fashioned garden. None but the flowers that have always existed grow there. You never get a glimpse over the hedge into the plots where flourish those strange and exotic blossoms the movies have bur-banked into being. These flowers are all simple and fragrant and real.If it had not been for the great success of the play \\"Lightnin'\\" they probably would never have attempted to put just such a picture as this on the screen. It needs the advantage of a favorable predisposition such as the prestige of the stage production gives it. For to put on a photoplay which deals mostly with character and very little with events is a hazardous undertaking. Movie audiences, trained in another school of observation, are not altogether ready for such an experience. They must be brought gradually to the conception that the little things that happen in real life are fit material for them to enjoy on the screen. One does not doubt they enjoy them, but they probably feel they ought make a guilty secret of their enjoyment. Some day, of course, they will not feel that way. There are lots of people who are going to be surprised when they find out how soon that day is coming.So if you enjoy \\"Lightnin'\\", we counsel you to keep it to yourself. Do not talk about your pleasure except among friends you feel sure of, because you may be thought queer. This picture, you know, is nothing whatever but an unpretentious recital of some of the little things that happen every day. At the same time, if we were a moving-picture director, we should probably feel a lot prouder of having done it than of having filmed any one of a hundred other productions that might be mentioned.While he was at it, Mr. Ford might, however, have shortened it just a bit. One may have a little too much of even a good thing. There are moments when one feels the beginning and the end of the piece are separated too far for complete comfort, that the middle, in other words, is somewhat too like that traditionally ascribed to an alderman to allow us to call the figure perfect.At the same time Mr. Ford has done a difficult job mighty well. Too much praise cannot be given for the way he has chosen his material out of the play and invented other material in keeping, and for the taste he has displayed and shrewd observation of the entertaining foibles of everyday humanity. The cast he has assembled is just about perfect for the task in hand. Jay Hunt gives a noteworthy performance in the title role, conveying through the difficult medium of the screen an amazing number of the touches that made the character so popular on the stage with the aid of speech. Edythe Chapman does especially well with the figure of \\"Ma\\" Jones. Otis Harlan is unforgettable as Zeb, the disreputable crony of \\"Lightnin'\\". Madge Bellamy and Wallace McDonald do the juvenile r√¥les capitally and J. Farrett MacDonald and Ethel Clayton contribute excellent figures.There is plenty of real humor and genuine pathos in \\"Lightnin'\\". If you insist on more complicated emotions, try elsewhere.The musical program at the Strand this week is excellent. It includes the first performance of an orchestral composition, \\"Ethiopian Rhapsody,\\" by Lucius Homer, some excellent singing by Kitty McLaughlin and Edward Albano, an interesting piano duo by the Chanal Sisters, who dare to bring whole-tone harmonizations to Broadway, but suffer by the generally characterless nature of their numbers, and some singing of Russian folk-songs by the Eight Volga Singers, whom it is worth crossing Broadway to hear.

And, indeed, there is more than that‚Äîfor, not content with just talking, he has become all at once a ventriloquist, an old woman, a dummy, a parrot and a young girl. In other words, he has done enough in one picture to provide a year's bread and butter to the wistfully humorous authors of Chaney jokes.There is so much of the actor that it becomes at times a trifle confusing","excerpt":"pleasantly, of course. Mr. Chaney speaks as Echo, then answers by way of the dummy. Far off in a crowd is a comment from Mr. Chaney the ventriloquist. Later Mr. Chaney‚Äîthe old woman‚Äîcarries on a bright conversation with Mr. Chaney the girl. A parrot chatters, but beneath the ruffled yellow feathers lies‚ÄîMr. Chaney. Possibly he also provides some of the off-stage noises; one can never tell.While \\"The Unholy Three\\" is notable as a vehicle for the actor's vocal gymnastics, those persons whose memories carry them back several years might prefer the silent version to the present one. The theme of the play‚Äîwith its increasing overtone of horror‚Äîis made a bit less gripping by its more audible additions. In other words, the prelude of a threatened murder has a tendency to take away drama from the murder itself. Be that as it may, the Capitol's audience yesterday obviously liked it.Mr. Chaney has made a further contribution to the modern motion picture‚Äîalthough it may be a bit indelicate to mention it here. Like the two dozen students who swam the Hellespont and so ruined the beautiful legend forever, he has destroyed the effect of the phrase, \\"See your favorite actor; he speaks.\\" For while others were loudly proclaiming the finding of a forgotten note, he quietly went fishing and came back with five. The industry will never be the same again.The story of \\"The Unholy Three\\" starts with a carnival. Echo is the ventriloquist in charge of the dummy, and Hercules and the Midget are other performers. The latter ultimately starts a fight with a patron, the police are called, and there soon is no more carnival. So the trio‚Äîhelped by Rosie, who has been a pickpocket for Echo‚Äîdecide to go into crime in a serious way. They plan to call themselves \\"The Unholy Three,\\" and one of their assets is a large gorilla.Taking hold of a pet shop as a cloak for their unpleasant activities, Echo becomes the old lady who owns it; Hercules changes into her son-in-law, and Midget, cigar and all, is the grandchild. Echo gives his ventriloquist voice to otherwise silent parrots, and when wealthy people buy them he makes the delivery and so spies out such items as necklaces and rings.Then things begin to happen rather suddenly. Rosie falls in love with Hector, an innocent clerk in the pet shop, and Hercules and his tiny companion commit a murder. The action is traced to the shop, so the conspirators put the proceeds in Hector's room, where the police find them. The young man is near the end of the road to the chair when Echo‚Äîas the grandmother‚Äîtakes the witness stand in his defense. The plot is discovered, but as Hercules has been killed by the gorilla and Midget by Hercules, Echo gets only five years. Rosie and Hector go away together.Lila Lee has the r√¥le of Rosie and Elliott Nugent that of Hector. Harry Earles is Midget and Ivan Linow the tremendous Hercules. The play is based on the book by Clarence Aaron Robbins, and J. C. and Elliott Nugent provided the continuity and the dialogue.The Travel-talk film is called \\"Gateway to India\\" and it is about Bombay.

Striding across the hotel lobby, he looks like some mirage come to life, some bare-chested superhero who stepped shimmering from the pages of a Marvel comic book. He looks too big for the room. He looks as if he owned the room. \\"I'm Fabio,\\" he says, gazing down with Mel Gibson-blue eyes and a face that looks as if it were chiseled from rock. \\"It's nice to meet you, sweetie.\\"   If you don't know who Fabio (pronounced FAH-bee-o) is, you've likely seen him someplace: grasping an ingenue on a romance novel's cover, perhaps, or appearing on television talk shows or, increasingly, going to the type of party covered by People magazine. With his income of several million dollars a year, he has been called the highest-paid male model in the world. And though he sometimes seems like a celebrity's celebrity, his presence in this Mexican resort town, where he is filming a new television series, is part of Fabio's own rigorous regimen to transform himself into a one-word household name, bigger than Madonna, bigger even than Arnold.

Rumsfeld found himself on the defensive while fielding questions from Iraq-bound troops who complained that they were being sent into combat with insufficient protection and aging equipment. The complaints are likely to revive accusations that the Bush administration failed to anticipate the tenacious insurgency.   A1    Iraq's leading Shiite political groups agreed to unite under a single banner, a move that could help them win a dominant share of votes in the national elections. Sseveral Sunni parties registered to field candidates. The two decisions appeared to strengthen the chances of a January vote, despite continuing violence.   A18    The military has disciplined four members of a Special Operations unit for abusing detainees at a Baghdad interrogation camp earlier this year. The exact penalties were not disclosed nor their identities.   A18    Secretary of State Colin L. Powell urged Europeans to get over their opposition to the Iraq war so they could ''support the Iraqi people.'' American officials laid out new obligations they were asking Europe to accept -- in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the West Bank and Gaza.   A18    Libya Revising Execution View  Libya will not execute five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor who were sentenced to death earlier this year for infecting more than 400 children with H.I.V. in 1998. The son of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, said the country would soon pass new laws to limit capital punishment.   A17    Political Overhaul in Ukraine  President Leonid D. Kuchma of Ukraine and the country's Parliament adopted an overhaul of the political system. The agreement smoothed the way for a new runoff, but the winner of that contest will inherit fewer powers.   A6    NATIONAL   A24-39    Treasury Secretary Is Asked to Stay on Job  President Bush asked Treasury Secretary John W. Snow to remain in his job, the White House said, after weeks in which Republicans close to the White House had spoken openly about Mr. Snow's impending departure and administration officials were interviewing possible successors.   A1    Gay Rights Strategy Dispute  Leaders of the gay rights movement are embroiled in a bitter and increasingly public debate over whether they should moderate their goals after 11 states approved constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex marriages in November.   A1    Union Debate Heats Up  The Teamsters union heated up the debate over reshaping the labor movement by proposing to cut the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s budget and to finance a four-year campaign of political and union organizing in swing states to help elect a pro-labor president.   A37    Skepticism in Source Case  A three-judge panel of the federal appeals court in Washington, hearing arguments on whether two journalists should be jailed for refusing to name their confidential sources to a grand jury, seemed to reject their main argument, which is based on the First Amendment.   A28    Spy Bill Passes Senate  The Senate voted to approve a landmark bill to restructure the nation's intelligence community, completing Congressional action on a measure backed by President Bush that is intended to put an end to the sort of intelligence lapses that plagued the nation's spy agencies before the Sept. 11 attacks.   A36    The intelligence overhaul approved by the Senate reorganizes the way the states grant driver's licenses, a change that civil liberties advocates and some security experts say could have far-reaching consequences.   A36    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-12    Three States Suffer High Death Toll in Iraq  Since Nov. 7, when the attack on Falluja began, 19 servicemen from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have been killed in Iraq, making it the deadliest term for soldiers from those three states since the start of the war.   A1    New Drug Law Questioned  Advocates for prison reform criticized the Legislature's decision to ease New York State's severe drug sentencing laws, contending that the changes may reduce public pressure for a more comprehensive overhaul in the way New York treats drug offenders.   B1    Comptroller Rules Out Run  William C. Thompson Jr., the New York City comptroller, who was considered among the most formidable potential opponents to Michael R. Bloomberg in next year's mayoral race, has decided not to run, aides to Mr. Thompson said.

It would take a lost soul indeed not to respond to the vigor and poignancy of the 40 objects on display in this quiet, beautiful show. Drawn in large part from Columbia's own Asian holdings, they have been organized by David A. Sensabaugh of the art history department, with the help of several graduate students in Chinese art. The results, meticulously installed and documented, illustrate both how engaging objects of less-than-masterpiece quality can be when put to the service of a single theme, and how dramatically that material can illuminate the society that produced it.

He decided that he would mark off the length in lengths of the shortest Lambda Chi Alpha pledge in the class of '62, Oliver R.
