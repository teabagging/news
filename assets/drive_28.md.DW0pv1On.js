He plays Michael Jennings, a hotshot inventor who steals the ideas and properties of other corporations, and refines them for competitors. For legal reasons, Michael gets his mind wiped clean of the theft by a dangerous medical process that nearly boils his brain. This procedure also eliminates Michael's memory of the entire period he spent at work — all for a paycheck.  When a new, less dangerous procedure comes along — one that can safely do away with three years, instead of a few months — Michael is invited by an old friend to get involved in a project that could potentially change the world, and net Michael an eight-figure income. He will come out three years later with a larger bank balance and no idea of his accomplishments.

With great wisdom, and with selfless dedication and devotion for more than two decades, he was the guiding spirit in the Library's resurgence from financial difficulties in the 1970's and helped move the Library into a new century, embodying his vision as a university of the people without equal. Under Mr. Heiskell's leadership, the Library raised over $300 million in the 1980's, and he was directly and instrumentally responsible for securing financial support from diverse public and private sources, in addition to his own generous philanthropy. His great achievements included the restoration of the landmark Library building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street to its original grandeur, the upgrading of many of the Branch Libraries in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island","excerpt":"improved access to the Library's great research collections; and the revival of the preservation program. He helped expand the Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and strengthen the endowment for The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. His interest in the Library's immediate surroundings led him to form the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, responsible for a comprehensive renovation of the Park, and he helped build 44 miles of new storage for the research collections in underground book stacks beneath the Park. The Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library, a facility dedicated to serving the blind, visually impaired, and others unable to read standard print material, is named in his honor to recognize his great energy and commitment in making this facility a reality. New York is a better place because of Andrew Heiskell, for his creation of beautiful public spaces, his drive to provide democratic access to knowledge, and his unwavering support of cultural institutions and their role in bettering society. We owe him our deepest, most profound thanks, and we are grateful to have been touched by a man of such extraordinary vision and goodness. We extend our deepest sympathies to Marian Heiskell and to all members of Andrew's family. Mrs. Vincent Astor, Honorary Chairman Samuel C.

It is a wonder fully verbal play, toying with words as if they were firecrackers, and sentences as if they were bombs. Of all his plays, I'm inclined to think &#8216;What the Butler Saw&#8217; is the most riotously funny. The play has its rough moments&#8212;I believe it was not its final draft at Orton's death&#8212;but as a whole it dazzles. Joseph Hardy is to be congratu lated for the cool and classic approach of his staging, which makes this by far the most successful Orton production seen in New York. Laurence Luck inbill has just the right approach to the belea guered psychiatrist; Jan Farrand is equally comical ly adept, and Diana Davila, Lucian Scott, Tom Rosqui and Charles Murphy all Jones, pleased eight of the nine critics who reviewed it, although two had reser vations. Clive Barnes: &#8220;I forget when it was that I first read Colette, but I know I instantly fell in love with her. In Miss Cald well's performance I can see just what it was that made me adore this writer. Miss Caldwell is a delight and her performance, cal culatedly and neatly stagy, is a privilege to watch. What of the play? The play starts strongly enough, but in the second act the chaos of too many succeeding years takes command. The first act sounds like a biog raphy, the second like a scurried digest. Gerald Freedman has staged the show with a sense of pe riod not impaired by a very clear sense of reverence for his subject. It is Miss Caldwell's show, but she is surrounded by an unusual ly good cast. Mildred Dun nock is marvelous as Colette's mother and Charles Siebert, Barry Bost wick and Keene Curtis also scored.

On its album, Los Lobos's songs still bounce and roll along, as the band wields electric and acoustic guitars plus such norteno instruments as accordion and the guitar-like bajo sexto, guitarron and quinto.

The misnomer dates from the 1850's, when ''gold seekers from the East Coast rushing to California,'' he writes, ''picked up the straw hats on their way west, and - for those who returned home - on their way back as well.'' 300 YEARS OLD AND NEVER OUT OF STYLE"},{"year":"2005","title":"The Grade-B horror pictures made in the 1940's for RKO by the producer and writer Val Lewton -- several of them in collaboration with the director Jacques Tourneur -- may have been put together on the run and with pocket change. But those are the only things remotely cheap about them. Lewton was as fascinated by monsters as his colleagues over at that other studio, Universal, were. But his monsters tend to walk around in street clothes, with regular, everyday faces: the fact that they could be anyone only reinforces the idea that they could be us. ''Cat People'' (1942) and ''I Walked With a Zombie'' (1943), both directed by Tourneur, are horror pictures rewritten to resemble 18th-century seduction verse. Their allure is sensual and unnerving, and their visual poetry alone has a velvety lushness: in ''Zombie,'' whispering slivers of light streak through the slatted blinds of a Caribbean mansion, like fingers reaching out in the darkness","excerpt":"in ''Cat People,'' a troubled young wife (Simone Simon, who has the face of a petulant Persian kitten) stares out her window on a moonlit night, shivering not at the thought of what might be out there, but at what might be inside her. This collection includes those two pictures, as well as the seven others Lewton made for RKO (and a biographical documentary). Together they're a treasure chest of skillful shoestring filmmaking, a sterling example of how much you can accomplish with brains and good lighting. The A-list is for unimaginative overachievers; Lewton understood the melancholy joy of being B.

This is hardly the only evidence that Mr. Norris flings himself into film making wholeheartedly. Only eight years after ''Good Guys Wear Black,'' his first feature, Mr. Norris has become a one-man cottage industry. By August, when his ''Invasion U.S.A.'' opens, he will have had four films released in New York in less than a year.   At the Plaza Hotel, in a suite large enough for him to practice his karate, Mr. Norris spoke excitedly about future projects. In Orion's ''Code of Silence,'' which opens next Friday, he plays a police detective involved in an escalating drug war","excerpt":"in ''Invasion U.S.A.'' he plays the only thing between the American citizenry and a band of foreign terrorists determined to blow up shopping malls. He also anticipates, as part of his six-picture deal with Cannon Films, making an action comedy about kick-boxing, which is a form of fighting that involves gloves on both hands and feet. Mr. Norris was once the world kick-boxing champion, before he realized that movie stardom might be an even better occupation. AT THE MOVIES"},{"year":"1998","title":"''Where are you from?'' It's a pretty familiar question, an icebreaker of sorts, meant to elicit a simple response and to keep the conversation driving toward commonality and connection. Unless, of course, where you're from conflicts with what you look like. Then the question is more pointed -- coded -- a falsely casual way of asking not who but what you are. And for a growing number of people living in America's post-integration miasma, What am I? is the question that's being asked, debated, turned over, chewed upon and spat back out again.    Nowhere is this clearer than in a number of novels -- some recently published (Danzy Senna's ''Caucasia'') and some scheduled to appear in the coming months (Ruth L. Ozeki's ''My Year of Meats,'' Nicole Mones's ''Lost in Translation'' and ''The Farming of Bones,'' by Edwidge Danticat). These are but a few of the offerings from a new generation of mostly female writers exploring cross-cultural experience. In ''Lost in Translation,'' a young white American tries to discover herself through a vain attempt to ''become'' Chinese","excerpt":"in ''My Year of Meats,'' a half-Japanese, half-white TV producer searches for vestiges of small-town America, and in ''The Farming of Bones,'' a Haitian woman struggles to survive in the Trujillo-dominated Dominican Republic.

Most of the stories in AN EXPLANATION FOR CHAOS (Soho, $21) are told from the point of view of an outsider on the inside: a younger sister watching her elder siblings grow, a shy girl analyzing a more ''popular'' friend's interaction with adults or an only child serving as the pivot in an evolving divorce. These attentive children watch their parents and others carefully, translating observations into explanations: sometimes right, sometimes wrong, but always illuminating. In ''The Private Life of Robert Schumann,'' a girl uncovers a romance between her music teacher and the class outcast, her tangential initiation into the world of adult sexuality","excerpt":"in ''Rehoboth Beach'' a pair of young sisters jealously watch their older sister start, enjoy and then destroy an affair with a ''gentleman philosopher,'' a man the younger sisters are willing to ''kidnap'' to keep. And in the title story a woman is interrogated by an unknown questioner about her relationship with her father; despite her anger and frustration with his flaws, she cannot avoid acknowledging the depth of her love. A careful, subtle writer, Ms. Schumacher draws full characters with just a few lines, gently defining the fluid zone in which innocence gives way to understanding.

Though any discerning reader of Paul Theroux's novels and travel books recognizes that he is a writer who commands language with admirable intelligence and grace, it may be less evident that his writing is much more than sophisticated entertainment. He is clearly a novelist with predecessors - other writers whose styles and genres he appropriates and exploits - and these predecessors, though often considerable, are not always the kind we expect an ambitious and sober young writer to emulate. In ''The Family Arsenal,'' for instance, Theroux seems equally indebted to the Conrad of ''The Secret Agent,'' the young Graham Greene and any number of American detective story writers. In ''The Black House'' he plays with the stuff of popular Gothic novels","excerpt":"in ''Saint Jack'' and ''The Consul's File,'' he draws on a tradition of Anglo-colonial fiction that includes Somerset Maugham and Rudyard Kipling as well as E.M.

In ''The Devil'' (1977), he tracked old Nick from antiquity through the New Testament","excerpt":"in ''Satan'' (1981), he followed him through the fifth century; ''Lucifer'' brings him up to the 16th, and a fourth volume is in the works. Mr. Russell begins ''Lucifer'' with the speculations of a sixth-century Serbian monk who opens the door onto Byzantine diabology. Byzantine devils were interesting but tame. It was in the West that they got really vicious - and sometimes comic. In this account they romp through plays, poetry and legends, belch brimstone from pulpits and torture saints and witches in ingenious hells. But it is the devil in the mind that is important to Mr. Russell. He recounts theolo-gians' arguments with an economy and clarity that makes them exciting. And his conclusion is a surprise - the Devil was sidelined not by skeptics but by St. Anselm of Bec and St. Thomas Aquinas who argued that Christ's death is not a ransom of captive sinners but an act of satisfaction to God for mankind's original sin; their resolution of the problem of evil and salvation in a world ruled by a just God made Lucifer a bit irrelevant in theology.

But few topics are more pressing of late, from the chronic debate over climate change to the acute crises surrounding Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. Even so, the choreographer Brenda Way had her doubts when the composer Jack Perla suggested a piece about global warming. ''I couldn't see a place for this in a dance,'' Ms. Way, the artistic director of ODC/San Francisco, remembers thinking. Then one evening she had a eureka moment: a block of ice suspended onstage, melting ominously above oblivious dancers. ''That was sort of interesting to me,'' she said. The darkly humorous ''On a Train Heading South,'' which has its New York premiere on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater, uses not one but 12 blocks of ice.

Wolfe convened the best-loved icons of black American culture and reduced them to an evanescent heap.   The ''exhibits'' in ''The Colored Museum,'' Mr. Wolfe's play that opened Sunday at the Public Theater to enthusiastic notices, are scenes, highbrow and lowdown, drawn from that culture and filtered through a prism of rage: In the first, for example, an airline attendant on ''celebrity slaveship'' instructs the passengers on the proper way to fasten their shackles","excerpt":"in ''The Last Mama-on-the-Couch Play,'' Mr. Wolfe deftly parodies black realism (''A Raisin in the Sun''), black existentialism (''For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf'') and black musicals (''Your Arms Too Short to Box With God'').   ''I call 'The Colored Museum' an exorcism and a party,'' the 32-year-old playwright said in an interview yesterday.

By Irving Howe. 99 pp. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. $12.50. IS America a success? The way to find out, said Henry Adams in a famous passage Irving Howe quotes early in this little book, is by asking whether American ''social power'' is being transformed into ''the higher forms of thought.'' Is the country giving ''new life to religion and art''? Are we creating and maintaining ''in the mass of mankind those habits of mind which . . . hitherto belonged to men of science alone''? In Adams's opinion nothing less than a revolution of spirit - a far-ranging democratization of culture - would be necessary for complete American fulfillment.   In Mr. Howe's opinion Ralph Waldo Emerson is the chief American spokesman for such a revolution","excerpt":"in ''The Poet,'' ''The American Scholar'' and other permanent utterances, Emerson envisioned cultural complements to democratic political institutions - ways of giving new life to religion and art.

The teenage rapper Bow Wow stars in ''Bow'' (WB)","excerpt":"in ''The Show With AJ Calloway'' (UPN), the host of BET's ''106 & Park'' sends up his own brand of talk show. ''Notorious'' (NBC), a single-camera, no-laugh-track sitcom, follows the life of Tori Spelling, formerly of ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' and now and forever the daughter of Aaron Spelling, the television mogul. Kate Aurthur talked to Ms. Spelling, who is also an executive producer of the series, about the benefits of playing yourself.    Why this show?  Every year since ''90210'' I've done a comedy pilot. And it's kind of the same response every year: ''Oh you're really funny, but we just can't see Tori Spelling playing a struggling waitress or a struggling shoe saleswoman. We just see you.''    So how did it happen?  I went to all the networks and pitched them my life. It wasn't really a story, I just said, ''My life is basically a sitcom.'' I had with me a huge notebook of every bad tabloid story that has ever run on me. They were like: ''Oh my God, are you O.K. with this? You're so willing to go there.'' I was like, ''I'm more than O.K.'' For the first time, I'm going to be laughing with people laughing at me.    What role has your father played?  I can't tell you how many times I heard this while making this pilot: ''Oh, that's so great you're making a pilot. It's a Spelling show, right?'' Over and over. I did one thing for my father, ''90210,'' and it was a huge success for 10 years. But I've never done another thing for him since.    What kinds of things happen to you that you want to include on the show?  On the way home from my honeymoon, at the airport, I was like, ''Ooh, American tabloids, I haven't seen them in three weeks.'' The first one I pick up, on the cover is like ''Guess Who Has Cellulite?'' and it's a picture of me. I had been sitting on a wicker chair and it was a 100-degree day. I had imprints all over the back of my legs. The pictures started in The Enquirer, then it went to Star magazine and as recently as I think a month ago it was in In Touch.

When the production had its premiere, in 1987, it was noted that the City Opera was presenting the work with its original German text for the first time. The company maintained its German version for three seasons, before sending the production into storage. But this season it is returning to its earlier practice of offering it in English.   The translation, by Andrew Porter, is thoroughly singable, and it strikes an artful balance between the work's comic and serious currents.

Audiences who remember the 1969 Sydney Pollack movie may experience an acute sense of deja vu watching \\"Marathon Dancing,\\" the director Anne Bogart's fiercely cynical, one-note treatment of the same subject. But though the essential themes of the works are similar, Ms. Bogart takes a far more detached, typically Brechtian view of the phenomenon.

Balanchine's inspiration is evident in the sweet-spirited formality of the ballet. But \\"Scotch Symphony\\" is also a loving, slightly teasing homage to 19th-century Romantic ballet and its conventions. And that was made clear in a stylish performance of the work by the New York City Ballet on Saturday evening at the New York State Theater.

Grand, 76 East 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-0600. It's common practice for grungy, punkish bands to pilfer the past and rehash it with a heavy dose of irony. Steel Pole Bath Tub, from Montana via San Francisco, revives late-1960's paranoia. While bass and drums chug out a grinding, post-industrialist rhythm and the guitars sputter and shriek feedback and distortion, Michael Morasky, one of the band's three singers, spins grim tales that read like James Ellroy on acid. In \\"594,\\" from the band's latest album, \\"The Miracle of Sound in Motion\\" (Boner Records), a psycho sits in the window of his room with a gun pointed at the street","excerpt":"in \\"Bozeman,\\" a staticky voice whispers, \\"They got your mind controlled.\\" Steel Pole Bath Tub's malice is just understated enough not to seem silly, and the grooves are deep and tight.

Electric Romanticism    Springhouse, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-4064. Ever since the late 1970's, British bands from the Buzzcocks to Felt to Jesus and Mary Chain have toyed with the process of doctoring pop hooks with thick layers of electric guitar. Springhouse, from New York City, updates the formula with a new romanticism. On \\"Postcards From the Arctic\\" (Caroline), the band's latest album, the vocalist Mitch Friedland sings with supreme detachment, as if he wants to look down on his angst from above. The melodies are pretty and wistful, the sentiments dizzying and sad; at its best, as in \\"Asphalt Angels,\\" Springhouse captures and holds onto a fleeting sense of melancholy. Tonight at 10. Admission is $6. Brooklyn Blues    The Senders, Sideshows by the Seashore, Boardwalk at West 12th Street, Coney Island, Brooklyn, (718) 372-5159. One of the few New York bands to have survived the rigors of the 1970's and 80's, the Senders still bash out a classic blend of blues, rhythm-and-blues and ornery attitude that long ago crystallized into the first wave of punk rock. The brawny, no-nonsense approach and dedication to tradition seems almost innocent when compared with today's young punks, the way 60's soul seems innocent compared to hip-hop; it's a style that lingers outside the mainstream, a little bit tougher than time and trends.

It is now, at 50 years old, a physiognomy film makers find eloquent.    \\"John's got a tremendous sadness in his eyes,\\" says David Puttnam, the producer. \\"And that may be an actor's greatest asset, because he can convey pain.\\"    Such empathy, of course, is born principally of experience. John Hurt's art -- his critically acclaimed ability to project, imaginatively, the most profound moments in life -- has been dearly won. By his own reckoning, and by the accounts of those close to him, Hurt has known privation, wantonness and great loss -- the artist's classic vicissitudes.\\" In short, says Puttnam, \\"He's led an extraordinary life.    HERE ON THE CANADIAN PRAIRIE, JOHN HURT seems at peace. At the moment, he is sitting in a small motor home that serves as a dressing room on the broad plains of southern Alberta, a boundless table top of Kelly green and harvest gold beneath a dome of blue. It is a warm day under a late-summer sun, and Hurt is at work on a movie entitled \\"Lapse of Memory,\\" an adaptation by the director Patrick Dewolf of \\"I Am the Cheese,\\" a psychological thriller by Robert Cormier.    \\"Lapse of Memory\\" is the actor's 36th feature film. The quality of these movies has been mixed -- from a piece of foolishness called \\"Partners,\\" in 1982, in which he played a homosexual policeman, to Michael Radford's gritty remake of \\"1984,\\" in which Hurt is Orwell's hero, Winston Smith. But good vehicle or bad, Hurt's performances across the last 28 years have, almost without exception, been admired.    He has twice been nominated for an Academy Award: in 1978 for his portrayal of a degenerate narcotics addict in David Puttnam's \\"Midnight Express\\" and in 1981 for the lead role of John Merrick in \\"The Elephant Man.\\" On television, as Quentin Crisp in \\"The Naked Civil Servant\\" and Caligula in \\"I, Claudius,\\" he was, according to John J. O'Connor of The New York Times, \\"brilliant\\" and \\"daring and memorable.\\"    Even the industry's top directors seem to hold him in awe.   \\"John Hurt is simply the greatest actor in the world,\\" says David Lynch, who directed \\"The Elephant Man.\\"    Jim Sheridan, the director of \\"My Left Foot,\\" worked with Hurt on \\"The Field,\\" which opens Dec. 21, and stars Richard Harris and Tom Berenger. He says Hurt is \\"like a snooker player -- deadly accurate.\\"    For his part, Hurt thinks of himself as a character actor, but in the European, rather than the Hollywood, mold. In America, character actors are apt to assume one character -- the lovable sot, the fumbling intellectual -- for the life of their career. Abroad, however, \\"a character actor,\\" says Hurt, \\"is someone who can play, literally, very different characters.\\" And his list of personas is a long one.    In Laurence Olivier's \\"King Lear,\\" he played the Fool. In \\"10 Rillington Place,\\" he played a man hanged for a murder he did not commit","excerpt":"in \\"Champions,\\" a jockey afflicted with cancer; in \\"Shout,\\" a cuckolded church organist; in \\"A Man for All Seasons,\\" the duplicitous Richard Rich, and in \\"Scandal,\\" Stephen Ward, the osteopath at the center of the so-called Profumo affair, Britain's infamous imbroglio of politics and sex. (Hurt likes to joke that for a moment after \\"The Elephant Man,\\" he thought he was in danger of being typecast: \\"What would you think would be the first part that was offered me following 'Elephant Man?' Try 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame.' \\")    And yet, at closer look, perhaps the roles he elects to play are not as varied as they seem. At the least, his characters are unorthodox; at the most, stubbornly eccentric. Witness Quentin Crisp's flamboyance, Winston Smith's quiet anarchy, Stephen Ward's celebration of sex.    \\"There isn't such a thing as a regular guy,\\" Hurt says, \\"not from the point of view of drama, but, yes, I am interested in characters who are misunderstood.\\"    Thus, he is usually an actor on the edge. \\"All those parts demand vulnerability, yes, the ability to expose things that would not normally be seen,\\" he says. \\"That's what makes them exciting.\\"    By contrast, the man who now sits in the trailer swatting at large black flies and waiting to be called out into the prairie sun for the next shot is retiring and rarely self-revealing.    JUST AFTER HIS 17TH birthday, John Hurt approached his parents. \\"Can't I go to acting school?\\" he asked.    His mother, an amateur actress, had trod the boards in a local troupe. His father, a vicar, emoted from the pulpit. But, to his parents, acting was not a fit profession. \\"They thought it represented something risque and populist,\\" Hurt recalls. \\"It was out of the question.\\"    So he went to art school instead, to learn to paint and draw; his parents hoped he might eventually teach. Three or four years passed. He still burned to act. Then, one night at a hamburger stand in London, he stumbled on a path to the stage.    \\"I met these two Australian girls who were with Lucillio's Spanish Traveling Dance Band and they invited me to a party,\\" he recalls. \\"Well, I had some wine and started fooling around, doing impressions and bits. All of a sudden one of them said, 'You ought to be an actor.' I said, 'How?' She said, 'Audition for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.'   \\"At the time, 1960, I was penniless, living in a one-room basement flat where the walls ran with damp. For two days before the audition, I went without food. I fell asleep on the steps of the theater waiting for the audition.  When I got on, I was so nervous and undernourished, I dried up 20 times during my speeches. Luckily they weren't looking for polished performers and I got a scholarship.\\"    Among his contemporaries at the prestigious academy were Sarah Miles, Tom Courtenay and Ian McShane. Students were taught classic dramatic technique -- to use their imagination in creating a role, to interpret a part from the script, rather than build an analogue based on observation and life, the way of the so-called Method school of acting that was then taking hold across the Atlantic.    By 1963, he had made a number of appearances on the London stage, and that year the critics named him Britain's most promising newcomer. By the end of 1966, he had been married and divorced, had appeared in several films, among them \\"A Man for All Seasons,\\" and had performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company in David Mercer's \\"Belcher's Luck.\\"    In 1967, he met Marie-Lise Volpeliere-Pierrot, a French model with whom, it quickly became clear, he expected to spend the rest of his life. Lise, as everyone called her -- long-necked, dark-haired, beautiful -- became much more than a lover and companion. Theirs was not a romance exactly, but according to those who knew the two, more of a spiritual bonding.    \\"She was an odd combination, not technically his wife, but his wife, also his best critic, his best friend,\\" says one of Hurt's oldest friends, Edgar Bronfman Jr., the president of Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, whom Hurt met on a film set in 1971. \\"And because they were so involved with each other in so many areas, they had a mercurial relationship.\\"    They were \\"like brother and sister,\\" says Don Boyd, a British director and for the last 15 years part of Hurt's small personal circle. \\"Lise of all the people I've seen with John was the least awe-struck by his personality. And she was good at coping with his drinking habit. At one stage, she told him, 'If you continue to drink, you're going to die.' \\"    On the morning of Jan. 15, 1983, \\"cold, wet, nasty altogether,\\" remembers Hurt, the couple went horseback riding close to their house at Ascot Under Wychwood near Oxford. Hurt was about to begin \\"Champions,\\" in which he would play the part of a jockey. \\"I needed to get my seat back,\\" he recalls. \\"We'd been out about 40 minutes. The horses weren't getting on that well. One put its foot in a hole, stumbled and set the other horse off, then both went crashing off down the lane. There were walls on either side of us and we couldn't get off of the road. Suddenly I got thrown; Lise went belting off, trying to catch my mount. All at once, she lost her stirrup, came out the back door and landed on her head in the middle of the road. She went into a coma at the hospital and never came out.\\" She died that day. \\"We had been together for 16 years and that was that.\\"    The loss, according to Bronfman, Boyd and others, set the actor spinning.    HURT IS A LEAN FIGURE, 5 feet 9 inches, 145 pounds, with straight auburn hair, tousled a bit in front, brown eyes, a freckled almost ruddy complexion and a walk that is tentative, sometimes cautious.    He speaks in the baritone of a country vicar, a voice, in fact, that on the telephone is a dead ringer for his father's. Since he is possessed by the urge to perform, he delights in telling stories and can usually spin a simple anecdote into a small set piece.    Here, for example, Richard Attenborough, the actor and director, summons him to a screen test for the lead role in \\"Gandhi\\":    \\"I went down there and they did the most cursory makeup job. Then they put me in a nappy. Well, I looked like a Welsh rugby player with a diaper, wearing brown boot polish on my body, with my hair scrabbled back and talking 'like dis, you know?' After Ben Kingsley got the part, Attenborough rang back, apologized and said, 'It was just the makeup, Johnny darling' -- he talks like that -- 'just the makeup, deary, really, seriously, you could play it standing on your head, lovey.' At the time, I thought, 'How on earth do you play Gandhi standing on your head?' \\"    Just now, returning to the trailer from the set -- a hollow of green in a provincial park near the Montana border -- the good-natured storyteller is now brimming with bile.    One of his co-players, Matthew Mackay, a nervous 16-year-old from Montreal, in his first major part in a feature film, has nettled the star. The offense took place during a scene in which Hurt was required to run through the park with Mackay chasing him on a bicycle. After the fourth take, Hurt, panting, turned and asked the director if he wanted more expression.    \\"Do you want me to act,\\" he asked Dewolf, \\"or just run?\\" \\"Just run,\\" came the reply.    And it was then that Mackay, no doubt meaning nothing more than mischief, asserted himself.    \\"That's O.K., John,\\" he said, impertinence ringing from every word, \\"you can leave the acting to me.\\"   And now, in the trailer, Hurt is fuming: \\"That little bugger,\\" he says, teeth clenched, \\"Larry Olivier would have eaten him alive for that.\\"    \\"WHEN I SAY THAT ACTING IS just a rather more sophisticated way of playing cowboys and Indians,\\" says Hurt, \\"it's my way of trying to quash all the pretentious crap that's said about acting. What I mean is, if you pretend well enough, the audience will believe you. By the way, I was always an Indian.   \\"It's your imagination that creates something, not research. People say, 'John, do you relate to a character?' Relate? How the hell do you relate to Caligula? You damn well imagine a character, and if you can't do that, go home.   \\"In front of the camera, you try to do subtle, telling things and hope the director, and the camera, notices,\\" he continues. \\"You can feel when you pass something through the camera. The old Alan Ladd story is the best one in that respect. He came back from a long day of shooting out in the dusty Arizona desert and someone said, 'Did you have a good day, Alan?' In his soft rasp, he said, 'Yup, a couple of good looks.' \\"    The director Jim Sheridan says Hurt is \\"not one of those people who lives the part, you know, but rather turns it on and off.\\" Method actors try to \\"get involved in the interior life of the character,\\" says Sheridan. Hurt, on the other hand, takes an idiosyncratic approach, looking for a trademark, a peculiarity, a quirk as emblem for the whole. \\"He doesn't build a character in a documentary way. He's more like an impressionist.\\"    The best example of this, and the use of his imagination, is Hurt's work in \\"The Elephant Man,\\" the story of John Merrick, hideously disfigured, a victim in the late-19th century of what was thought to be neurofibromatosis.   To play the part, during each day of shooting Hurt sat for seven hours while a makeup artist applied 22 pieces of prosthetic makeup. The mask, in effect, made him appear a monster, but the character he created from beneath it was almost angelic, \\"truly remarkable,\\" wrote Vincent Canby in The New York Times.    \\"It occurred to me as we went along,\\" says Hurt, \\"that this was a creature that was totally without malice. I mean, he was a saint in that sense. So I had to find a voice that was the opposite of his physical image, a sweet voice, refined, something that, against his face, would be a total shock. I had to get the audience to love me.\\"    The voice, key to the role, \\"was beautifully tender,\\" says David Lynch, the director. \\"Every move and sound was right; John    was    the guy. He totally gave up his own personality. That's a kind of cosmic feat, a huge, frightening thing. He's the greatest actor I've ever worked with.\\"    The technique behind this achievement, of course, is so discreet it's almost imperceptible.    Here on the prairie late in the afternoon, the actor again is called to the set. In a previous scene, the main character has chased his son headlong down a wide concrete spillway toward the edge of a dam. But to have continued the sequence, reversing the angle and filming from the edge, would have been too dangerous, so a simulated precipice was constructed of plywood and set nearby on a grassy knoll. Now, as the actors assume their marks on this ersatz precipice, the director reminds them that they should appear breathless from a long run.    Mackay begins to hop in place, trying to get himself winded. Hurt, meanwhile, stands almost motionless, idly sipping a cup of tea.    \\"O.K., ready?\\" says the director.    The teen-ager, finally panting, stops bouncing. Hurt yawns and tosses his cup into the tall grass.    \\"Action,\\" says Dewolf, and, with that, Hurt suddenly is doubled over, so completely out of breath it seems he's been sprinting for miles. The small deception is stunning, a work of pure imagination.    \\"That's a wrap,\\" says Dewolf, smiling. \\"See, you tomorrow, John . . . for your death.\\"    \\"Oh, another death, is it?\\" says Hurt, laughing. \\"Well, I'll add it to the list.\\"    HE GREW UP PART OF THE manse, the third child of Phyllis Hurt and the Rev. Arnould Herbert Hurt. In his early years, the family lived in Britain's Midlands and along its east coast, a land of collieries and potteries, gritty villages and hard, working-class towns.    He passed his childhood at St. Michael's School, a small Anglican academy for the sons of the middle-class clergy. And it was here, at the age of 9, in the Maeterlinck fantasy \\"The Blue Bird,\\" that John Hurt became stage-struck:    \\"I remember going across the footlights and saying to myself, 'I'm at home here.' \\" St. Michael's was also a place steeped in ritual. The trappings and devices of high-Anglican ceremony -- incense and rose petals, the gold cloth over the monstrance, the reprise of prayers and ringing chants -- all imbued the boy was a passion for drama and scene.    \\"Talk about being brought up with a sense of theater,\\" he says. \\"It was a fantastic show.\\"    He was, however, a student with \\"a hopeless record\\" and, after he failed the entrance exam to a private secondary school, he found himself at a proletarian warehouse in Lincoln, isolated, estranged.    \\"Lincoln School was what you in America call a public school, maybe a thousand students. At first I was the vicar's son, very different from them.\\"    \\"It was a bit of a trial for John,\\" says his father. \\"He didn't fit in very well. He also had a far from understanding headmaster there. John was too much of an individual for him.\\"    \\"The headmaster loathed me,\\" Hurt remembers. \\"But to get along with the others, I quickly learned to become working-class, a reactionary, a teddy, a low life. I even changed accents. I hated it.\\"    Back home, however, he refused to play the changeling. Says a close friend: \\"The thing you must remember most about John is that he found himself at an early age in disagreement with all those deeply conservative religious values of his family and was always kicking against his father's principles, always gripped by his own intrinsic individuality.\\"    In other words, like the characters he now embraces, he was a misfit.    Perhaps this, in part, explains why John Hurt now seems so frequently aggrieved.    \\"It's also just his emotional makeup,\\" says Edgar Bronfman. \\"John's an artist, not an actor making a living, and most artists are a wailing open sore. I think there is no rationally explaining the demons with great artists. John is just constantly at war with himself.\\"    In the past, the weapon often has been alcohol.    \\"There were times when he was a boring drunk and prickly, contentious,\\" says his friend Don Boyd.    \\"His problem has never affected his work,\\" says Bronfman, \\"but he's had a real struggle.\\"    For his part, Hurt says only: \\"I try to keep the dark side of my life to myself. I don't believe in wearing that on one's sleeve.\\"    After Lise died in 1983, the war escalated. The year before, Hurt had met a television actress who was tending bar in a Los Angeles restaurant. Now, six months after Lise's death, he asked her to live with him. Six months after that, they were married. \\"You've heard of Cinderella stories?\\" he says. \\"Well, as someone I know put it, this turned out to be a Godzilla story.\\" They were, he went on, hopelessly ill-matched. Along the way, he decided to build a house in Kenya, a sprawling hacienda. The couple spent barely two months there. Looking back, says Hurt, \\"the house in Kenya was as crazy as the marriage.\\"    Then, in 1988, he went to London to begin work on \\"Scandal\\" and there met Joan -- or Jo as everyone calls her -- Dalton, an assistant to the director, Michael Caton-Jones.    One weekend, Hurt left the set without his script and Dalton was asked to ferry it to his flat. \\"We met and had this incredible conversation,\\" she recalls. \\"It was like we'd known each other forever. I thought I'd be sad when the film ended because I wouldn't be able to have these conversations anymore. It was completely guileless.\\" One day Hurt emerged from his dressing room and told Jo Dalton he was going to end his marriage.   \\"Oh,\\" she said, \\"I see the penny's finally dropped.\\"    She was 30, once married, an American from New Jersey educated in Canada and a former producer of television commercials and pop videos. He was 48, \\"near to a nervous breakdown,\\" she says.    The romance revived Hurt. Soon, he convinced Dalton to move into the Savoy Hotel with him.    \\"I must say, I really turned it on,\\" he remembers. \\"I was driven to do so. I knew if I let this bus pass, it was not going to stop again. This was the first time I'd ever really fallen in love.\\"    Jo Dalton was frightened: \\"I thought, no, God, it's too much like all those movies. Here's this leading actor and this girl who's working on her first film. We tried to keep it sort of quiet. I said to myself, 'This is splendid, romantic and mad, but, I mean, is it going to come to any good?' \\"    JO DALTON HURT IS A TALL, poised, accessible woman with straight blond hair, light blue eyes and a fair complexion. At the moment, she is standing at a kitchen counter, chatting amiably and grinding baby food.    John, Jo and Alexander Hurt -- Sasha, as they call him, a first for both -- age 10 months, have taken up residence in a powder-blue lakeside cottage rented for the duration of the shoot. It is Sunday, gray and wet, a day of rest for cast and crew. The actor has his hands in the sink, doing the dishes; his wife begins spooning out lunch for their infant son.    \\"Let me tell you what happened when my parents found out about us,\\" she says. \\"I called my mother and said, 'You're not going to believe this, but I'm kind of seeing John Hurt.' At first, she was very excited. Then she went to the video shop. She got out 'Midnight Express,' in which he plays a junkie, then 'The Hit,' where he plays a hit man, then 'I, Claudius,' where he's this crazed emperor. Two weeks later, I got a phone call. Her voice was an octave higher. 'Honey,' she says, 'are you O.K.?' \\"    Jo Hurt says her husband still suffers from chronic disquiet. \\"To be honest, he's desperately pained by things all the time, from people around him to the world situation -- battered around, you know, bumped on the head everywhere he goes,\\" she says.    But marriage and fatherhood seem to have given the actor at least a few moments of equanimity.    \\"He has a self-confidence I have not seen in a long time, and I'm sure it has something to do with Jo and the baby,\\" says Don Boyd.    \\"His relationship with Lise didn't satisfy the need for a deep and abiding love,\\" says Bronfman. \\"He has that with Jo and that has brought him a great deal of inner peace.\\"    The Hurts recently settled in Ireland and are renovating an 18th-century Georgian farmhouse that sits on 13 acres some 50 miles from Dublin. \\"Ireland is a bright nation,\\" says Hurt. \\"It's poetic. In England, if you turn up in the morning looking like disaster, they say, 'John, Jesus, you look like hell.' But in Ireland, they say, 'Johnny, you look like you had a great night last night, lad.' I like the Irish immensely.\\"    Meanwhile, his career keeps to its quiet, even track. It is unlikely that John Hurt will achieve stardom, at least as Americans think of it. He does not, for example, \\"work Hollywood,\\" cultivating producers, directors and studio plutocrats. \\"John simply doesn't play the Hollywood game,\\" says one friend. \\"If you go to Hollywood,\\" says the director Jim Sheridan, \\"you have to change your identity. To become successful there, you literally have to become someone else. John's been relatively successful without doing that.\\"    Hurt, keeping in character, answers with an anecdote: \\"David Niven once said: 'I'm a reasonably paid second-rate star who usually gets a part after someone else has turned it down. I never overprice myself because I like to keep working.' \\"    He is likely one of the least acquisitive actors in the industry. He pines for no role, chases no script, advances no image. In fact, for more years than he can remember, he had no mirror in the house.    And although he finally seems settled -- \\"One has one's ups and downs; I'm feeling rather up at the minute\\" -- the wrinkles, folds and crow's feet will always leave him with an aspect of melancholy, a hint of distress.    \\"So what if it looks as if he hasn't slept in 25 years,\\" says Jo Hurt. \\"He's been up doing interesting things.\\" John Hurt: Always in Character"},{"year":"1933","title":"STRACHEY, who could not write badly and never wrote idly, deserved a collection of his shorter reviews.

For example, her use of schlock figures from popular culture (in her case the pathetic cartoon characters on greeting cards) preceded Jeff Koons's translation of such figures into sculpture, as demonstrated by \\"Hystorical,\\" a 1983 painting that hangs in the gallery's office. So it is especially painful to see Ms. Wachtel's latest efforts, which present derivative dilutions of strategies she helped formulate.    These seemingly transitional paintings suggest an amalgam of work made in the 1980's by Richard Prince, Peter Halley and the team of Wallace and Donahue. They combine hard-edge abstraction and daytime television, juxtaposing silkscreened images of faces on the afternoon talk shows with monochrome panels that are variously notched and shaped. The colors and images appear to be subtly matched, both in hue and in emotional vapidness.

To some extent, Ms. Wachtel's subject has always been the falseness of American life, and there is certainly no small relationship between television's canned emotions and the mindless palette of corporate America.

In \\"Peak,\\" perhaps the most poignant of the stories, a man mistreated by his family escapes to the woods and finds a companion -- a wolf.

Reinhard Hauff, the director, in other words, seems to have scoured West Germany for unlovely settings, not picturesque villages and valleys or bright and bustling towns. The country is flat, the people coarse, the color photography dim. In short, we are mired in the \\"realism\\" into which young film makers are apt to stumble while seeking a shortcut to Parnassus. Or in this instance to the Museum of Modern Art, where the two films will be shown at 6 P.M. today and at 8:30 P.M. tomorrow as part of the New Directors/New Films series.The climax of \\"Paule Paulander\\" occurs when an outbreak of swine fever—not to be confused with swine flu—ruins the father and brings on an emotional breakdown. The youth knocks away the rifle that his father is threatening him with and clubs him briskly with a shovel. Leaving the stubborn old fellow moaning on a pile of dying piglets, he abandons the acres that his family has tilled for 300 years to seek his fortunes in the big city.In \\"The Main Actor\\" the youth is recruited to play the starring role in a film within a film, an unsparing quasi-documentary look into the horrors of rural life, as seen from the perspective of the film's director, who seems to be a socialist of some sort and it is hinted, a homosexual.Tired of dismantling old Volkswagens, encouraged by his father's kicks and cuffs, this youth abandons the junkyard. He follows the director to what may be the same city, possibly Cologne, where he turns out to be no happier.Mr. Hauff has made the mistake of stating his intentions in a credo distributed at the screening of the films instead of fulfilling them on the screen. For artistic ideological reasons that he fails to make entirely clear in the statement, he has amateur actors in \\"Paule Paulander\\" and professionals in \\"The Main Actor.\\" Both perform at about the same level of plodding inadequacy, with the edge, perhaps, going to the amateurs.

In DANTE  GABRIEL ROSSETTI (Abrams, $29.95), Russell Ash, the author of numerous books on  art, including volumes on Edward Burne-Jones and Toulouse-Lautrec, portrays Rossetti as an undisciplined youth whose florid personal style eventually took him to the center of the Victorian artistic world. Along with his fellow painters William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and others, Rossetti founded  the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a movement Mr. Ash characterizes as having an \\"idealized and escapist view of an imaginary 'golden age' rooted in the medieval world, with its traditions of courtly love and chivalric duty.\\" Others in Rossetti's circle included the art critic John Ruskin, Burne-Jones, William Morris and the poets Algernon Charles Swinburne and George Meredith. Rossetti, who was also a poet, married his model Elizabeth Siddal in 1855","excerpt":"in 1862 she died from an overdose of laudanum. Racked with guilt that he had ignored her for his work, Rossetti buried the only complete set of his poems with her, and then  ordererd her body exhumed seven years later so that the poems could be retrieved and published. Because of frequent bitter criticism of his work, the artist rarely exhibited publicly, and his final years were marked by insomnia, drug abuse and doomed love affairs, including one with another of his models, William Morris's wife, Jane.

From the outset of his career, Parrish hitched his fortunes to the technologically expanding publishing industry, doing his first magazine cover for Harper's Bazaar in 1895 and thereafter earning mass-market popularity with his winsome book illustrations, art posters, calendars, theater sets, murals and paintings -- some, like ''Daybreak,'' specifically commissioned to be reproduced and sold as prints. This unabashed embrace of commercialism, not considered unseemly for a fine artist early in the century, was later reviled by art world arbiters like Clement Greenberg, who wrote severely of Parrish's ''hallucinatory high-octane realism.'' The rise and fall of critical assessment of the artist is the crux of Sylvia Yount's ambitious MAXFIELD PARRISH: 1870-1966 (Abrams/Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, $39.95); if the case she builds for returning him to an honored place in art history is not airtight, it is certainly meaty. That Parrish had incredible facility as a draftsman and colorist, particularly in some of his wickedly original illustrations for children's books, is evident throughout the vivid reproductions in the book (these images, after all, were largely designed for printing). And Yount discusses how the curator Lawrence Alloway was the first to revive Parrish in a 1964 exhibition as a progenitor of Pop Art, with its playful conflation of art and commerce (Andy Warhol was an avid Parrish collector). Yet Parrish, who by the age of 60 had immersed himself in landscape painting, did his own disparaging at that time: ''There are countless artists whose shoes I am not worthy to polish whose prints would not pay the printer.''

End of story.   But is it? No, and the plot line has been unraveling for some time. Now a new book, \\"As Seen on TV: The Visual Culture of Everyday Life in the 1950's,\\" extends the revision. It is by Karal Ann Marling, an art historian and a professor of American studies at the University of Minnesota. Her account doesn't have much to do with Pollock or de Kooning. But it has a great deal to do with Winston Churchill, Claudette Colbert and a forgotten businessman named Max Klein.   As Marling describes it, in a chapter titled \\"Hyphenated Culture,\\" the 50's wasn't a decade defined by a small band of Greenwich Village abstractionists struggling to fame despite a hostile public. It was a decade of unprecedented interest in painting. Everyone was at it. Ike was in the White House with the television on, painting copies of greeting cards (up to 7 in 10 days!). Hollywood stars promoted themselves as weekend dabblers. Sinatra painted clowns, Fonda plums, Colbert portraits. A traveling show featured art by celebrities like Joe Louis and Clifton Webb.   Another exhibition that toured the country showcased art by businessmen. One man whose work was in it, a New York City clothing manufacturer, said he had been inspired by Irving Stone's biography of van Gogh, \\"Lust for Life,\\" a surprise best seller when reissued in 1946. Specifically, he said, his painting \\"borrowed from the violent style of that tortured master.\\" Van Gogh, that is, not Stone.   The rest of the country, it seemed, was painting by numbers. I don't know about you, but the paint-by-numbers craze always seemed to me -- as it did to 50's social commentators, who heaped scorn on it -- somewhere between Hula-Hoops and Davy Crockett on the scale of cultural signifiers. But maybe not. It doesn't require a relativism that would equate Mighty Morphin Power Rangers with Valkyries to see how serious painting and painting by numbers spoke to the same moment in American cultural life. At the least, Abstract Expressionists rose to postwar stardom partly on the tide of a popular mania for painting -- even if they had to be cast as charlatans to do so.   So great was the public's enthusiasm for painting by numbers that one entrepreneur told Business Week in 1953: \\"We pray a little, keep our fingers crossed, and hope that when the herd finally turns to glass blowing, enough will stay behind to keep us in business. In the meantime, we're cleaning up.\\"   You may feel edified to learn that a great work like Leonardo's \\"Last Supper,\\" at $11.50, was the all-time favorite among paint-by-numbers hobbyists. Until you discover that \\"Three Kittens,\\" produced by Picture Craft, a company headed by Max Klein, was a big hit, too. Klein started a \\"Masterpiece\\" line that included nudes and celebrity portraits. A Picture Craft ad said: \\"Decorate Your Home . . . or Sell Your Paintings for Profit.\\" Sure enough, judges at a San Francisco art show were even fooled into awarding one a prize.   \\"Do-it-yourselfism,\\" writes Marling, \\"was the last refuge for the exercise of control and competence in a world run by the bosses and the bureaucrats.\\" She points to the influence of Churchill as amateur painter, and particularly to his popular book, published in America in 1948, \\"Painting as a Pastime.\\" In it he extolled the therapeutic value of putting down \\"large fierce strokes.\\"   \\"Churchill's insistence that art was cheap psychotherapy or a way of releasing pent-up feelings found some resonance in the 'splash and wallop' technique of the Abstract Expressionists,\\" observes Marling.   Here you have it. Paint-by-numbers enthusiasts and Abstract Expressionists alike were affected by the same 50's Zeitgeist: the tension between social strictures and personal freedom. When the critic Harold Rosenberg famously described de Kooning and others as Action Painters, he was, on a highfalutin level, echoing the widespread belief that art was a form of release.   Of course, there was only so much releasing that most Americans could take -- hence the preference for painting that nonetheless stayed within the lines prescribed by Klein & Co.   Abstraction was O.K. when it came to those asteroid shapes and squiggly forms on the new Formica kitchen counter tops. But Grandma Moses' treacly pictures were what the average Joe wanted on his walls. Moses, an autodidact, ideally suited a decade of do-it-yourselfers and paint-by-numbers hobbyists.   Moreover, she painted homespun fantasies of a bygone country. If art was a means of escaping the new corporate grind, her paintings epitomized escapism. Little wonder she was dubbed America's most beloved artist or that in 1950 the United States Information Agency, to hype American culture, sent her works to Europe -- where the French and others received them warmly, to the horror of America's art establishment.   We do well to remember that the art stars of the period, besides Moses, included Ben Shahn and John Marin. In exalted circles, praised was lavished on them during the postwar years. In 1950, Marin had a retrospective at the Venice Biennale","excerpt":"in 1954 Shahn had one (as did de Kooning).   The Museum of Modern Art put those Venice shows together. But it wasn't until late 1956 that it presented a one-person show of an Abstract Expressionist in New York -- a posthumous tribute to Pollock. A David Smith retrospective in 1957 and a survey called \\"The New American Painting,\\" which toured Europe in '58 and came here the next year, were the only other shows exclusively dedicated to Abstract Expressionism that the museum mounted during the entire decade.    The point is that Abstract Expressionists didn't simply take charge during the postwar period. For much of it, they weren't even the main event. And their rise is better understood against the backdrop of Shahn and Marin, of Moses and the paint-by-numbers craze, than in a vacuum.   American art in the 50's turned out to be a tango of High and Low: Pollock, dancing around drip paintings in a studio at the end of Long Island, partnered with Gene Kelly, dancing around in his beret as the artist in \\"An American in Paris\\" (a 1951 film). The history of postwar American art, far from a closed book, has only started to be written.

Mark Felt as Deep Throat is a reminder of the power of a No. 2: he wasn't the boss, but he was twice as dangerous. Cooper's political memoir opens with the claim that in his long career as a senior officer in the C.I.A. and various other federal agencies -- ''as deputy or special assistant to, of or for somebody or something'' -- he has had a wisdom far beyond that of his high-powered but short-term bosses. A promising hypothesis, but what Cooper's experience shows -- from minor O.S.S. operations in China during World War II through Korea, the Cuban missile crisis, Vietnam and other conflicts -- is that bureaucratic work, even all the way (or almost all the way) to the top, is always dull and usually inconsequential.

THE LAST VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS: Being the Epic Tale of the Great Captain's Fourth Expedition, Including Accounts of Swordfight, Mutiny, Shipwreck, Gold, War, Hurricane, and Discovery. By Martin Dugard. (Little, Brown, $24.95.) Vast new lands, strange new peoples, Edenic flora and fauna aside, Columbus's four voyages to the new world were commercial enterprises, with a nervous Spanish court expecting a return on its investment. In a rich, fluent account, Dugard offers both a gripping naval adventure and a revealing history of the competitive mercantile politics of the turn of the 16th century, and portrays Columbus as a star-crossed striver eager to legitimize his quest. Reined in by hard-nosed administrators and for a time imprisoned for failing to maintain order in the critical outpost of Santo Domingo, the Admiral of the Ocean Sea made a final, desperate attempt in 1502 to find that elusive passage to India. Perhaps he knew it was doomed when, while searching for gold in the lush Panamanian jungle, a scout was told by angry inhabitants that ''these people were going to burn our ships and kill us all,'' a threat they nearly carried out. The leaking fleet escaped, only to be marooned in Jamaica for a year. But Columbus's ingenuity never failed him. In an archetypal high-seas scam, when the local tribe in Jamaica began to cut off the castaways' food supply, he consulted an astronomy text and told the Indians ''God would send them a clear token from heaven of the punishment they were about to receive'' if they didn't cough up the daily victuals; right on schedule a lunar eclipse came, the Indians cried for mercy, and that was that. Dugard's detailed reconstructions, while sometimes far-fetched (how could he know that Columbus's prison shackles were ''clattering lightly'' as he wrote an apology to Ferdinand and Isabella?), rely on ships' logs, journals, letters and other contemporary accounts, letting the participants describe these extraordinary adventures themselves.

I had been a minor-league pitcher from 18 to 22 and then, after being released by the Milwaukee Braves, returned home to Fairfield, Conn., was married, finished college, had five children and became a writer. By my early 30's, I was a sedentary ex-jock going to fat and dealing with a bad back. My doctor told me to do dead lifts. I bought a cheap set of barbells and weights, stood in front of the living-room mirror and to the amusement of my children performed set after set of dead lifts until my back muscles began to loosen up. Then, bored, I did a few barbell curls, a few standing shoulder presses and lay on the living room rug to do a few bench presses. A few months later I was astonished to discover that I had lost fat and gained muscle. So I went looking for a gym.    The only gym in town was located behind a strip mall because not many people lifted weights in those days. Athletes feared weights would make them musclebound, and the fitness craze was still a decade in the future. It was ''a dirty iron gym,'' not only because the gym was dirty but also because the rust on the iron weights came off on your hands and clothes. The guys in the gym (there were no women) grunted and sweated under heavy weights while their comrades shouted at one another in that demeaning, good-natured, jocky way: ''Who's the rustler stole them calves?'' ''You call them sticks arms?'' I immediately fell in love with that gym. It was a place for hard work, accomplishment, renewed strength and increased muscle size. But most of all I loved the camaraderie of the place. It reminded me of the locker room I had missed for so many years.    The only thing for sale in that gym, other than illicit steroids sold in the locker room, were a few workout T-shirts and shorts, all of them emblazoned with the logo ''Gold's Gym, Venice Beach, California'' and a drawing of a bodybuilder with a shaved head who looked like Mr. Clean. Everybody knew about Gold's. It was where all the Mr. Universes and Mr. Olympias went to train. It was where bodybuilding was being legitimized as a sport and as a healthful form of exercise to lose weight, gain strength and reshape bodies.    Gold's was founded by a self-described ''beach bum,'' Joe Gold, the son of an East L.A. junk dealer. At 12, in 1934, Gold and his brother would visit an automobile wrecking yard, where they turned cast-iron flywheels and buckets of concrete into weight-lifting equipment. In his teens, Gold began to haunt so-called Muscle Beach in Santa Monica, where men lifted weights and performed acrobatics.    Between serving in the Navy during World War II and again during the Korean War, Joe Gold lived as a beach bum in Santa Monica, alternating work in the merchant marine as a machinist's mate with play on the beach. It was there, after Korea, that he heard about a casting call for a Las Vegas revue starring Mae West. When Gold and a few of his fellow bodybuilders visited Mae West's apartment, she looked them over and said, ''I'll take all of you.''    After Gold finished his cross-country tour with West, he soon returned to Santa Monica, where he used his machinist's skills to design and build his own sophisticated weight-lifting equipment. In 1965 he opened the first Gold's Gym a few streets off the beach in Venice, Calif.","excerpt":"in 1968 Arnold Schwarzenegger walked through the door. The rest is history, the history of bodybuilding. Schwarzenegger went on to star in the movie ''Pumping Iron'' in 1977, which helped validate bodybuilding and contributed to the fitness craze that continues today. Schwarzenegger never failed to admit that these trends, as well as his own realization of the American dream, were owed to Joe Gold, whom he called a ''trusted friend and father figure who looked after me, encouraged me and was instrumental in my training.''    The Gold's of the 60's was a plain, grungy, boisterous place of hard work and good cheer. Gold called Arnold ''balloon belly'' to remind him of his less-than-chiseled abs. He made fun of the bodybuilder Dave Draper's skinny legs by warning him not to walk on the beach -- or he'd sink into the sand. Draper said, ''When Joe insulted you it was a sign that he liked you.'' Gold always liked to say that the ''object'' of going to a gym was ''having fun.''    I didn't find my way to an actual Gold's Gym until the late 70's. By then, Gold was gone. He had sold his gym and his name in 1970, and in 1977 he started World Gym. Today, World is the second most famous gym in the world; the first remains Gold's, which is in 25 countries. But the Gold's Gyms of today don't much resemble the original. They are clean, carpeted, well-lighted places with showers and saunas and racquetball courts and chromed weights and fancy machines (though a few resemble Gold's original designs). The clients are mainly ordinary men and women who just want to stay in shape and only rarely serious bodybuilders.    I am pushing 64, arthritic now, but still I lift weights every day at a gym where I am no longer as boisterous as I once was. Even so, I can always find some guy, a young kid of 30 wearing a Florida State football T-shirt whom I can rag about how my beloved 'Canes have just beaten his pitiful 'Noles for the sixth straight time.

Operation Clear Lanes, our tough enforcement policy, has reduced illegal parking by 60 percent in midtown over the past two years.

Still, congestion is a serious problem, but your recommendation for solving it by building new garages would not be effective. In fact, in the midtown core it would make matters worse. It is simply not possible for private automobiles to serve more than a small fraction of those who travel daily to and within midtown and downtown Manhattan.

The man has three kids himself, the youngest a baby. He'd made his reputation making movies about kids and parents. He knew I had children and knew I had spent the better part of the week playing phone tag with him, trying to arrange our interview around my toddler's nap time or nanny visits. And while the director was ostensibly sympathetic, he had managed to mess me up twice, calling once at my daughter's bedtime. I finally reached him at the end of a rather long and frantic day of chasing Franny.   \\"She's great,\\" I told him, \\"but about as exhausting as anything I can think of.\\"   \\"Yeah, but it's fun,\\" he said somewhat insistently. \\"The rewards far outweigh the insanity.\\"   Right, pal, I wanted to say. Maybe I'd be more enthusiastic if I'd spent the day overseeing the editing of my next multimillion-dollar motion picture. Instead I had been running around a Brooklyn park trying to convince my 20-month-old not to lick rainwater off a picnic table. This was more than mere envy. Unlike our friend the auteur, I'm an all-day dad. My wife works full time and I freelance from home. My parenting is not confined to weekends and quality time and \\"baby-sitting,\\" as some men put it. Mine is the full-throttle, sunrise-to-sunset experience most dads never know, though some pretend to. These pretenders are what I call Gentlemen Fathers.   A gentleman farmer is someone who doesn't have to farm the land he owns and generally pays someone else to do it for him. He likes to get his hands dirty occasionally though, and he really likes to act the part. A gentleman farmer is to farmers what Martha Stewart is to homemakers.   A gentleman father, similarly, doesn't have to take care of his kids. He has a wife or a nanny to take care of the children while he works. But like the gentleman farmer, the gentleman father savors the role, and plays to the balcony when in character. He can usually be seen on weekends carrying his wee one around in a state-of-the-art baby backpack and declaiming his intentions in a loud stage voice: \\"Do you want to go see the squirrel? Daddy will take you to see the squirrel because he loves you very, very much.\\"   Unlike many of our fathers, today's gentleman father is not afraid to change a poopy diaper and talk to you about it at length using all his descriptive powers. The gentleman father defers to no one in the area of his child's health -- or any child's health, for that matter. Like the Russian babushkas, who are famous for hectoring strangers on the street, the gentleman father won't hesitate to tell you that your child should really be wearing a hat or that the muffin you're feeding her is filled with sugar.   As a species, the gentleman father is usually in his late 30's to early 40's. He is a man who put off having children until he found the right mate, or became a senior partner, or finally wearied of trying to nail every girl he met. He is determined to be identified as a father -- carrying his child's toys at arm's length, so you won't think that Elmo doll belongs to him. In his spare moments -- when his child falls asleep in his stroller, say -- he can be seen scribbling notes on his experience for the fatherhood book he is writing.    A glance in a bookstore's remainder bin reveals a cottage industry of books about being a father. As long as writers can impregnate women (something most used to strive not to do) they will write books about it. Bob Greene, Dan Greenburg, Steve Chapple, each has found his experiences as parent worthy of publication.    Not that there's anything new about writers writing up every aspect of their personal lives. Everything is fair game: adoption, adultery, alcoholism. But what has appalled many mothers (and this father) is the presumption of novelty. \\"So you've changed a diaper,\\" they complain. \\"Talk to me when you've changed a thousand.\\" HE BACKLASH TOO, IS NOT NEW","excerpt":"in 1979 Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his role as a martyr dad in \\"Kramer vs. Kramer.\\" Millions wept as Dusty transformed himself from a workaholic absentee parent to a caring, voice-cracking, French-toast-making earth father. And while some women objected, it seems that moviegoers -- including many women -- wanted to believe that within each obtuse father is a caring, sharing, nurturing mensch dying to play patty-cake.   The stance has even become politically correct; \\"I want to spend more time with my family\\" has become the excuse du jour when someone is squeezed out of a studio or board room and wants to save face.    But what burns me about the gentleman father is the self-righteousness with which he greets any expressions of frustration about the child-caring experience. To hear another man say that his kids are driving him crazy seems to the gentleman father an act of treason; it's not supposed to be work, he seems to be saying, it's supposed to be fun, fulfilling, rewarding. But who said fulfilling experiences shouldn't be difficult, that fun would not be leavened with frustration?   In a culture where Forrest Gump seems like a role model and Barney the dinosaur has to tell kids to use their imaginations (as redundant, to my mind as Joycelyn Elders's proposed masturbation instruction) I think it is important to remember that rewarding does not mean painless and that expressions of insanity are better than going insane.   At the end of a long day with Franny, when I'm exhibiting what war survivors call the 1,000-yard stare, I am in a state of solidarity with any full-time parent, and in empathy (I now realize) with my own mother, who raised three kids by herself. And I know as she did that as discombobulating as kids can be, all is forgiven when they wrap their arms around you or give you a smile. As hard won as that bit of wisdom sometimes seems, it is not unique or brilliant; I don't even know what I can do with it.   Write a book, maybe.

After receiving the F.E.C.'s letter of inquiry, the campaign repaid Mr. Zaccaro and the Zaccaro children $130,000 in October 1978.

The Council of Europe, an organization of 21 Western European democratic countries, which forced the junta in Athens to withdraw Greece's membership, is considering suspending Turkey. The Danish and Norwegian Governments recently froze financial aid to the junta, and the European Economic Community has suspended an aid package of $600 million.   The United States' attitude seems to be going in a quite different direction. On Feb. 21, the commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Gen. Bernard W. Rogers, urged $5 billion to $6 billion in aid to modernize Turkey's armed forces.

Phillips in his new book, ''Post-Conservative America,'' published by Random House. The author, whose earlier writings foresaw the ascendency of the Republican party that culminated with President Reagan's 1980 election victory, says now that the contradictory and reactionary strains within Reaganism -supply-side economics and monetarism, among others - are a product of Republican politicians looking back in nostalgia for answers to present problems, rather than looking forward with a new vision.   An excerpt from his book is followed by a response from Paul Craig Roberts, a supply-side economist who resigned in February as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy. WHEN the first histories of the 1980's are written, the place of the radical transformation of c onservative economics will be as important as that of any other t ransformation - geographical, cultural or institutional.

Health concerns have been one of the main motivations behind the tremendous switch from butter to margarine among Americans since the 1950's. Yet confusion regarding margarine's health benefits is still widespread, fostered by contentions in some scientific quarters that the role of fats and cholesterol (butter has considerably more of both than margarine) in heart disease has been overemphasized and that the methods used to make margarine negate some of its potential benefits to the heart and create possible cancer hazards.    While there is no ironclad evidence to support one view or another, certain facts are worth considering when choosing between butter and margarine or the compromise alternative, a butter-margarine blend.   Butter has been singled out by the public as a major fatty culprit in heart disease even though the fats in meat are as bad, if not worse, offenders. Diets rich in cholesterol and saturated fats, as butter is, are associated with a relatively high level of cholesterol in the blood, which in turn is a major risk factor in the development of heart disease.

No perspective organizes Traylor's art; the very idea of a vanishing point is beside the point. Each of his works is as bold and corporeal as a stamped impression -- or a shadow -- of a particular presence: someone strolling past the Monroe Street fruit stand where he sketched, for example. What emerges from this monograph is a coherent sensibility of an ingenuous and witty man inspired by the secular world. Traylor's work connects with the broadest tradition of folk art: isolated individuals who excerpted and inventoried from their immediate world without thoughts of posterity.

Busi nessman and philanthropist known for his generosity and passion for knowledge and justice, died at his home on June 12, 2004 after a long illness. At the time of his death, he lived in Boulder, CO, and maintained a family home in Maine. Charles Butcher was born in 1916 in Cambridge, MA, and attended Harvard University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematical Economics. He was a conscientious objector during World War II and, as a consequence, received what he called his ''postgraduate education'' in federal prison and work camps. He continued to live his values for the rest of his life. In 1951, after several years in the printing business, Charles Butcher joined the Butcher Company, a familyowned floor care products company in Massachusetts. He became CEO shortly thereafter. Over the next five decades, he developed the Butcher Company from a small regional firm into a large, successful, socially responsible company with international reach, 100 times its original size. A pioneer in thinking about socially responsible business practices, he was invited to lecture at business schools and consult with business leaders. When he sold the Butcher Company, then headquartered in Marlborough, MA, to Johnson Wax Professional in 2000, Charles Butcher and his wife, distributed $18 million of the sale proceeds to the company's 325 employees. He published a book, How to Succeed in Business by Giving Away Millions. A lifelong fascination with science led Charles Butcher, in 1965, to found the Lazy Eight, a network of scientists interested in cross - disciplinary ap proaches to technical problem-solving, education and issues of poverty. In 1973 he began working with Dr. Larry Gold in the lab of the Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology Department of the University of Colorado. In 1986, he was chairman of the board of Clonetics, a biotech start-up that gained international recognition for its genetic research","excerpt":"in 1991 he joined the board of NeXagen, a biomedical company. With Dr. Gold, he designed the Discovery Exchange to promote cooperation between academic scientists and business. In addition to his direction of the Butcher Company, his work with high-tech and biotech startups, and his own scientific research, Charles Butcher spent decades as an active and creative philanthropist. He dedicated his giving to encouraging and promoting civil liberties, -big-picturescientific thinking and creative cross-disciplinary research. In 2002, in recognition of his longstanding, continuous support for civil liberties and his leadership as a board member, the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado presented Charles Butcher its 50th Anniversary Champion of Liberty Award. Charles Butcher, with his wife, in 2002, contributed $1.1 million to the University of Colorado to fund the launch of the Colorado Initiative in Molecular Biotechnology, which is using a multidisciplinary approach to unlock genomics secrets to improve the quality of life and health for all people. An energetic entrepreneur, a master sailor, and a generous friend and mentor, Charles Butcher was the father of eight children. His wife, the former Jane Weinberg, is a founder of the Women of the West Museum, the Co-Chair of the University of Colorado Conference on World Affairs and Co-Chair of Mother Jones magazine. Charles Butcher is survived by his wife, Jane, his children Catherine Butcher and husband Ben Pfohl, Susan Butcher and husband David Monson, Kimiko Butcher and husband Neil Grundy, Benjamin Butcher, Claudine Butcher and husband Michael Hannigan, Gina Lasky and husband David Lasky, and Andrew Butcher and grandchildren Ethan Pfohl, Naomi Pfohl, Tekla Monson, Chisana Monson, Charles Grundy and Rachel Grundy.

A devoted New Havener, Yale Man and WWII Naval commander, he was 83. Mr. Lapides was born and raised in New Haven and graduated from Yale University, Class of '39S with an engineering degree and an Ensign's commission in the U.S. Naval Reserve. Shortly thereafter, he was called to active duty. At 25, he became one of the youngest ever commanding officers of a fleet destroyer (the U.S.S. Dahlgren DD187, in 1943, followed by command of the U.S.S. Niblack DD424, in 1945). The Niblack was part of the American armada preparing to invade Japan, and he was one of the first ashore to witness the destruction of Hiroshima. Upon release from active duty in 1946, Mr. Lapides returned to United Smelting & Aluminum Company, the New Haven firm founded by his grandfather in 1891. Remaining in the Naval Reserves, he became Commanding Officer of Surface Division 3-8 and later Surface Battalion 3-27. He also served as Mobilization Director for the State of Connecticut until recalled to active duty as a Commander when the Korean War began. He was then called to the Pentagon, where he served on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations on the Anti-Submarine Warfare Desk. After the war he returned to New Haven and rejoined his family's firm, where he was elected President in 1957. The Company became a leader in precision cold rolling of aluminum coil, serving markets worldwide. In 1968, Mr. Lapides relocated the Company to North Haven, CT, and in 1989 assumed the role of Chairman. It continues as United Aluminum Corporation, the second oldest aluminum roller in America. Mr. Lapides was active in community affairs. He served as the President of the Board of Trustees of the Hopkins School and Chairman of the North Haven Police Commission, and on the Boards of Yale New Haven Hospital, the St. Raphael's Foundation, First Bank of New Haven, the New Haven Savings Bank, Congregation Mishkan Israel and the New Haven Boy's Club. In 1996 Mr. Lapides was honored with a Hall of Fame Award from Junior Achievement","excerpt":"in 1998, both a Founders Award from Business New Haven and a Lifetime Achievement award from the Aluminum Association. Recently he was an Associate Fellow at Yale's Branford College and Treasurer of his Yale Class. Mr. Lapides is survived by his loving wife of 54 years, Ruth R. Lapides, and three children, John S. Lapides, of New Haven, James A. Lapides, of Brookline, MA, and Susan J. Lapides of Cambridge, MA, a sister, Joan L. Wingate, of Branford, CT, and four grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on Sunday, January 6, 2002, at 2:30 PM, at Battell Chapel, Yale University.

But now that the season of list-making and awards-mongering is upon us and the slump talk has quieted down, I find myself preoccupied with a slightly different, not unrelated worry: What if the problem with Hollywood today is that the movies aren't bad enough?

TV Weekend; Of India and Its Tragic Dynasty"},{"year":"1995","title":"DESPITE ALL THE REPUBLICAN PREENing and Democratic pouting since Nov. 8, neither political party gets it. If Speaker Newt Gingrich is serious about delivering results from his party's \\"Contract With America\\" and if President Clinton means to revive his Presidency, each can start by recognizing how fundamentally drugs have changed society's problems and that together they can transform Government's response.\\n\\nFor 30 years, America has tried to curb crime with more judges, tougher punishments and bigger prisons. We have tried to rein in health costs by manipulating payments to doctors and hospitals. We've fought poverty with welfare systems that offer little incentive to work. All the while, we have undermined these efforts with our personal and national denial about the sinister dimension drug abuse and addiction have added to our society. If Gingrich and Clinton want to prove to us that they can make a difference in what really ails America, they should \\"get real\\" about how drugs have recast three of the nation's biggest challenges.\\nLaw, Order and Justice. In 1960 there were fewer than 30,000 arrests for drug offenses","excerpt":"in 30 years, that number soared beyond one million. Since 1989, more individuals have been incarcerated for drug offenses than for all violent crimes -- and most violent crimes are committed by drug (including alcohol) abusers.\\n\\nProbation and parole are sick jokes in most cities. As essential first steps to rehabilitation, many parolees need drug treatment and after-care, which means far more monitoring than their drug-free predecessors of a generation ago required, not less. Yet in Los Angeles, for example, probation officers are expected to handle as many as 1,000 cases at a time. With most offenders committing drug- or alcohol-related crimes, it's no wonder so many parolees go right back to jail: 80 percent of prisoners have prior convictions and more than 60 percent have served time before.\\n\\nCongress and state legislatures keep passing laws more relevant to the celluloid gangsters and inmates of classic 1930's movies than 1990's reality. Today's prisons are wall to wall with drug dealers, addicts, alcohol abusers and the mentally ill (often related to drug abuse). The prison population shot past a million in 1994 and is likely to double soon after the year 2000. Among industrialized nations, the United States is second only to Russia in the number of its citizens it imprisons: 519 per 100,000, compared with 368 for next-place South Africa, 116 for Canada and 36 for Japan.\\n\\nJudges and prosecutors are demoralized as they juggle caseloads of more than twice the recommended maximum. In 1991 eight states had to close their civil jury trial systems for all or part of the year to comply with speedy trial requirements of criminal cases involving drug abusers. Even where civil courts remain open, the rush of drug-related cases has created intolerable delays -- 4 years in Newark, 5 in Philadelphia and up to 10 in Cook County, Ill. In our impersonal, bureaucratic world, if society keeps denying citizens timely, individual hearings for their grievances, they may blow off angry steam in destructive ways.\\nHealth Care Cost Containment. Emergency rooms from Boston to Baton Rouge are piled high with the debris of drug use on city streets -- victims of gunshot wounds, drug-prompted child and spouse abuse, and drug-related medical conditions like cardiac complications and sexually transmitted diseases. AIDS and tuberculosis have spread rapidly in large part because of drug use. Beyond dirty needles, studies show that teen-agers high on pot, alcohol or other drugs are far more likely to have sex, and to have it without a condom.\\n\\nEach year drugs and alcohol trigger up to $75 billion in health care costs. The cruelest impact afflicts the half-million newborns exposed to drugs during pregnancy. Crack babies, a rarity a decade ago, crowd $2,000-a-day neonatal wards. Many die. It can cost $1 million to bring each survivor to adulthood.\\n\\nEven where prenatal care is available -- as it is for most Medicaid beneficiaries -- women on drugs tend not to take advantage of it. And as for drug treatment, only a relatively small percentage of drug-abusing pregnant mothers seek it, and they must often wait in line for scarce slots. Pregnant mothers' failure to seek prenatal care and stop abusing drugs accounts for much of the almost $3 billion that Medicaid spent in 1994 on inpatient hospital care related to drug use.\\nThe Fight Against Poverty. Drugs have changed the nature of poverty. Nowhere is this more glaring than in the welfare systems and the persistent problem of teen-age pregnancy.\\n\\nSpeaker Gingrich and President Clinton are hellbent to put welfare mothers to work. But all the financial lures and prods and all the job training in the world will do precious little to make employable the hundreds of thousands of welfare recipients who are addicts and abusers.\\n\\nFor too long, reformers have had their heads in the sand about this unpleasant reality. Liberals fear that admitting the extent of alcohol and drug abuse among welfare recipients will incite even more punitive reactions than those now fashionable. Conservatives don't want to face up to the cost of drug treatment. This political denial assures failure of any effort to put these welfare recipients to work.\\n\\nThe future is not legalization. Legalizing drug use would write off millions of minority Americans, especially children and drug-exposed babies, whose communities are most under siege by drugs. It has not worked in any nation where it's been tried, and our own experience with alcohol and cigarettes shows how unlikely we are to keep legalized drugs away from children.\\n\\nDrugs are the greatest threat to family stability, decent housing, public schools and even minimal social amenities in urban ghettos. Contrary to the claim of pot proponents, marijuana is dangerous. It devastates short-term memory and the ability to concentrate precisely when our children need them most -- when they are in school. And a child 12 to 17 years old who smokes pot is 85 times as likely to use cocaine as a child who does not. Cocaine is much more addictive than alcohol, which has already hooked more than 18 million Americans. Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, a top drug expert, estimates that legalizing cocaine would give us at least 20 million addicts, more than 10 times the number today.\\n\\nIt's especially reckless to promote legalization when we have not committed research funds and energies to addiction prevention and treatment on a scale commensurate with the epidemic. The National Institutes of Health spend some $4 billion for research on cancer, cardiovascular disease and AIDS, but less than 15 percent of that amount for research on substance abuse and addiction, the largest single cause and exacerbator of those diseases.\\n\\nTreatment varies widely, from inpatient to outpatient, from quick-fix acupuncture to residential programs ranging a few weeks to more than a year, from methadone dependence to drug-free therapeutic communities. Fewer than 25 percent of the individuals who need drug or alcohol treatment enter a program. On average, a quarter complete treatment; half of them are drug- or alcohol-free a year later. In other words, with wide variations depending on individual circumstances, those entering programs have a one-in-eight chance of being free of drugs or alcohol a year later. Those odds beat many for long-shot cancer chemotherapies, and research should significantly improve them. But a recent study in California found that even at current rates of success, $1 invested in treatment saves $7 in crime, health care and welfare costs.\\n\\nHere are a few suggestions for immediate action to attack the dimension drugs have added to these three problems:\\n* Grant Federal funds to state and Federal prison systems only if they provide drug and alcohol treatment and after-care for all inmates who need it.\\n* Instead of across-the-board mandatory sentences, keep inmates with drug and alcohol problems in jails, boot camps or halfway houses until they experience a year of sobriety after treatment.\\n* Require drug and alcohol addicts to go regularly to treatment and after-care programs like Alcoholics Anonymous while on parole or probation.\\n* Provide Federal funds for police only to cities that enforce drug laws throughout their jurisdiction. End acceptance of drug bazaars in Harlem and southeast Washington that would not be tolerated on the Upper East Side of New York or in Georgetown.\\n* Encourage judges with lots of drug cases to employ public health professionals, just as they hire economists to assist with antitrust cases.\\n* Cut off welfare payments to drug addicts and alcoholics who refuse to seek treatment and pursue after-care. As employers and health professionals know, addicts need lots of carrots and sticks, including the threat of loss of job and income, to get the monkey off their back.\\n* Put children of drug- or alcohol-addicted welfare mothers who refuse treatment into foster care or orphanages. Speaker Gingrich and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have done the nation a disservice by playing all-or-nothing politics with this issue. The compassionate and cost-effective middle ground is to identify those parents who abuse their children by their own drug and alcohol abuse and place those children in decent orphanages and foster care until the parents shape up.\\n* Subject inmates, parolees and welfare recipients with a history of substance abuse to random drug tests, and fund the treatment they need. Liberals must recognize that getting off drugs is the only chance these individuals (and their babies) have to enjoy their civil rights. Conservatives who preach an end to criminal recidivism and welfare dependency must recognize that reincarceration and removal from the welfare rolls for those who test positive is a cruel Catch-22 unless treatment is available.\\n\\nFortunately, the new Congress and the new Clinton are certain not to legalize drugs. Unfortunately, it is less clear whether they will recognize the nasty new strain of intractability that drugs have added to crime, health costs and welfare dependency, and go on to tap the potential of research, prevention and treatment to save billions of dollars and millions of lives.\\n\\nIf a mainstream disease like diabetes or cancer affected as many individuals and families as drug and alcohol abuse and addiction do, this nation would mount an effort on the scale of the Manhattan Project to deal with it.

The high priest of \\"formalism,\\" he set in motion an approach to art that has remained prevalent for nearly half a century. While such an achievement might seem to have won him the lasting veneration of art-worldlings, he is not particularly popular these days. In an age that seems increasingly intent on erasing the line between high art and popular culture, Mr. Greenberg, a staunch separatist, has become the focus of intense resentment. He's 82 and hasn't written a review in three decades, yet his views are more disputed than those of any other living art critic.    \\"Hindsight has exaggerated my importance,\\" Mr. Greenberg observed one recent afternoon, puffing on an unfiltered cigarette and chuckling at the ways of the art world. \\"People want to think I was a power broker, a wheeler-dealer.\\"    At home in his Central Park West apartment, Mr. Greenberg seems less like the intellectual tyrant of legend than a friendly shmoozer. He has opinions galore, and cannot be accused of having mellowed with age as he sits in bare feet issuing verdicts on everything from Kantian ethics to Julian Schnabel's last show. (\\"He's not devoid of gifts, but he's minor.\\") The voice is gruff and raspy, the pronouncements delivered with a pugnacious edge. Eyeing his visitor's plastic tape recorder, he asks, \\"Why would anyone buy a piece of junk like that?\\"    The critic's apartment is an airy, elegant place in which paintings by Kenneth Noland, Walter Darby Bannard and other longtime friends vie for attention with good antiques. Everywhere, small, marvelous objects -- an ancient Chinese wine vessel, a bejeweled knife, a serenely smiling Egyptian figure -- catch the eye.    Mr. Greenberg first came to prominence in the 1940's, when he became identified with Abstract Expressionism and created a new language for a generation of art critics. Writing for small but influential magazines like The Nation and Partisan Review, he championed the work of Jackson Pollock and went on to formulate lofty theories about the development of modern art. If Mr. Greenberg can be described as the Moses of the art world, solemnly laying down the laws of painting, he is also its Ann Landers. He has advised, counseled and coaxed innumerable artists, and was the conscience behind the dry, problem-solving art that emerged in the 60's under the rubric of \\"color field\\" painting.    Mr. Greenberg is not a critic with a flexible approach. Since 1939, when he published his now classic essay \\"Avant-Garde and Kitsch,\\" he has been a stubborn defender of \\"formalism.\\" He sees the art of the past century as a search for pure form, a systematic stripping away of subject matter, illusion and everything else he feels is extraneous to art. Driven by an internal, inevitable logic, painting evolved to the point where it finally discovered that it wasn't about storytelling or even an artist's feelings, but rather about its own qualities, such as the \\"flatness\\" of the canvas. In much the same way that Pollock elevated American painting to international renown, Mr. Greenberg is the first American art critic whose work can be put on the library shelf next to Roger Fry, Charles Baudelaire and other great European critics.    Today, no one would describe Mr. Greenberg as a model of prolificacy. Stalled for more than two years on a book entitled \\"Home-Made Esthetics,\\" he complains of being afflicted by a \\"neurotic languor.\\" Yet his days are not completely idle. He lectures at universities, judges art contests, and makes himself available to graduate students and scholars. He receives many queries in the mail, and diligently answers them all. Dissertations have been written on him, and a biography is under way. The concluding two volumes of his collected writings will be published next year by the University of Chicago Press -- an event that Mr. Greenberg regards with a distinct lack of enthusiasm. \\"I don't reread my work,\\" he explains. \\"It's too painful.\\"    His detractors might agree. Mr. Greenberg's conception of modern art is brilliant but notoriously narrow, and it has not gone unchallenged. As long ago as 1976, Tom Wolfe made merry with the critic in \\"The Painted Word,\\" portraying him as an absurd theorist to whom \\"the Freight Train of Art History had a specific destination. . . . Flatness.\\" It isn't surprising that Mr. Wolfe, an art-world outsider known for his rackety wit, would treat Mr. Greenberg as a comic figure. But what is surprising, perhaps, is that the tone of Mr. Wolfe's criticisms -- hectoring, mocking, rudely dismissive -- is the same tone that nowadays characterizes much of the writing emanating from inside the art world.    At a time when the high-minded ideals of modernism are being replaced by a more relaxed esthetic, Mr. Greenberg has come to be regarded as an unsavory survivor of the old regime. Scholars and critics attack articles of his from 40 or 50 years ago as if they had been written just yesterday. Among the more prominent Greenberg-bashers are leftist professors like Rosalind Krauss and T. J. Clark, who resent the critic for presenting art as a seamless, self-contained bubble floating high above the world of politics.    Robert Storr, the new curator of contemporary art at the Museum of Modern Art, is typical of the younger breed of opponents. Fortyish and hip, he dismisses the established order without compunction","excerpt":"in a catalogue accompanying the \\"High-Low\\" show held at the museum in the fall, he accused Mr. Greenberg and his followers of trafficking in \\"intellectual kitsch, a debased form of thinking.\\" Like many others, Mr. Storr feels that formalism's love of abstract painting to the exclusion of everything else has warped our understanding of modernism, and that new, more tolerant approaches are needed.    Confronted with these charges, Mr. Greenberg looks surprised. He says he can't understand why people accuse him of dogmatically defending abstract painting or trying to push art in a specific direction. \\"You can't say I'm for one kind of art,\\" he protests. \\"The only kind of art I'm in favor of is    good    art. All other things being equal I prefer figurative art. But the fact is the very best art of the past 30 or 40 years has been abstract art.\\"    Mr. Greenberg keeps a close watch on his fellow critics -- and seems to disapprove of nearly all of them. Most critics today have a \\"bad eye,\\" he says. Asked if there's anyone alive who he thinks has a good eye, he replies, \\"Only the people who go along with me.\\"    Mr. Greenberg came of age during the Depression years, when the key word was \\"cause\\" and everyone had one. It was a decade of rallies and soap-box orators, and in some ways he epitomizes its talky, opinionated spirit. \\"You can't get around without value judgments,\\" he says. \\"People who don't make value judgments are dullards. Two or three people I know, I like them, but they're dullards. They have no opinions, not just about art, but about anything. Having an opinion is central to being interesting -- unless you're a child.     \\"Do wives have to have opinions?\\" He pauses, stares off as if the question he has asked himself is a weighty one, then resoundingly delivers his reply: \\"   My    wife has to have opinions.\\" Mr. Greenberg's wife, Jenny, is a playwright, whom he married for the second time last year after a divorce a decade earlier. Their daughter, Sarah, owns the Greenberg-Wilson gallery in SoHo. \\"She majored in art history against my wishes,\\" her father says dejectedly. \\"Art became chic.\\"    Mr. Greenberg observed in the 40's that for American Jewish writers of his generation, literature offered an escape from their immigrant heritage, a flight from the \\"restriction and squalor of the Brooklyns and Bronxes to the wide open world which rewards the successful fugitive with space, importance and wealth.\\"    This notion of culture as a means of ascent certainly holds true in his own case. Born in the Bronx in 1909, he grew up in Norfolk, Va., and Brooklyn, the oldest son of a Russian immigrant who owned a clothing store. From the time he was 4, the young Clement drew obsessively, delighted by his talent for bringing objects and people to life. His parents didn't share his affection for art. He glumly describes them as \\"barbarians\\" who discarded his every last scrap of artwork -- and who perhaps unwittingly laid the groundwork for their son's famous theorizing on the mutual antagonism between art and the average man.    After graduating from Syracuse University in 1930, where he majored in literature, Mr. Greenberg settled in New York. As the Depression cast its bleak shadow on the city, he sat at home unemployed, teaching himself Latin and German, and eventually found work translating books. A turning point came in 1937, when he was hired as a customs clerk by the Federal Government. Assigned to the Appraisers Store division of the Customs Service on Varick Street, he began to spend idle hours at the office composing essays on culture. They soon found their way into the pages of Partisan Review, the unofficial house organ of that brainy and querulous group known as the New York Intellectuals.    Mr. Greenberg emerged on the art scene when it was still fairly small. In the early 40's you could visit all the galleries in town in just a morning, and critics belonged to the isolated, impecunious world of the artists themselves. Mr. Greenberg, who lived in Greenwich Village, soon got to know nearly all the young artists. Among them was an obscure painter named Jackson Pollock, who was earning a pittance on the W.P.A. Federal Art Project -- and struck him as the one American painter whose work could stand up to the great Europeans.    The critic praised him extravagantly and at first hardly anyone noticed. But in much the same way that the French critic Felix Feneon became linked with Georges Seurat, and the British critic John Ruskin with J. M. W. Turner, Greenberg's name eventually became inseparable from Pollock's. Together they symbolize the romance of an era in which critics and artists believed that American painting could finally outshine the art of Paris, and were right.    While Mr. Greenberg was prescient in his support of Abstract Expressionism, his later allegiances have generated less enthusiasm. In 1959, after becoming a consultant to the French & Company gallery on Madison Avenue, he organized shows by Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Larry Poons and other spearheads of the \\"color field\\" school of painting. The movement reached its zenith in the mid-60's, when people talked of a Greenberg school and the artists' abstractions increasingly pre-empted space in galleries, museums and art magazines.    Today, it might be argued that Morris Louis is the only painter of the group whose reputation seems fully deserved, yet Mr. Greenberg is loyal to his favorites. Mr. Olitski, he says, is the \\"greatest living painter,\\" towering above everyone else.    Besides offering written criticism, Mr. Greenberg is an avid practitioner of the ritual known as the studio visit. He routinely visits artists at work to dispense advice. And what does he tell them? \\"You say,\\" he replies, 'That's good' or 'That's not as good' or 'That's not good enough.' You never say, 'That's bad' in an artist's studio.\\"    It has often been said that Mr. Greenberg tells artists how to paint, a charge he adamantly denies. Yet he does have a knack for friendly intrusion. After Morris Louis died in 1962, Mr. Greenberg, with the approval of the artist's widow, completed a few Louis paintings by deciding where to cut off the stripes.   In 1974 controversy erupted when Mr. Greenberg, this time in the role of executor of an estate, was publicly accused of stripping the paint from several unfinished David Smith sculptures. \\"They looked better with the naked metal,\\" he says without apology, adding that he removed only primer.     Asked whether any limits govern a critic's relationship with artists, Mr. Greenberg thinks for a while. \\"What you can't do is write in praise of a girlfriend,\\" he replies, referring perhaps to Helen Frankenthaler, a second-generation Abstract Expressionist whom he dated in the early 50's. \\"People think I've written about Helen, but I haven't.\\"    One of the hallmarks of Mr. Greenberg's style is his elephantine self-assurance. His \\"Art and Culture\\" (1961), a campus classic that brings together his key writings, has taught a generation of students that the formalist path to modern art is the only path.   Nonetheless, it is not churlish to wonder whether Mr. Greenberg ever doubts his own ideas. Even his admirers might concede that formalism is frustratingly limited. Shouldn't art speak to something larger than its own limitations? What is to keep art from becoming trivial if it refuses to grapple with age-old themes like morality and nature and death?    Faced with such questions, Mr. Greenberg moans loudly. \\"Those are questions asked by square people!\\" he says.    Does he think art has any connection to an artist's life?    \\"I only make one demand of art -- that it be good,\\" he replies. \\"How it gets to be good I don't care.\\"    And is it wrong to want art to instruct us in living and in dying?    \\"The mission of art is to be good according to its own lights,\\" he says solemnly. \\"It has no other mission.\\"    There is a poignancy to his reply, to his stubborn adherence to the old orthodoxies. Or maybe it is just the poignancy of old age. Nearly all the artists whom Mr. Greenberg championed in his youth are gone now, and the days when he knew virtually everyone in the art world are long over. It's incredible, a visitor tells him, that he has managed to outlive so many members of his generation.    \\"Incredible?\\" he says, exhaling a plume of smoke. \\"No one uses that word correctly anymore.\\" Catching Up With the High Priest Of Criticism"},{"year":"1994","title":"TWO years ago, Patrick Cullen had a problem.

Jones, chairman and chief executive of Jones Intercable Inc., Jones Spacelink Ltd., Jones International Ltd. and Mind Extension University. \\"I'm in the business of extending the human mind.\\"   Certainly, Mr. Jones, 63, is not your everyday cable executive. The owner of 23-year-old Jones Intercable, the country's seventh-largest cable operator, which owns or manages 44 cable systems serving 1.4 million subscribers in California, New York and 18 other states, sees himself as a visionary pioneer on the information highway, an entrepreneur/ risk-taker, a poet of technology. He works from a high-tech headquarters in Denver. And he reads voraciously, cites science fiction easily and writes books and poetry (as Yankee Jones).   Like Ted Turner, Mr. Jones is also producing his own programming. In 1989, he founded the Jones Entertainment Group, which produced the current release \\"Household Saints.\\" And like other cable moguls, Mr. Jones has recently seen his wealth ballooning -- Intercable's shares are up nearly 70 percent since May, trading at around $17 last week -- as Wall Street has become bullish on cable's role in the future delivery of home entertainment. Witness Bell Atlantic's deal for Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable operator, and the battle between Viacom and QVC Network for Paramount Communications. Indeed, Intercable and Spacelink themselves may merge to help attract a partnership deal or capital from Pacific Telesis or Bell Canada.   \\"The entertainment business,\\" Mr. Jones says, \\"impacts the human mind, which is the determination point of the electronic highway. The brain is a three-pound electrochemical device that cooks along at about 25 watts, mostly glucose. It's really the world's first computer.\\"   Mr. Jones's mix of management philosophy and technological jargon suggests a cross between Carl Sagan and Ross Perot. To keep up with the latest ideas, Mr. Jones often buys $500 worth of books at a time and stuffs them into three backpacks, keeping one in the office, one on his five-seater jet and one in the trunk of his white Mercedes. At his Frank Lloyd Wright-style home in Denver, he just finished reading a biography of Jefferson and has started one on John Paul Jones.   \\"Those people,\\" he said, \\"talked about the idea of individual freedom and the concept of self-government -- a delicate, tenuous experiment still going on because it was based on having an informed electorate, which brings you right into education. Our democracy needs to become more electronic.\\"   The education of America is Mr. Jones's passion. He has lavished some $30 million on his Mind Extension University since he founded it in 1987 to provide college classes -- with credit -- by cable. This type of education, he said, would not have worked before the advent of the VCR, with its taping capabilities.   Right now, 25.5 million subscribers to basic cable systems that carry the MEU channel can watch classes for free, but those seeking credit must enroll at one of the 26 universities. The schools, which charge MEU students less than the full cost of actually attending class, include the University of California at Berkeley, George Washington University, the University of Maryland and Colorado State. Currently, Mr. Jones said, 36,000 students are enrolled in at least one course.   Linda Roberts, special adviser on technology for the United States Education Department, gives Mr. Jones credit for being on the cutting edge of the information highway. \\"Mind Extension University is a very important example of how we can use today's technological systems, whether cable or interactive fiber,\\" she said.   While he is proud of his educational mission, Mr. Jones is a bit defensive about MEU's for-profit status as well as its current lack of profits. \\"It is a legitimate purpose of the private sector to focus upon and help resolve the intractable problems of our culture,\\" he insisted. He added: \\"I'm taking the risks. And it's un-American for me not to make a profit somewhere down the line -- about three years.\\"   Mr. Jones is used to being called crazy -- like a fox.   \\"We started small when people didn't understand the limited partnership concept\\" in acquiring cable systems, he said, \\"so we had to form our own securities company. We raised $152,000 with the first limited partnership, then started raising $33 million and $55 million at a clip. It was un-American at the time, but it became mainstream when I raised $200 million. Since 1972, we've raised $1.3 billion in capital. We have 170,000 limited partners.\\"   In many ways, Mr. Jones is already living the future. Of the company's 3,600 employees in the Denver area, 350 work in the suburb of Englewood in a glass office building with a helicopter pad. Fiber-optic and coaxial cables snake under the floors. Mr. Jones's circular office has 16 television sets and a computer that can manipulate several satellite dishes. At the center of the building is an atrium, featuring a big reflecting pool with an island.   In a ceremony in the atrium each year, Mr. Jones honors one of his employees for a job well done. The employee receives the award on the island as colleagues watch and bagpipes play.   \\"There's a lot of poetry in business,\\" Mr. Jones said. \\"Hard as it is.\\" The Executive Life","excerpt":"In a Fast Lane On the Data Highway"},{"year":"1973","title":"ST LOUIS, July 27 &#8212","excerpt":"In a fastball&#8208;to&#8208;fastball confronta tion of All&#8208;Star pitchers, Tom Seaver outpitched Rick Wise, 2&#8208;1, and sent the New York Mets flying home with a plus record for their longest trip of the year.

After a series of neurological tests, doctors at the University of Minnesota concluded that he had multiple sclerosis.  Despite periodic flare-ups that sometimes required hospitalization, Ronald managed to complete a college degree in psychology and develop expertise as a social worker. He met a fellow student who became his wife and mother of their three sons.   Ronald, now 52 years old, still works full time, drives a car and gets about on his own, though he uses a cane because his gait is sometimes unsteady. Despite the slow progression of his stillincurable illness, he always has a smile and a good word for family and friends. His indomitable spirit, his friends say, helped him to surmount the limitations of the disease and to lead a full and useful life.   Luck was also on his side, for he is among a large minority of multiple sclerosis patients whose disease has followed a relatively benign course. Others fare even better than he: About 25 percent of victims never develop progressively disabling symptoms even though they have occasional flare-ups","excerpt":"in a few patients the disease becomes inactive indefinitely even without treatment.

THE VIEW FROM: THE CROTON AQUEDUCT;\\nVOLUNTEERS WIN BARRIERS TO KEEP CARS AND LITTER OFF THE TRAIL"},{"year":"1990","title":"Not for some time has New York City been presented with two more extensive drawing shows than \\"Renaissance Into Baroque,\\" at the National Academy of Design, and \\"Woodner Collection: Master Drawings,\\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The latter includes some 150 works that form a virtual compendium of artistic activity in Europe since the Middle Ages.   The National Academy's display brings together the same number of drawings from the second half of the 16th century by the brothers Taddeo and Federico Zuccaro. Taddeo, in particular, dominated the artistic scene in Italy, as Polidoro da Caravaggio and Parmigianino had done a generation earlier. Working on a series of commissions from Pope Julius III and others, he completed several major decorative projects -including those for the Villa Giulia, the Farnese Palace, the Belvedere in the Vatican and the Mattei Chapel at the Church of Santa Maria della Consolazione in Rome - that made the term Zuccaresque virtually synonymous with Italian art of the later 1500's.   \\"Renaissance Into Baroque\\" includes several dozen works that confirm him as a draftsman of the very first rank, a man who, in a few quick strokes, could render figures that combined Raphaelesque elegance with Michelangelesque power. A sheet of studies for the Frangipani Chapel in Rome conveys Taddeo's freedom of approach and his almost frenetic intensity. And his drawing of \\"St. Paul Restoring Eutychus to Life\\" proves him to be an artist who could suggest Herculean scale in an image of modest size.   Taddeo's career lasted only 18 years and was confined essentially to Rome, where he established a personal reputation as studious and humble. Federico, on the other hand, studied under Taddeo and went on to work for more than a half-century, completing projects in places as disparate as London, Madrid, Antwerp and Venice.   The exhibition, organized by E. James Mundy, chief curator at the Milwaukee Art Museum, and drawn from North American collections, is devoted mostly to Federico, the less studied of the two brothers. Mr. Mundy has tried to establish a chronology for Federico's works and to make the case in a catalogue essay that he exemplifies as clearly as any artist the transformation in Italy from the Renaissance to the Baroque.   Mr. Mundy argues, as well, that Federico was one of the first truly international artists. Federico, he notes, relied on such widespread sources as Titian, Michelangelo and Hans Holbein the Younger, whose works he had seen on his various travels. \\"Whereas it would be fair to say that Taddeo's style was invented in Rome, Federico's was forged in an international crucible,\\" he writes.   And it is true that Federico was an artist who didn't adhere to one style. A drawing like \\"The Vision of St. Eustace,\\" with its picturesque landscape, rounded figures and sweet mood, bears hardly a passing resemblance to the nervous, spiderly study for the \\"Canonization of St. Hyacinth by Pope Clement VIII.\\"   What cannot be said is that when it came to drawing Federico matched the virtuosity and emotional conviction of his older brother's work. To see Taddeo's study of a man seen from behind, and Federico's version of the same subject is to see the difference between a draftsman who could endow a subject with grandeur and vigor and one who couldn't.   It should be added that this did not stop Federico from declaring himself a figure of singular importance. He published an influential treatise summarizing his theories about art in 1607 and he maintained an academy at his home in Rome on the Via Gregoriana. He was one of the only artists to have commemorative medals struck in his own honor. \\"He became something of a role model for the proliferaton of courtier-artists during the next two centuries,\\" Mr. Mundy notes.   But appropriately, it is a drawing by Taddeo, not Federico, that is included in the selection of works from Ian Woodner's collection at the Metropolitan. The show includes one-sixth of Mr. Woodner's extensive holdings, arranged according to national schools. Mr. Woodner, a developer born in Minnesota, began collecting during the 1950's and, at the age of 87, continues to add to what has clearly become one of the finest private drawings collections in the world. Several new purchases have been added to this exhibition since its last stop, in London in 1987.   The show begins with the Italian school and what may be the finest object the collector owns, a sheet of drawings by Filippino Lippi and Sandro Botticelli that was put together by Giorgio Vasari. There is also Benvenuto Cellini's finely wrought and agonizing depiction of a satyr that was Mr. Woodner's first major purchase, and a flickering depiction of three philosophers at an altar by the sculptor Baccio Bandinelli, the son of Cellini's teacher.   The Italians are most extensively represented in this show, but the strength of Mr. Woodner's holdings, in terms of national schools, would seem to be in German, Dutch and Flemish artists. He has bought aggressively and wisely, seeking out rare sheets attributed to Albrecht Durer, an airy interior by Pieter Janz Saenredam, a zesty head of a bearded man attributed to Jost Amman, a pair of penetrating portraits by Hans Holbein the Younger, and a series of works by anonymous artists like the 15th-century Swabian master whose study of a knight in armor is among the more entrancing images on view. With the Italian artists, Mr. Woodner may have steered toward familiar names, but in the case of Germany, he seems to have let taste dictate selections.   The strengths of his collection in terms of individual artists come with the assortment of 19th- and 20th-century work. Odilon Redon, Georges Seurat, Francisco Goya and, to a lesser extent, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres are brilliantly represented. There are, as well, many works of middling interest and importance, and a few drawings that may be optimistically or just wrongly attributed, including those that are said to be by Dieric Bouts and Michelangelo.   It must not go without mention, in fact, that Mr. Woodner's catalogue and the selection of the works in the exhibition were done by the collector, his staff and scholars whom he hired, not by the museum, a situation that cannot help but seem to compromise the Metropolitan's independence and integrity. (Mr. Woodner wrote the catalogue entry attributing the Michelangelo drawing, for instance.) As for \\"Renaissance Into Baroque\\" it has been partly sponsored by Sotheby's, the auction house that sold a large assortment of drawings by the Zuccaros in January when the show was on view in Milwaukee. Mr. Mundy had been working on the exhibition long before Sotheby's offered its support and his interests in the subject are obviously genuine. Sotheby's has also sponsored a number of displays in Europe in which it had no financial conflict.   But the coincidence in this case of auction and exhibition can only cast a cloud over the show. Whether prices were boosted by the exhibition is of course impossible to say, but presumably Sotheby's did not give money with the idea that the show would hurt sales.

He was to the defiant Jew what the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was to the proud African-American, but while Dr. King said no to violence, Rabbi Kahane said use it if necessary.    The rabbi often said it was good for the Jew hater to know that some Jews were crazy enough to do anything in their defense. Though I and my colleagues disagreed with him on many issues, we never washed our laundry in public. In 10 years, he never made a racist remark about any group in front of me.    His commitment was singular, and nothing or no one got in his way. You either agreed with him or you were against him. I never saw him squander money, give importance to material things or look jealously upon another's possessions. He was committed to God, Israel and its people, and to himself last of all.    Once in Chicago, he decided we should go to Nazi headquarters during the middle of a weekday, when most of our J.D.L. chapter members were at work. With only a dozen men, we stood in front of the 71st Street building, outnumbered 4 to 1 by the National Socialists and surrounded by a hostile local populace.    I stood next to him with people screaming in our faces, cursing and defaming our heritage, and yet I realized they felt a grudging respect for a dozen Jews willing to risk all odds. I wanted a police escort to make sure the rabbi got out of there in one piece, and he became angry with me for even thinking such a thing.    In the late 1960's, Rabbi Kahane protested the mistreatment of Soviet Jews by taking his radical ideas to the streets and harassing Soviet diplomats. He said if Jews were fair game, so were they.    He takes his place in a line of Jewish martyrs, honored mostly by their own, whose blood has run freely in most of the countries of the world. When it came time to charge the enemy, he was always at the point of saying, \\"Follow me.\\" BUZZ ALPERT Chicago, Nov. 6, 1990 But Meir Kahane's Message Refuses to Die","excerpt":"In a Line of Martyrs"},{"year":"1964","title":"Albert B.

I believe that, on the contrary, the use of calculators would introduce extraneous inequities in the examination.   If students bring their own calculators to the S.A.T., those who can afford expensive calculators, the ones that perform complex tasks at the press of a few buttons, will have a clear advantage over those who can afford only the minimal, basic hand calculator.    Conversely, if calculators are supplied by Educational Testing Service, it will take some time for many test takers to adjust to the format of the calculator handed out, while those students who have had experience playing with calculators through their school days will be in a better position to master quickly the configuration of almost any hand calculator. Since time is important in doing well on the S.A.T., adapting quickly to the new device would be of considerable advantage.   Once calculators are introduced, math problems frequently do not have a single answer. Suppose that after some manipulation a problem comes down to adding 2/3 and 1/4. Those of us who can add fractions will get 11/12","excerpt":"in a multiple choice test, 11/12 is the answer. If calculators are allowed, the student would not have to know how to add fractions; most people cannot add 2/3 and 1/4. (Try it on a few friends.)    Thus the student with the calculator would proceed as follows: Press the 2 button, then the division symbol (/), then the 3 button and finally the equal symbol (=). The display register will show 2/3 to be .66666666 or, on some machines, .66666667. There may be more or fewer sixes if the calculator has a larger or smaller number of digits for display. Then do the same with 1/4, getting .25000000. Add the two decimals, getting .91666666 or .91666667, which is an approximation to 11/12.    Now, in a multiple-choice test those  who compose the test are in a quandary about what to list as the right answer because there are now several possible \\"right\\" answers. The result is that multiple-choice questions would have to be abandoned in favor of fill-in-the-blank questions.    However, because there is not a single answer to such a problem (and almost all problems in which calculators are used exhibit this feature), the grader would have a difficult time deciding what is acceptable. For the simple problem we have just described, there are these possible answers: 11/12, .91666666, .91666667, .91666666666, and even 2/3 + 1/4. There are many others; grading becomes unfair when the grader does not recognize a correct answer because the form in which it is stated is unfamiliar to the grader.   Finally, if we expect that students do not know how to add fractions, we have to allow extra time for them to do even simple computations on the calculator. Thus those who can add fractions and can easily perform straightforward arithmetic have a time advantage. Perversely, those who need to use a calculator take more time for simple computations than do those who know arithmetic.   Calculators hurt students who are relatively inexperienced in using them, introduce inequities in grading, may separate wealthy students from poor ones and alter the efficient use of the student's time in taking the S.A.T. Keep them out of the hands of test takers.  M. H.

King, then a local disk jockey, was starting to perform as a musician, he made a series of self-conscious decisions. He wanted the sound of a gospel quartet, but since the line between secular and  religious music hadn't been crossed, he settled for a horn section to play the role. He combined the music of his four favorite guitarists, Django Reinhardt, Charlie Christian, Lonnie Johnson and Blind Lemon Jefferson, into a distinct improvisational style. He invoked, rhythmically and with the instrumentation of  his small band, the sound and power of the best big bands. In his borrowing, he  came up with the perfect sound for a postwar America, that of rural culture moving to the city, sophisticated and urban with mud on its boots.         Mr. King also perfectly understood the uses of his instrument, the electric guitar, and on Tuesday night at the Blue Note he took advantage of all the infinite shadings that electricity can provide. He played long, unbroken lines,  bending one note into the next, sometimes using vibrato so that the beginning and ending of notes disappeared, sometimes changing his attack so that lines seemed to be speaking. He made his tone rough by pressuring his amplifier into distortion. He chopped some notes short, and let others drift until they faded.  Mr. King is in his early 70's, and in this set there was a lifetime's worth of skill and technique on display. Every note he played had a personality of its own.

Shaken by what he described as a ruthless attempt on his life, Mr. Perez wondered aloud what the plotters could have hoped to gain. \\"We cannot imagine how these madmen could be full of such anachronism, such ignorance, or such hate or ambition,\\" he said, \\"for them not to realize that the time of the coup d'etat is over in Latin America.\\"   Given the months of coup rumors that preceded the first attacks late Monday night, Mr. Perez could not have been entirely surprised. But there were reasons for his disbelief. For 34 years, Venezuela has been a democratic exception in South America, passing from one elected government to another. Its economy grew a stunning 9.2 percent last year, winning praise from investors and financiers at home and abroad. Just one day before the revolt, which left as many as 78 dead, Mr. Perez gushed of his success at a meeting of business leaders in Davos, Switzerland. \\"The spirit of the reforms is no longer a subject of controversy,\\" he said.  Grudging Support    As much as Venezuela's neighbors might share Mr. Perez's shock, they could hardly help but see last week's bloodshed as a reminder of the limits to Latin America's incipient recovery from a decade of economic crisis. However retrograde their methods, the military rebels in Venezuela were not so out of touch with the national mood.

The images are moving and at times anguished, but the faces depicted in both books convey hope and fortitude far more than sadness. For LIVING PROOF: Courage in the Face of AIDS (Abbeville, $19.95), Ms. Jones, a New York fashion photographer, asked people who are H.I.V. positive to pose in her studio with an object or person that meant a great deal to them. The symbolism speaks for itself -- a close-up of two hands entwined, a mother embracing her daughter, a young man straightening his tie to prepare for whatever comes next. Her subjects' comments focus less on the pain of loss than on the determination, verve and spirit of renewal that they need to live. Almost without exception, their goal is to enjoy the life that remains, and the ultimate effect of these powerful portraits is surprisingly upbeat. In LIVING WITH AIDS: A Photographic Journal (Bulfinch/Little, Brown, $24.95), Mr. Lopes chronicles three related stories. First, he illustrates the emotional -- and political -- impact of AIDS by depicting the Names Project AIDS Memorial Quilt as it was unfurled during demonstrations in Washington in 1988 and 1992. Candid shots show mourners touching, lying sprawled across and even wrapped around sections of the quilt. In the next section, Mr. Lopes, the author of \\"The Wall: Images and Offerings From the Vietnam Veterans Memorial,\\" records the bonds that develop between AIDS patients and the volunteers assigned, through a community \\"buddies\\" program, to help them through their illness. The agonizing immediacy of these dual portraits -- in many cases the AIDS patients are visibly close to death -- carries a message of courage and mutual support.

His new assignment, given to him by Jazz at Lincoln Center, is THELONIOUS MONK. Almost everything Monk wrote had the dance impulse in it: his tunes were springy and full of wit. But their simplicity can be deceptive. (I would love to see Mr. Glover, or any dancer, try the 4/4 over the waltz in Monk's version of ''Carolina Moon.'') In any case, Monk's work is packed with fresh suggestions for any improvising artist, and ''Tappin' Into Monk,'' Mr. Glover's collaboration with a first-rate quartet--the pianist CYRUS CHESTNUT, the saxophonist TED NASH, the bassist GERALD CANNON and the drummer HERLIN RILEY -- could be one of the best jazz events of the season. Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Rose Theater, 60th Street and Broadway, (212)721-6500.    Most of us go to see live music to be chilled, a little bit spooked, and MILTON NASCIMENTO consistently delivers. He was part of the upwelling of great popular music in Brazil in the 1960's and 70's. The innocence and desire of his wide-ranging voice, as well as his repertory of distinctive songs, crossing midperiod Beatles with the sound of a Catholic church service, don't lose their power to hit you in the sternum. He has a new album, ''Pieta'' (Savoy), his most focused in years, which takes his 70's sound as its jumping-off point and then moves in the directions of more basic (parade drums) and less so (tape loops).
