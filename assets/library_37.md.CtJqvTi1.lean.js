The sun goes down, the sun comes up, and Selection Sunday turns into Travel Agent Monday, full of extremely important questions.

O.K., O.K. How about Buckhead?   Why can't all those very distinguished, very important college graduates convince their schools that there must be extra tickets hanging around?    Why isn't there a chance to fit all those Indiana Hoosiers who thought they were headed to Cincinnati into the Owyhee Plaza Hotel in Boise, Idaho?   Princeton in the Final 16?    Why not?  SOMEBODY PUT A FRESH ROLL OF PAPER ON THE RICHTER SCALE   The best matchup that may never happen: West semifinal, at Albuquerque. Louisiana State vs. Georgetown, Shaquill O'Neal vs. Alonzo Mourning. It could be the best meeting of big men since Patrick Ewing and Georgetown beat Hakeem Olajuwon and Houston in the 1984 championship game. Just two major problems: Georgetown must get past Florida State, and L.S.U. could have a second-round game against Indiana. We may just have to wait for an N.B.A. All-Star Game.  MOST VULNERABLE NO. 1 SEEDED TEAM   The Bruins of U.C.L.A., the last to repeat as champion, in '73. U.C.L.A. (25-4) was seeded first in the West despite late-season losses to Southern California and Duke. The Bruins could face a second-round game against Louisville and Denny Crum, a former assistant to John Wooden for part of the school's historic run of 10 championships in 12 years.  BEST NAME IN TOURNAMENT   Delaware's Spencer Dunkley, a 6-foot 11-inch center who does not lead the Blue Hens in dunks. That distinction is held by 6-6 forward Alex Coles, who has had 43 dunks this season and 146 in his four years.    IS THIS PART OF THE SYRACUSE PROBATION?   Before the sun went down on Selection Sunday, Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim was smiling as he stood outside a dressing room in Madison Square Garden. His team's Big East tournament trophy had fresh fingerprints on it, and Boeheim was tweaking detractors who predict an annual early N.C.A.A. tournament exit. \\"I love being the underdog,\\" Boeheim said. \\"I've never been an underdog before.\\"   So who do the Orangemen draw? The Princeton Tigers, every yuppie's underdog.    LONGEST WAIT FOR A TICKET IN NEW YORK CITY...   Twenty-one years. That is how long it had been since Fordham University conducted its last sale for an N.C.A.A. game. Fordham's allotment of 250 tickets for the game against Massachusetts Friday at Worcester, Mass. was gone in less than 30 minutes. After seats were set aside for families of players, the band, and athletic department personnel, there were only about 50 left.   \\"It's a shame,\\" said assistant business manager George Kolb. \\"Everybody has been so angry. I don't know what to say to them.\\"  ...AND ANYWHERE   After exhaustive research, the University of Delaware determined that its state, which as license plates have reminded us was first to ratify the Constitution, was the last to place a team in any level of the men's or women's tournament. Which led sports information director Scott Selheimer to proclaim: \\"First to ratify, last to qualify.\\"  ISN'T THE OTHER ONE SUPPOSED TO BE THE LOSER'S TOURNAMENT?

The German baritone, who canceled his New York debut last year owing to illness, had already been nominated by some English and other European critics as the successor to the long-reigning king of song, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. No wonder the audience at Alice Tully Hall was large and unusually attentive as Mr. Baer and his pianist, Geoffrey Parsons, played out the poignant, hourlong drama that is \\"Die Schone Mullerin.\\"   In choosing to introduce himself with Schubert's 20-song cycle rather than a potpourri program, Mr. Baer certainly signaled his seriousness. Most song enthusiasts hold a firm opinion about what should happen in Schubert's lyric narrative, one of the cornerstones of the lieder literature. Nor are they reluctant to measure a newcomer against famous recordings or fondly remembered recitals. Before Mr. Baer's appearance, one heard all the familiar names being dropped: Fischer-Dieskau, Hotter, Schreier, Souzay, Prey, Wunderlich, Husch, Schiotz. Comparing artists is seldom meaningful, however, and with critics can frequently degenerate into consumer advice. Mr. Baer deserved to be heard as himself, not a clone of some past master.

There is Billy Graham, who lost a controversial call in a welterweight title bout in Havana to Kid Gavilan, a Cuban, in 1952. He said Ernest Hemingway told him that he had clearly won but that he was luckier to have lost since most spectators carried guns.   In one corner - by the coffee urn - was Allie Stolz, who lost a lightweight title shot against Sammy Angott, a fight that the septuagenarian growls he won. Toward center ring was Roger Donoghue, a promising middleweight in the 1950's, until he killed a man with his fists and never bounced back.   The men are members of an organization called Veteran Boxers Ring No. 8. It is one of a number of similar \\"rings\\" around the country dedicated to the health needs of those who fought for a tiny fraction of what professionals make today. It gathers contributions to provide free dental care, eyeglasses and periodic medical exams. When a boxing brother is in trouble - say in an emergency room with no health insurance -members come to help.   They want to do far more. One idea is to persuade promoters to dedicate a tiny percentage of revenues to the care of retired boxers in the manner that the Screen Actors Guild takes care of elderly actors. Some favor Federal legislation to force this.   \\"What happens when a guy comes from the Dominican Republic and he's an old boxer and he gets hit by a truck?\\" asked Charley Gellman, first vice president of the group. \\"They don't give a damn about the old-timers.\\"   The special attraction the other night was a talk by Irving Rudd, a veteran boxing publicist. \\"I feel strange and touched and funny at the same time,\\" Mr. Rudd began.   In an accent reflecting New York City's streets, he told a little about his life. \\"I didn't graduate from high school, by the way,\\" he said. \\"I was acquitted.\\"   In no time at all he was working for the old Rockland Palace in Harlem. He recalled working on an encounter between Jersey Joe Walcott and Tiger Joe Fox, as well as uncountable bouts with a combined purse of \\"about $90.\\" In more recent years, he has worked with the likes of Ali, Norton, Leonard and Tyson - and has the stories to prove it.   Mr. Rudd spoke of a changed pugilistic landscape. \\"All the fight clubs have become parking lots,\\" he said. \\"The whole thing has shifted now. It isn't like you and I remember.\\"   He wasn't hopeful about the prospect of big-time promoters coughing up money to benefit old boxers. \\"There's no authority,\\" he explained. \\"There's nobody to put the wood to any of them.\\"   Mr. Gellman then took the podium. He said he grew up so poor he had to steal to eat. He fought 66 light-heavyweight bouts, winning most. \\"I fought a main bout in the Garden,\\" he said. \\"I fought one of the other contenders. I knocked him out.\\"   What separates Mr. Gellman from so many boxers is that he saved his small purses to use for an education. He went on from the fight game to administer two hospitals. His speech was long on the virtues of self-help.   \\"You're not going to get anything from anybody, because nobody's going to give you anything,\\" he said. In a machine-gun delivery, he reported a growing health crisis among aging fighters - a crisis that nobody seems eager to address. \\"I've found the biggest guys in the world, when a crisis comes, they run like thieves,\\" he said.   \\"What about the guys from 50 years ago -60 years ago - who right now need help and need help badly?\\" he asked. \\"These guys weren't champs.

Margaret Rutherford as a fussy English matron putting the case for \\"England's migratory birds\\" before the uncomprehending League of Nations is much funnier and more promising than Michael Wilding embarrassedly offering his butler's hand to Penelope Ward.

Tin cans are actually made of steel with a thin coating of tin on the inside to prevent the contents -- everything from soups to vegetables -- from chemically reacting with the iron in steel. The Waupaca foundry uses 20 tons of cans a week as an additive to other types of scrap steel. It uses the steel to make cast-iron auto parts like brake components, exhaust manifolds and clutch plates.    The cans are collected as part of a countywide recycling program. The tops and bottoms, sometimes made of different metals, are removed along with the paper labels. The cans are then cleaned and flattened for shipment to the plant.   The grade of steel used in tin cans makes it a useful additive to the cast-iron mix, Budd officials say. And the tin, though an impurity, actually adds to the tensile strength of the final product.   \\"We did a lot of research before we started this,\\" said Steve Albrecht, manager of sales and marketing at the foundry. \\"We found that the tin actually was a benefit.\\"   Foundries, he added, are \\"natural recyclers\\" because they typically use much more scrap than virgin iron to produce new products.

In a front-page article in its April 23 issue, the paper reported that Mr. Baker has ordered certain ''refinements,'' but that the basic designs of the bullion coins are set.\\n\\nThe legislation authorizing the gold bullion coins specified that the largest of the four pieces, a 1-ounce coin, should carry a ''design symbolic of Liberty'' on the obverse. It stated that the reverse should bear ''a design representing a family of eagles with the male carrying an olive branch and flying above a nest containing a female eagle and hatchlings.''

The audience also found an old Chaplin comedy, \\"The Fatal Mallet,\\" quite amusing, although it proved that the illustrious screen clown has gone a long way since 1916, when this feature was made. Another comic strip was \\"The Kiss,\\" the first commercial film ever produced and released in the United States.The initial presentation was Mary Pickford's ancient production. It was made in 1912. In it Miss Pickford filled the rôle of a Salvation Army lass, and King Baggot, who 13 now a director of repute, figured as the hero who had resolved, come what might, to go straight. The action of the extended flat right hand signified his intentions, and he stuck to his resolution in spite of all temptation that was thrust in his way. It is safe to assert that nobody would recognize in the Salvation Army girl with the big bonnet the charming Miss Pickford of today.From the viewpoint of merit the picture that proved the most stirring was Mr. Brabin's \\"Driven,\\" which was made in 1922. It is a throbbing narrative of Southern mountaineers in which a mother betrays her husband and two sons to save her youngest boy. Emily Fitzroy gives an amazingly fine performance in the part of the mother and Burr McIntosh is capital as the cruel, godless husband and father. Charles Emmet Mack, who is to be seen this week in \\"The Unknown Soldier,\\" acts the rôle of the youngest son. George Bancroft, who really came to the front after his portrayal of the smiling villain in James Cruze's production, \\"The Pony Express,\\" demonstrates that he ought to have been recognized as an unusually fine screen actor a year or so before he appeared in Mr. Cruze's film.\\"The Great Train Robbery\\" was produced in 1903 and it contained some features that at least show the resourcefulness of the producer. When it comes to throwing the firemen off the engine tender a dummy is quickly substituted, and off it goes to the embankment.\\"Backstairs,\\" the German contribution, is a film without titles, in which Henny Porten, Fritz Kortner and Eugene Dieterle are seen. It is a strong, gruesome feature, but the detail is worked out magnificently. Miss Porten officiates as a servant in a large household, and in depicting her daily toil the director does not duplicate any of her activities. Whether it is dusting a piece of furniture, washing the plates or polishing the glasses, it is done in a natural way. The tale concerns the girl's love for a tall young man, who goes away. The servant waits for a letter, and she smiles the first day when no missive is brought. Her smile has partly faded in a few days, and soon she receives the post-man with a stare and a worried frown.The subnormal, semi-paralytic postman, a man of forbidding appearance and actions, has kept back the girl's letters because he is himself in love with her. In the end the postman slays the girl's sweetheart with an axe and the servant in a daze walks to the roof of the building in which she had been employed and falls to the cobblestones below.The action is told fairly clearly without subtitles, although the players seldom make a movement of their lips that might be understood. There is not even an insert of the letters in this film, as there is in \\"The Last Laugh.\\"Symon Gould, the director of the international Film Arts Guild was congratulated by scores of the spectators for the exceptionally interesting evening he had afforded by his selection of pictures.

Mr. Marsalis is the program's artistic director, and critics, commentators and some older musicians of an experimental bent (though not audiences, which flock to the concerts) have been complaining with great regularity about the preponderance of Mr. Marsalis's own band members in the program's shows, and the yearly presentation of a new commission to himself.   Neither he nor the administrators of Jazz at Lincoln Center have seen fit to do anything diplomatic about the complaints. Instead of backing down, they just keep on going. So Mr. Marsalis will present \\"Blood on the Fields,\\" a two-and-a-half-hour meditation on slavery played by a big band that includes his entire septet (it will be repeated on Saturday).

Dairo started playing juju music in Nigeria in the late 1950's, the music belonged to the urban, Yoruba-speaking working class. By the end of the 1960's, Mr. Dairo had been made a Member of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth, and he and his band, the Blue Spots, had made juju music popular across Nigeria. By recording in other languages as well as Yoruba, by introducing the accordion to music that had previously been made with guitars, percussion and voices, and simply by making music with irresistible melodies and an infectious spirit, Mr. Dairo modernized juju while staying true to its traditional roots.    Younger juju band leaders like King Sunny Ade and Ebenzer Obey toured the United States frequently in the 1980's. But Mr. Dairo's appearance on Tuesday at S.O.B.'s offered a rare chance to hear juju from an older generation. He led a nine-piece band, half the size of the next generation's troupes.

The third and most lasting shock is to find demure Marian Nixon in the role of the hunted woman, gadding about Europe with all the assurance of a high school girl playing Madame X at the commencement exercises.The story opens with the return of Sir Carlyle and Lady Austin from their wedding trip. Four years later Sir Carlyle has a drink too many and kisses his old tennis partner in the garden, whereupon Lady Austin goes off in a huff to London with her baby. Her old friend, Beaumont Winthrop, who has just been told he has three months to live, calls on her and drops dead. The child is taken from her and Lady Austin tries to forget her sorrow on the Continent in the companionship of various men. She sees by the newspapers that her ex-husband is planning to marry his tennis partner, so she steals back to get the baby.

The most appropriate movie scores for such films are still written in a style that imitates the music of the period, in which the long, tonal musical lines once associated with Romantic desire twist upon themselves, splintering into fragments or drifting into disturbed disarray.    So it should not have been too surprising that when the Canadian director Robert Lepage brought his Canadian Opera Company productions of Bartok's \\"Bluebeard's Castle\\" and Schoenberg's \\"Erwartung\\" to the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday night, there was no escaping the sense of cinematic cliche. In Mr. Lepage's staging of Schoenberg's monodrama -- a troubled, disoriented monologue by an unnamed woman -- there are languorous slow-motion sequences: an attack with a scythe, a naked body rolling into a stream of water, blood streaming from a corpse, a hand emerging out of a brick wall and grabbing its victim. There is even a white-suited psychiatrist with a pad, making notes as the woman's obsessions take shape. In Bartok's one-act opera, Mr. Lepage has given us a long dungeon corridor, huge doors with keyholes the size of severed heads, shimmering shadows cast by red light and a slow march of women through streams of blood.

NBC's ''Apprentice: Martha Stewart'' (6.22 million) was among the vanquished, sinking further from its weak debut last Wednesday. But ABC's ''Invasion'' didn't benefit from the strength of ''Lost'' nearly as much as it should have. It delivered 12.97 million viewers and was weaker in the second half-hour than the first, which is never a good sign. NBC's ''Law & Order'' roundly beat ''Invasion'' in total viewers (14.73 million), but more important, it did better than the season premiere of CBS's ''CSI: New York'' in both viewers (13.12 million) and adults 18 to 49. Before that, CBS's ''Criminal Minds'' made its time period debut opposite ''Lost'' and managed to place a very distant second, with an audience of 10.56 million. Fans of UPN's critically beloved ''Veronica Mars'' can feel some relief.

Up-to-date touches include four-letter words, bared breasts and behinds (including the hero's) and soft-porn writhings. There is also plenty of seedy scenery and a top-of-the-voice performance by Mr. Lithgow, alternating between explosions of rage and fits of bonhomie. You can't tell whether the fellow he is playing is determined to keep his flaunt-it wife and the flaunted-at seaman apart or push them very close together, but although the character may flail, Mr. Lithgow's energy never flags.

Doubleday. $19.95.     Both the themes and the characters of \\"Poet and Dancer,\\" Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's 11th novel, uncannily echo those of \\"In Search of Love and Beauty,\\" a novel she published exactly 10 years ago. Both novels concern the fragmentation of family life experienced by immigrants in New York. Both novels feature a similar cast of people, including gurulike charlatans who seduce wealthy women with their promises of salvation","excerpt":"older matrons who end up leading lonely, desperate lives, and the offspring of these people, who drift aimlessly through life in search of love and connection.   This time the reader is introduced to Anna and Siegfried Manarr, wealthy German immigrants who have made a home for themselves in Manhattan. Assiduously devoted to each other, Anna and Siegfried spend their free time going to concerts and art exhibits. Having come from families who have prospered in business for generations, they dream of having children with artistic talent.   Instead, their son, Hugo, becomes a sort of new-age guru who dreams of \\"fashioning a new humanity.\\" He marries a flighty woman named Alice, one of those familiar Jhabvala characters who travel the third world looking for meaning, and they have a pretty, high-strung daughter named Lara. Hugo's sister, Helena, meanwhile marries a wealthy businessman named Peter, and raises a shy, introspective daughter called Angel.   Angel and her cousin Lara meet briefly as young girls, and both vow to pursue artistic careers: Lara will become a dancer; Angel, a poet.   Years pass in which the girls do not see each other. Angel grows up to be a shy, serious girl, unhealthily dependent on her mother. Lara grows up to be a world-class neurotic and flirt.   Beautiful, vivacious and emotionally needy, Lara collects admirers and hangers-on the way a lepidopterist collects butterflies. One of her chief admirers is Angel, who quickly transfers on to her all her needs to be needed. Her other big admirer is Angel's father, Peter, who soon sets her up in a hotel room as his mistress.   Intercut with the incestuous tale of Lara, Angel and Peter are other stories of love and loneliness in Manhattan. Mrs. Jhabvala shows Helena compensating for her daughter's absence by befriending a superstitious widow from India named Mrs. Arora, who has lost her eldest son in a bloody fight in prison. Peter's mother, Mrs. Koenig, meanwhile, tries to compensate for    her    son's absence by befriending Rose, her new maid. Each of these friendships is supposed to make up for more conventional family ties, but as in so much of Mrs. Jhabvala's fiction, love breeds disappointment and regret, not solace and safety.   When Peter grows sick of paying hotel bills for Lara, he comes up with another plan: he decides to install her in an apartment with his daughter, Angel. Despite the protestations of her mother, Angel jumps at the idea, and she and Lara soon become inseparable pals. It's hardly a friendship of equals. In fact, the two women quickly come to resemble one of those infernal pairings found in so many of Anita Brookner's novels: Lara is the imperious, bossy, selfish one, constantly making importunate demands on Angel's time and attention; Angel is the meek, passive one, always eager to please.   Their hermetic relationship seems meant to protect the two women from the realities of the outside world, and it leads, predictably enough, to a dangerous mutual dependency. Angel abandons her poetry-writing; Lara abandons her dance. Lara actively tries to turn Angel against her old friends, and she begins demanding that Angel spend all her time at home. As Lara's behavior grows more and more erratic -- she starts stealing things from stores, and baiting Peter's wife -- Angel begins giving her large doses of tranquilizers. Confusion and hostility soon take over their daily routines and gradually infect the rest of the Manarr clan as well.   Mrs. Jhabvala writes with such fluency and poise that \\"Poet and Dancer\\" flies by with almost no effort from the reader. Her subsidiary characters, as usual, are delineated with deft, ironic strokes, and together they leave the reader with the pleasant sense of being immersed in a convincing fictional world. We are made to see the ways in which emotional needs and scars are handed down from father to son, mother to daughter, and we are made to appreciate the difficulty of erasing these patterns.   Still, the reader finishes \\"Poet and Dancer\\" vaguely dissatified and filled with a lingering sense of deja vu. The story of Angel and Lara feels mechanistic and predictable in the end: as young girls and later as women, they are almost completely defined by a single personality trait or two, traits that practically condemn them to their unhappy fates. Halfway through the book, we know where these characters are headed, and sure enough, we are given no surprises -- or further emotional revelations -- by the novel's end.   Mrs. Jhabvala has written similar stories before, and done so with considerably more complexity and insight.

By good luck while visiting Greece, I turned up at Nemea, 80 miles southwest  of Athens in the Peloponnesus, in time to witness a trial run. The ancient festival was one of four Panhellenic competitions, of which the biggest and oldest was at Olympia. The others were at Delphi and Isthmia, near Corinth.

And the doctor said, \\"It looks benign.\\" Indeed, three women out of four who undergo a biopsy get a clean bill of health.
