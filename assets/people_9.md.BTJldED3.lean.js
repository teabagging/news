Light snow was falling in the Catskills. The cold was beginning to numb, night was coming on, and I was questioning my sanity for getting involved in the affair in the first place.   Fifteen minutes earlier, Lieut. Deming Lindsley had perched a small stuffed deer in a copse of trees across the road. He was hunkered down about 25 yards away, and Officer William Mincarelli and I waited 50 yards farther along, scrunched down in his all-purpose truck.    I didn't believe anyone would be dumb enough to shoot at the decoy, but thought it would be impolite to express my doubts to the two seasoned game wardens, especially since six or eight cars had already passed without stopping and testiness was beginning to set in.    Through the woods we saw a sedan coming, then slow to a creep, then stop. A window was rolled down. We waited. Mincarelli trained his field glasses on the car, muttering.   Suddenly, a shot rang out, then several seconds later, a second report. They were obviously rifle shots.   \\"Go!\\" Lindsley yelled over his shoulder, springing out from under cover and making a run for the sedan.   I quickly became a believer.    The driver looked bewildered as Lindsley -- the palm of his hand on his pistol holster -- sprinted for the sedan, swung open the door and ordered him out of the car. The warden reached in and grabbed a loaded hunting rifle that was in the front seat near the driver's wife. A swaddled baby was sleeping on the back seat.   This scene, for which the hunter subsequently paid fines of $400 on roadhunting charges, is being played out repeatedly in a dozen states this deer-hunting season as conservation officers crack down on illegal hunting.    Col. Donald W. Brewer, commander of the investigative force of the Department of Environmental Conservation in Albany, said the decoy program has been partly responsible for the collection of $2 million in hunting fines in the last year. The decoy programs, most of which use private funds for the decoys but are manned by state game wardens, have spread from the Northeast to as far as Wisconsin and Tennessee, and they are getting results.    \\"Our program in West Virginia has led to charges against 50 hunters, and this is only the first full season we have used decoys,\\" said Capt. Kenneth Painter of the State Division of Natural Resources in St. Albans, W. Va. The decoy program there uses a remote control deer that moves its head.   The only hitch in the program so far, Painter said, is that some local magistrates think decoys translate to entrapment and dismiss many cases, while others believe the safety implications outweigh the civil liberties issue.    Painter said it was the personal embarrassment, more than the fines, that was the major deterrent for roadhunting, which he emphasized was very dangerous.   \\"Setting aside legal issues and putting it as simply as possible, having a loaded hunting rifle in the front seat of a car is crazy,\\" Painter said.   Lindsley and Mincarelli echoed his words. Several hours before setting out the decoy, they had made a routine stop of a van with two bucks tied on the roof to check the hunting licenses and the deer tags.    As Lindsley approached the vehicle one hunter in the front seat started ejecting shells from his .30-.30 Marlin onto the floorboards. One hour later he paid a $200 fine for having a loaded firearm in a vehicle.    \\"The overwhelming majority of hunters do care about safety,\\" Lindsley said, pointing out that sportsmens' clubs in Delaware County donated the $450 for the decoy. \\"But there is a small fraction that don't give a damn how they get a deer.\\"   Lindsley added that many of the same people who are caught road hunting are also involved in petty crime, usually drug possession and burglary.    One recent Saturday Lindsley and Mincarelli either arrested or issued summonses to a dozen hunters in widely scattered locations of Delaware County, which is larger than Rhode Island. Mincarelli is the lone enforcement officer in an area of 500 square miles.    Lindsley has administrative responsibility in both Delaware and Greene Counties, largely for environmental problems such as the disposal of hazardous wastes, and adds wildlife enforcement during the hunting and fishing seasons.   Lindsley, who is 42 years old, and Mincarelli, 56, might be game wardens out of central casting. They wear rough rider campaign hats and mustaches, and maintain a steady stream of patter with hunters, judges and the police from other departments. Lindsley is the son of a fish-and-game officer","excerpt":"Mincarelli a former police officer.    \\"Other kids would either jump all over me because of what my father did,\\" said Lindsley, \\"or pester me for favors.\\" He added that being a game warden also strains the social life he and his wife have in this rural area where almost everyone hunts.   Still, Lindsley insists he has \\"the best job in New York State.\\"   After three years with the decoy program, he remains stunned by the self-absorption of violators. \\"I've caught I don't know how many roadhunters with the decoy and almost without exception they'll ask me 'Did I hit it?' \\" he said, shaking his head. \\"They care more about their marksmanship than getting caught doing something stupid.\\"    Both officers are extremely committed to the importance of their work.
