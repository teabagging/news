Bloomingdale's has centered its Christmas catalogue on the theme \\"Be an Angel Too,\\" with nine celebrities and their favorite charities.   For example, Jane Curtin talks about Unicef, Lena Horne about the United Negro College Fund and Tommy Tune about Broadway Cares.   At Macy's Herald Square, the holiday windows have been decked out in red dresses by 12 young designers. Proceeds from the sale of the one-of-a-kind dresses will be donated by Macy's to the Make a Wish Foundation, a group that grants wishes to terminally ill children.   There is a bright red Christmas bell dress by Isani, a blazing sequined gown by C. D. Greene and a scarlet sheath by Isaia that is topped with an Afro-shaped hat of red Christmas balls. The dresses cost $3,000 each. More on Red    Speaking of red, the next installment of MTV's \\"House of Style,\\" to be shown tomorrow at 10 P.M., may change the way you think of the seductive red dress. Although red is legendary for its sensual powers, a color expert explains how it can backfire.   It seems that men and women favor different shades of red. Men are partial to yellow-based reds, which are more orangey, according to the program. Women tend to be attracted to sharper reds with a blue base.   So when a woman puts on her sexiest red dress, she is often, unknowingly, attracting her own sex, not men. And this may explain much of what's wrong in the world.

The crossover styles are not strictly lingerie","excerpt":"prices range from $175 for a chiffon halter to $1,800 for a sequined slip dress. According to Mrs. Natori, a former Wall Street investment banker, the bottom line is women aren't afraid to show their bodies.   \\"After all these years, women are saying, 'Why can't I be sexy in the street, not just in the boudoir?' \\" Mrs. Natori said. \\"It's like reverse liberation. Before, women were hiding their bras. Now, they're showing them.\\" Reviews of the Reviews    Designers read their reviews, all right. While not as financially dependent on good notices as, say, a playwright, clothing designers can be just as sensitive. This week a number of designers got over their recent reviews enough to talk about them.   Christian Francis Roth, a 21-year-old designer who held his second show this season: \\"People really wanted blood from me this season. It was really in the air. They've done it to every young designer I can think of. The out-of-town press misunderstood the clothes.\\" His reviews were generally good.   Marc Jacobs, the designer for Perry Ellis: \\"There's a difference between criticism and nastiness. I always get disappointed if it's negative, but I can take it if it's constructive. Of course, a good review is never good enough.\\"   Gordon Henderson, whose reviews have gone up and down and up again: \\"I try not to be affected and stay grounded as much as possible. Last fall I was ripped to shreds. . . . But if you don't keep yourself level when you're good, it's hard to get through a bad season.\\"   Said Bill Blass , who has read a few: \\"A bad review can throw you down into the depths from the 90th floor. There are no insensitive people who are also creative.\\" PATTERNS"},{"year":"1976","title":"Article on Patek Philippe chiming pocket watches on sale at Tiffany's","excerpt":"prices range from $25,000 to $130,000; illus (M) For Whom the Chimes Toll $48,000"},{"year":"2003","title":"Diego Della Valle is resurrecting brand of Roger Vivier, pacesetting French shoe designer, with luxury shoe collection designed by Bruno Frisoni","excerpt":"prices range from $400 to $15,000; photos (S) Retail Resurrection, Of a Shoe Legend"},{"year":"1991","title":"Debt  * Delaware State Housing Authority is offering $40.4 million in tax-exempt senior home mortgage revenue bonds with a maximum yield of 7.80 percent for a bond due in 2020 through Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.

That may be one reason the music took so many forms (jazz, blues, gospel), and why the offshoot of each form had its own name (rhythm-and-blues, doo-wop, soul), and its own musical, and social, twist. But none of these forms had lived an entirely segregated life: to one degree or another they had all taken what they wanted or needed from white music. With its youthful postwar brashness, aimed at teen-agers, rock-and-roll sped up this process.   The black pioneers of rock-and-roll were not giving America unfettered race testimony or self-expression. They were giving America calculated entertainment in bright racial Technicolor.

The quotation is from my testimony before the House Administration Subcommttee on Elections, in which I advocated creation of six scheduled primaries as an alternative to regional primaries. Under my plan, all state primaries and caucuses would be held on six selected dates between March and June.
