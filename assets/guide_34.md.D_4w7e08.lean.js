I.,\\" all about a tough, dedicated and extremely loud Marine drill instructor on Parris Island. The picture has Mr. Webb every minute of the way, his fans will be delighted to know. And as the most earsplitting entertainment at the Paramount since that historical rock 'n' roll stage revue, it also has volume. Some spectators will cringe. Nobody will nap.As penned by James Lee Barrett for Mr. Webb's enterprising Mark VII unit, this Warners release bears no relation to the controversial \\"death march\\" of recent headlines. Against a colorfully detailed background of mercilessly thorough regimentation, the slender plot shows how an apparently soulless top-kick scaldingly molds a confused recruit into a crack Marine. As final proof that the sergeant's bark is worse than his bite, our hero (the sarge) also seals a sideline romance with a nice shop girl.The handful of basic relationships examined here are certainly familiar, even with such telling lines as \\"there must be a man underneath that baby powder.\\" Nevertheless, Mr. Webb has staged a pounding, graphic tribute to the Marine training method, from sun-up to sundown, from the barracks into the field. The tempo and drive of these scenes, some of which may chill civilian blood, is further enhanced by excellent photography (Edward Colman) and a lashing, if rather conventional, musical score (David Buttolph).Furthermore, as was the case in Mr. Webb's two previous features, the supporting players are dandy, when given a chance. In addition to authentic bits by a whole slew of actual Marines, notably Cpl. John R. Brown, there are Don Dubbins, as the problem youngster","excerpt":"Jackie Loughery, as the attractive sympathizer of the sergeant; Lin McCarthy, as his commanding officer, and Virginia Gregg, as a visiting mother.However, with the stage thus set for an interesting off-beat drama, the star takes over and confines it to a rather one-dimensional close-up of a fairly monotonous fellow. As the sergeant, Mr. Webb struts around, squinting blandly, growling and, most of the time, bellowing at the top of his lungs. One viewer, risking the wrath of the actor's fans, still wishes Mr. Webb had never ventured beyond his strictly secondary excellence as the paraplegic in \\"The Men\\" or as Bill Holden's pal in \\"Sunset Boulevard.\\"The Marines landed yesterday at the Paramount.

In \\"Information Wars,\\" the most provocative cut on Jackson Browne's new album, \\"Looking East\\" (Elektra), Mr. Browne, a 47-year-old Los Angeles singer and songwriter, mounts an attack on America's television culture  that includes an ingenious collage of variations on familiar advertising slogans. Reiterated without their brand names, the slogans are turned against themselves in a way that reveals the Orwellian seductiveness of television.         The pitches, which range from \\"your true voice\\" to \\"you're in good hands,\\" are compacted into little blocks of unctuous banality that fit snugly inside one of Mr. Browne's high-minded pronouncements. The most obnoxious quote is an aural clone of a long-running Chevrolet commercial in which a Kenny Rogers-like voice  declaims the phrase \\"the heartbeat of America.\\"    RECORDINGS VIEW","excerpt":"Jackson Browne vs. Madison Avenue"},{"year":"1996","title":"Even comfortable people need consolation sometimes, and Jackson Browne has been there to provide it for more than two decades. In his songs from the 1970's, he grappled with fading idealism and found heroism in holding down a day job, poeticizing \\"the struggle for the legal tender.\\" More recent songs reveal misgivings about the state of the world: about poverty and desperation, violence and greed. But sincere good intentions, a lover's smile and cozy folk-rock guitars are there to ease both disillusionment and the pangs of conscience.         At the Beacon Theater on Tuesday night, Mr. Browne played songs from his current album, \\"Looking East\\" (Elektra), and from his 1970's heyday. Every song  recorded before the 1980's brought part of the audience to its feet and drew shouted requests for more oldies. Mr. Browne's music cushions his grainy voice in basic three-chord settings, and it has evolved only slightly through the years.

His strength among those voters cut sharply into what had been Senator Gary Hart's base of support in previous primaries.     Before the vote, Mr. Mondale had looked to blacks to lift him to victory in the first of the big, Northern state primaries just as they had in the Georgia and Alabama primaries a week ago. Last week, Senator Hart had prevailed among white voters, and Mr. Mondale gained his margin of victory by getting 47 percent of the black vote in Alabama and 30 percent in Georgia.   But in Illinois the picture shifted. The Times/CBS News Poll showed that Mr. Jackson, riding his prominence as an influential home-town figure and drawing on the backing of Mayor Harold Washington, who is black, carried an overwhelming 79 percent of the black vote.

McDowell is a 20-game winner for the second successive season, Fernandez blossomed into an 18-game winner and the youngest pair, Alvarez and Bere, have been hotter than the other two in the past seven weeks, winning 14 and losing none of their last 15 starts combined.   All four are power pitchers, with Bere, a 22-year-old rookie, registering the best strikeout ratio. Bere was a 36th- round draft pick in 1990, and was not a starter in his first minor league season. He has developed rapidly, compiling a 2.19 e.r.a. since the all-star break.   The development of Bere and Alvarez have relegated Tim Belcher and Kirk McCaskill, two veteran starters, to relief roles.   Roberto Hernandez has been an effective closing relief pitcher, gaining 38 saves in 43 chances. In the field As much as they like to run, the Blue Jays have to be wary of Ron Karkovice, who has thrown out 48 of 96 would-be basestealers.   \\"You can never steal on Karkovice,\\" Sparky Anderson, the Detroit manager, said. \\"The only chance you have is if a pitcher allows you a chance and the White Sox usually don't allow you a chance. McDowell is the only one you can take a chance on. Karkovice is the best receiver in either league.\\"   The catcher is the first cog in the smooth defense the White Sox boast up the middle. Shortstop Ozzie Guillen and second baseman Joey Cora form a good double-play combination and provide good coverage in the middle of the infield. Lance Johnson covers a lot of ground in center field.   Robin Ventura is one of the best defensive third basemen in the league. Frank Thomas, the regular first baseman, very likely will be the d.h. His replacement, Dan Pasqua is better defensively. At the plate The series could come down to one simple development: Will Frank Thomas have a healthy left arm to swing at Toronto pitches, or will he continue to have the problem that plagued him in his final couple of weeks? Thomas injured his left triceps trying to catch a foul ball Sept. 19 and slumped badly afterward. Sitting out five games before playing Sunday, the big first baseman hit no home runs in his last 15 games and drove in two runs in his last 11.   If he is healthy and hitting like the player who batted .316, socked 41 home runs and knocked in 128 runs, the Blue Jays won't let him hit. That is, they most likely will pitch around him.   \\"For me, I wouldn't let Frank Thomas get close to a fastball,\\" said the general manager of an American League team not in the playoff. \\"Walk him. The Blue Jays' pitchers have to pitch around him. You can't let Thomas beat you.\\"   If the Blue Jays employ that strategy, Robin Ventura (22 home runs, 93 r.b.i.) becomes the key run producer. If Thomas is the d.h. George Bell or Bo Jackson won't be. But neither has hit against Toronto this season (Bell .065, Jackson .048, so that may not be much of a loss). Tim Raines, the leadoff batter, and Lance Johnson are .300 hitters. Off the bench Manager Gene Lamont probably will use his bench more than the Blue Jays, but probably not much more. He has spelled Tim Raines in left with Bo Jackson, and he has started Dan Pasqua in right for Ellis Burks. Craig Grebeck also gets an occasional infield start.   George Bell, if he is not the designated hitter","excerpt":"Jackson, Pasqua, Warren Newson and Ivan Calderon could hit for someone if the situation calls for it. Steve Sax is the invisible man. Blue Jays: On the mound The pitcher who should have been the Blue Jays' best this season pitched in New York instead. They let Jimmy Key leave as a free agent, and their starting rotation suffered.   Dave Stewart, a veteran of 14 post-season starts with Oakland, has received the assignment of leading the staff, not just because of his experience but because of his recent run of effective pitching. After struggling to an 8-8 record, he reeled off four consecutive victories.   Juan Guzman (14-3) hasn't lost since July 20. He has won 7 of his 13 starts since, and the Blue Jays have won three others. Pat Hentgen, in his first year in the starting rotation, was the team's No. 1 winner with a 19-9 record but, like the other starters, had a high earned run average, 3.87. Guzman finished at 3.99, Stewart at 4.44 and Todd Stottlemyre (the staff enigma with an 11-12 record) at 4.84.   Jack Morris can't pitch because of a torn elbow ligament, but he couldn't have helped, based on his 7-12, 6.19 e.r.a.   Duane Ward, with 45 saves, has done as well as Tom Henke, his predecessor, ever did as the closer, but no one stepped in to take Ward's spot as as the setup reliever to the closer. In the field Pat Borders is no Ron Karkovice--he's borderline, a general manager said, jokingly or otherwise--but the Blue Jays' pitchers do a better job than most holding runners on. The rest of the defense doesn't have to apologize to anyone.   Roberto Alomar is as good a second baseman as there is, and Devon White has the same standing among center fielders Rickey Henderson, snatch catch and all, catches everything on the left field side of center that White doesn't get. In other words, the Blue Jays are well covered on grass (Comiskey Park) and on artificial turf (SkyDome).   Tony Fernandez, who revived after the Mets traded him back to Toronto, doesn't have the range at shortstop he did in his first seven years with the Blue Jays, but he gets around well enough. Ed Sprague, in his first year as the third baseman, can be vulnerable, having committed 17 errors this season. At the plate To beat the Blue Jays, Sparky Anderson says, the White Sox must stop Rickey Henderson and Paul Molitor. \\"They don't have to stop the other guys,\\" Anderson said. \\"If Henderson and Molitor have good series, they're going to make monsters out of the others. You have to contain them, and I haven't seen anyone contain Molitor all season.\\"   Molitor, who replaced Dave Winfield, he of the World Series-winning hit, outdid Winfield during the season, batting .332, hitting 22 home runs and driving in 111 runs. During one late-season month, Aug. 15 to Sept. 15, the designated hitter batted .405 and knocked in 27 runs in 28 games.   Henderson, on the other hand, batted only .216 after joining Toronto, highly uncharacteristic for a player who always has played extremely well upon going to a new team. \\"This is national attention for him,\\" Anderson said. \\"I'm scared of guys who respond to national attention and he does.\\"   The \\"other guys\\" Anderson refered to include Roberto Alomar (.323), Joe Carter (33 homers, 120 r.b.i.) and John Olerud, whose .402 average of July 31 dropped to .363 because he batted only .290 since then. Not to be overlooked are Devon White (.272), Tony Fernandez (.304) and Ed Sprague (73 r.b.i.). Off the bench With the lineup he has, Manager Cito Gaston doesn't have much need for a bench. Who would he hit for? That's why the Blue Jays don't need the kind of pinch-hitters they used to have, people like Pat Tabler and Rance Mulliniks.   Turner Ward was the team's busiest pinch-hitter during the season, and he batted six times. No one had more than one hit as a pinch-hittter. Nor does Gaston have any need to substitute defensively. What the Blue Jays show at the start of a game is pretty much what they'll still be showing at the end.

One of America's leading exponents of twentieth-century music, Richard Dufallo died June 16, 2000, of cancer. During his career, he conducted more than 80 major orchestras and festivals in the U.S., Canada, and twelve European countries and premiered a host of major works by acclaimed American and European composers. Former assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic, Maestro Dufallo worked closely with Leonard Bernstein from 1965 to 1975. During this time, he made his opera debut with the New York City Opera and succeeded Darius Milhaud as artistic director of the Conference on Contemporary Music at the Aspen Festival in Colorado. American symphony orchestras that performed under his baton include the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, and Buffalo Philharmonic, with which he enjoyed a three-year association as assistant conductor. Maestro Dufallo conducted more than 25 world premieres, including Stockhausen's ''Carre'' in London, The Hague and Paris","excerpt":"Jacob Druckman's ''Lamia'' with the Berlin Philharmonic, and Sir Peter Maxwell Davis' opera ''The Lighthouse'' at the Edinburgh Festival. Other European performances include Robert Beaser's ''Piano Concerto'' with the Philharmonique de Monte Carlo with his wife, Steinway Artist Pamela Mia Paul, the Rome premiere of Elliott Carter's ''A Mirror on Which to Dwell,'' the world premiere of ''Trance Formations'' by Robert Zuidam at Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, and the Polish premiere of Bruce MacCombie's ''Chelsea Tango.'' Named permanent guest conductor of the Gelders Orchestra in Holland, Maestro Dufallo made his European debut in 1970 in Paris with the Orchestra Telephonique Francais. Other major European orchestras that have performed undehis baton include the Concertgebouw Orchestra, Rotterdam Philharmonic, Berlin Philharmonic, London Symphony and Royal Philharmonic. Equally at home with Mozart and Mahler, Dufallo's programming frequently included works by Bernstein, Aaron Copland, George Gershwin, Charles Ives, and Igor Stravinsky. In February 2000, Maestro Dufallo conducted the Dutch Radio Symphony as part of a 26-hr. series, ''Of Beauty and Consolation,'' which was taped by VPRO Dutch television and broadcast in Europe in April. The two-and-one-half-hour performance (with no intermission) included original text (by the conductor), which he spoke between each piece. Other recent appearances include tours with the Netherlands Wind Ensemble, a tour of Holland and Belgium with the Dutch Radio Philharmonic, the world premiere of ''The Food of Love'' by Peter Schat with the Noord Nederlands Orkest, and debuts with the Orkest van het Oosten (1997-98), and Israel Sinfonietta and Limburg Symphony Orchestra (1998-99). His internationally acclaimed publication, ''Trackings: Composers Speak with Richard Dufallo'' (Oxford University Press), includes conversations with twenty-six of the world's leading composers. Maestro Dufallo has been recorded on Sony, Composer's Voice, CRI American Masters, Fontec Records, Channel Crossings, and Globe. A native of Whiting, Indiana, Maestro Dufallo was born Jan. 30, 1933. He is survived by his wife, pianist Pamela Mia Paul, sons Basil Dufallo, a classics scholar, of Seattle, and Cornelius Dufallo, a violinist in the Flux Quartet, of New York; daughter Rene Kirby of Los Angeles, and a sister, Kathryn Traczyk of East Chicago, Indiana.

(\\"Enter Giovanni with a heart upon his dagger,\\" reads the Grand Guignol stage direction.) A pair of young lead actors better known for their Hollywood roles in lubricious movies like \\"The Doors\\" and \\"Basic Instinct\\" than for their experience in speaking verse. A severely intellectual director whose previous encounters with another 17th-century author, Shakespeare, have been her least successful projects.

By Blair T. Bumelin. (Schocken $17.95.) The author of this promising first novel plunges us right into the middle of serveral suburban school intrigues. Lee Jacobi, a married principal, is involved with a young, pot-smoking first-grade teacher","excerpt":"Jacobi is also desperately envious of Donald Kone, the new school superintendent, who has been appointed over him and has quickly earned the enmity of most of the staff. Oddly, Blair T. Birmelin chooses to locate her first novel's center with neither principal nor young teacher but with the superintendent, a bland, conscientious and pathetic 51-year-old character who seems increasingly frayed as the novel develops. Kone's father was Jewish, but that's about all Kone has in common with Jacobi, who is callous, virile, jocular, a schemer; in comparison, Kone seems more like one of the inept Cone-heads of ''Saturday Night Live.'' After a while, as though momentarily loosed from his habitual caution, Kone finds himself in more and more trouble with his colleagues. Finally he takes a way out that seems as probable as sex beyond the grave. Miss Birmelin's writing seems much better than her ideas. Her prose - terse, pithy, vivid, in the limited third person - seems to touch and see the characters until it is betrayed by a plot studded with intrigue and catastrophe. I submit that anybody who can show us a woman with the ''hard sugared look of an inedible confection'' can do a heck of a lot better than trivialize a suburban scandal with febrile ruminations and erotically motivated suicides.

Saint Margaret Mercy Healthcare Centers recently honored Mr. Gaffigan for his outstanding support of the Healing Ministry of the Sisters of St. Francis. Mr. Gaffigan gave of his time and resources to support organizations including Hospice of the Calumet Area, Northwest Indiana Forum as well as Purdue University Calumet Chancellors Advisory Council. As past Chairman of all of these organizations, his commitment was evident in the progress made in their respective missions. In addition, in 1989 he received the Shamrock Award from the Friendly Sons of Erin for his commitment to family and faith. Mr. Gaffigan's professional career began in 1957 at Chase Manhattan Bank where he rose to Assistant Treasurer. He returned to the Midwest in 1965 to assume a position with Central National Bank of Chicago (now La Salle National Bank) and was eventually promoted to Executive Vice President. In 1976 he was appointed President and then Chief Executive Officer of Mercantile National Bank of Indiana. Under his management, Mercantile always earned more than 1% on assets and was subsequently honored by Money Magazine as one of the 100 safest banks in the United States (one of only two Indiana banks so honored). As a banker, Mr. Gaffigan was a master at balancing criticism and encouragement. ''Mike was always fair in the way he treated us and I think that is what made him the respected President he was. He really did care about the employees as much as he did the bank's clients,'' said Jeanne Cleaveringa, a former Mercantile employee.

Jade Palace, the county's newest Chinese restaurant, proves that statement. \\n\\nAlmost every dish we sampled was excellent, but since the restaurant was barely half full, we have withheld a higher rating until present standards can be maintained with a full house. \\n\\nForget grease and heavy sauces. Cantonese cooking is light and operates on the principle that the character of the ingredients should not be altered and each element should enhance every other one. Thus simple cooking methods are employed.\\n\\nBecause pure flavors are highly valued, freshness and variety are essential. And both are available in the abundance of fish and shellfish, tea, rice, peanuts, meats, poultry, vegetables and fruits resulting from the district's semitropical climate, fertile valleys and proximity to the South China Sea. \\n\\nThe menu is deceptively simple. The high quality of ingredients and their skillful preparation make dishes unusually delicious. Posted on the wall, a small menu of daily specials is written in Chinese, a practice common in Chinese restaurants. Owners want to please all their customers and fear that non-Chinese diners might dislike any unusual or unfamiliar tastes and take their patronage elsewhere. Those interested in a bit of experimentation or in simply what's up for the day should ask David Ng, the affable owner, for suggestions. \\n\\nSoups here are impressive, and just right for chilling winter days. The two we tried were superb: tender morsels of beef with parsley and egg white in one case and chunky dried scallops, squid and shrimp with shreds of yellow leek. Bring a friend, as these interesting soups are made for two.\\n\\nNor was seafood disappointing. With its fine texture and delicate flavor, steamed grass carp proved the ultimate in carp. When it's available, steamed flounder should also be considered. Tender squid starred in two delectable dishes: with fresh, homemade pickled mustard greens (light years from the often chokingly sour canned variety) and with a skim of breading in salt-and-pepper squid.\\n\\nPerfectly sauteed lobster (in the shell) with ginger and scallions was a fine version of a widely available dish, and succulent shrimps with hearts of cabbage were just as carefully handled. As good as Manhattan Chinatown's best, conch with anchovy sauce was paired with bean curd stuffed with minced shrimp. \\n\\nExceptionally light E-fu noodles, a Cantonese specialty, are often served at the end of a banquet. They made a satisfying addition to humbler meals. These delicious noodles are first fried, then dried and finally boiled and tossed with a vegetable or two, ours being sliced black mushrooms and safflower stalks.\\n\\nBeef-lovers will enjoy marinated short ribs, a tad peppery and succulent to the bone, and juicy cuts of beef with broccoli and loads of fragrant fresh ginger. Melt-in-your-mouth baby bok choy was also a treat. \\n\\nFor dessert there's ice cream and soothing, sweet tapioca and peanut soup. An a la carte dinner averages $14 without drinks, tax and tip.

Never solidly here, never truly stable, safe or sure, forever thrashing the air (like the image in the Talmud: ''Man's shadow is not that of a tree swaying but that of a bird aflutter''), Mr. Halter's characters often have itineraries rather than lives. Here is a genealogy of flights from persecution without, from demons within","excerpt":"jagged trajectories that start with the sack of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, zigzag in ancient Carthage, travel through medieval Andalusia, cross Bourbon France, to end, after many a wheeling and looping, in the all-too-modern Warsaw ghetto, raked by the machine guns of the SS.

A1    A marine who appears to shoot and kill an unarmed and wounded Iraqi prisoner in an NBC video was not aware that the incident was being recorded, and moments later approached the cameraman with seemingly remorseful words, according to the first public description of the events by the cameraman, Kevin Sites.   A12    Iraqi electoral officials scheduled national elections for Jan. 30, but voter registration is badly hampered because of violence. About 90 of more than 540 registration centers have been shut down because of violence or threats of it.   A13    Iran Pledges to Meet Deadline  Iran pledged to meet its deadline and suspend its uranium enrichment activities today.

Powell arrived in Israel and said he would work with Palestinian leaders to come up with an American financial aid package to facilitate elections and improve their security forces.

A6    Guerrilla Suggested for Office  A former ethnic Albanian guerrilla commander widely believed to be under investigation for war crimes is being put forward to become prime minister of Kosovo, a prospect that is causing alarm among international officials there.   A10    55 Die in Chinese Crash  A China Eastern Airlines commuter plane crashed, killing all 53 people on board and 2 on the ground. The initial reports suggested that the plane broke into flames and began falling apart after takeoff. There was no immediate indication whether the crash was caused by a major malfunction, a terrorist attack or some other problem onboard.   A15    Chinese Party Leader Resigns  The leader of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong, Yeung Sum, announced that he would step down next month, taking responsibility for the party's worse than expected showing in legislative elections in September. Mr. Yeung will remain a member of Hong Kong's 60-member Legislative Council.   A14    Chile Downsizes Bush Dinner  President Bush's visit to Chile ended on a bizarre note when the Chilean government disinvited more than 200 guests to a dinner with the president rather than let the Secret Service screen them for weapons.   A8    NATIONAL   A16-24    Bush Will Seek to Revive Blocked Intelligence Bill  President Bush vowed to work with Congress to revive a bill to enact major recommendations of the Sept. 11 commission, as Republicans struggled to explain why House Republicans blocked the bill's passage despite the president's lobbying.   A1    Rest Easy, TV Sinners  The election will have little impact on which shows they put on television, representatives of the four big broadcast networks as well as Hollywood production studios said in a series of interviews.   A1    A Religious Perspective in Law  At the Liberty School of Law in Lynchburg, Va., a class in civil procedure began with a prayer. Some schools are bringing a religious perspective to the law and a moral component to legal practice.   A16    Deferral Strategy Fails Amtrak  Amtrak's strategy of scraping by on limited budgets by deferring capital investments is not working, according to the inspector general of the Transportation Department, recommending that Congress either give the railroad more money or tell it to cut back operations.   A16    Outcry Over Tax Provision  Some Republicans denied any ill motives even as senators from both parties expressed outrage over a clause in a spending bill to allow some Congressional officials to examine income tax returns.   A22    Enforcing Civil Rights Law  Federal enforcement of civil rights laws has dropped sharply since 1999, as the level of complaints received by the Justice Department has been constant, according a new study.   A17    5 Dead in Deer Hunting Dispute  A dispute among deer hunters over a tree stand in northwestern Wisconsin erupted in a shooting that left five people dead and three injured, officials said.   A20    Hotel Workers to Return  A group representing 14 luxury hotels in San Francisco has agreed to end an eight-week lockout, allowing about 4,000 maids, bellhops, and cooks to return to their jobs.   A17    Judge Denies G.O.P. in Recount  An effort by the Republican Party to force Washington State's most populous county to stop counting some ballots in the recount of the governor's race was denied by a federal judge.   A20    EDUCATION    Power Shifts to Schools  State and school officials now have more power to shape the terms for providing services to disabled children. In updating the law governing special education, Congress pared down rights that advocates for disabled students won during the Clinton administration.   A22    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-8    New York Port Bustling With Asian Trade  The Port of New York, which fell into a slump in the second half of the 20th century, is beginning to thrive again because of an explosion of trade with China. Trade through the port has grown faster in the last five years than at any time since World War II. Last year, $100 billion of wares moved through the port.   A1    A Conflict Heads West  Hundreds of demonstrators from across the globe are flooding the streets of New York to press their case that the Chinese government is persecuting the practitioners of Falun Gong, a form of spiritual calisthenics and meditation. Supporters say 1,100 have died and thousands more tortured and imprisoned for their beliefs, chiefly in China, but increasingly in other countries.

However, while I am grateful for the attention Caleb Crain gave to my book ''White Savage: William Johnson and the Invention of America''(Oct. 16), he levels a charge that cannot be allowed to stand without comment.      ''White Savage'' is based to an overwhelming extent on primary sources, as Crain could see from my annotation but did not mention in his review. Like every historical work, however, it also draws on the published work of others. In his review, Crain cites three ''expository sentences'' from my book which, he rightly shows, are drawn from other sources: Fred Anderson's ''Crucible of War''","excerpt":"James Axtell's ''Natives and Newcomers''; and Richard White's ''Middle Ground.'' He acknowledges that these sentences simply concern undisputed facts but he strongly implies that their sources were unacknowledged and that in these instances I essentially misled readers by passing off the work of other writers as my own.      The implication that I have concealed my indebtedness to these superb books is almost as absurd as it is unjust. I cite these three works 35 times in my source notes; the relevant book is cited at least once in the notes for the chapter in which each of the sentences Crain quotes appears, pointing the reader to passages in Anderson, Axtell and White that are close to the sentences he is concerned with. If I were indeed attempting to use the material from these fine works as my own, the charge of extreme stupidity ought to be added to that of dishonesty. The ease with which Crain himself could locate the sources is itself proof of the transparency of my effort to point the reader to the texts on which I have drawn.     Crain might have argued that I should have annotated every sentence I wrote, but he might at least acknowledge that the 27 pages of source notes in ''White Savage'' give the reader ample guidance to my sources, including the three fine works he mentions. Perhaps he would have been happier if I had offered a numbered source note for each sentence in the book -- a procedure that is commonplace in academic monographs and law review articles, but hardly ever recommended in the composition of books for the general reader.      Crain's charges seem to arise from a fundamental misunderstanding about the annotation of a nonacademic book, in which a balance has to be struck between readability on the one side and the ability of other scholars to check sources on the other. The normal compromise for readable historical research is that one cites all the sources in such a way as to make it easy for anyone else to know where the information came from and to check the accuracy of its use. That I have done this is obvious. But I am not sure that even the most scrupulous of academic scholars can in fact annotate every single statement of fact he or she draws from the work of those who have gone before. For example, in the case of the statement I took from ''Crucible of War,'' Fred Anderson himself did not provide a simple source for it; his note states merely that his account of the conference to which it refers is ''drawn from the versions'' in other books by Theodore Thayer, Stephen F. Auth, Francis Jennings, Nicholas B. Wainwright and Anthony F. C. Wallace. The facts I drew from Axtell were not directly annotated at all in his book.     The oddest implication of Crain's complaint is that writers who draw facts from the work of others should re-arrange them the better to disguise their origins. Had I done so, of course, his charge could not have been leveled. Since it was leveled, and since The New York Times chose, however reluctantly, to print it, I assume that the same test will now be applied in your pages to every work of history. The implications for scholars will not be pleasant.    Fintan O'Toole      Dublin    Caleb Crain replies:     I agree that in a book for a general audience, it would be tedious to footnote the facts sentence by sentence. I was concerned with wording, however. In my review I quoted three sentences by O'Toole that closely matched the language of sentences by Anderson, Axtell and White. Of course I don't advise O'Toole to conceal the provenance of his facts by rearrangement. I don't even see how rearranging facts would achieve this. For that matter, I do not require him to rearrange the words of other writers, either. If he wants to make use of their sentence-making ability, he need only place their words inside quotation marks.
