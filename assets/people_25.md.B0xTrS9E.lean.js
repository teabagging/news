In Mr. Schultze's conception, the term covers a diverse set of Government policies ''designed to produce an industrial structure different from what the market would have produced.''     He finds two broad but not mutually exclusive types of such policies. The first is ''protecting the losers,'' that is, supporting major declining industries by such means as trade barriers, subsidies, favorable regulatory treatment, tax breaks and subsidized loans. The second is ''picking the winners,'' or providing various forms of Government help to specific companies and industries that are the fast growers and big employers, exporters or technological pioneers of the future.

De Zayas, who was born in Veracruz, Mexico, in 1880 and died in Greenwich, Conn., in 1961, was once a prodigious and versatile figure on the American art scene - an artist, a writer, an editor, a cartoonist and caricaturist, a film maker, an art dealer and public-relations agent, and even in one period of his life (in the early 1930's, when he occupied a chateau in the French countryside outside Grenoble), a chicken farmer. Was it Cyril Connolly who said that every young writer had to satisfy three illusions - falling in love, starting a magazine and having a chicken farm? Well, de Zayas seems to have managed all of this and a lot more in a very crowded life.   Yet in recent decades he has mainly been remembered, if at all, as a colorful appendage to the Alfred Stieglitz circle. He certainly played an important role in Stieglitz's campaign to bring the avantgarde to New York. In 1909, Stieglitz organized an exhibition of de Zayas's caricatures at the Photo-Secession Gallery, and two years later de Zayas was established as one of Stieglitz's principal guides and consultants to the modern-art scene in Paris.

What is new and arresting in ''Ike'' is the author's moral penetration and his concentration on gathering evidence to show Eisenhower's chronic vacillation and remarkably opaque moral standards. Piers Brendon, a British biographer of Winston Churchill, among others, writes from a center-left perspective and gives some evidence of how inherently difficult it is for a foreigner to master the arcane ramifications and intransigencies of American politics.

It deals at one remove with deeds as well as words - the press may not make policy, but in a free society it certainly makes things easier or harder for those who do.   In the first half of the book Professor Lipstadt, who teaches at the University of California at Los Angeles, describes the darkening course of events from 1933 to 1939. The main landmarks are grimly familiar ones - the Nuremberg Laws, Kristallnacht, the Anschluss - but her account of what newsmen made of them at the time contains a good deal of rewarding new material.

The music itself, inadvertently but inevitably, kept recalling the outer world. This was an all-American program, which might have seemed patriotic. But the third piece, David Amram's \\"Three Songs for America,\\" achieved a rather different effect. Composed in 1969 by a partisan of peace and love and setting words by John F.
