It is an adaptation of a minor stage work, written by Ian Hay and Anthony Armstrong, and the wonder is that the producers, Gaumont-British, thought it worthy of such an excellent company of players. On the credit side of this piece of buffoonery and punning there are the interesting glimpses in a military barracks, splendid photography and sound recording and good-natured work by the cast.Now and again the film rises to being mildly amusing, but more often than not it is scarcely the sort of stuff to make one laugh on a warm Sunday afternoon. James Gleason and Charlotte Greenwood are the only Americans in the cast, and among the Britons are Cyril Maude, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Donald Calthrop.Mr. Maude is called upon to appear as an English colonel named Bellows, which appellation gives Miss Greenwood a chance to start off with a pun. She portrays Wanda, assistant to Ed Waggermeyer (Mr. Gleason), a film director. Mr. Waggermeyer is bent on making a motion picture inside the barracks and using His Majesty's troops as extras. The Colonel frowns upon this idea for a while, but eventually the lanky Wanda indulges in a billiard contest with him and apparently wins the right to make a picture. Bellows, being a vacillating person, decides to appear in one of the scenes himself and, of course, at the crucial moment, in stalks the brigadier general (acted by Sir Cedric Hardwicke), who cannot be blamed for being rather hot under the collar at the sight which presents itself before him.Even in its own boisterous way, \\"Orders Is Orders,\\" is more than slightly muddled and there are only a few lines that are amusing. It lacks originality and a flair for true farce. It might be better had it been limited to two reels. Mr. Gleason, as Waggermeyer, tries to use as many slang words as it is possible and the colonel becomes too utterly English, but they don't arouse much mirth. Waggermeyer is no shining example of a motion picture director and Colonel Bellows and the others are a lot of silly fools played by clever actors. That is, with one exception, the brigadier general, who conducts himself as though he had real blood running in his veins. And, of course, Sir Cedric is a clever actor.Mr. Maude tries hard to be comic, but seldom succeeds. Miss Greenwood makes the most of her long limbs to do some high kicking. Mr. Gleason is an actor in need of a story. Mr. Calthrop, as an individual referred to as Pavey, a victim of Waggermeyer, has little to do.

Perhaps he is afraid of Pat Robertson, who this month warned that terrorist bombs, earthquakes, tornadoes and ''possibly a meteor'' could strike Orlando, Fla., in biblical vengeance for ''Gay Days'' at Disney World.

Was born September 4, 1910 in Cleveland, Ohio to Otis Howard Adams and Hermine Weis Adams, and raised in Framingham, Massa chusetts. He passed away peacefully at his home in Austin, Texas on Sunday, April 25, 2004. Mr. Adams was a loving father to his only child Cornelia Adams Foster and father-in-law to Mark Edward Foster, and a loving grandfather to Lucy Piper Foster and Warren Adams Foster. Mr. Adams lived in New York City for most of his adult life prior to retiring in 1976 from CPC International Inc. (formerly Corn Products Co.) for which he served as chief general counsel. In 1986, he moved to Austin, Texas. At the age of 15, Mr. Adams entered Princeton University where his nickname was ''Babe.'' He was a star ice hockey player on a stellar team in Princeton history and, but for a broken collarbone suffered in a practice, would have played on a U.S. Olympic team. He also played on the football team at Princeton. After graduating in 1930, he went on to Harvard Law School, graduating in 1934. In 1935, he joined the New York bar and was in private practice in New York City until 1940. In 1941, he received a J.S.D. from New York University. With the onset of World War II, he went to Washington, D.C. to serve in the War Production Board and later enlisted in the Marine Corps. He fought in the Pacific between 1942 and 1946, and achieved the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Returning to New York in 1946, he went to work for Corn Products Co. For many years he served on the board of the Washington Square Fund and was a trustee of the Whitehall Foundation, Inc. He was also a member of the American Bar Association, The Pilgrims of the United States, The English Speaking Union, The Racquet and Tennis Club (NYC), the Metropolitan Opera Club of which he was a past president, the Princeton Club, Colonial (Princeton), Ekwanok Golf Club (Vermont), American Society of the Order of St. John (Knight), Royal and Ancient Golf Club (Scotland), Boodles (London), and the Union Club (NYC). He was a lifelong golfer and lover of opera. He survived four wives, including Eve Madsen Adams (medical illustrator and mother of Cornelia), Adele Thompson Adams, and Romaine Clinton Adams. (He was divorved from a first wife prior to World War II.) For most of his life he was a summer resident of a part of the New Hampshire coast called Little Boar's Head. In later years he was a summer resident of Manchester, Vermont, and, during his marriage to Romaine Adams, of Newport, Rhode Island. His family particularly wants to thank Ken Luebke and caregivers who became part of his life following a car accident in 2000","excerpt":"James Mendiola, Mike Arnold, Tigh Walters, and Alfredo Ruiz.

No one could not be affected by a Mel encounter. He was born and raised in New York City and had a deep loyalty and love for his town. He grew up in Washington Heights and the West Side of Manhattan, and had a reputation as one of its greatest hand ball players. He was a gifted athlete, and excelled in any sport that he played. Mel was the offspring of German and Russian Jews and always said that, that was a dynamite combination. He went to New York University, studied journalism and was on the boxing team. He thought his future would be in the family business, which was advertising, but it was not to be. Mel married his childhood sweetheart, Helen Koenig. It was now a time of war. Having received his orders the two of them moved from Army camp to Army camp until he received his overseas orders. Mel was a Warrant Officer in the 394th Field Artillery Battalion which landed in Normandy immediately after the first days of the Allied invasion and eventually participated in the liberation of two concentration camps in Germany. Mel created the pioneering James Roy Inc, the discount furniture showroom. Starring in his own television commercials for ten years made him a celebrity and he could not walk down the street without someone recognizing and greeting him. Mel and Helen had two children","excerpt":"James Roy, a producer, director, and actor, and Stephanie Gwen, owner of the New Age Health Spa in Neversink, New York.

He is also survived by his four great-grand children; Ben and Ella Mallinger and Gabe and Jack Melville Paty. Mel had a loving relationship with his sister Geraldine Hoffman who also survives him.

The mayhem, murder and downright colorful cussedness inspired by the seemingly indestructible struggle between cattlemen and homesteaders, is handled with consummate professionalism by such top hands as John Ford, director","excerpt":"James Stewart and John Wayne. But time has made their vehicle creaky. Their basically honest, rugged and mature saga has been sapped of a great deal of effect by an obvious, overlong and garrulous anticlimax.Mr. Ford, who has struck more gold in the West than any other film-maker, also has mined a rich vein here. He is again exposing the explosive forces involving the advent of law, in the shape of Mr. Stewart, on the raw denizens of a lawless frontier town. Our hapless hero is immediately ambushed by Liberty Valance, as brutal a dastard as ever shot up a sound stage, and a murderer in the hire of the cattle barons, who are opposed to statehood. But the majesty of the law sustains our transplanted Eastern lawyer, who is determined to bring justice to the town of Shinbone.Of course, a viewer wonders why the sadistic Valance had not been liquidated before Mr. Stewart's arrival, especially since John Wayne, the fastest gun in the territory, is there to do the trick. As related in one long flashback — Mr. Stewart, now a famed Governor and Senator of the state, who has returned to Shinbone for Mr. Wayne's funeral—there is \\"more than meets the eye in \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\\" Out of unexplained kindness, Mr. Wayne has given Mr. Stewart his protection even though he knows that Vera Miles, the local waitress and his girl, is losing her heart to Mr. Stewart. At any rate, the mystery of who actually did the shooting of the villain, a deed that eventually catapults Mr. Stewart into national eminence, is explained. But to a moderately alert observer, it is hardly an enigma since it is strongly stressed that Mr. Stewart couldn't hit the floor with his hat.Once that point has been made—and it is made in vividly tough and picturesque style—Mr. Ford's irony is lost and his drama bogs down. Mr. Stewart's ascent to national fame is neither inventive nor intriguing. But his vignettes of the brawling life of Shinbone on a Saturday night; the ravenous diners on giant, fried steaks; the tinny music and clatter of a saloon; the tinkling sounds of a cantina near the desert, and a raucous local election are the authentic sights and sounds of a pioneer community.Mr. Stewart makes an effectively fumbling but indomitable lawyer, who values honesty as much as justice. Mr. Wayne again proves, if it is necessary at this late date, that he can sit a horse well, shoot from the hip and throw a haymaker with the best of them. And, fortunately, he is more laconic than most. The same cannot be said for Edmond O'Brien, whose performance as the town drunk and newspaper owner-editor includes more words than The Congressional Record. It is both a broad and fairly chiché-ridden portrayal. \\"Lee Marvin, in the title role, is a villain, without nuance, to delight the abnormal psychology student. He beats, kicks and kills his victims with the fervor of a maniac.Miss Miles makes an engagingly rough-hewn heroine and John Carradine, in an oratorical bit; Jeannette Nolan and John Qualen, as the Swedish restaurant owners; Andy Devine, as a timorous marshal, and Woody Strode, as Mr. Wayne's unflinchingly loyay sidekick, add competent support to the principals.\\"When legend becomes fact,\\" a newspaper editor tells Mr. Stewart, \\"print the legend.\\" In \\"Liberty Valance,\\" there is too much of a good legend.

Melpomene is a thrice-wed minister with a roving eye and a hysterical streak. Her husband, James, an art historian, suffers from writer's block and his own extramarital yearnings. \\"The Gates of Paradise\\" -- Gwyneth Cravens's fifth novel -- records a day in their life. Melpomene dispenses glib counsel to parishioners and conspires to see Kuno, a former lover who hopes to renew the affair","excerpt":"James tables his dissertation to write to an old flame. Before the day is up, each discovers with a jolt the other's other. Ms. Cravens aims to treat candidly the unspoken desires that can estrange even high-minded spouses, to write a sort of highbrow soap opera. Too often, though, her prose dissolves candor on contact: James \\"had told \\n[\\nMelpomene\\n]\\n his dreams; she had penetrated his deepest crevices. But she must never know about Alice, the erotic fusion.\\" The dialogue, although spunky in places, is sometimes equally artificial. \\"So this is goodbye forever,\\" says Melpomene to Kuno; \\"I now see I'm nothing without you,\\" Kuno writes to Melpomene. Verisimilitude rallies as the supporting characters (the rock star Gabriel, for instance) enter, but ebbs each time Ms. Cravens -- seeking, one can only imagine, to flatter the sort of reader who displays busts of Beethoven and Mozart in the living room -- has her characters refer offhandedly to Plato, Bergson, Mallarme and Wittgenstein. The novel's other excesses include a much-foreshadowed suicide and a tirade by Melpomene against James that runs, in part: \\"You're old. You're fat. You're lazy. You're stupid. You're pathetic in bed. . . . You make me sick. . . . I hope you die!\\" The measure of the book's incredibility is that, after absorbing these rabbit punches, James -- the Neville Chamberlain of domestic disputes -- tries to redeem himself in Melpomene's eyes by whipping her up a bowl of homemade soup.

Steck's and William Graham's \\"Waterhole #3,\\" one keeps hoping these new, young filmmakers are going to catch up with and lay hold of a substantial theme. For there are enough little bursts of comical business and exchanges of surprising dialogue in this out-and-out farcical Western, which arrived yesterday at the Trans-Lux East and the Trans-Lux West, to encourage the hope for something solid and a little different, at least, in this difficult genre.Furthermore, the producer and director have James Coburn, escapee from the role of Our Man Flint, to play a rambling card sharp and moonlighting highwayman on the trail of a cache of stolen gold, which he does with his characteristic splaying of coolness and crafiness. And they have Carroll O'Connor, a new fatso on the order and proportions of Burl Ives, to do very well by a comical sheriff who is every bit as venal as this man he is out to catch.Spread around are such other apt performers of dead-panned farce as Margaret Blye as a girl who gets raped by Mr. Coburn and goes running after him—for more","excerpt":"James Whitmore as a numb-skull cavalry captain, Timothy Carey as a moronic thief and, yes, even dear old Joan Blondell as a fancy lady on the cut of Mae West.But, regrettably, the tangled twistings and turnings of the strictly hootenanny plot, the up-hill-and-down-dale chases, the constant mix-ups of advantages with guns, gets them nowhere but into further situations of manufactured farce. Finally, one comes to the conclusion Mr. Graham must have lost his script away out there in the Mojave Desert, where much of it was shot; and, with a company on his hands and no time for writing, just made it up as they went along.

While the audience sighs in rapture at the old-fashioned prospect of love triumphing over likelihood. \\n\\n     Likewise, of course, Jane Austen has little on the surface to recommend her.  A spinster lady from the English shires, a vicar's daughter who never left home  if she could help it, dead since 1817 -- no money, no title, no connections -- what can she have to offer? Just herself and six novels, which in the 1990's have suddenly become the feverish obsession of film makers. These days we mine the past for plot and characters, in much the same way as we drill ancient rock  for oil. And why not? There's good stuff to be found down there, and good profit if we strike lucky.

Her characters, who were so circumspect about their visits to each other, their hesitant confessions of feeling and their delicately nuanced courtships, are now being thrust into a brash contemporary culture that cares for circumspection not at all.         This Wednesday, a filmed version of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" will open in theaters, with a screenplay by its star, Emma Thompson, that has already been published as a book to rival Austen's own. The film, for all its lustrous intelligence, is being plugged on talk shows where issues of romance and marriage generally have little connection with the manners of English landed gentry in the early 19th century. It also comes close on the heels of other filmed incarnations of Austen's books: a limpid version of \\"Persuasion,\\" released this fall, and last summer's updating of \\"Emma\\" with ditzy Beverly Hills teen-agers in \\"Clueless.\\" More Austen adaptations are imminent.

The 17 paintings and 6 drawings encapsulate a period of intense experimentation for Jane Freilicher, which began when she started to spend several months a year on the East End of Long Island. Transfixed by vistas of land and sea, she turned away from painting still lifes and cityscapes and approached landscape through abstraction. Paintings like ''Small Harvest Moon,'' ''Copper Sky,'' ''Inlet'' and ''Winter Sun'' were executed in oil on raw linen or canvas, sometimes from memory. Their soft masses of white and bleached-out color drift before the eye, suggesting a joyfully unmoored world engulfed in hand-painted sun spots. They may take cues from Hans Hoffman, with whom Ms. Freilicher had studied, as well as Helen Frankenthaler's stain paintings and Willem De Kooning's swashbuckling odes to the East End.

But Bellows, who died in 1925 at the age of 42, produced more than 600 oil paintings, as well as lithographs, drawings and magazine illustrations, in his short career. THE PAINTINGS OF GEORGE BELLOWS (Abrams, $49.50) and GEORGE BELLOWS AND URBAN AMERICA (Yale University, $45) offer a valuable reconsideration of Bellows's life and art. A member of the Ashcan School, Bellows shared with such painters as Robert Henri and John Sloan a fascination with the hurly-burly life of the New York streets. But Bellows found equal inspiration in the rugged terrain of Monhegan Island, off the coast of Maine, where he produced dozens of striking seascapes. His portraits -- whether of street children or members of his family -- are painted with quick, fluid brushstrokes that give a sense of emotional immediacy and psychological insight. Bellows was concerned with trying to establish logical underpinnings for his art, and was forever trying out new systems of composition and color. The result was that he changed his style more or less markedly every two years or so. Of the two volumes, \\"The Paintings of George Bellows\\" -- written by Michael Quick, a curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art","excerpt":"Jane Myers, a curator at the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth; Franklin Kelly, a curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington; and Marianne Doezema, an official at the National Endowment for the Humanities -- offers the fuller examination of the artist's work, and includes 76 color plates as well.

Now they have put her in a swim suit, wearing a pair of mechanical gills and paddling around among the fishes in the sub-aqueous gloom of a sunken ship.This happens in \\"Underwater!,\\" which came to the Mayfair yesterday. The title conveys a description and an estimation of the contents in one word.Seldom has anything so trifling as this story of delving for treasure beneath the seas been dished up as feature entertainment—or even as a special vehicle. Much of its hour and forty minutes is given over to lazy, tedious talk about the likelihood of anything of value being in the old hulk that Richard Egan and Gilbert Roland have come upon, lying down there in the Caribbean on a shelf of a submarine reef.And while Mr. Egan and Mr. Roland are chattering, along with Robert Keith, who plays a priest-antiquarian with a knowledge of the Spanish Main, Miss Russell as the Cuban wife of Mr. Egan is plucking at his ears and generally trying to distract him from such a silly old interest as gold.Finally, they all go underwater—all except Mr. Keith, who stays topside with a lady supercargo, Lori Nelson, to keep an eye out for sharks. (The most annoying is JosephCalleia, a passing fisherman, who sniffs a treasure haul.) And, down in the blue-green water, they hit a few occupational snags and one minor emotional crisis before their simple salvage job is halfway done.Even the underwater action is on the lethargic side, with the actors merely swimming around in wreckage and giving out bubbles instead of words. This sort of pantomimic business soon becomes obvious and dull, especially since the sub-aqueous setting is mainly a hive of barnacles. Even Miss Russell, heavily laden in a tangle of skin-diver's gear, is no one to excite much interest, let alone raise the temperature.This presentation of Miss Russell is like one of those fountain pens that is guaranteed to write underwater. It is novel, but impractical. Miss Russell does nothing underwater that she hasn't done better above.

Physically, Miss Russell scores.Otherwise, despite fine character portrayals by Luther Adler, Joseph Calleia and the late Mikhail Rasumny, as a sort of gypsy elder statesman, \\"Hot Blood\\" is lukewarm stuff.As the aforementioned lady, Miss Russell, her father (Mr. Calleia) and brother are truly wanderers. Papa supports the brood by betrothing Miss Russell to an eligible gypsy, pocketing the marriage settlement and clearing out of town with his offspring just before the marriage becomes official.Things change when Marco Torino (Mr. Adler), a gypsy king, arranges a wedding for his younger brother, Stephan (Cornel Wilde). Stephan, who has ideas of life outside the gypsy world, wants no part of it. The lady lets Stephan in on the scheme and Stephan thinks it's a good way to play a $2,000 joke on brother Marco. At the last moment, then, the lady has changed her mind and winds up with a reluctant husband and an unemployed father.That's the way it goes until Stephan changes his mind. By then, the lady has changed her mind and packs up. But Marco averts a stalemate by telling Stephan: \\"Isn't it a custom among the gajos [those out-side the gypsy fold] for a man to run after a woman when the woman walks out?\\" Now, Marco, is it, really?

Walter Brennan and Berton Churchill take it pretty much in stride. Pauline Moore and Robert Wilcox, a pair of juvenile leads who need practice, get plenty trying to keep up with Little Jane.At the Teatro HispanoAdmirers of swash-buckling period pictures are sure to like \\"Nostradamus,\\" the current visitor on the screen of the Teatro Hispano. Played by what may well be called an all-star Mexican cast, headed by Carlos Villarias in the title role and with the lovely Consuelo Frank as the main incentive for the valiant deeds of J. J. Martinez Casado, this mostly apocryphal tale of the doings of the \\"wonder doctor\\" of the court of Catherine de Medici and Henry II of France in the sixteenth century has hardly a dull moment.Aurora Campuzano is effective as the Queen and Leopoldino Ortin combines comedy with sword-wielding without difficulty. Based on a popular novel by Michel Zévaco, produced by Salvador Bueno and directed by Juan Bustillo Oro, \\"Nostradamus\\" is well done technically. Furthermore, its outcome is rather different from the usual Mexican ending. A working knowledge of Spanish is necessary.At the Modern PlayhouseThe principal merit of \\"A Meltosagos Kisasszony\\" (The Superior Maiden), the Budapest importation with which the Modern Playhouse has opened the 1937-38 Hungarian film season in Yorkville, is an attractive artist in the person of Zita Szeleczky, already well known on the Magyar stage, but new to the screen. As the rather haughty rich girl, who falls in love with a handsome young physician (Lajos Basthy), disguised as the tutor of her little brother, Miss Szeleczky reveals the conflict between pride and affection in a convincing way and without \\"emoting\\" all over the place. The other members of the cast are familiar and capable actors.This picture is the fiftieth Magyar talking film turned out in Hungary and for that reason its director, Bela Balogh, and the producers have called it a jubilee piece. The technique is good, but there is hardly enough melody to justify the label \\"musical film.\\"At the 86th St. Garden TheatreA mildly entertaining mixture of joy and sadness, mostly expressed in Viennese dialect, is at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre under the name of \\"Das Fiakerlied\\" (The Cabbie's Song). The popular Paul Hoerbiger is the driver of a two-horse carriage in the supposedly romantic Austrian metropolis of 1910.In bringing his brief love affair with a rather pathetic little vaudeville actress (well played by Gusti Huber) to an end, E. W. Emo, who directed the picture for the Bavaria company, has avoided the routine finish and provided something of a surprise. Franz Schafheitlin is fine as the man-about-town whose amours are the cause of most of the trouble. The song of the \\"Fiaker\\" is done very well by Herr Hoerbiger and the incidental old-time music is pleasing.At the 86th Street CasinoAnother pre-Hitler German comedy of errors and jewel robbery is at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino Theatre, with the comely and capable Betty Amann and Lee Parry in the leading feminine roles. Otto Wallburg, Paul Hoerbiger, Theo Lingen and Hugo Fischer-Koeppe do most of the mixing-up of film actors, crooks and police officials which keeps the persons watching \\"Der Grosse Bluff\\" (The Big Bluff) wondering who the thief is until the final reel.Nini Theilade, the Danish-Javanese dancer, takes care of the terpsichorean part of the program. The settings are luxurious, the technique is good and the musical numbers are agreeable. All in all, Director Georg Jacoby did a good job for the T. K. Film Company.

What a sight the 52-year-old Grandpa of Grunge is, stomping around the stage in saggy shorts, baggy T-shirt and black socks, hitting on a riff and playing it over and over until it brings on a trance. And in between musical sequences, Jim Jarmusch finds a visual form that mirrors the spirit of the music.

And in coming up with the title character, played by Sharon Stone in a delectable comic performance, he gives that world exactly the kind of divinity it deserves. This muse is quite a piece of work, but she seems to get results, on the evidence of a couple of inspired cameos here. The joke of a premise winds down before it reaches a punch line. But Mr. Brooks again manages to be funny and bleak with equal ease. &#151","excerpt":"Janet Maslin The Price of Success"},{"year":"1999","title":"Sydney Pollack's characteristically solid, incisive direction has become a throwback to the days of subtler movie storytelling.

The plot becomes very thick indeed when it develops that the dead spouses were having an affair, and the survivors fall into a bittersweet relationship of their own. Harrison Ford is taciturnly forceful, Kristin Scott Scott Thomas a shade too familiar, as credulity-stretching complications ensue. &#151","excerpt":"Janet Maslin Together By a Twist Of Fate"},{"year":"1999","title":"With heavenly finesse Kevin Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a teenage cheerleader.

All the actors display coolly expert timing, especially Annette Bening as the antihero's grasping wife.
