Apparently the move didn't help prices, because the pivotal nearby March delivery closed Friday at 72.95 cents a pound, down $262.50 per contract on the week. A year ago, when the speculative cash margin was $1,000 a contract, copper sold for 85 cents a pound, rising to a 1981 peak of 96 cents last August.   Because futures speculators tend to favor the long (buy) side of most markets, copper analysts say their thinking is still dominated by the poor state of the housing and the auto industries, two of the leading consumers of copper, and by the continued weakness in silver and gold, which have traditionally influenced the metal.

In the new film which arrived yesterday at the Paramount, Mr. Hope is in there pitching against considerable odds, same being three script writers who were stingy with witty lines and humorous situations. With the irrepressible comedian crowding the screen most of the time \\"The Great Lover\\" is not without its moments of fun, but it soon becomes apparent that he has to work twice as hard to stir up the audience.Two of the brightest spots in the picture are sight gags. Jack Benny appears fleetingly as a shipboard acquaintance whom Hope asks to change a $100 bill and the way Jackson drools over it and is surveyed foot to head by the anxious Mr. Hope is charged with fun. Hope's preoccupation with threading a needle while Rhonda Fleming, heady with champagne, tries to seduce him is a broad bit of comic business which still has a lot of sparkle despite the familiarity of the device.Playing chaperon to a group of Boy Foresters returning from France, Hope gets into quite some mischief as he becomes entangled with an impoverished countess on the one hand and a card sharp and murderer on the other. Between being intimidated and abused by his teen-age charges (a Boy Forester in good standing neither smokes, drinks nor gives a second thought to girls), falling hopelessly under the influence of the countess and being tagged as a murderer the hapless open-faced youth from North Zanesville, Ohio, has a rugged trip.The writers of \\"The Great Lover\\" have enough comic props in their script, but they just don't make the best use of them and there is no apparent invention in the direction, either. Apparently they figured that Hope alone was enough, but the results prove that they were only half right. Miss Fleming is quite agreeable, but there is no continental flavor to her countess. The same pertains to Roland Culver as her grand duke parent. Roland Young is good as the card-sharp murderer, his occupation is no secret to the audience, and Richard Lyon is the kind of kid you love to hate as the Boy Forester leader who bullies Hope into seeing things his way. Sure there are some laughs in \\"The Great Lover,\\" but not enough, unfortunately, to make it a completely satisfying comedy.Claude Thornhill and orchestra","excerpt":"Red Buttons, the Acromaniacs and Sarah Vaughan headline the Paramount's stageshow.
