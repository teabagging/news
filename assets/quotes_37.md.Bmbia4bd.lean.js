(Vintage Contemporaries, $13.) In his first novel in 10 years, McGuane zeroes in again on characters responding with comically awful behavior to a hostile but also zany universe. This time his fecklessly nihilistic hero is out to cash in on his former father-in-law's infernal will by reuniting with his estranged ex-wife and managing the family business. With copious detours and one-liners, ''a lot of what happens in this novel is funny or deftly described, no matter how irrelevant or inconsequential,'' Paul Gray wrote in these pages in 2002.    A VISIT TO DON OTAVIO: A Traveller's Tale From Mexico, by Sybille Bedford. (Counterpoint, $16.) First published in 1953 in slightly different form as ''The Sudden View: A Mexican Journey,'' this unclassifiable book recounts Bedford's first visit to Mexico, merging an Englishwoman's intensely personal story with cleareyed description of a beautiful, squalid and unfamiliar culture. ''She extracts the very essence of rural and small-town Mexicans,'' Virginia Lee Warren said here in 1954. ''They absolutely live.''    THE HORNED MAN, by James Lasdun. (Norton, $13.95.) Steeped in gender paranoia and the psychology of self-policing, this thriller follows the unraveling of a member of a college sexual harassment committee who lives in terror that a single misstep might brand him a criminal. ''Spookily hilarious and dark as a rabbit warren,'' the book ''combines a narcotic literary ease with a knuckle-whitening tension,'' Emily Nussbaum wrote in these pages last year.    SHAKEY: Neil Young's Biography, by Jimmy McDonough. (Anchor, $16.95.) This portrait of the durable rock icon's complicated life and times tracks Young from his childhood in Canada (where he survived polio) to his musical ascent with Buffalo Springfield to his tempestuous years with Crosby, Stills and Nash and with the garage-rock specialists Crazy Horse, and to his re-emergence in the 1990's. The result is an ''exhaustive, quarrelsome and sometimes maddening biography,'' Rick Moody said here last year. Nonetheless, ''there are revelations in abundance.''    THE CELL: Inside the 9/11 Plot, and Why the FBI and CIA Failed to Stop It, by John Miller and Michael Stone, with Chris Mitchell. (Hyperion, $13.95.) According to this gritty police procedural, New York City detectives and ill-equipped American law-enforcement agencies were on the case of Islamic terrorists even before the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. '' 'The Cell' crackles like a police radio'' and is a ''frisky but important addition to the growing literature on Al Qaeda,'' Jeff Stein wrote here in 2002.    REVENGE, by Stephen Fry. (Random House, $12.95.) In this modern-day recasting of the Dumas classic ''The Count of Monte Cristo,'' the Edmond Dant&#232","excerpt":"s figure is a seemingly charmed 17-year-old English public school student who is framed for marijuana possession, and whose woes continue when he is implicated in an I.R.A. scheme and sent off to an insane asylum. Fry, a comic actor, has written ''both a highly readable thriller and a viable novel in its own right,'' Brooke Allen said here last year.    AFTER THE QUAKE: Stories, by Haruki Murakami. (Vintage International, $11.) Even though they were written before Sept. 11, 2001, these six stories about the emotional aftershocks of the lethal 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan, will resonate with many American readers as a metaphor for the terrorist attacks. Last year our reviewer, Jeff Giles, found this an ''unexpectedly powerful'' collection about a traumatizing shock to the Japanese system. In fact, he added, ''one sliver of what makes the book so moving is the sense that on some level it is Murakami's deeply felt get-well card'' to the United States.    DOT.CON: How America Lost Its Mind and Money in the Internet Era, by John Cassidy. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) This history of the dot-com bubble, by a financial writer for The New Yorker, takes Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to task as something of a free market ideologue. Last year our reviewer, Hugo Lindgren, found it a mostly familiar rehash of the Internet age, but said it ''succeeds quite nicely'' in a few areas.    IN RAINBOW'S END: The Crash of 1929, by Maury Klein (Oxford University, $16.95), a historian tells of a time when prosperity spawned optimism, which led in turn to euphoria and finally a speculative frenzy and market manipulation.

For those slender emerald spears, lightly tipped with violet, bring with them green and easy taste of springtime. In these days when availability often seems to be prized for its own sake, asparagus of sorts are with us the year round. But to true buffs, these imports are tougher, less flavorful, less joyous in the pleasures they afford. Nor are canned or frozen impostors considered satisfactory substitutes by those who value the verdant spring freshness of the originals. Better by far to eat asparagus several times a week, if not every day, while they are in season, enjoying them in myriads of ways, and then to forget them until next year's crops come to market, as it does between late February and early March. Beloved by the ancient Greeks who named this vegetable aspharagos, and by the Romans, who dried them so they could have them throughout winter, asparagus come in for a variety of delectable treatments in countries around the world. Europeans, for the most part, prefer white asparagus, achieved by growing the stalks under mounds of earth so the sun does not strike them to produce chlorophyll.

Doug Wright's one-actor play, with a thrillingly accomplished performance by Jefferson Mays and a diamond-sharp production directed by Mois&#233","excerpt":"s Kaufman, has made a rewarding transition to Broadway. The play tells a terrific story based on a real person, Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (n&#233; Lothar Berfelde), a soft-spoken but tenaciously gender-bending biological man who died in 2002 at 74. Her lifelong obsession -- Mahlsdorf preferred to be thought of as female -- was the preservation of furniture, especially from the 1890's, and other household relics like Victrolas and gramophones. Her devotion to her astonishing collection, with which she turned her home into a museum, gave focus and motivation to a life whose grandest achievement was that it proceeded to its natural end. The play is largely about Charlotte's enduring the cruel repressions of the Nazis and the Communists, and her harrowing tales of survival through the eras of the Gestapo and the Stasi are nothing short of breathtaking. Ah, but are they credible? That also becomes an issue in the play, which very subtly but, in the end, quite powerfully makes a case for the necessity of storytelling in our lives. Among the play's resonant assertions is that lives themselves are narratives, and that the perspective, sympathy and reliability of the narrator is crucial to our understanding of them. In other words, to endure the world, people may lie about themselves or to themselves, and the lies are as important as the truth (2:30). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

Museums    * ''ACROSS BORDERS: BEADWORK IN IROQUOIS LIFE,'' Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700 (through May 19). Tribes of the Iroquois nation turned to their long tradition of beadwork as a survival strategy. Using ancient themes but also adapting to the Victorian tastes of outside buyers, they turned out purses, pincushions, picture frames, jewelry, sport and smoking caps and sold them at Niagara Falls and other sites near Iroquois communities. This show, with more than 300 items from the days before European influence to the present, displays the vital design sense and extraordinary handcraft of Iroquois beadworking, from a large 18th-century wampum belt of shell beads, used for record keeping in the absence of a written language, to a recent group of Barbie dolls adorned with feathers and beads. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free (Grace Glueck).    * ''BRAZIL: BODY AND SOUL,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through May 29).

''JEWISH LIFE IN ANCIENT EGYPT: A FAMILY ARCHIVE FROM THE NILE VALLEY,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through May 12). Although the Jews, led by Moses, fled centuries of bondage in Egypt around 1250 B.C., they were back in the country, by then Persian-ruled, as free citizens 800 years later. So say the biblical books of II Kings and Jeremiah, and their assertions are confirmed by the 1893 discovery of a papyrus collection on Elephantine Island in the Nile. Among scrolls from that collection given to the museum 50 years ago, and now displayed in this small show, are several relating to the family of Ananiah, a priest at a temple on the island. The museum has raised the visual quotient by adding works from its own collection, like a striking granite statue (680-650 B.C.) of an Egyptian worshiper. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3, students and 62+ (Glueck).    * ''PIERRE MATISSE AND HIS ARTISTS,'' Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through May 19). More interested in selling art than in making it, Pierre Matisse (1900-1989), son of the painter Henri, migrated as a young man from Paris to New York, where he became one of the century's most influential dealers in modern European works. His gallery, operating from 1931 until his death, represented some of Europe's greatest: Balthus, Chagall, di Chirico, Dubuffet, Giacometti, Mir&#243; and Henri Matisse among them. The library was given the gallery's archives in 1997, and this show celebrates the dealer's achievements, displaying more than 60 paintings, sculptures and drawings he exhibited over the years, as well as letters, photographs and other documents. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6, students and 65+ (Glueck).    * ''GERHARD RICHTER: 40 YEARS OF PAINTING,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through May 21). This is one of the finest, most beautiful and strangely moving exhibitions of the work of a living painter in years. You could quibble about one picture or another, but it is just about pitch perfect as an overview of this 70-year-old German master's maddeningly kaleidoscopic and exquisitely refined output. Since the mid-1960's, Mr. Richter has undoubtedly been Europe's most challenging painter, an evasive switch-hitter between realism and abstraction. You need to see the work, like all good art, firsthand to grasp properly its dizzying diversity, spooky presence and tactile allure. Mr. Richter maintains a kind of cruel faith. The world is mean and absurd. Nature is sublime but indifferent to us. Mass culture turns thinking people into sheep. But beauty is still out there. We can see it only if we don't lie to ourselves. It's what is left after you strip away the clich&#233;s and false rhetoric. ''I constantly despair at my own incapacity, at the impossibility of ever accomplishing anything, of painting a valid, true picture or of even knowing what such a thing ought to look like,'' he once wrote. ''But then I always have the hope that, if I persevere, it might one day happen.'' Clearly it does happen in the show, again and again. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15. Admission: $10; $6.50 for students and 65+ (Kimmelman).    * ''THE RUSSIAN AVANT-GARDE BOOK, 1910-34,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through May 21). In its final offering before going dark on West 53rd Street for a three-year expansion, the Modern has come up with a very MOMA show. Immaculately installed, it's a classic combination of visual &#233;lan and radical ideas. The 300 books on display were designed and in many cases collaboratively made -- printed, collaged, painted, annotated, bound -- by some of Russia's greatest modern artists and poets. The early examples are playfully anarchic; after the 1917 revolution they become graphically more logical, symmetrical, and photographic. The best are as vibrant as any painting and, with their hand-sewn bindings, wrap-around designs and textured covers, have the material presence of sculpture. Hours and admission: See above (Holland Cotter).    * ''THE SHORT CENTURY: INDEPENDENCE AND LIBERATION MOVEMENTS IN AFRICA, 1945-1994,'' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through May 5). This landmark assemblage of art and artifact aims to tell the tumultuous, cruel yet culturally rich history of postcolonial Africa. Painting and popular culture, the interrelationship of the political and the visual, the clash of the modern and the tribal, and the roles of important leaders and writers are among its themes. Brilliant advantage is taken of P.S. 1's vast, multidirectional structure, and against all odds the show largely and unforgettably succeeds, in the process breathing new life into the large-scale, context-oriented exhibition form. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+ (Roberta Smith).    ''STUDIES AND SKETCHES: HENRY DARGER,'' American Folk Art Museum's Eva and Morris Feld Gallery, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue near 66th Street, (212) 595-9533 (through July 14). This small, muted show is a supplement to the larger installation of Darger's collage-paintings at the museum's new home on 53rd Street, and gives a good sense of how those paintings were created. Darger mainly composed by tracing directly from comic strips, coloring books, newspaper advertisements, and magazine illustrations. As the show confirms, many of Darger's recycled images were the product of this method, from natural forms like clouds and flowers, to images of nude prepubescent girls, some with male genitals, being strangled and eviscerated. Hours: Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Cotter).    * ''SURREALISM: DESIRE UNBOUND,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through May 12). Destined to be popular, this show is not your ladies-who-lunch Met exhibition, particularly because of a small amount of pornography, although only bluenoses and people who have never looked closely at what's on view every day in the permanent collection of the museum will find the presence of erotic Surreal art truly daring or sensational. Organized and first presented by the Tate Modern in London last year, the event has desire as its unnecessary motif, as if it were not previously self-evident that sex was always at the heart of the Surrealist program. There are plenty of chestnuts to please the masses, like Magritte's painting of hooded lovers kissing, an illustration that love is blind, and Dal&#237;'s lobster telephone, although what the telephone has to do with desire is not clear. A few works still raise eyebrows, and some of the old jokes are still funny. But success neutered the movement decades ago. The Surrealists, having opened everybody's eyes to the essential weirdness of everyday life, fostered the demand for ever greater anomalies, relegating their own work to the quaint status of bowler hats and antique sewing machines. Now much of it looks small and slightly embarrassing. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).    * ''2002 BIENNIAL EXHIBITION,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street (212) 570-3676, and in Central Park (through May 26). The Biennial, the show that almost always gets the art world's knickers in a twist, is looking good this time around. One whole floor (the top one) works totally as an integrated installation, and there are strong sections on the two other floors. If photography and painting are in shortish supply, there are lots of sound and digital art, an excellent film program, an off-site sculpture show in Central Park and all sorts of oddball, handmade stuff on the walls and floors -- stained glass, quilts, lacework, architectural models -- making this an unusually labor-intensive show. The main thing this Biennial has going for it, though, is a thematic point of view that has to do, in ways hilarious and sad, with American culture and spiritual history, from the Transcendentalist 19th century to the psychedelic 60's to the standing-here-wondering now. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8, for students and 62+ (Cotter).    Galleries: Uptown    * MAX BECKMANN, ''The Eight Sculptures,'' Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700 (through May 24). Hardly known as a sculptor, the German Expressionist Beckmann (1884-1950) is renowned for his powerful paintings, enigmatic compositions that suggest the angst of 20th-century civilization. But at two points in his career he made sculptures: five in the mid-1930's when he was living in Berlin, and three in New York in 1950, the year of his death. This show, the first to exhibit them in New York in 35 years, includes all eight, from a robust self-portrait head (1936) to an acrobat doing a back bend (1950). As the bronzes relate closely to the paintings, it is instructive to see them with a selection of oils and graphics, as displayed here (Glueck).    *  ''STUART DAVIS: MAJOR LATER PAINTINGS,'' Salander-O'Reilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606 (through May 11). This full-bodied show is a greatest-hits lineup of 16 paintings, most of them museums loans, dating from the last two decades of this esteemed American modernist's energetic career. In mood, it's spring-into-summertime stuff; the work's bracing colors and snappy patterns the visual equivalents of jazz on a boom-box, with the volume turned up. The earliest piece, ''Arboretum by Flashlight'' (1942), finds Davis in his urban-rococo middle style; then his compositions grow more spare and large-featured as he refines motifs from his own past paintings. All the way along, he takes a shrewd critical look at American culture, popular and elite, but in the end cool formal rhythms and an extroverted spirit reign supreme (Cotter).    Galleries: 57th Street    JAY DEFEO, ''Ingredients of Alchemy, Before and After the Rose,'' Michael Rosenfeld, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082 (through May 4). Like Meret Oppenheim, creator of the ''Fur-Lined Teacup,'' DeFeo is famous for one singular work, a massive, radiating mandala painting called ''The Rose.'' This selection of paintings and drawings, in styles from Abstraction Expressionism to mechanical Precisionism, gives no indication that DeFeo ever produced anything else so powerfully original. But late iconic compositions hint at the Symbolist mystery that was most fully achieved in her eccentric masterpiece (Ken Johnson).    VALERIE DEMIANCHUK, George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 644-5665 (through May 18). Take your reading glasses for this show of extremely fine pencil drawings. With impressive skill, Ms. Demianchuk draws roots, feathers, snarls of vines and twigs, and a field of stones and rubble (a touching 9-11 memorial). Isolated on large sheets of paper, these images exude a compelling magic realism (Johnson).    MYRON STOUT, ''Studies for Drawings,'' Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780 (through May 18). Stout was famous for taking his time -- nearly 20 years in some cases -- to finish his compact, emblematic, black-and-white abstractions. He also produced intimately sensuous, palm-size graphite drawings. The iconic geometric and biomorphic compositions from the 60's and 70's in this show, some finished, some not, seem simple at first but given time, they reveal a paradoxical play between figure and ground and a subtle, oracular mystery (Johnson).    Galleries: Chelsea    * POLLY APFELBAUM AND BEATRIZ MILHAZES, D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460 (through May 24). One of Ms. Apfelbaum's signature floor pieces and a single large canvas by Ms. Milhazes make an elegant and sumptuously decorative exhibition. Puzzling together small, cut and dyed pieces of velvet, the former creates a lush, expansive carpet of cellular forms in a composition blending Cubism and organic all-overness. The painter offers a big, square, buoyant picture of abstracted floral forms on a Sunday funnies-blue field (Johnson).    * HILARY BRACE, Edward Thorp, 210 West 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, (212) 691-6565 (through May 11). Erasing into postcard-size, charcoal-blackened rectangles, this Seattle-based artist brings to light ragged, fluffy, clumpy or misty cloud forms, which pile up into what seem to be celestial, divinely irradiated mountain-scapes. The technique is amazing, the meteorological vision beguiling (Johnson).    * ''DREAMY,'' Margaret Thatcher, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 675-0222, (through May 4). Three distinct sensibilities are well-matched in this appealing show. Carol Seborovksi creates compact, iconic assemblages combining seductive materials and playful eroticism; Nancy Blum presents a trippy whole-wall installation of cartoonish, outsize ceramic blossoms, all glazed pale gray; and Susan Dory makes flickering, optically riveting pattern paintings using stencils and spray enamel (Johnson).    SUSAN GOLDMAN, John Connelly Presents, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 254-4082 (through May 13). This show serves as a memorial for Goldman, a New York artist who worked in painting and sculpture as well as sound and digital art, and who took her own life in New York a year ago at age 37. In a series of beautiful paintings, candy-colored product logos, bits of architecture and thread-fine lines of written numerals float out like space modules over fields of gray paint. Other paintings are done directly on store-bought paint-by-number panels depicting banal romantic themes, which the artist makes her own by selectively painting sections of each in brilliant colors (Cotter).    HEIDI McFALL, ''Portraiture,'' Annina Nosei, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8695 (through May 11). Working with black pastel on medium large sheets of paper, this young artist makes large, soft-focused portraits based on photographs of friends and family. They call to mind the photo-based works of Gerhard Richter and early Chuck Close, but are less conceptually pointed. Big heads of women are the most impressive, psychologically and technically (Johnson).    ''MORBID CURIOSITY,'' I-20, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 645-1100 (through May 4). The most remarkable piece among these works by four young Californians is a life-size tableau by Kristian Burford: peer in through gauze-curtained French doors and behold a grandmother's sitting room with a near-naked teenage girl sprawled on the sofa. Other works include a large painting of Rasputin, dead, by Tom Allen; naked women with bird heads, finely drawn by J. P. Munro; and video and sculpture by Julian Hoeber, who has a curious fascination with blood (Johnson).    Galleries: SoHo    ''DEMONCLOWNMONKEY,'' Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, (212) 226-3970 (through May 11). In a funhouse-like sequence of spaces, this entertaining exhibition presents works supposed to be subversive, wacky and mischievous. It was organized by the painter Matthew Ritchie. Highlights include David Altmejd's weird science lab table, with severed wolf heads growing crystals; intriguingly eccentric, reverse-perspective paintings by Scott Grodesky; funny, Paul McCarthy-esque video performances by Karen Leo; and a sculpture aptly titled ''One of the Ugliest Objects in America,'' by Michael Byron (Johnson).    ''THE DUBROW BIENNIAL,'' Kagan Martos, 515 Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 343-4293 (through May 4). Organized by the art collector Norman Dubrow, this salon-style display of works by 35 artists proves there's a lot more visual excitement being generated by younger artists than the current Whitney Biennial might lead you to believe. Don't miss Inka Essenhigh's beautiful drawing of the dealer Stefan Stux or variously quirky, poetic and well-made pieces by Laura Owens, Erik Parker, Nicky Jodjoumi, Scott Peterman and numerous others (Johnson).    ''PARSING THE LINE,'' Work Space, 96 Spring Street, (212) 219-2790 (through May 11). The most impressive piece in this show of artists who incorporate literary texts into their works is an 11-foot circle by Cheryl Sorg, which upon close examination turns out to be ''Moby-Dick'' cut and pasted into a very long spiral. Alice Attie turns quotes from Virginia Woolf into spiraling calligraphy; Seong Chun crochets Arthur Danto; Nancy Friedemann makes a rug pattern out of Milan Kundera; Cyrilla Mozenter toys with Gertrude Stein; and Lucia Warck-Meister weaves a plastic cocoon around red plastic words by Jorge Luis Borges (Johnson).    Other Galleries    ''FRESH KILLS: ARTISTS RESPOND TO THE CLOSURE OF THE STATEN ISLAND LANDFILL,'' Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, (718) 448-2500 (through May 27). Rackstraw Downes's panoramic landscape, Marguerite Kahrl's motorized buggies made from recycled parts, Mark Dion's bottle-collecting clubhouse, Alexis Rockman's animal portraits made with leachatecq and Steve Siegel's pile of household rubbish stand out among various ecologically minded artworks. But what is most compelling is the evocation, through text panels and interviews, of the awe-inspiring scale and complexity of Fresh Kills, New York City's last active landfill. More than just a big inert dump, it seems to become a giant, living and breathing organism, a sleeping Frankenstein's monster (Johnson).    * TIM HAWKINSON, ''&#220;berorgan,'' Ace Gallery, 275 Hudson Street, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 255-5599 (through May 11). The art world's master tinkerer and garage genius has cobbled together an enormous, slightly insane conflation of human body and musical instrument, seemingly from scraps. This Goldbergian contraption funnels air into room-size white plastic balloons, which resemble bladders or lungs and function as primitive bagpipes. The piece meanders in and out of six big spaces in this Super Bowl-size gallery, and gives one the feeling of visiting a zoo of mournful whales or walking through the belly of some inchoate beast. But its most haunting effect may be purely aural (Smith).    Last Chance    * JANET CARDIFF AND GEORGE BURES MILLER, ''The Paradise Institute,'' Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9100 (through tomorrow). Could this be the future of cinema? ''The Paradise Institute,'' an award winner at last year's Venice Biennale, is an almost scarily captivating 13-minute multimedia experience. Wearing headphones, you watch a noirish film about a prisoner in a remote hospital, while the soundtrack conflates what's happening on screen with what seems to be going on around you in the theater. It builds to an amazingly powerful climax; you exit feeling mystified and exhilarated (Johnson).    * WIM DELVOYE: ''CLOACA,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Sunday). This Belgian maverick's scatological inclinations have resulted in one of the rare idea-laden Conceptual artworks that must be constructed to achieve its full effect, and seen to be believed. With quite a bit of help from his scientist-friends, he has built a machine that replicates the human digestive system from beginning to end -- from French fries to excrement -- in a straightforward manner that is surprisingly civilized and relatively odor-free. Involving yards of shiny stainless steel and six big glass cylinders, as well as tubes and computers, it will make you at least appreciate the miraculous, discreet efficiency of the human body. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, for artists, students and 65+ (Smith).    WIM DELVOYE, ''Marble Floors,'' Sperone Westwater, 121 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 431-3685 (through tomorrow). Who knew that one of the great things you can do with processed meat is use it to create faux-marble floors? The extravagantly inventive Mr. Delvoye, whose digestion machine ''Cloaca'' is at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo, is a master of this unusual craft. Actual-size photographs document puzzled-together pieces of boiled ham, salami, bologna and other mystery meats. They look for all the world like intricately patterned, pink marble Islamic or Renaissance floor sections (Johnson).    * ''ENDURING ART OF JADE AGE CHINA: CHINESE JADE OF LATE NEOLITHIC THROUGH HAN PERIODS, VOLUME II,'' Throckmorton Fine Art, 153 East 61st Street, (212) 223-1059 (through tomorrow). Jade was invested with moral weight and spiritual power in ancient China. Its touch ensured immortality, and because it was extremely difficult to work, anything made from it carried the glamour of rarity. That aura lingers around the small, intricate pieces here, from a statuette of a nude woman (circa 1500 B.C.) to a zany little figure with a human torso emerging from the body of a snake. The curator, Elizabeth Childs-Johnson, has suggested that jade was perceived as a vehicle of metamorphosis and transformation: just as the man leaves the serpent behind, so human life leaves earth for eternity. The show beautifully illustrates such metaphors (Cotter).    * ''ARSHILE GORKY: PORTRAITS,'' Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through tomorrow). This haunting exhibition centers around one of Gorky's most familiar and defining paintings, an image of himself at age 8 beside his mother, based on a 1912 photograph taken in Armenia where he was born. Two versions, one from the Whitney Museum, the other from the National Gallery in Washington, are here, along with nearly three dozen other loans of paintings and drawings, including portraits of Gorky's family and self-portraits. It is a taut, compelling visual essay about formal virtuosity, identity politics and one artist's profound investment in his own past (Cotter)     * ELIZABETH MURRAY, PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-7000 (through tomorrow). Small, cut-and-folded watercolors replay Ms. Murray's familiar tales of domestic craziness starring animated coffee cups and splay-legged tables. They don't have the funky muscularity of her big paintings, but the intimate scale, lucid color and not-too-fussy craft make for a pleasing change of pace (Johnson).    ''OBJECTS FOR USE: HANDMADE BY DESIGN,'' American Craft Museum, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535 (through Sunday). Proposing an optimistic if not wholly convincing vision of the craftsman's relationship to design and to modern life, this ambitious exhibition focuses not on artisans who make things that people might buy at less than fine-art prices and actually use in their homes. Some 400 objects, including furniture, dishware, cutlery, toys, musical instruments and even fly-fishing lures by more than 190 artisans are on display in a three-floor installation that looks more like a high-end department store than a museum exhibition. There are many objects of elegance and beauty, but few of great originality. Hours: daily, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission, $7.50; $4, students and 65+ (Johnson).    AURA ROSENBERG, Gasser & Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-9494 (through tomorrow). If you belong to the cult of Walter Benjamin, you may be captivated by Ms. Rosenberg's photographic essay based on his memoir of childhood, ''Berliner Kindheit.'' Otherwise, color pictures of historic sites with and without children will seem routinely professional and thematically scattered. More interesting are the three-dimensional works, including a 19th-century monument replicated in bread dough (Johnson).    KIKI SMITH, Pace Wildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-7000 (through tomorow). Ms. Smith has never shied away from the big existential subjects -- birth, death, resurrection -- that seem to embarrass everyone else. In this solo show, three life-size sculptures of nude women kneel atop piles of loose logs as if ready to go up in flames. Close by -- too close by -- full-length figures are suspended like cyrogenically preserved bodies among clusters of poles. As usual, Ms. Smith's combination of Romantic candor and formal solidity carries the day even when her work is disadvantageously displayed, as it is in this cramped show (Cotter).   ART GUIDE"},{"year":"2001","title":"A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.    Museums    * ''BRAZIL: BODY AND SOUL,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 27). The rotunda is black and half filled by an immense altar. The French architect Jean Nouvel's installation is aptly over the top, considering that the show is about a culture gloriously, self-consciously excessive. A sampler of Brazilian culture, the show divides attention between the Baroque and the modern. Physicality, spectacle, eroticism and pleasure: the clich&#233","excerpt":"s of Brazilian culture are all leitmotifs, in stunning objects mixing indigenous, African and European roots. These include the works of genius eccentrics like Aleijadinho, Brazil's Bernini and Arthur Bispo do Rosario, a seaman, boxer, doorman, bodyguard, jailbird and mental patient who died in 1989 at the age of 78. He sewed banners out of bedsheets and embroidered them with long incantatory lists of places and people, including a presentation mantle he made for himself to wear before God on Judgment Day. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $15; $12, students over 12 and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

(Vintage International, $14.) A gay American, H.I.V. positive and living in a state of suspended animation in Paris, drifts into an affair with a much younger man, a married French architect. Their emotionally intense union, and its tragic conclusion, work both with and against the clich&#233","excerpt":"s of marriage. Last year in the Book Review, Alice Truax admired this novel's ''dark power'' and said, ''White rings new changes on the old themes of mortality and forgiveness.''    BLOOD OF THE LIBERALS, by George Packer. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $14.) Liberalism is the defining (and often dysfunctional) force that shaped much of the author's family, including his grandfather (a progressive Alabama congressman), his father and himself, a political nomad struggling to decode the meaning of the concept itself. The result is a ''remarkable story'' that ''belongs on the shelf next to 'Angela's Ashes,' 'The Liars' Club' and 'A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,' '' Jack Hitt said here in 2000.    LITTLE SAINT, by Hannah Green. (Modern Library, $13.95.) The author, who died in 1996, recalls the many years she and her husband spent commuting between the United States and a small village in rural France, in particular her deep involvement with the spiritual life of the community and its patron, a 12-year-old girl martyred in A.D. 303. ''There are many jewels in this book,'' Geoffrey Moorhouse wrote here last year.    THE ARROGANCE OF POWER: The Secret World of Richard Nixon, by Anthony Summers with Robbyn Swan. (Penguin, $16.) In this muckraking biography, the former president is portrayed as a ruthless, paranoid leader whose criminal acts extended well beyond Watergate. ''The great merit of 'The Arrogance of Power' is that it takes much of what we already knew, or thought we knew (or darkly suspected), and refines and confirms and extends it,'' Christopher Hitchens wrote here last year. ''The inescapable conclusion, well bodyguarded by meticulous research and footnotes, is that in the Nixon era the United States was, in essence, a 'rogue state.' ''    DUNE: House Harkonnen, by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. (Bantam, $6.99.) The second prequel to the classic series by the late Frank Herbert revolves, as always, around schemes of vengeance and redemption on a strange planet inhabited by giant sandworms and a fiercely independent people. The novel (Frank's son is a co-author) ''succeeds admirably in setting the stage for the epic conflicts recounted in the earlier books,'' Gerald Jonas said here in 2000.    SUNNYVALE: The Rise and Fall of a Silicon Valley Family, by Jeff Goodell. (Vintage, $13.) A seasoned technology journalist tells of growing up in the cradle of the computer revolution, and of how his parents' divorce and his own disillusionment were the flip side of his hometown's eternal optimism. The result is an ''affecting memoir,'' Sam Lipsyte wrote in these pages last year. ''Goodell's story, despite, or maybe because of, its inexorability, is riveting.''    A SUSPENSION OF MERCY, by Patricia Highsmith. (Norton, $11.) In this 1965 mystery, originally published as ''The Story-Teller,'' a television scriptwriter who plots his wife's murder in elaborate detail -- for creative inspiration only, mind you -- is tempted to do the deed in real life when his spouse takes an unannounced vacation. ''It's a curious and absorbing novel, almost unique in its fantastic and ironic tone,'' Anthony Boucher wrote in the Book Review. Norton has also reissued Highsmith's first novel, Strangers on a Train ($11). Remember the Hitchcock film? When Guy Haines sits next to a talkative chap named Bruno, little does he know his fellow passenger is a psychopath eager to swap murders with an equally disgruntled soul. In 1950 our reviewer, Hillis Mills, called this a ''tense, well-written hare-and-hounds thriller,'' as well as ''a complex examination of character under stress and a sort of parable of good and evil warring for the human spirit.''    SUMMER GONE, by David Macfarlane. (Anchor, $13.) A divorced magazine editor goes canoeing with his 12-year-old son in northern Ontario, where he recalls his own youthful confusion and his wilderness experiences at a boy's camp. ''The pain of lost innocence ripples through this remarkable novel,'' Katherine Wolff said here in 2000. ''The novel's language -- perfectly tuned to guilt, responsibility and transcendence -- evokes the freshwater lakes and rivers that the characters navigate.''
