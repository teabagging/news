A14    THE ELECTIONS   P1-16    Riding Wave of Discontent, Democrats Seize House  Democrats seized control of the House of Representatives and defeated at least three Republican senators, riding a wave of voter discontent with President Bush and the war in Iraq in the most contested Congressional battle since Republicans captured Congress 12 years ago.    A1    A majority of independent voters aligned with Democratic candidates, driven by their distress over the Iraq war, disapproval of Congressional leadership and concern about the direction President Bush was leading America, according to interviews with voters as they left their polling places.    P9    Touch-screen voting machines would not start, poll workers were missing equipment and tempers flared over who was registered as voters in many states went to the polls only to find that casting their vote was as much a challenge as a responsibility.    P1    Democrats won open governor's seats in Ohio, Massachusetts, Arkansas and New York, capturing positions that had been in the hands of Republicans and tilting control of the majority of statehouses to Democrats for the first time since the 1990s.

P5    Democratic Sweep in New York  Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general who crusaded against Wall Street corruption, was elected governor of New York in a historic Democratic sweep of statewide offices.    A1    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton won a resounding re-election victory, securing broad support even in more traditional Republican areas.

The vocalist and guitarist for the Minneapolis trio Babes in Toyland rants, raves and spews lyrics that don't always rhyme. She has the kind of voice that would be more suited to a hoary, stringy-haired death-metal dude than to a cute 28-year-old blonde. Her voice is loud, brutal and vitriolic. It's not very ladylike, and it's not at all pretty.   Ms. Bjelland (pronounced bee-YELL-und) is far from a traditional rock chanteuse, but then Babes in Toyland, who perform tonight at the Ritz, don't fit the stereotype of a girl group. The music is ugly, crunching post-punk, with Ms. Bjelland thrashing out rudimentary chords on her guitar, Lori Barbero laying down tempestuous rhythms on the drums, and Maureen Herman thumbing hard and fast on her bass.

He's sensitive, but with a smirk. He's literate without being intellectual. And he's emotional without being messy about it. Mr. Dando, a 26-year-old hunk, is perfect for his huge audience of teen-age girls, and for much of his show on Saturday night at Roseland his audience sang along with his songs, producing a high-pitched sound that was mostly drowned out by the band's grinding sound. He's everything a teen-ager would want to be: smart, good-looking, successful, and still wearing T-shirts and ratty jeans.   One of rock's main tensions has always between melody and sound, between the contours of a song and the exuberant annihilation of blasting, distorted guitars. Mr. Dando is an extraordinary melodist with a flair for a 60's pop sound, and his best songs have the sort of logic all great melodies share: they seem so obvious, and it's hard not to wonder why they hadn't been written before. On his records, Mr. Dando emphasizes his pop side, all within an alternative, post-punk framework that's not always convincing.

But the new film, which opened yesterday at the Rivoli, is, for a number of reasons, only intermittently compelling as an entertainment, notwithstanding the freshness and urgency of its subject.Offhand, we would say the film's principal weakness might be traced to a conscious effort of Dore Schary, the producer, and his scenarist, Allen Rivkin, to formularize the principal characters. And, considering the growing social implications inherent in the problem of the disillusioned and footloose veteran, it would seem that a picture contemplating such a vital theme should at least make an earnest effort to treat the matter realistically.Cliff Harper, who went from high school to the Marines and returns home a man, is, to our way of thinking, a particular rather than a representative ex-service man. He is representative in that he is sound in body and mind, but beyond that he is strictly a conventional movie character. And his experiences in a small California town, while intended to be composite, are more theatrical than natural. For after briefly dramatizing the uneasiness Cliff feels in the presence of his well-meaning but hardly perceptive parents who just can't understand that Cliff must plan his own life in his own good time, the film projects him into a troubled love affair with a young war widow. They find love, or something resembling the same, at first sight, have a misunderstanding and make up, quarrel again and find bliss in each other's arms until finally one is quite exasperated with their juvenile behavior.As a subordinate theme there is the story of Cliff's two buddies, Bill Tabeshaw, a happy-go-lucky cowhand with a silver plate in his head, and Perry Kincheloe, a promising prize fighter who lost both legs and is bitter, but determined to live his life through a kid brother whom he is training for the ring. The picture also makes a pass at realism by a sharp warning against phony organizations of veterans with fascist racial and religious programs. And with a logic that is peculiar to Hollywood, all three veterans (not to overlook that troubled widow) come to a clear-cut understanding of all their complex problems after a bloody barroom brawl. Top that for a solution to the imponderables of war's aftermath if you can!With the exception of Dorothy McGuire's characterization of the moody girl and Robert Mitchum's portrayal of the breezy cowboy, there is nothing exceptional about the performances. Guy Madison, who plays Cliff Harper, is a personable youngster, but he has much to learn about the art of acting.Whatever the merits of the Niven Busch novel, \\"They Dream of Home,\\" on which this film is based, \\"Till the End of Time\\" emerges in the final analysis as a conventional love story, with pretensions of topical social import.

Justice White must believe that his concluding assertion provides a persuasive clincher to the majority's lamentable opinion.   If the majority chooses to construe such a narrow interpretation of the Constitution as a time-bound text, it must bear in mind that the Constitution is equally silent on the subject of judicial review. The Court's power to evaluate legislation is an assumed power, albeit venerable and accepted by now. It cannot be validated by a close reading of the constitutional text alone (see Federalist 78). Rather, it is validated by knowledge we have of the Framers' intentions and by practices in the highest courts of several states between 1776 and 1803, when judicial review by the Supreme Court was first announced by Chief Justice John Marshall as a matter of interpretation.
