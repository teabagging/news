M-G-M'S 'BOUNTY' BACK ON COURSE","excerpt":"Remake of '35 Film Picking Up Speed After Milestone Replaces Reed at Helm"},{"year":"1939","title":"Originals are always better than imitations, and in view of all the depressing copies of \\"Beau Geste\\" which the cinema has suffered during the last thirteen years (take any picture about the French Foreign Legion at random) the prototype of them all seems eminently worth repeating, for a change. It should also prove encouraging to persons with faith in the continuing validity of the screen's most gallant gestures to note that \\"Beau Geste,\\" in the Paramount's current re-make, is still good cinema—that the absurd nobility, brotherly devotion and self-sacrifice of the Geste tribe are still unflagging ingredients for action melodrama.On the other hand, the law of diminishing returns has got in its dirty work over the years: since 1926 the Foreign Legion motif has been so sadly overworked, so cruelly abused, that today the original may itself take on some of the irritatingly reminiscent quality of an imitation. In a sense, it is an imitation—an imitation in talk and sound effects of what was admittedly a classic in silence, and romantics with a too glowingly nostalgic recollection of Herbert Brenon's magnum opus may even be disappointed in the present exhibit. It must be acknowledged that the suspense and the timing are less torturing, less conducive to sweaty palms, than in the early epic, but then, it is now possible to hear the bugles and the wicked spatter of Arab gunfire, not to mention the shrieks of the poor devils beaten or maimed forever by that beast in human guise, Sergeant Markoff.There is, of course, something a little nightmarish about the heroics of the Geste brothers, with their somewhat stagy, \\"Let me be the first to die\\" competition, something unreal about their eternal Britishness, which is not improved by the fact that \\"Beau\\" is now Gary Cooper, with unimpaired Texan accent, instead of Ronald Colman, that John, the survivor of all this touching fustian at last, is Ray Milland, and that Digby is the capable but curiously un-Anglican Robert Preston. These are niggling faults, but they mar what should be a poem of pure action, as do the children who play so stiffly the Geste brothers and Isobel Rivers in their chivalrous and storybook haunted youth.On the whole, it is perhaps an unfortunate thing for Beau Geste the Second that Beau Geste the First was so distinguished, for Mr. Wellman's film seems dominated by the tremendous shadow of its predecessor. But it would be a mistake on that account to assume that the current generation will not find the current \\"Beau\\" a stirring piece of cinema, worth more than all the combined photostatic copies which followed the first and alas! preceded the second. Those dead legionnaires, staring down from the gun embrasures of the desert fort, can still give one the creeps. The mystery of the disappearing bugler, of the two vanishing corpses, of the immense funeral pyre romantically burning in the desert, are still matters for shuddery speculation. Who stole that unparalleled sapphire, the \\"Blue Water\\"? The question is still a gripping one.As for that earlier, perhaps blessedly silent, \\"Beau Geste\\"—what the present generation doesn't know, it will certainly never miss.

Mr. Tracy, who was the self-centred and amusingly confident hoofer of the play \\"Broadway,\\" goes through the part of Eddie Burns in this current film with the same show of impudence and pig-headedness with which he played Roy Lane. The character in this talking picture may be called by another name, and the story is quite different from \\"Broadway,\\" but as Mr. Tracy appears in the rôle it results in the tale being very much like a sequel to the adventures of Roy Lane and his partner.Here Mr. Tracy is the joke and dance performer, who through a sudden stroke of fortune is engaged with Lily Clark to appear at a small-time theatre. His aspirations are for big-time, the Palace and other such houses. His conceit in this direction is so marked that Sybil, who runs the ten, twenty and thirty place of amusement, says that one could stage Ben Hur in his hat.Burns goes blithely along, hopping up the ladder of success, until his wife and partner, Lily, becomes a mother. Then he decides to team up with a girl named Gloria, until Lily regains her strength. This new combination results in an affair with his new team-mate, and Lily, understanding the conduct of the faithless Eddie, forthwith goes her own way. and Eddie flops down and down until he has to take a job as a waiter in a lunch counter. He has been reminded on countless occasions when going to agents that Lily was the mainstay of the \\"act.\\"Although Burns is gifted with swift repartee of a sort, his line of jokes seldom varies and one of the outstanding episodes in this 'picture' is where he is caught by one of the freight train's crew in a horse car. Burns, who is perceived asleep near the feet of a mule, is awakened by a kick, which he at first thinks comes from the animal near him. Soon, however, he discovers that the kick was performed by the trainman, who in the course of conversation learns that Burns is a comedian. Burns is told by the trainman that if he (Burns) can make him laugh the comedian will be permitted to continue his ride west.Mr. Burns tries all the jokes he told before the footlights, and there are interruptions from the freight expert, but that man's face remains as stoic as that of a Sioux warrior. The chatter is brought to a more or less satisfactory conclusion by a combination neighing-and-braying outburst from the mule.Following the long and uncomfortable ride, Mr. Burns lands in Hollywood, where Lily is doing exceeding well. Food is uppermost in Mr. Burns's mind at that time, and if one has not had lunch before going to the Roxy one is decidedly inclined to sympathize with the hungry hoofer.Mr. Tracy's gift of humor loses nothing in coming from the screen. The man in the monitor room may have permitted Mr. Tracy's delivery to be a trifle sonorous at times compared with the utterances of the other players, but the voice is the voice of Tracy and he suits his actions and expressions to the lines.Mae Clark is sympathetic as Lily. Daphne Pollard plays Sybil with feminine force. Stepin Fetchit contributes many a good laugh with his lazy tones and his treacherous memory.On the Fox Movietone reel are George Bernard Shaw in his amusing chat on physical exercise and sea bathing","excerpt":"remarkable scenes with sound of the pilgrimage to Lourdes and other side-lights of the news.Mr. Rothafel has conjured beauty and song out of nothing more than a lettuce and tomato salad in one of his numbers.

For nearly a century now, that has been the standard American response when events in the region geographically closest to the United States threaten to get out of hand, and for just as long a time, those interventions have almost uniformly failed to produce the results that policy makers in Washington had hoped for.   Since its first sustained foray into the region during the Spanish-American War of 1898, which yielded a protectorate in Cuba, permanent possession of Puerto Rico and a colony in the far-off Philippines, the United States has intervened militarily in the insular Caribbean and in Central America more than a score of times. Some countries, such as the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua, have been invaded and occupied more than once, a phenomenon that probably most eloquently expresses America's historic inability to remake neighboring societies to its own satisfaction. Indeed, it has often seemed that the more the United States tinkers, the worse things become. Many Tactics, One Rationale    The forms of intervention have varied, of course, from quick campaigns such as in Nicaragua in 1912, Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1989, to long occupations in Haiti and the Dominican Republic early in the century.  Then, too, there was invasion by proxy, practiced in Central America in the 1980's, and even the creation of a country by fiat -- Panama in 1903. The locations have also varied, with Spanish-, French- or English-speaking parts of the Caribbean all having to surrender sovereignty and self-determination at one time or another.

The image is one of the oldest known of a conquering monarch, and its naturalistic carving, monumental size and fine state of preservation make it virtually unique.   It is only 1 of 200 pieces of ancient Near Eastern art on first-time loan to New York from the Louvre during that museum's extensive gallery renovations. (A smaller sampling appeared at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington last spring.) The Louvre's holdings in this area are among the finest in the West, thanks to the pioneering efforts of 19th-century French archeological teams.
