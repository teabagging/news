It looks mighty suspicious, and the long, pure sweep of the canyon line, when you look down at it from the top of the gorge, makes the metro-polite catch his breath. Although Dude and his pard, Nebraski, are supposed to be riding fence, they are really aiming to find out where the short-horns go.

The hosses clatter along against a pale-blue sky and the six-shooters reverberate down vast and magnificent distances. When the Dude and the Red Rock foreman have it out on the dizzy edge of the precipice, you have more concern for the view than for the Dude's fate. For the Dude is played with bronzed and modest splendor by George O'Brien, who can take care of himself on or off a bronc.Of course, there are enough ornery cusses in the bunkhouse to give the Dude a good work-out.

The military contractors have each joined forces with established rail-car manufacturers to bid for the contract, which is seen as a test case of whether the companies can successfully transfer decades of high-tech weapons production into marketable products for the rapidly expanding transportation equipment and services market.   The contract, with an estimated value of $200 million, is to be awarded by the end of June. It covers the building of 87 cars for the city's Green Line, scheduled to open in late 1994, and to develop technologically advanced transportation products that can be used in Los Angeles cars and other transit systems worldwide.    \\"Unlike some businesses that the defense contractors are considering entering, transportation is still an underdeveloped market, and a lot of the skills used in defense are applicable to mass transit,\\" said James Raffel, a research analyst for the National Commission for Economic Conversion and Disarmament, a Washington group.   Rail-car industry executives appear pleased to form partnerships with military contractors, which they said had developed a variety of technologies that would benefit future mass transit systems.   They may include lightweight frames for rail cars and buses, made from the same composite materials that the military contractors use in their rocket and missile designs. The contractors may also use their knowledge of aerospace electronics to develop safer braking and more fuel-efficient propulsion systems for the rail cars.   \\"Most of this technology has been too expensive for us to develop for the current market, and a lot of it has been kept confidential or classified as sensitive because of its use by the military,\\" said Thomas J. Smith, president of the Morrison Knudsen Corporation's rail system group, which has teamed with the Hughes Aircraft Company and the Lockheed Corporation. \\"It's a unique opportunity for us to get our hands on some of it.\\"   Many weapons industry experts and executives have long maintained that the skills the contractors gained in building complex weaponry like missiles, jet fighters and radar have direct applications to transportation. Even critics say that if military contractors are at all successful in commercial ventures, they will most likely be transportation related, mainly because that market remains largely undeveloped.  Yet Mr. Raffel said that military contractors were unlikely to enter the market for transportation equipment and services, despite its predicted fast growth, unless the Federal Government made a considerable investment in the development of new technologies and in the rebuilding of roads, bridges and mass transit.   As an example of why such conversion efforts are prone to fail when there is no Government support, Mr. Raffel cites the Boeing Corporation's early success in building rail cars and trolleys after the Vietnam War. But the Seattle-based jet builder ultimately abandoned its rail-car efforts when financing from the Urban Mass Transit Administration was cut during the Carter and Reagan Administrations and the market became unstable.   President Clinton has said he intends to increase Federal investment in transportation and rebuilding roads and the like, but no specific plans have yet been formulated.   The American Public Transit Association, an industry group, estimates that transit systems across the United States will have to spend about $8.1 billion by the end of the decade to replace rail vehicles and keep them in proper working order. That amount compares with $4.5 billion spent in 1990.   Los Angeles plans to spend $150 billion over the next 30 years on a 400-mile metro system that includes light- , heavy- and commuter-rail systems. About $70 billion will be spent on the light-rail system, which will require hundreds of rail cars. Motive Was Loss of Jobs    Officials of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority said that the region's loss of some 150,000 aerospace and weapons jobs in the last five years prompted them to structure the rail-car procurement as an enticement for military contractors to consider transportation work to offset the decline in military business.   \\"We've worked very hard to encourage local aerospace and defense firms to form these partnerships with the rail-car industry to help them make the transition into the emerging surface transportation industry,\\" said Mike Antonovich, chairman of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority.   The four bidding teams are: the Northrop Corporation with the Bombardier Corporation","excerpt":"Lockheed, Hughes and Morrison Knudsen; TRW Aerospace, the AAI Corporation and the Siemens Duewag Corporation, and the Rockwell International Corporation with the Sumitomo Corporation.   Under the contract, the winning team will receive up to $10 million to develop product ideas, which will be tested on two prototype cars and possibly be included in some of the 87 cars ordered. The winning team is expected to be well positioned to compete for other transit rail contracts and to sell its products across the country and overseas.    But some critics and supporters of conversion alike say that the military contractors have yet to show a real commitment to transportation and that the companies' participation in the Los Angeles rail system is only window dressing because it requires little capital investment. Union Is Skeptical    \\"If they are serious about transportation, why aren't they creating design and development centers within the companies to study the new technologies and make prototypes?\\" asked Don Nakamoto, research director for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 727 in Los Angeles. \\"They are very reluctant to take the first step.\\"   Mr. Nakamoto, whose union strongly supports conversion for jobs growth, said he believed the city's effort to get military contractors to participate in the rail-car procurement was partly political. After the metropolitan transportation commission canceled a $121.8 million contract it had awarded to Sumitomo for the Green Line cars, amid a storm of criticism about the selection of a foreign-owned company, it was forced to find American companies to bid with foreign rail-car makers, Mr. Nakamoto said.   Gwendolyn Williams, manager of contracting for the vehicle acquisition project for the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said that initially the rail-car makers responded coldly to the idea of teaming with the military contractors because the two were in totally different businesses. After months of collaboration, however, the rail-car makers have expressed optimism that the partnerships will prosper.   Greg Fountain, Lockheed's manager of advanced product development for commercial systems, said that the Los Angeles procurement represented an opportunity to test ideas. \\"The critical issue here is that we in the defense business must learn to assess the needs of the market and match those needs with the appropriate technology,\\" he said. \\"In the past we were just given requirements and we met them.\\"    Mr. Fountain said that if Lockheed was successful in developing new transportation technologies, he believed the new area of business could amount to as much as $100 million in annual revenue and possibly more in the long term.  Rockwell Sees Advantage    Officials of Rockwell International said they believed they had an advantage over other military contractors competing for the Los Angeles rail contract because of the company's history of translating military technology into transportation products.   Using its military navigation and electronics skills, Rockwell recently developed satellite navigation and communications systems that are being used by trucking companies, transit systems and railroads to track vehicles and provide the latest type of communications. The contractor is also developing so-called intelligent vehicle highway systems, a traffic management tool, and it is a major supplier of car and truck components and systems.    \\"It's not hard to imagine transportation being half of Rockwell International,\\" Mr. Black said. \\"The same technology that we put in infrared sensors can be used for traffic-lane monitoring or even for collision avoidance in cars. The trick is correctly identifying the market and applying the technology.\\" Arms Makers Vie to Build Rail Cars"},{"year":"1941","title":"Douglas, Vultee and Northrop Aircraft increase wages","excerpt":"Lockheed, Vega, Ryan, Solar and North Amer reach tentative agreements subject to employe ratification; OPM, War and Navy Depts approve COAST AIR PLANTS INCREASE WAGES; Three Announce New Scales and Five Reach Pacts Subject to Votes by Employes COST IS MANY MILLIONS Grants Approved in Capital to Aid Defense and Stabilize Pay in Factories of Area"},{"year":"1990","title":"The Lockheed Corporation said yesterday that Ben R.

Sure, there are a couple of W's, but downtown Chicago is mainly a canyon of Marriotts, Sheratons and Hyatts. So the opening in March of the James Hotel Chicago, a 297-room upstart that promised high design at midlevel prices, generated considerable buzz. Travel + Leisure magazine put it on ''The It List,'' and the local news media tracked its opening like a new Goodman Theater revival. So does it deserve the hype? Perhaps not for design mavens looking for the next big thing. For everyone else seeking a cool and stylish alternative to the city's bland hotel chains, the James is now the only game in town.    THE LOCATION -- The James is centrally located in Chicago's downtown shopping district, steps from a Cartier, a Linens 'n Things and an Ann Taylor. Michigan Avenue, the retail-clogged artery, is one block to the west.    THE ROOMS -- Homey and well-proportioned, in a modern airport lounge kind of way. Just ask for a street view. My initial room faced a courtyard -- prison yard was more like it. After a quick change to a room across the hallway (a request honored even though the hotel was unaware I was a reporter), I had a pretty view of a Victorian-style house, the old onion-domed Medinah Temple and slivers of the city's modernist skyline. The décor, however, was less inspired. A leather-and-metal chair bore a shameless resemblance to a Barcelona Chair by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (who lived in Chicago). A dark wood bench recalled George Nelson's Slat Bench. And tucked into a dining alcove was an oval table that was a clear knockoff of Eero Saarinen's Tulip Table. To be fair, most guests won't care to notice the difference. They'll be too busy admiring the enormous plasma TV, which is almost as wide as the king-size platform bed.    THE BATHROOMS -- Chic, like the locker room of an upscale spa. Tucked behind a sliding door, the bathroom had chocolate-colored slate tiles, hard-to-pronounce toiletries, piles of fresh-smelling towels and a shallow sink on a marble countertop. Waffle-print bathrobes hung in an oak wardrobe. Too bad there wasn't a deeper tub to complete the illusion.    THE AMENITIES -- No skimping here. The rooms feature free WiFi, an iPod-ready stereo and dimmer switches. A compact spa and gym are on the lower level, equipped with a battery of butter-smooth Cybex machines. (Danny Errico, founder of Equinox Fitness Clubs, is one of the partners.) The hotel's restaurant, David Burke's Primehouse, features a salt cave for dry-aging steaks. And for late-night drinks, the J Bar next door attracts what a bouncer called ''sophisticated young professionals.'' Take your room key for admission in case you don't fit the bill.    ROOM SERVICE -- The eclectic 24-hour menu includes protein shakes ($8) and less-healthy choices like filet mignon ($44). A Caesar salad, ordered midday, arrived in under 20 minutes. If you can't wait that long, there's a minibar filled with snacks (and condoms), as well as a handsome liquor cabinet stocked with top-shelf spirits (starting at $17 for 375-milliliter bottles). Twice-daily maid service turns down the bed, lighting and music.    THE CROWD -- Business travelers in Paul Smith suits and urbanites in designer jeans and flip-flops. As I was checking out, a well-dressed family from London was checking in.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- Finally, a design boutique hotel that Chicago can call its own. Standard guestrooms start at $250","excerpt":"lofts, which feature a minitheater room, start at $379; and one-bedroom apartments, with a wet bar and corner views, start at $439.

The first Lollapalooza tour, in 1991, sold out arenas with a bill of seven raucous bands and a circus tent full of political and social-action groups. Its success proved that people in their teens and 20's would turn out in force for a 10-hour show that promised sonic jolts, a break from concert routine and a hint of idealism. The tour was an early warning of both the rage of the 1992 electorate and the ascendancy of post-punk alternative rock.   The sequel, which sold out the 11,000-seat Jones Beach Theater here today and returns on Tuesday, is a sure thing rather than a wild idea. It's bigger and more mercantile than its model, more diverse in its auxiliary attractions and less so in its headliners. As with the first Lollapalooza tour, the 1992 version carries a grab bag of messages and attitudes, from the party-hearty spirit of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and, surprisingly, Ice Cube, to the vengeful wrath of Ministry and Soundgarden to the smoldering despair of Pearl Jam, the flippant nihilism of the Jesus and Mary Chain and the introspection of Lush.

Primus, Alice in Chains, Dinosaur Jr., Fishbone and Arrested Development are the major names in a lineup that also includes seven other bands. But the audience is also an attraction, as fans in their teens and 20's look at themselves and test their self-image as a community.    Lollapalooza is becoming a habit: spring break for the alienated. In Chicago, a July 3 Lollapalooza show sold out before performers had been named. For anti-mainstream rockers, the festival combines stadium dates with some underground credibility.

Simply by walking outside, one could witness, in June alone, the jubilation surrounding both the Argentine collapse in the Falklands and the royal birth.  There were diverting sideshows, too - from a crippling transit strike to Wimbledon to the much-chronicled David Frost-Lynne Frederick divorce. With so much public theater on view, perhaps the offerings in London's legitimate theaters are bound to disappoint by contrast.   Whatever the reason, most of the works I saw during a two-week theatergoing binge lack the excitement coursing through London itself. Remove the city's two remarkable institutional theaters -the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater - and what's left is a theater scene depressingly reminiscent of New York's.

THE THEATER IN LONDON IS A DECIDEDLY MIXED BAG","excerpt":"LONDON"},{"year":"1982","title":"''The ups and downs in the price of silver bullion have as much to do with the value of antique silver as today's price of lumber does with the value of Chippendale furniture,'' said Jacques Koopman, the Dutch-born dealer.   Mr. Koopman, of E. & C.T. Koopman & Son, Ltd., knows what he's talking about. One month ago he paid $390,000 plus a 10 percent buyer's fee to Christie's in New York for a pair of silver gilt tureens by Jean-Baptiste-Claude Odiot - the most expensive silver ever sold at auction in the United States. The gilded vessels were among 13 offerings from the collection of the late C. Ruxton Love, an art collector and connoisseur of the decorative arts, 10 of which were purchased by Mr. Koopman in the dispersal on June 14.

At the Winter Garden, one can already see a mammoth billboard for ''Cats,'' the hugely successful British musical which will open with an American cast in October. At least three other West End plays - Michael Frayn's ''Noises Off,'' C.P. Taylor's ''Good'' and Nell Dunn's ''Steaming'' - are expected to arrive soon after. If the past is any guide, some of these productions will repeat their London success in New York, while others will induce Anglophobia.   From a New York theatergoer's point of view, British imports are lifelines: the Tony Award-winning plays of each of the past two seasons, ''Amadeus'' and ''Nicholas Nickleby,'' came from England.  Yet Americans need not feel culturally deprived or insecure when confronting the best British theater: The theatrical exchange is a two-way street, and there are in fact more American shows running in the West End than the other way around.
