Porter's images, drenched as they often are in the effulgent light of the summer sun and redolent of salt air from the ocean, can at first seem as casual and unchallenging as the work of a gifted Sunday painter. But they are neither. In his uncorruptedness of feeling and his bedrock commitment to the history and craft of painting, Porter was a deeply, invigoratingly serious artist, as the latest exhibition of his paintings and prints, at Hirschl & Adler Galleries, makes clear.   Always out of sync with the mainstream, Porter has become an inspiration to many artists who likewise labor on the sidelines. During the 1960's, when representation made a comeback in the form of Pop Art, his reputation began to spread, until it became clear that his personal kind of work really had nothing in common with the commercialism of Pop. Not until 1983, eight years after his death, was he the subject of a major retrospective, organized by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

The film of \\"The Amateur Gentleman,\\" at the Roxy, admits it has been \\"freely adapted\\"","excerpt":"Q. E. D. It is a disappointment and fellow-students of Farnol will be wary.Still, there probably are millions of non-Farnol readers at large, unfortunate souls, and, having no preconceived notions of the amateur gentleman and his invasion of London in 1810, they in all likelihood will accept the new photoplay as a properly romantic, adventurous and colorful tale. It was produced in England by Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s new company, Criterion Films, and has been performed with considerable skill by Mr. Fairbanks himself, by Elissa Landi as the Lady Cleone, Gordon Harker as Natty Bell, Basil Sydney as the evil Chichester and Frank Pettingell as Glorious John Barty, former heavyweight champion of England and now keeper of the rustic Pride of the Fancy Inn.In this liberally altered version young Barnabas Barty goes to London, not to become an amateur gentleman on the strength of a huge inheritance from an uncle, but to discover the knave who stole the Marquess of Camberhurst's jewels as he slept serenely in the Barty Inn. There are two suspects, the lovely Lady Cleone's brother and her completely unlovely suitor, Chichester. Only by posing as one of the \\"nobs\\" and winning access to high society can Barnabas exonerate Glorious John, who stands convicted of the crime and has been sentenced to be hanged in accordance with the pleasant criminal code of Regency England.And so, in tight breeches, frilled cravat and flounces, the innkeeper's son becomes part of the lively pageant of old London, engages in a bare-knuckled fist fight, pleases the Prince Regent, woos the Lady Cleone and outwits Chichester handsomely. Barring the setting, the tale might have been penned by an Erie Stanley Gardner or a Leslie Charteris, for Mr. Farnol was never much of a hand at writing detective stories. The photoplay is decorative, though, and, if it is a bit overlong in its telling, it is not too bad a beginning for Criterion Pictures.

The reshaping of the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee is an important victory for those trying to tug the party toward a new world of free markets -- for goods, though not ideas. The shake-up, which included the retirement of two leading hard-liners, sends a clear signal that the party intends to focus its energies not on ideology but on economic restructuring. A Future Power Struggle    The selection of the seven men as members of the new Standing Committee prepares the battleground for the huge power struggle expected after the death of Deng Xiaoping, China's 88-year-old paramount leader. The seven men will have far more weight than any one else in determining the direction of China after Mr. Deng dies.   While Mr. Deng holds no official position, he clearly was the prime force in picking the new Standing Committee. But as his health deteriorates, he is unlikely to be able to influence it in the way he has in the past.   Mr. Deng emerged today to congratulate the new leaders, in his first televised appearance in eight months. He seemed very frail and his facial expression barely changed. Still, he managed to walk about and wave to the cheering delegates of the just-ended Communist Party congress. Helped by His Daughter    \\"The congress was a great success,\\" Mr. Deng said, according to the official New China News Agency. \\"I hope all people will continue to work hard.\\"   Mr. Deng is known to be virtually deaf and to have difficulty articulating his words, and from the Chinese television footage it appeared that his daughter Deng Rong, who held his arm the entire time, had to repeat his remarks on some occasions so others could understand him. She also spoke into his ear to tell him what people were saying to him.   While Mr. Deng is said to be more alert in the mornings, it is still not entirely clear how a man in such a physical state can exert such a grip over national affairs. One partial answer to this puzzle is that he focuses only on setting broad policy guidelines and on choosing personnel at the highest level. Even so, some Chinese wonder if those around Mr. Deng may be manipulating him or else manipulating the country by sometimes speaking in his name.    It is impossible to know how the new leaders will act once they are freed of Mr. Deng's supervision. But so far there is no sign that they favor a political liberalization to go along with the economic changes that have opened large segments of the Chinese economy to market forces.   Jiang Zemin, the Communist Party General Secretary, remains the head of the Standing Committee. As a stereo system played \\"Descendants of the Dragon,\\" a ballad that ironically was written by a pro-democracy campaigner expelled from China two years ago, Mr. Jiang strode into a large room in the Great Hall of the People and introduced the other members of the new Standing Committee to several hundred foreign reporters. A Different Atmosphere    Five years ago, the newly chosen Standing Committee walked around the room, bantering with journalists, but this time the atmosphere was entirely different. As soon as they had been introduced, the members hurried out of the room, some looking nervously over their shoulders at the mobs of journalists shouting questions at them.   One of the most important appointments today was the elevation to the Standing Committee of Zhu Rongji, a former Shanghai Mayor who is sometimes labeled \\"China's Gorbachev\\" because of his aggressive efforts to restructure the economy. Mr. Zhu, who is 64, has risen very rapidly and is the leading candidate to replace Prime Minister Li Peng if Mr. Li is edged out when his term expires next spring.   \\"Now the reformers finally have some advocates in the highest ranks,\\" a Western diplomat said. \\"It's unrealistic to think that they will lead to a Western parliamentary system. But there probably will be dramatic changes in the economy, and that will lead to political changes even if they don't want that to happen.\\"   The youngest of the new Standing Committee members is Hu Jintao, the 49-year-old party secretary in Tibet. Mr. Hu has played a central role in crushing dissent in Tibet, where troops have fired machine guns on protesting Buddhist monks and nuns, and yet he is generally considered a reformer.   In part this is because Mr. Hu endorsed the repression for practical rather than ideological reasons. Moreover, he was a protege of Hu Yaobang, a former Communist Party leader who sought far-reaching change. On the other hand, Hu Jintao was also promoted early in his career by Song Ping, a hard-liner, and so the accuracy of the labels is open to question.   The other new addition to the Standing Committee is Gen. Liu Huaqing, a 76-year-old army veteran who has tried to make the military forces professional and modern rather like those in the West.    Three other party leaders have been retained from the previous Standing Committee: Mr. Li, the Prime Minister","excerpt":"Qiao Shi, who is in charge of internal security, and Li Ruihuan, who looks after ideology and propaganda. Most Chinese regard Li Peng as a hard-liner and Li Ruihuan as a reformer, with Mr. Jiang and Mr. Qiao somewhere in between.   Those dropped from the Standing Committee were Yao Yilin, the head of the central planning apparatus, and Mr. Song, the hard-liner who has been in charge of party organization.   In addition to the seven chosen to serve on the Standing Committee, 13 others were chosen regular members of the Politburo. The full Politburo meets about once a month, with many other party officials present as well.    The Standing Committee, on the other hand, normally meets at least once a week, with much less ceremony. It is by far the more important body.   Aside from the seven serving on the Standing Committee, 11 officials were elevated to the full Politburo for the first time: Ding Guangen, Mr. Deng's bridge partner; Li Lanqing, the Trade Minister; Qian Qichen, the Foreign Minister; Yang Baibing, a general; Wu Bangguo, the party leader in Shanghai; Zou Jiahua, a Deputy Prime Minister; Chen Xitong, the Mayor of Beijing; Jiang Chunyun, the party leader in Shandong Province; Wei Jianxing, the Minister of Supervision; Xie Fei, the party leader in Guangdong Province, and Tan Shaowen, the party leader in the city of Tianjin.   Two others who had served on the previous Politburo were retained on the present one: Tian Jiyun, who oversees agriculture, and Li Tieying, the Education Minister.   There is a sense in Beijing that other changes -- in policies and personnel -- are likely to follow soon. At People's Daily, for instance, an official spokeswoman paused when she was asked if the hard-line publisher, Gao Di, was still holding his job.   \\"Well,\\" she said uncertainly, \\"I have no information that he's no longer serving as publisher.\\"   FREE MARKET GAINS"},{"year":"2001","title":"Chinese security forces reportedly have detained since Dec Qin Guangguang, Chinese-born pharmaceutical company executive with permanent residency status in United States","excerpt":"Qin was well-connected newspaper editor in China until 1989, when he left nation; later served as visiting scholar at several American universities; reportedly is suspected of giving state secrets to overseas intelligence agency (M) Chinese With Ties To U.S. Is Detained"},{"year":"2003","title":"Boldface Names column","excerpt":"Qintessentially is British concierge service that is trying to get foothold in America and is positioning itself as personal assistant boasting celebrity clients; Aerosmith's Steve Tyler discusses his wardrobe; Mary Tyler Moore attends party at Waldorf-Astoria honoring Julie Andrews and Carol Burnett; Sharon Stone attends American Foundation for AIDS Research Awards (M) BOLDFACE NAMES"},{"year":"1952","title":"Keefe, Frank B ..
