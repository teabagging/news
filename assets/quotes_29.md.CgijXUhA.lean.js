The most naive of these myths -- and the one most coveted by the movies -- is the myth of deathbed reconciliation. The scene I have in mind is the one in which the son, after years in exile, sits at his dying father's side and dismisses in a few teary phrases the anger and hostility that have governed their relationship for decades. A touching idea, but implausible. The rage of decades works itself deep into flesh and bone","excerpt":"platitudes can never reach it.   My father died two months ago, gaunt and skeletal from cancer in his bones. My last year with him consisted of visits to a deathbed where the sinuous man I knew as a boy had been rendered down to a ghastly 85 pounds. Like the son in the myth, I'd been long on the road. So angry was I at my father that I once went 10 years without seeing his face.

Taken together, these opinions sound like a chorus of voices raised in a family argument.   Nevertheless, this is an important argument. As an increasingly multi-cultural country, we are asking ourselves, \\"Who are we?\\" and it is necessary that this discussion take place in our universities, just as in our political campaigns and law courts.   The rising minority voices say it is time that we learn much more about the race, ethnicity, religion, gender and class of other Americans, rather than rely on traditional attitudes. If we are to work together as a nation, we need to be on better terms with one another. At the State University of New York's Buffalo campus, where I teach in a new curriculum program (similar to those introduced at Michigan or Stanford), we have instituted a new one-semester course on American pluralism and the search for equality.   But we are more than the sum of our parts. We live in the cultural and historical reality that is America. No academic course that concentrates exclusively on subcultures -- black, Latino, Asian or European -- can satisfactorily explain who we are or what it means to be American. Ethnicity is only a segment of our common culture (and much of the noisy debate is academic turf war).    American culture (as opposed to demographic make-up) consists of our common values, our expectations, our daily conventions, our laws, our religiosity. It is a many-faceted ideal, built up through historical experience. If you have any doubt about this powerful common reality, spend some time living outside the United States and then come back.    Because our national culture is a historical phenomenon, we can best answer who we are as a society by studying how our culture developed out of the intellectual traditions of Western Europe. This is important because American college students tend to hold a narrow world view that is largely ahistorical and ethnocentric. For these reasons, SUNY at Buffalo is introducing a required curricular sequence, beginning with a two-semester course on world civilization.    To those who bewail the replacement of freshman Western civilization with world civilization, I say fear not. The nature of Western culture comes out all the more powerfully when it is seen in combination with the achievements of other peoples.   The problem in the campus debate on multiculturalism comes when we are told that we must choose between teaching Western civilization and multiculturalism. Those for eliminating the traditional Western civilization course assert that Western culture is only a political ideology conceived by European males. Those resisting multiculturalism argue Western culture is dominant because of its commitment to objective inquiry and social flexibility. Both views are correct. But no such choice is necessary, for we are the sum of our individual citizens and our collective culture.   No doubt the debate will go on","excerpt":"Plato and the Bible will remain relevant and compete successfully with other course readings. How can I be sure? Just look at the world around you.

Who Carl is we can only imagine, but can there be much doubt about what kind of memorial Ms. Vogel would like to sew for him? Her play is about an elementary-school teacher named Anna (Cherry Jones) who learns that her brother, a young San Francisco librarian named Carl (Richard Thompson), is terminally ill. Anna's response is to sweep her brother and herself into a fantasy world -- a crazy-quilt patchwork of hyperventilating language, erotic jokes, movie kitsch and medical nightmare -- that spins before the audience in Viennese waltz time, replete with a dying fall.    The result is a dizzying evening at several levels, and the fact that \\"The Baltimore Waltz\\" is performed without an intermission did not prevent several Circle Rep subscribers from walking out at a critics' preview.
