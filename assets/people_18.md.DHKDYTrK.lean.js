Sabena's chairman, Pierre Godfroid, disclosed that Sabena, which has been looking for a partner for eight years, had received separate proposals from British Airways P.L.C. and American Airlines. He said Sabena had also held talks with an airline in Southeast Asia.   Mr. Godfroid proposed to cut 2,200 jobs from Sabena's 11,000-member work force to help the company become profitable by 1992. The Belgian Government, which owns 53 percent of Sabena, is studying the plan.   Sabena also wants to scale back long-distance routes, ending flights to Montreal, Toronto, Atlanta and Singapore and possibly to Africa. It has already reduced to 7 its previous 11 weekly flights to New York.   Mr. Godfroid also outlined a recapitalization plan, developed with the help of the United States consulting firm of McKinsey & Company, that calls for writing off $533.3 million in debt owed to the Government.   Mr. Godfroid said at a news conference that any partner could take a 40 percent stake in Sabena, which would mean $266.7 million of fresh funds.   He said British Airways, his choice, had asked Sabena to postpone a decision until after the Persian Gulf war.

Even the choice of the word \\"web\\" wrongly equates public purpose with that of a spider.   Gerstner ignores two salient points. First, that several American states always have been strong regulators of business and vital policy crucibles. States always have had the option of setting higher environmental standards than the Federal Government, for example. Second, while Europe is moving toward more uniform standards and regulations, these will never exactly mirror those in the United States, Japan, Canada or anywhere else. There will continue to be wide differences in world marketplaces.   The most competitive companies thrive by being more flexible and more responsive to markets and customers. I.B.M. is only the latest company being forced to make that adjustment. As the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Commission on Industrial Productivity found in \\"Made in America: Regaining the Productive a study published last year, the adjustment involves shedding outdated mass-production and economies-of-scale strategies that Gerstner champions in his unified marketplace argument.
