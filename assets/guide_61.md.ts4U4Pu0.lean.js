ABC, giving Superman still another whirl in \\"Lois and Clark,\\" is going with a hunk in a red cape. Freighted with elaborate sets and special effects, the new productions are expensive and ambitious. They obviously relish the possibility of toppling Ms. Lansbury's sweet old Jessica Fletcher.    Seaquest DSV (it means deep submergence vehicle) is a futuristic submarine patrolling and exploring the world's waters in 2018. A consultant to the series, Dr. Robert Ballard, the oceanographer who found the sunken Titanic, insists that this is not science fiction, but that the show is predicting the future. The pragmatic Mr. Spielberg, still looking for a television hit after the disappointments of \\"Amazing Stories\\" and \\"Family Dog,\\" is more flexible.

For HBO, it was the combination of the television premiere of the hit movie \\"Ghost\\" and a new comedy series from Billy Crystal, \\"Sessions.\\" For PBS it was the first part of \\"Columbus and the Age of Discovery,\\" which scored the highest ratings for a public television series since \\"The Civil War\\" last September. Topped Almost Everybody    \\"Ghost\\" scored a gigantic 30.6 rating in homes that have the HBO service, and \\"Sessions\\" added a 15.5 rating, one of the highest ever for any series on the channel. HBO research said yesterday that the first episode of \\"Sessions\\" had a higher rating in HBO homes than every new series on the networks this year except two: \\"Home Improvement\\" and \\"Step by Step,\\" two new ABC comedies.   The 4.9 rating \\"Columbus\\" garnered on Sunday in the 25 largest television cities more than doubled the 2.1 ratings that PBS shows average in prime time.   The number for \\"Ghost\\" translates to about a 6 national rating, which was better than NBC did between 8 and 9 P.M. on Sunday with \\"Man of the People\\" and \\"Pacific Station,\\" which had 5.3 and 5.2 ratings respectively. HBO is available in 17.5 million homes","excerpt":"NBC is received in 92 million.   In other words, between 8 and 9 Sunday night, NBC was the fifth-rated network nationally, behind CBS, ABC, Fox and HBO. HBO Soars With 'Ghost' And Crystal"},{"year":"1982","title":"Which television network has the most promising new prime-time shows for the fall? If you believe a couple of advertising agencies that annually handicap the race, the answer is underdog NBC-TV.   Indeed, while the agencies -Ketchum Communications and Ted Bates - agree that NBC will remain in third place in the prime-time ratings, both also say that NBC will improve its standing at the expense of both CBS-TV and ABC-TV. As usual, the agencies predict that the overwhelming majority of the network's two dozen new series for the fall will fail.   Perhaps the most surprising prediction is the share of audience that will constitute a hit in 1982. A 30 share was considered the minimum for survival just three years ago, but Ketchum says that this fall a 25 share will be adequate, while Ted Bates puts the figure at 26 or 27. Overall, Ketchum expects the three networks to command just 77 percent of all viewers -a drop of 4 points since last season. Ted Bates predicts an 80 share, but either way the drift of audience away from the networks seems inexorable.

HALF IN LOVE: Stories, by Maile Meloy. (Scribner, $23.) Fourteen stories, set mostly in the author's native Montana, among small-time racetracks and failed oil wells, where brides choose wedding dresses to hide branding-iron scars; no one expects an easy life here, and even the young feel their choices constrained by economics and losing habits.    THE GATEKEEPER: A Memoir, by Terry Eagleton. (St. Martin's, $19.95.) Charming, gregarious, remarkably acute autobiographical observations by a top practitioner of literary theory (at Cambridge, then Oxford, now Manchester) who was born into Britain's Irish Catholic working class but earned his present eminent position, very high and way over on the left.    CAMOUFLAGE: Stories, by Murray Bail. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $20.) Fourteen stories by an Australian who invests his space in satire, not character; in one story people hold races on the partitions of their office cubicles, while in another a conceptual artist offers to document the existence of everyone alive.    THE HEART OF REDNESS, by Zakes Mda. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) A novel encompassing a black South African's critique of the cult of the new, presented as the combat between the forces of ''progress'' and those of tradition, all reflected from a defining religious schism in the Xhosa nation back in 1856-57.   And Bear In Mind"},{"year":"2002","title":"UNCLE TUNGSTEN: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood, by Oliver Sacks. (Vintage, $14.) This charming account of the author's early years, chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2001, both recreates a large extended family of brilliant and eccentric adults in Britain in the 1930's and 40's and also focuses on his own youthful fascination with chemistry (hence the nickname of Uncle Dave, a maker of light-bulb filaments who inspired Oliver). The result is a ''joyous, wistful, generous and tough-minded memoir,'' Natalie Angier wrote in these pages. ''Above all the book is about the light of the human mind.''    TIME'S FOOL: A Tale in Verse, by Glyn Maxwell. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.) The hero and narrator of this novel-length narrative by a British poet lives under a curse that prevents him from aging beyond 17. He is stuck in a seven-year loop, consigned to a solitary and empty existence while everything around him is transformed by time. In 2000 our reviewer, Langdon Hammer, called this ''a variation on the supernatural tales that attracted Coleridge in 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.' ''    FREE FLIGHT: Inventing the Future of Travel, by James Fallows. (PublicAffairs, $15.) A journalist makes the case that air travel, hobbled as it is by the blighted, bloated airline industry, can be made faster, cheaper and more efficient with the advent of small personal airplanes and a ''nationwide air taxi fleet'' of five-seat jets serving underused airports. ''Fallows argues with grace, passion and thorough reporting that we are at the dawn of a new era in aviation,'' James R. Gaines wrote here in 2001.    THE DEVIL'S LARDER, by Jim Crace. (Picador USA, $12.) In these 64 brief fictions -- teasing parables and parodies of knowingness, for the most part -- characters look and sound entirely plausible to themselves, while something more frantic, ridiculous and doomed is hovering nearby. Crace is ''a great writer of whimsical, fastidious, poetic prose'' who can make something as simple as the cooking of cheese seem ominous, Adam Phillips said in the Book Review last year.    WITTGENSTEIN'S POKER: The Story of a Ten-Minute Argument Between Two Great Philosophers, by David Edmonds and John Eidinow. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $13.95.) The sole face-off between Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper in 1946 in Cambridge, England, became the stuff of philosophical legend, complete with a brandished fireplace poker and heated pronouncements about morality and language. Last year our reviewer, Jim Holt, found this an ''enthralling reconstruction of the episode.''    CRESCENT AND STAR: Turkey Between Two Worlds, by Stephen Kinzer. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $14.) In his lively account of Turkey in the late 1990's, a correspondent for The Times examines the cultural identity crisis of a nation split between East and West, one that is 99 percent Muslim but whose best friend in the region is Israel. ''For painstaking advice as to what needs fixing in order for Turkey yet to become 'a light unto the nations,' 'Crescent and Star' cannot be beat,'' Fernanda Eberstadt said here last year.    I CANNOT TELL A LIE, EXACTLY: And Other Stories, by Mary Ladd Gavell. (Random House, $12.95.) The ambiguities of motherhood and the inevitable losses between mothers and children lie at the heart of these tales by Gavell, a polished author who was unpublished at the time of her death at 47 in 1967. Her ''frequently moving'' work features ''wives, mothers and daughters who know more than they say and subtly question the conventional surfaces of their lives with silent yet pointed observations,'' Stacey D'Erasmo wrote here in 2001.    CIVILIZATIONS: Culture, Ambition, and the Transformation of Nature, by Felipe Fern&#225","excerpt":"ndez-Armesto. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $16.) The author's radical proposition is that civilizations from tundra to tropics are shaped dramatically by the environments in which they spring up. Fern&#225;ndez-Armesto is ''an entertaining writer'' with ''original, occasionally brilliant insights,'' J. R. McNeill wrote in these pages last year.    THE DEARLY DEPARTED, by Elinor Lipman. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.) After her mother's mysterious death, this novel's heroine returns to her New Hampshire hometown, where she slips back into her former community and takes up with a man who may or may not be her half brother. The tale ''has the charm and economy'' of Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town,'' Maggie Galehouse wrote here in 2001.

He became El Duque, the pitcher who never loses a big game.    Now it's almost June, Hern&#225;ndez still does not have a victory this season and his legendary confidence seems shaken. Tonight the Indians hammered Hern&#225;ndez for six runs and nine hits, including three homers, in only four-plus innings, defeating the Yankees, 6-4.

(Random House, $13.95.) Crisp, suburban and antiseptic, the poems in this greatest hits collection by America's poet laureate are infused with his characteristic self-deprecating humor, even as death, longing and regret hover at the margins of his work. ''There are brainy, observant, spit-shined moments on almost every page,'' Dwight Garner said in the Book Review last year. ''Young writers have plenty to learn from his clarity and apparent ease.''    THE COLLECTED STORIES OF ISAAC BABEL. Edited by Nathalie Babel. (Norton, $16.95.) This compilation of short fiction, drawn from ''The Complete Works of Isaac Babel'' (2001), reveals the Russian writer's lifelong effort to fuse the Russian, the Jewish, the revolutionary and the literary, a synthesis that breathed life into his work even as it doomed him (he was shot on Stalin's orders in 1940). His tales ''have a consuming force,'' Jonathan Rosen wrote here. ''In Babel's stories, war and peace . . . have been crushed together to produce something new and terrible.''    AVA'S MAN, by Rick Bragg. (Vintage, $13.) The author, a national correspondent for The Times, follows up ''All Over but the Shoutin','' his 1997 memoir about his mother's struggle to raise a family by herself in rural Appalachia, with one about his maternal grandfather, a roofer, brawler and natural storyteller who lived a hard but proud life in the poor South. ''It is hard to think of a writer who reminds us more forcefully and wonderfully of what people and families are all about,'' Robert Morgan said here last year.    BING CROSBY: A Pocketful of Dreams. The Early Years, 1903-1940. By Gary Giddins. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $17.95.) The eminent jazz critic sets out to restore the fading reputation of a wildly successful crooner and recording artist who presented himself as a simple nice guy but who was actually enigmatic and often remote. ''Giddins has performed a great service in tracking Crosby's life and career so scrupulously,'' Robert Gottlieb said here last year. ''He's not only superb on the music, but he has lovingly considered the films of the 30's.''    HAUSSMANN, OR THE DISTINCTION, by Paul Lafarge. (Picador USA, $13.)

(Anchor, $14.) A novelist well versed in the lives of unsung working-class heroes explores the travails of Mixtec migrant laborers from the poor southern Mexican state of Oaxaca in this tale of an unlikely couple brought together and then torn apart by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. '' 'Highwire Moon' is an eye-opener of a novel, a road map to the real California,'' Suzanne Ruta said in these pages last year.    STUFFED: Adventures of a Restaurant Family, by Patricia Volk. (Vintage, $13.) Despite its title, this memoir by Volk (at right), an essayist, novelist and short-story writer, is less about restaurants (though food is never far from the narrative) than about her extended New York City family (her great-grandfather introduced pastrami to America). Last year our reviewer, Regina Schrambling, said ''Volk has a gift for seeing the world in a grain of salt.'' Foodies will also enjoy Serve It Forth (North Point/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $12), M. F. K. Fisher's first book, an opinionated tour of gastronomic affairs from ancient Egypt to modern times. ''It is erudite and witty and experienced and young,'' the Book Review said in 1937. Its ''pages are filled with odd fact and obscure fantasy, illuminating comment, personal reflection and remembrance.'' Rounding out the meal is The Passionate Epicure: La Vie et la Passion de Dodin-Bouffant, Gourmet, by Marcel Rouff (Modern Library, $11.95), a m&#233;lange of novel, cookbook and satire about a provincial master epicure dedicated to the pursuit of l'amour and the pleasures of the table. Though often funny, ''its theme -- the glorification of the senses -- is an extremely serious matter, like the fabulous menus and gastronomic perspectives it reveals,'' Lesley Blanch wrote in these pages in 1962.

There are men and women of the eighteenth century in powdered wigs, satin suits and voluminous silken gowns, flitting here and there amid charming backgrounds. The photography and tinting almost strikes one as being consistent with the story of Beaumarchais's indefatigable character, Figaro, who, while he is occasionally deceived himself, is marvelously successful in most of his adventures.This barber of Seville, the faithful Figaro, is astute enough to arrange the marriage of Count Almaviva to Rosine, the ward of Bartholo, a roguish old miser. The Count, sad to relate, turns out to be a philanderer, who when he hears that Figaro wishes to wed Suzanne, his wife's maid, disapproves of the match, unless Suzanne meet him at a trysting spot on the eve of the ceremony.Rosine and her maid are equal to the machinations of the Count. They arrange in a simple way that the Count shall think that he is embracing Suzanne, when it is Rosine who is in his arms. Figaro, however, is much perturbed when he perceives, as he supposes, Suzanne being kissed by the inconstant Count. Soon, however, he discovers that the figure he presumed to be his Suzanne, was Rosine and the veiled lady to whom he had bowed low, was none other than his own sweetheart.That is not the end of the matter, for the Count continues his attentions to other fair creatures, apparently not bothering whether his wife hears about his actions or not. And then Rosine has her own affair, with her page, a young man named Cherubin, who is summarily shifted out of the way by being sent to fight for his country.Most of the scenes take place in Agua-Frescas Palace, not far from Seville. Where the structure actually is, matters not, for it is a beautiful one with an artificial lake that serves as a swimming pool for pretty girls, a marvelous cascade, sloping lawns and wide flights of old stone steps.Arlette Marchal, who has been seen in several Hollywood films, impersonates the vivacious Rosine, and Marie Bell fills the rôle of Suzanne. Their performances are quite satisfactory. E. H. Van Duren does fairly well in the circumstances as Figaro, and Tony D'Algy makes an agreeable Count Almaviva.This production is followed by a rather funny, rowdy film, featuring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. It jerks one back from the eighteenth to the twentieth century. This pictorial affair is titled \\"Double Whoopee,\\" and it is not long before a dainty woman has her face smudged with ink, and an officer falls down an elevator shaft and his nicely fitting white uniform is covered with grease and mud. The audience, however, laughed freely, especially when a taxi driver aroused unwittingly the ire of a policeman. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Near Old Seville.

Major trading partners: exports: France, U.K., Italy; imports: France, Saudi Arabia, U.S. The Seychelles Islands were occupied by France in the 18th century and seized by Great Britain in 1794. They were administered along with Mauritius until 1903, when the Seychelles became a separate British colony. African and Indian workers were brought in to work in coconut and spice plantations and in guano mining. The present population is of mixed African, Indian, and European descent. In the post-World War II period, a home-rule government rejected independence as impracticable. At the urging of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations, the Seychelles declared independence on June 29, 1976. Its first president was ousted in a socialist coup in 1977 led by Prime Minister France Albert René. A new constitution, promulgated in March 1979, formalized one-party Socialist rule. In July 1992 a commission was elected to rewrite the constitution before the end of the year, but the delegates defeated the first results. Since independence, the economy of the Seychelles has become heavily dependent on the tourist industry, which accounts for 90 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings. Fishing accounts for 40 percent of exports. Seychelles"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: chain of 12 principal and some 60 smaller islands in Pacific Ocean, about 500 mi.

Formerly known as the New Hebrides, Vanuatu is a rugged, volcanic island chain with heavily forested mountains; peaks rise to over 6,000 feet (on Espiritu Santo, the largest island). The people are Melanesians. In 1887 the islands were placed under the administration of an Anglo-French naval commission, becoming a joint Anglo-French colony (condominium) in 1906. The islands escaped Japanese occupation during World War II; they sided with the Free French and were used as bases for Allied campaigns in the Pacific. The New Hebrides were granted independence as Vanuatu on July 30, 1980, with membership in the British Commonwealth. The government is a parliamentary system, complemented by a National Council of Chiefs to decide matters of tradition and customary law. The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, cattle raising, and fishing. Tourism is developing rapidly, and the sale of long-term tuna-fishing rights, principally to Japan, Australia, and the United States, is an important earner of foreign exchange.

In 1900 Germany relinquished to Great Britain its claim to the North Solomons, including Choiseul and Santa Isabel; Bougainville Island was retained by Germany (see “Papua New Guinea”). The major islands were occupied by Japan in 1942 and retaken by the Allies in a series of battles in 1943. The Solomon Islands were made self-governing in January 1976 and became an independent nation on July 7, 1978. The economy is based on subsistence agriculture and fishing. Some light manufacturing and craft industries have been established in recent years. Copra, cocoa, palm oil, and lumber are the principal exports. The sale of tuna fishing rights in the surrounding waters has given the nation a favorable balance of payments. In June 1999 ethnic violence erupted on Guadalcanal against settlers from the island of Malaita, with perhaps 2,000 fleeing over the next year. Then, in June 2000, gunmen from the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) placed the prime minister under house arrest and captured Honiara airport. On the eve of a parliamentary no-confidence vote, prime minister Ulufa'alu resigned June 14. On July 1 parliament elected opposition leader Mannasseh Sogavare to be prime minister. In 2001, a truce between militias brought no disarmament, but Sogavare used foreign aid to buy off the Eagle Force and other politicos. With Dec. 2001 elections, his rule was overturned, Sir Allen Kamekeza becoming prime minister after his People's Alliance won a majority in the legislature.

Latin American armies have earned an evil reputation in the 20th century by corrupting the soldier's traditional role of protector into that of oppressor. Panama, though never an exemplary democracy, came relatively late to this unhappy situation. In 1968, its colonels engineered a coup d'etat that placed one military leader or another in control for the next 21 years. R. M. Koster, an American who teaches English at Florida State University's Panama Canal branch, and Guillermo Sanchez, a Panamanian journalist and the premier columnist of the opposition newspaper La Prensa, have joined forces to write a scathing history of these two decades of humiliation and corruption that is full of enough scoundrels, fools and genuine heroes to stock an old-time melodrama -- Omar Torrijos, for example, whose blend of charisma and radical slogans charmed Fidel Castro, the domestic Communists and naive intellectuals like Graham Greene, while his moderate actions reassured the United States. The authors, however, see in Torrijos the roots of the disasters that followed his accidental death in 1981, disasters such as the ascent of Manuel Noriega, whose limitless greed resulted in Panama being turned into a narco-military state. Opponents like Hugo Spadafora, who threatened Noriega's control, were murdered, preferably through torture","excerpt":"nearly everyone else was bought off.
