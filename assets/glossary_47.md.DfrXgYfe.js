This Ufa talker which has just had its première at the Ufa Palast am Zoo will unquestionably be the most spectacular German production of the year. Huge sums go whirling through the air, some mention four million marks as the film's cost and the most conservative estimate is two millions.

All the more credit to the courage and enterprise of the Ufa in these dark and uncertain times. \\"The Congress Dances\\" will bear the German banner around the world.Of course, it would have been nice if the Ufa had seen its way to selecting a plot with a suggestion of originality. But we musn't be too severe with them","excerpt":"just recall the stories of \\"Noah's Ark\\" and \\"The Ten Commandments.\\" I know you won't be able to remember them in detail; but it will probably have stuck in your mind that they distracted you unnecessarily from really important matters like floods and earthquakes. Of course, it is easy enough to understand the producers' viewpoint: when they sink such enormous sums of money in one film they must be sure that there is nothing in it that anybody could take objection to, that there be nothing beyond the reach of a six-year-old child. It must be just the simple old love story, black and white must be the black and white that we are used to in Grimms' fairy tales and such mighty masterpieces of fluent mediocrity as \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" and \\"Les Miserables.\\" And that's the kind of a scenario \\"Der Kongress Tanzt\\" has.Always Gay.But to me the German epic has an advantage over its Hollywood relatives in that it is kept light and never for a moment takes itself seriously. The story flits along with the high merry rhythm of old Vienna, even the touch of tragedy at the end is skimmed with praiseworthy agility. The stress is always laid on the atmosphere. We are given the Austrian capital of the year 1815; a city of luxurious ease and pleasant, soft toned clamor is spread out before us. Beautiful women, waltzes and sparkling wine seem to be the only things that interest the inhabitants. Of course, as in all costume pieces, there is some politics, but here it never gets out of bounds, is about as impassioned as a game of chess. In short, it is the Vienna of the operetta. And it is not even the Viennese musical-comedy Vienna, for none of the leading players, neither Lilian Harvey nor Willi Fritsch nor Conrad Veidt, has the slightest suggestion of that charming Viennese accent which adds so much grace and delicacy to the Austrian speech. The whole production is filtered through the North German mentality.But it is, nevertheless, an exceptional film entertainment. The director, Erik Charell, is the Ziegfeld of the German musical comedy stage and in this, his first film, has gone about the \\"glorifying\\" business with a vengeance. There are gay torchlight processions, there are triumphal parades, there are elaborate receptions in stupendous halls, there is a Russian ballet in the opera house, there are tremendous ballrooms with hundreds whirling to the measures of the waltz. And, first and foremost, there is a very lovely sequence in which the heroine rides in an open carriage through Vienna and out into the country. This journey is accompanied by a Viennese folk song which the heroine is singing and which is taken up by various groups of people she passes: the market women, the soldiers, the workers, the washerwomen, and finally a group of children dancing on a lawn. It is a continuation of the tradition of revue-like musical entertainments which Charell has given at the Grosse Schauspielhaus, and these shows were the most successful theatrical enterprises of post-war Berlin. Last year they reached their culmination in \\"Zum weissen Rössl\\" (At the Sign of the White Horse) which is also the sensation of the London season and will soon be given in New York under Charell's direction. And, of course, the talker gives him still larger possibilities to spread his taste for the lavish and spectacular. \\"The Congress Dances\\" will bring his style to the provinces, for which it is perhaps even better suited than for the metropolis Berlin.Talented Players.And although the players whom Charell had at his disposal may not be Viennese in quality they are among the best which the German screen has to offer. Lilian Harvey in the rôle of a little salesgiri is as fragile and Puck-like as ever, Willi Fritsch brings his pleasing manliness to the rather colorless rôle of the young Russian Czar, Conrad Veldt is casual and yet completely convincing in the rôle of Metternich, the most creative statesman of his time; Lil Dagover brings a few moments of that pictorial elegance which is hers alone to the all too brief rôle of an intriguing Countess. And there seemed to be troops, battalions, regiments of exquisite girls in those lovely old Viennese costumes—where have they been hiding themselves all these years in Berlin?And the plot? This concerns itself with Christel, the owner of a small glove shop, and the young Czar Alexander of Russia. The royal youth has come to Vienna to attend the congress of 1815. Metternich, who does hot want Alexander to cross his plans, tries to keep him and other important personages away from the meetings by giving a ball at the same time and by getting them interested in specimens of Viennese femininity. Alexander has met Christel by chance and been greatly attracted by her, but he believes that she is being used by Metternich. And so, although he has placed a villa at her disposal, he does not ever go to see her there. But one night he sees her again at the ball and sneaks off to a wine garden with her, forgetting all about the congress, at which Napoleon's permanent banishment is being decided. But the news comes that Napoleon has escaped from Elba and Alexander has to hurry back to his native land. Poor little Christel is left sobbing behind. So the moral is: young ladies would do well not to fall in love with royal personages.\\"Der Brave Sünder.\\"The week also made us acquainted with \\"Der brave Sünder\\" (the upright sinner), another film which will take a worthy place in the history of the German screen. And yet its qualities are almost the exact opposite of those which distinguish the Charell film. It is not sumptuous, it is not charming, it is not even smooth—in fact, its direction is at times distinctly amateurish. But it is a film which combines the work of an excellent dramatist, a director who is also one of the finest of stage and screen players, and Max Pallenberg, the first German comedian, who here makes his début on the screen. If the picture had nothing more to its credit, than the winning of this player for the talker, it would have deserved a large and glittering medal. The thing that sets Pallenberg way off on a lonely pinnacle is that, although he is the most uproarious of Teutonic comedians, he is a great deal more than just a funny man. His humor is often almost belligerently knockabout, but the extraordinary thing is that he is equally at homo in rôles of quiet human depth—indeed, those are the parts in which I personally prefer him. I may forget his highpowered wise-cracking in Molnar's \\"One, Two, Three\\" but not his gentle idiocy in Hauptmann's \\"Schluck und Jau.\\" In a nutshell, Pallenberg is a great actor, as great as any of those who have flung the more showy rôle of tragic black around them.And, since the very early days of the silent picture, he has stayed away from the films. Then he saw himself on the screen and realized that he could only express a small part of his personality without the spoken word. But at last Fritz Kortner was able to persuade him to come to the talking screen under his direction. Kortner is himself one of Germany's representative players, is famous on the stage for his Hamlet, Richard III, &c., on the screen for numerous brilliantly conceived character rôles, among them Danton and Karamazov. However, being a man of exceptional intelligence; he has decided to extend his field to direction. \\"Der brave Sünder\\" is his first picture and, taking that in consideration, an extraordinary piece of work. There are many things in it that a cold-blooded routinier would have done considerably better, but then there are also many things which would have been away beyond the average film director's reach—and that is to me the more important point. He gave the whole film a very personal quality, lifted it into a half-fantastic sphere. This grotesque conception of reality, which was at the bottom of the triumphs of many German silents and which is to my mind the real strength of German dramatic genius, has been absent too long from the Teutonic screen.And the third in the combination is Alfred Polgar, well known as dramatist, essayist and ciltic. For the first time since the talker began we heard dialogue with feeling for literary style. His scenario is founded on a short story by the Russian Katayev, but goes its own way and is a distinct improvement over its source. Its leading figure, a bank cashier, is an absconder-in-spite-of-himself. He travels to Vienna to hand over a sum of money to the president of his bank. But he misses him and is made drunk in the restaurant where he is waiting for him. When he wakes up next morning he finds that a large part of the money is gone and he tries to make up the loss by gambling. He breaks the bank, but the crooks who are running the den get away with all the money before he can cash in his chips. He wanders out into the country and has decided on suicide. But at the last moment he sees a poster offering a reward for the arrest of the president of his bank, who has absconded with a sum of money ten times as large as that which he was to bring to him. And he also learns that the sum he won in the gambling house was paid to the president by the police, who had gotten it back from the crooks. He returns home to find that he has been made provisional president of the bank.That, I think you will agree, is not an everyday theme, but one which made high demands on the actor-author-director triumvirate. They came out with flying colors. And if they slough off a certain aroma of the stage which still hangs around them I will have to go on a quest for new superlatives to do justice to their next onslaught on camera and microphone.

A year ago you wrote about a tidbit of folk wisdom: a shot of gin added to the water in which paperwhites (Narcissus tazetta) are grown can keep their stems shorter and less likely to fall over. Is there any new information?    A. When addressed in this space last February, the gin tip elicited cautious support from Bill Miller, the director of the Flower Bulb Research Program at Cornell University. He said he could imagine how alcohol (ethanol) might promote short, sturdy stems if you added just the right amount, because it could interfere with water uptake. Flowers would not be affected but less water pressure on the stem cells would result in less cell-stretching, so stems would be shorter. But he said he doubted there could be a universal formula. ''I can guarantee you nobody's studied this,'' he added.      Now someone has. With the help of one of his horticulture students, Erin Finan, Dr. Miller started running experiments. Their results are at www.hort.cornell.edu/index.html. In brief, what they discovered is that stems will end up roughly a third shorter than normal if you take the following steps.     Start your bulbs in plain water. When roots have formed and the green shoot is 1 to 2 inches long, pour off the water and replace with a solution of 4 to 6 percent alcohol. If you are using 80 proof liquor (40 percent alcohol), that works out to one part gin (or the like) to 7 parts water.

Why do it with movies?''   One answer is that we do talk about some people that way and, if we don't, it's because most people aren't presented to us as finished works. Films are. They lay themselves open to analysis, and analysis involves a certain amount of dismantling - taking the parts out, examining them, testing them and grading them, as if they were the components of an engine.

Its 6,300 employees (out of 50,000 in New Jersey) make it the largest employer by far in Bernards, which has a population of about 17,000. A forerunner of the suburbanization of corporate America chronicled in Joel Garreau's 1991 book, \\"Edge City: Life on the New Frontier,\\" AT&T; moved its headquarters in 1984 from Manhattan to a 2.6-million-square-foot corporate campus built nine years earlier amid the rolling hills of the township's Basking Ridge section.

Gummy Bears are popular. Swedish Fish. Chocolate raisins are very popular. All the mixes we make up -- they're real popular, too. All the health mixes. People love their candies.\\n\\nQ. Do they eat them at their desks or take them home?\\n\\nA. Predominantly, I would say they eat 'em at their desk. They put 'em in their candy jars. Everybody says, 'Uh, oh, my candy jar's empty. Got to fill up my candy jar.' But for the people who let their kids know I'm here, they always have requests. \\"Ah, Thursday, the candy guy's here, I've got to get Gummy Bears,\\" \\"I've got to get chocolate raisins,\\" whatever it is.

They look forward to their candy as a pick-me-up, whatever it may be. They say: \\"I need something for my meeting.\\" \\"I need something to work late at night.\\" A lot of these people, I guess, have to work late and so they keep it in their desk drawer and it's something, you know, when the cafeteria's closed and there's no snacks. They can just open up this.\\n\\nQ. Has being here shown you that this place houses not just 4,000 AT&T; employees, but 4,000 individuals? \\n\\nA. Yeah. You know, it's all walks of life. You see all different people. I mean, one time I happened to see Bob Allen, or Mr. Allen -- he's the chairman. But he came down to buy candy once, and I was pretty shocked. It was a bag of candy, one for the secretaries, he told me. And he was just like any other guy. The people here are really nice. I mean, generally, they'll do anything to help you. Your maintenance people, your building people, service people, they'll do anything you need to straighten out the problem.\\n\\nQ. If someone said, \\"Oh, those AT&T; people, they're all just corporate clones!\\" would he be wrong? \\n\\nA. That's totally wrong.

He unsuccessfully challenged the conviction on direct appeal and state collateral proceedings in the Texas state courts, and in a Federal habeas petition. In February 1992, 10 years after his conviction he urged in a second Federal habeas petition that he was \\"actually innocent\\" of the murder for which he was sentenced to death, and that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and the 14th Amendment's guarantee of due process of law therefore forbid his execution. He supported this claim with affidavits tending to show that his now-dead brother, rather than he, had been the perpetrator of the crime. Petitioner urges us to hold that this showing of innocence entitles him to relief in this Federal habeas proceeding. We hold that it does not.                    . . .

Am I morally compelled to offer my life to fulfill the objectives of Operation Desert Shield? International leadership, as guided by President Bush, has made this difficult to answer.   If the objective is to insure that powerful nations cannot usurp the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of militarily weaker ones, with might alone serving as justification, the answer is yes. If it is to insure that the industrialized world can continue to run its motors at convenient costs, the answer is no.   Contradiction arises in considering these two possibilities in light of global circumstances. The relationship between China and Tibet shows a situation where it is internationally tolerable for a powerful nation to usurp the independence of a weaker one, even while committing confirmed human rights abuses. The Soviet Union's illegal occupation of the Baltic republics shows another such situation.   The world offers many examples of powerful governments forcing their wills on weaker nations. Though few so simply and indisputably constitute injustices as the cases of Kuwait, Tibet and the Baltic republics, all demand serious discussion.   My point is that if I am to offer my life to accomplish the goals of Operation Desert Shield, I need an assurance that the same conviction will be devoted to the correction of all situations where might has unjustly made right, and not just to the ones where there is an attractive economic interest.

A1    Bush Pitches Plan in S. Carolina  President Bush took his campaign to overhaul Social Security to the friendly territory of South Carolina, telling a joint session of the State Legislature that he was open to a range of ideas to fix the retirement program's long-term solvency problems.

The opinion, by Associate Justice John Paul Stevens, was joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor. Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun's dissenting opinion was joined by Associate Justices Thurgood Marshall, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and William H. Rehnquist.  Petitioners manufacture and sell home videotape recorders. Respondents own the copyrights on some of the television programs that are broadcast on the public airwaves. Some members of the general public use videotape recorders sold by petitioners to record some of these broadcasts, as well as a large number of other broadcasts.   The question presented is whether the sale of petitioners' copying equipment to the general public violates any of the rights conferred upon respondents by the Copyright Act.    Respondents commenced this copyright infringement action against petitioners in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in 1976. Respondents alleged that some individuals had used Betamax videotape recorders (VTR's) to record some of respondents' copyrighted works which had been exhibited on commercially sponsored television and contended that these individuals had thereby infringed respondents' copyrights.

Majnun goes into the desert and sings a song of desperation so powerful that its beauty spreads across the land. How to show this?
