Put simply, this is a lovely building - witty, relaxed, wise and comfortable. Within it are all sorts of lessons that are urgent today, at this moment of much rhetoric and little ideology, for it is a building whose design emerges not out of any dogma or theory but out of a brilliant compositional sense, a deep respect for architectural history and a subtle understanding of the way in which different kinds of buildings relate to each other.

The group hit hardest is the working poor, which had been aided under various welfare ''entitlement'' programs. Many people in this group no longer receive benefits under the following programs: Aid for Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, Medicaid, housing, reduced-price school lunches for children. This has occurred despite Budget Director David A. Stockman's original hope that the cuts would fall evenly on all groups in our society.\\n\\nPresident Reagan has believed for a long time that marginally poor people should be weaned from the welfare system. This is what all the talk about the ''safety net'' and the ''truly needy'' boils down to.  Mr. Reagan's philosophy is that only truly needy people who cannot work should be exposed to the welfare system. If those who can work are exposed to welfare, it is feared that they will be drawn into the system and trapped by it. Whether this theory is right or wrong, the remarkable thing that happened in 1981 is that this Presidential philosophy was enacted into law. Welfare programs have been fundamentally changed. AFTER RESEARCHING EARLY REAGANOMICS: BAD NEWS FOR THE POOR","excerpt":"PRINCETON, N.J. - Will Rogers once said, \\"Things will get better despite our efforts to improve them.'' As a former United States official who in the 1970's worked on ways to reform welfare programs, I always thought that there was a lot of embarrassing truth in this remark and that it was aimed at Government reformers like me. But I'm not so sure now that I believe that things will get better for the poor.

Both are more closely related to the genus skin flick than to the austere practices of the American Nurses Association or original research in the medical sciences.In either case, the skin flick affliction is very mild and the possibility of contagion is slight. These seemingly serious dramatizations of the tribulations of their young men and women in white, filmed in fine color, only prove that the practitioners appear to have as many woes as their patients.\\"The Student Nurses,\\" four of them to be exact, are as quick on romance as they are on stuy.

Wednesday and at 10 A.M. Thursday. At each session, food will be served, and elegant table settings will be exhibited.

Today's concert costs $5 and includes admission to the museum. The other programs are free with the museum admission fee, which is $3, or $2 for students and the elderly and free for children under 12. All programs will begin at 4 P.M.   Macculloch Hall is at 45 Macculloch Avenue and is open from 1 to 4 P.M. on Sunday and Thursday.   Information: (201) 538-2404.  'ELECTRIC SERVANTS'    Labor-saving devices for the home have played an important role in women's history, so this month the Edison National Historic Site in West Orange will feature \\"Electric Servants.\\"    The kitchen and other work areas usually closed to the public will be open during tours of Glenmont, the home of Thomas Edison and his family, for the exhibition of early electrical household appliances.    Siphonators, which were combination coffee makers and hot water dispensers for making tea, were among the Edicraft products marketed in the late 1920's by Edison. Examples of the Edicraft products, also including toasters, waffle irons and sandwich grills, will be on display.   The \\"Electric Servant\\" program will be offered from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. Wednesday through Sunday until April 3. Tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis for this tour.    Visitor passes for Glenmont and the laboratory complex are $2 at the Edison Laboratory Visitors Center, Main Street and Lakeside Avenue. Admission is free for those under 17. The center is open from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily, and laboratory tours are conducted from 10:30 A.M. to 3:30 P.M.    Information: (201) 736-0550. ON COLLEGE SPEAKERS    Bernard Weinstein, a professor of English at Kean College in Union, where a recent speech by Khalid Abdul Muhammad stirred racial and religious controversy, will speak next Sunday in Bergenfield on the topic \\"The College Campus: A New Source of Anti-Semitism?\\"    Dr. Weinstein is an active participant in the Holocaust studies program at Kean. He will speak at a breakfast-lecture at 10 A.M. at the Bergenfield-Dumont Jewish Center, 169 North Washington Avenue. Admission is free.    Rabbi Jerome H. Blass, spiritual leader of the center, said, \\"Dr. Weinstein's talk will deal with the tendency of college students to invite to their campuses speakers who preach hatred and divisiveness toward Jews and other groups or who insist that the Holocaust never happened.\\"    When Mr. Muhammad spoke at Kean College in November, he was the senior spokesman for Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam. The subsequent publication of Mr. Muhammad's remarks against Jews, Catholics and homosexuals resulted in national attention and Mr. Muhammad's demotion.    Information: (201) 384-3911. MAGIC SHOW    A magician, Ron Owens, will apply his characteristic humor to a show on \\"Magic and the Environment\\" on Saturday at the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission Environment Center in Lyndhurst.    People of all ages may enjoy a laugh while learning about good environmental habits, but children 4 to 8 years old are expected to find the show particularly entertaining.   Mr. Owens is a familiar figure on New Jersey stages and has also appeared in Vienna and on Japanese educational television.    Preregistration is required for attending the show, which is open to both organized groups and individuals. Admission is $4.    The show will be from 11 A.M. to noon at the Environment Center, 1 DeKorte Park Plaza. It is accessible from Route 3 or Route 17.    Information: (201) 460-8300. MARY L. EMBLEN STAGE SOLOS    Of the numerous solo performers whose virtuosity has commanded a mostly bare stage in New York this season, Irene Worth and Spalding Gray are among the best known. The McCarter Theater in Princeton will be presenting each, if only for a single performance.   In the midst of what appears to be an Edith Wharton renaissance, Ms. Worth, who last year celebrated the 50th anniversary of her stage debut, is offering a reading -- her word is recital -- from the author's novels, including \\"Ethan Frome\\" and the 1933 autobiography, \\"A Backward Glance.\\"   Ms. Worth's \\"Portrait of Edith Wharton,\\" which she has described as \\"an old-fashioned Victorian evening,\\" is on tap tomorrow night at 8. It includes observations on New York's frivolous society, conversations with Henry James, memories of a first prepubescent kiss and sexual fulfillment at 45, but mostly, it is about the joy of writing.   Today from 5 to 7 P.M., Ms. Worth is also to discuss, with Arif Mardin, a composer, their new recording, \\"Her Infinite Variety -- Irene Worth as the Women of Shakespeare,\\" with a question and answer period afterward. The appearance, which is free, will be at the Betts Auditorium at Princeton University's School of Architecture at the corner of Prospect Avenue and Washington Road.   Audiences will have to wait until June 9 to hear Mr. Gray, in \\"Gray's Anatomy,\\" tell of his quest for a risk-free cure for an eye ailment: a \\"macular pucker.\\" Among the alternative medical practitioners he visited, he says, are a witch doctor in Borneo, a Filipino psychic surgeon and a quack in New Jersey.   The monologuist's Princeton appearance is to take place during the first week of his return engagement at the Mitzi E. Newhouse in Lincoln Center, where \\"Gray's Anatomy\\" played two performances a week for seven weeks earlier this season.   Tickets cost $17 to $22 for Mr. Gray and $18 to $22 for Ms. Worth, or, only for the Worth performance, $10 for students with ID. Reservations: (609) 683-8000. No tickets are required for Ms. Worth's appearance today.

Faced by such responsibilities, Mr. Mitchell and the rest of the cast can hardly be blamed for not having a perfect score when the shooting is finished. For this film, which makes an honest attempt to portray its characters reasonably and admirably expounds its crime-does-not-pay theme, is, nevertheless, slowly-paced and uneven entertainment laboring under an occasionally over-imaginative plot.As the judge who becomes the tough, penitentiary warden and thereby brings his son and daughter under the influence of the inmates, Thomas Mitchell's portrayal is restrained and impressive. If he finds himself in the unique position of literally being his son's keeper and the principal in a tense gun duel of an attempted jailbreak, the blame lies logically in the script and not his performance. Edward Ryan is convincing as his 'teenaged, delinquent boy, who, as a prisoner, vindicates himself by dying manfully to save his father.
