Secretary Bennett and your Sept. 27 editorial focused on the issue of ''a common language,'' criticizing extended instruction in the native language because it supposedly impedes progress in English.   A further issue that should not be ignored in evaluating bilingual education, though, is that of the educational achievement of non-English-speaking children. Are these children learning to read, to write, to understand math, science and social studies in any language at all?

Smith began teaching his \\"Black Politics\\" course at San Francisco State University last fall, he probably had no idea it would evolve into a lab course. But the course quickly became an issue of academic politics among black students and faculty members. The chairman of the black studies department, Oba T'Shaka, accused the university of trying to undermine his department by putting Dr. Smith's course under the aegis of the political science department. Professor T'Shaka argued that Professor Smith's course substantially duplicated a course that had been taught in the black studies department for 19 years, and some student protesters urged a boycott of the Smith class. But Dr. Smith argued that black politics courses should be part of every political science program. As the semester ended last month, each side could claim a victory of sorts. The course was still there but its enrollment had dwindled from 45 students, 35 of them black, to 5 students, all of them white.

And then came the details of his divorce, a rather lurid case that involved accusations of adultery and lavish spending on his mistress.   Judging from the polls, which show Mr. Romer now leading Mr. Benson by a wide margin, there are worse things than being an incumbent after all.

If word got out about the town's terrific bus drivers, the regulars would be standing in the aisles. And Ms. Simon's sister, Beth, the most fanatic of regulars, would be among them. In her book, Ms. Simon describes Beth (near right, with Ms. Simon) as ''a person with mental retardation.'' She now prefers ''with a developmental or cognitive disability,'' she said, although Beth likes ''a person with special needs'' -- one of them being the freedom to bus-hop around her city for most of the day. Like the book, the film, shown at 9 on CBS, is about the year Ms. Simon decided to enter her sister's world on wheels, but includes flashbacks to their childhood. During her time en route, Ms. Simon discovered the kindness of strangers (there are 12 bus drivers in her book, reduced to two composites in the movie), as well as the special abilities of the sister she had worried too much about for 38 years. ''I've inadvertently become a national speaker for both the disability community and the public transit industry, and I meet bus drivers all around the country,'' she said. ''They're a type of person that is well represented by the people in the movie -- very giving people, sensitive people, people people.'' It was at the house of one of Beth's bus-driving buddies that Ms. Simon and her sister first watched the film, which stars Andie MacDowell as a dewy-eyed Rachel and Rosie O'Donnell as a bouncy, beat-you-to-the-bus-door Beth. ''What Rosie got,'' Ms. Simon said, ''was exactly what she wanted to get: a character who is being portrayed not as a stereotype but as a full person -- someone who isn't going to be pushed around.'' Not even to the film's Los Angeles premiere. ''Oh, yeah, she knows what she wants,'' Ms. Simon said of the real Beth. ''She doesn't want to be on an airplane. And what's the fun of sitting in a movie theater with movie stars if you can sit on a bus with your favorite driver?''

The construction, maintenance and use of either is different and we do not believe that the one can be made into the other. Can the swimming pool be taken out and a smaller garden pool put in its place? There are many nurseries and books available for details on the construction, plants to grow and upkeep of garden pools. Humidity     Q.    Are there any house plants which affect humidity in the environment, either raise or lower it? S.S., Pawling, N.Y.     A. No. House plants need humidity and lack of it is one of the reasons why house plants fail to thrive. Most homes are dry and often there is need to plug in electric humidifiers especially where many plants are grown. This question may have been spawned by recent research done for NASA by a now-retired environmental engineer who reported that certain plants remove some pollutants from a room. However, the research did not include any studies on humidity. Plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air and with the aid of sunlight manufacture oxygen, which is released through plant pores called somata. Gardenia     Q.    When and how often should a gardenia plant be fed? I bought it at Easter and it was blooming, but it has not bloomed since. I keep it moist, in a bright not sunny location with a night temperature around 65 degrees. H.F.K., State College, Pa.     A. A gardenia plant is not ever-blooming. If it flowered for the Easter season and if it is well taken care of for the rest of the year, it should bloom again at Easter time. This is the cycle that has been established. Fertilizer is not the answer; too much fertilizer often results in soil contamination, root burn and stimulation of leaf growth and sacrifice of bloom. Gardenia is not the easiest plant to grow. It thrives in a humid, sunny, cool atmosphere and requires acid soil. Most house plants are going into a rest period now and need little stimulation. Keep the gardenia cool -- 60 degrees at night is fine -- and keep the soil moist. Acid-type fertilizer can be applied in late winter to support the formation of flower buds and new growth. Mealybugs/Jade Plant    Q.    I have two large jade plants that are taken outdoors every summer. They were infested with mealybugs but I got rid of them with a hose. But now that the plants are indoors again, I find one of them is infested again. The jade plant is too large to swab each mealybug with rubbing alcohol. What can we do? A.K., Williamsville, N.Y.     A. Touching individual mealybugs with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol is an onerous task indeed, but truly the best way to get rid of the insects. The deed will have to be repeated every few days to control unseen mealybugs, nymphs and hatchlings. If the mealybugs are not destroyed, the sticky sap they exude will ruin floors and carpets underneath the plants. Household sprays might be used as an alternative but check the label carefully as jade plants are susceptible to injury by certain spray ingredients.

After seeing the first half of the double bill, \\"The Phantom Fiend,\\" we were inclined to share the management's surprise over the \\"hit.\\" Unfortunately, one's enthusiasm is tempered by the follow-up, \\"Behind the Green Lights,\\" which cannot by any stretch of critical charity be called a smash.The tabloid sound of the title \\"The Phantom Fiend\\" is discouraging, but you are advised to pluck up your courage when it is explained that this British-made horror film is based upon Mrs. Belloc Lowndes's novel, \\"The Lodger.\\" For sheer, cold-blooded, suspenseful and spine-chilling melodrama, nothing like it has been seen since the German picture \\"M\\" was shown here about a year ago.A somber foreigner takes lodgings with a lower middle class London family. Soon the city is terrified by a series of woman-murders committed by a homicidal maniac whom the headlines call \\"The Avenger.\\" In a series of shadowed scenes, curtained with fog and brooding over the dark tragedy of insanity, the conviction is borne to the audience that this mysterious lodger is the murderer. When the light-hearted daughter of the landlady falls in love with the man and he, apparently, with her and when they have rendezvous in the fog, the audience finds itself in a breathless state of suspenseful fear comparable to that it might experience at the sight of a child petting a man-eating tiger. The climax is as surprising as it is grisly.Ivor Novello contributes a gripping performance as the lodger, holding to the last the audience's interest in the strange character he portrays. Elizabeth Allan, A. W. Bascomb, Barbara Everest and Jack Hawkins are individually splendid. The direction and photography contribute immeasurably to the macabre quality of the picture. One word of warning","excerpt":"leave the youngsters and impressionables at home.\\"Behind the Green Lights\\" can be dismissed from the mind more easily. Its title is that of the autobiography of former Captain Cornelius W. Willemse, known to the city's Police Department as the Gang Buster for his successful work in a twenty-five year police career. The picture, however, has just borrowed the title of Captain Willemse's book, not its contents; or, if it has, it has taken but a few incidents, built a routine screen play about them and let it go at that.As it stands now, the film is the commonplace tale of the veteran police lieutenant's daughter, who works for an unscrupulous criminal lawyer and soon adopts his trade practices. One of the men whose acquittal she obtains through legal trickery later shoots her father during a robbery. Thereby convinced of her mistake, she helps a young detective to capture the criminal and expose the shyster. The cast, headed by Norman Poster, Judith Allen, Sidney Blackmer, Purnell Pratt and Theodore Von Eltz, do their best, but the picture cannot rise above its story.

Now, 16 years later, the Court, in New Jersey v. T.L.O. (student's initials), informs teachers and students that their rights are, upon entry into school, altered, transformed and diluted. This decision is to be regretted and deplored. It represents a departure from the Court's own efforts to accord maximum protection for the rights of students and is yet another clear indicator of the Burger Court's understanding, or misunderstanding, of the Bill of Rights.    Your editorial (''Searching Students,'' Jan. 18), welcoming the increased authority conferred upon school officials by this decision, is based on a clear misreading of the New Jersey case and the direction of the Burger Court.
