Reports trickling across this desk from various sources--returned ...   GOSSIP OF THE RIALTO","excerpt":"Here and Elsewhere the Theatre Feels the Pinch of Economic Uncertainty"},{"year":"1921","title":"IT is an exceptional week when everything in the regular motion picture houses worth special mention cannot be covered on Sunday and reviewed in the Monday morning paper. Not infrequently there is insufficient material for one respectable review. So it is a pleasure to report that last week was an exception. Charlie Chaplin's latest comedy. \\"The Idle Class,\\" at the Strand, and that unusually encouraging work. \\"The Beggar Maid,\\" at the Rivoli, took all of the available time and space at the beginning of the week, and crowded out the Urban-Ditmars contribution. \\"The Four Seasons,\\" which was at the Rialto. But this production cannot go unnoticed. It is one of the worth-while works of the year.Neither the name of the picture nor a routine description of it is exciting. \\"The Four Seasons\\"? Sure, Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, they are what the year is divided into, but what of that? The progress of the year as shown through animal and plant life? Oh. yes, nature stuff—budding flowers and baby animals for Spring, flowers in full bloom and busy bugs for Summer, falling leaves and animals hunting holes in the ground for Autumn, and nothing much but snow and ice for Winter—the kind of stuff the teacher talks about in the schoolroom and tells the children they ought to be interested in while she knows they won't be.But \\"The Four Seasons\\" is not that ???cort of picture. It's entertaining. People sitting near the writer when he saw it read the titles out loud as sedu???ly and gushed over the cute young things as effusively as they ever did during the showing of a deliberately popular photoplay. \\"Even such people were interested. And the others, those who go to the theatre to be entertained but seldom are, because flubdub and ???doodle weary them, found themselves following the four seasons with ascending interest.This, then, is the conspicuous achievement of Dr. Ditmars and Mr. Urban. They have made their \\"educational\\" film interesting, undoubtedly more interesting to some than to others, as anything must be, but surely tedious to no one. They have accomplished this by a skillful selection of subjects and their arrangement with regard to dramatic continuity. Thus, a deer is shown in the Spring with his antlers falling off, and it is explained why he loses them. This is a phenomenon not generally known and it arouses interest. Then, in the Summer pictures, the same deer is shown with his new antlers at an early stage of development, small, and covered with an apparently spongy substance. The spectator becomes interested in these new antlers. He knows he is going to see them grow and he wonders when they will be full-grown. In the Autumn scenes he sees them becoming larger and larger and finally shedding their moss-like covering, and when, at last, he sees the proud buck in Winter with his towering antlers complete he senses a dramatic climax. He wants to cheer for the success of those antlers. They have been the hero of a tale.And so, in following the growth of other animals through the year, in depicting their seasonal activities, and in illustrating the changes which trees and plants undergo, continuity is maintained. But there would be a loss of interest through too confident anticipation if each reel included only the subjects of its predecessor, so something new is introduced into each season to freshen the interest. Furthermore, with some departure, perhaps, from the strictly pedagogic point of view, but greatly to the enrichment of the film as entertainment, the makers of the picture have selected subjects which??? by their novelty, oddity and beauty, may be counted upon to have a popular appeal. Also, the photography of the picture is satisfactory, for the most part, though in this particular there is room for improvement. As it stands, however, the picture is an extremely interesting and refreshing work, which, incidentally, administers education painlessly.AND now an additional word may be said about the Rivoli's important offering last week, \\"The Beggar Maid,\\" which, by the way, is to go into the Rialto for another week, beginning today. This picture represents one of the most inspiriting experiments that has been made for a long time. As has been reported, it is the first of a series of two-reel motion pictures based on, or built around, masterpieces of painting, the idea of the producers being to surround each painting with a true story or legend that shall popularize it and at the same time exemplify beauty on the screen. It is said that some of the distinguished artists and art patrons who endorse the idea are especially interested in popularizing great paintings, while others are chiefly intent on beautifying the screen, but the two purposes go well together—and anyhow it's the picture that counts not any one's inte???tions.So those interested must turn ??? \\"The Beggar Maid,\\" and see what h??? been done. The present writer conside??? the picture an important achievement??? is a charming thing in itself and pror???ises a real advancement in cinematography. It is not perfect. Its story is t???o sentimentally unreal for the taste ???some, and it could be more cinematographic, and less logographic, in ??? form. But in story and form it is f??? ahead of the average photoplay, and ??? one particular at least it is so exce???tionally good that it is almost unique??? has the rare quality of dramatic an pictorial unity.It is practically impossible for an??? director to make each separate fra??? of a motion picture pleasing to the ??? in itself. The necessities of dramat??? composition compel some sacrifice ??? pictorial composition. The story r???equires its players to move in a certai??? manner in certain surroundings and th??? means that scenes must sometimes b??? photographed when they are unbalance??? or badly composed in some, other r???spect. But if the motion in such scene??? is continuous, and the story is likewis??? continuously moving, the spectator ??? always in the act of going, visually an??? emotionally, from one scene to the nex??? and is not stopped by an impression ??? pictorial ugliness, unless the eye is vio???lently offended.Also there is a composition of objects in motion as well as of objects at rest, and it is therefore possible for a director to make a moving picture pleasing to the eye which would not be pleasing if its motion were arrested at any given moment. So the competent director can virtually achieve dramatic and pictorial unity in those parts of his picture in which his story is moving, that is, approaching its minor and major crises. But then the crises themselves must be taken care of. They are the moments when the story becomes most intense and seems to stand still for a brief, but appreciable, time. And the pictures stand still, too. It is then that they strike the eye most strongly as pictures. In such a moment if the scene offends the eye the crisis is weakened. The spectator's impression of ugliness detracts from the effect of the story. So it is especially incumbent upon a director to maintain pictorial and dramatic unity in his crises. As his story approaches a critical point the moving pictures through which it is told should approach perfection of composition, so that, when the crisis is reached, the scene in which it occurs may be pictorially complete.This is where Lejaren ???a Hiller and Herbert Blaché, the directors of \\"The Beggar Maid,\\" are most satisfactory. Their picture gives a decidedly enjoyable impression of pictorial and dramatic unity. Its story moves through scenes that never offend and often delight the eye, and invariably comes to its crises in pictures of finished composition.THOMAS H. INCE, who made the recently revised version of \\"The Three Musketeers,\\" originally issued as \\"D'Artagnan,\\" writes to protest against the revival of the picture at this time to compete with the new Douglas Fairbanks adaptation of Dumas' story. The old picture passed from his control years ago, he says.???Mr. Ince refers to the Fairbanks work as a \\"splendid achievement,\\" and then, with all justice, adds the following:???\\"However, for the benefit of reviewers who are making comparisons of the productions, I will say that the original picture was an honest, painstaking production utilizing all the limited resources available at that time and costing about $15,000, as I remember. In the nature of things my pioneering efforts are not to be compared with the modern Fairbanks production, which I understand cost about a million dollars.\\"The present writer, who found the old \\"Musketeers\\" crude and tame, can easily imagine that, in its day, it deserved high rank as screen entertainment.

Late TV Listings"},{"year":"1921","title":"THERE'S some delicious satire in the latest John Emerson-Anita Loos work, \\"Woman's Place,\\" which was at the Strand last week. Many of its scenes, and especially those which wind up its story, are just the usual movie stuff brightened by good acting and directing, but not essentially different from the thousands of other photoplays made according to the hero-heroine-happy-marriage formula. The impression given, however, is that Mr. Emerson and Miss Loos used this old material only to make their production seem like a regular photoplay to those who are too bewildered by anything unconventional to enjoy it. Their real purpose, surely, was to satirize politics and politicians (including the politics of the Actors Equity?), and this they have done for the delectation of all those who purposely do not vote and those who vote as a matter of habit or protest rather than in the belief that the next election will bring the millennium, if only the right party wins.The moral of the tale seems to be that woman's place is in politics because she is just as brainless as man is. The heroine of the story is nominated by women to run for the Mayoralty because she's young and good looking and socially preferred. When the henchmen of the male boss against whom the heroine is campaigning try to reassure him by pointing out that the women have shown a lack of political astuteness in selecting such a brainless candidate, he points to their own candidate and says that they have done the same thing. And the indications of the story are that the voters of both sexes turn out in force to shout and ballot for the rival candidates in all earnestness. The man is elected because the women voters don't like the heroine's influence on their husbands.And so it goes, with many bright side plays in pictures and subtitles. (The present writer always wishes there were more pictures and fewer words in the Emerson-Loos productions, but the pictures are usually so good and the words ???aptly chosen that there is no tedious verbosity, at any rate. After all, the thing most to be dreaded on the screen is dullness, and the Emerson-Loos comedies are seldom dull.)\\"While Mr. Emerson and Miss Loos, and also Victor Fleming, who directed the production, are chiefly responsible for the brightness of the photoplay, their wit would have been flattened by stupid acting. So it is fortunate that the cast is equal to the occasion. The burden of the work falls on Constance Talmadge, and her complete success in the heroine's rôle is indicated by the report that she makes the burden seem light. Miss Talmadge's gayety and expressiveness on the screen, already well known, will be better known when \\"Woman's Place\\" has gone the rounds.Another member of the cast whose rôle is essential to the comedy and who does more than is essential with it is Hassard Short. Mr. Short Is a real pantomimist. He does a silly-ass part in \\"Woman's Place,\\" and this is one of the characterizations peculiarly his own, but he can do other things, too. Remember him as the French apache in \\"The Stronger Vow\\"? The only trouble with him is that he is not seen often enough. He is said to be a pretty busy man, but can't he take a little more time for pictures? He is needed in them.SCENES from photoplays which show the various uses of the iris, the fade-in and fade-out, double exposure, the dissolve, the close-up, the semiclose-up, the long shot, the panoram and other cinematographic devices and expedients have been incorporated in a film to be used for purposes of instruction in Mrs. Frances Taylor Patterson's classes in cinema composition at Columbia University. Pictures of studio interiors, directors at work and laboratory methods are also included, as well as identical strips of positive and negative film.This is interesting. In the first place, it is quite appropriate that the screen should be used for the instruction of students of the screen. Educational Pictures for pictorial education seem the right thing.Also it is an excellent sign that the students at Columbia are studying the actual idioms of the motion picture language. The iris, double exposure, the dissolve, the close-up and the like are essentially cinematographic. They give peculiar expressiveness to motion pictures. Their abuse is frequent and fearful, of course, but their imaginative use gives the screen an individuality and capacity which it cannot approach without them. To compose a photoplay that has any character of its own, a person must think in terms of moving pictures, and to think in terms of moving pictures a person must have easy command of these pictorial idioms. So it is encouraging to learn that the students at Columbia are studying cinema composition with the aid of this graphic film, which, incidentally, the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation has prepared for them.RECENT Swedish films, it is reported, are finding favor in London and elsewhere. Alder Anderson, in The Daily Telegraph, refers to those he has seen as \\"remarkable\\" for their \\"simple grandeur\\" and naturalness. \\"Compared to the average American, or even the average British, film,\\" he says, \\"these Swedish productions must cost a mere trifle, yet they are everywhere winning their way right into the heart of the world public.\\" He mentions particularly a photoplay entitled \\"Let No Man Put Asunder,\\" adapted from Strindberg's story, \\"Higher Aims,\\" as a current example of good workmanship.This is encouragiug. The screen is international. More readily than stage plays or books, photoplays are sent around the world, and this means that people everywhere may enjoy the best things done anywhere. It also means that the picture makers of each country are stimulated to their best efforts and are taught to make better efforts by the competition of pictures made in other countries. Could anything be better for the screen and for those who want to enjoy it?Of course, if any country chooses to deny itself the benefit of foreign pictures by adopting a prohibitive tariff, the screen cannot be blamed. But the hope is that the proposed American tariff will not become a law, and that these new Swedish films, along with the French, Italian, German and English productions, will come to the United States for the pleasure and profit of all those who want to see and make good pictures.Sweden has not sent many pictures to this country, but some may remember a photoplay called \\"The Girl from the Marsh Croft,\\" which was shown in 1919, and another entitled \\"A Man There Was,\\" which reached Broadway in 1920. The first of these was well above the average American production. It was a sincere and lucid treatment of a humanly dramatic story. The other, while marred by absurd subtitles in doggerel, and not as cohesive as it might have been, nevertheless had a distinct quality of its own. A number of its scenes were strikingly effective as moving pictures.So it appears that they can make excellent photoplays in Sweden. The reports from London are not surprising. Therefore let the Swedish pictures be brought to the screens of Broadway and the other Main Streets of the country.

SCREEN","excerpt":"HERE AND THERE"},{"year":"1922","title":"THE Young Painter,\\" the third of the Triart productions based on famous paintings, which was at the Rialto Theatre last week, has the fine composition and effective photography of its predecessors in the series, \\"The Beggar Maid\\" and \\"The Bashful Suitor,\\" and in some respects goes ahead of them. Its scenes, as a rule, are more expressive and there's more body to its story. It seems more a motion picture existing for its own sake and less the instrument of a plan for popularizing great paintings. It achieves this character, to be sure, by some sacrifice of continuity and of the atmosphere provided by the costumes of another day, put it gains so much in photodramatic strength that the net result is an improvement.The story begins with what is really a prologue, set in the time of Rembrandt, in which the circumstances under which he might have painted \\"The Young Painter\\" are suggested, and then, rather abruptly, the scene changes to Long Island and today, with a young artist working under the inspiration of the Rembrandt painting as its central figure. From then on the story moves smoothly, with legitimate touches of comedy and an ascending' dramatic interest, coming simply and sincerely to its pathetic, and yet only genuinely happy, ending. The acting is superior to that of \\"The Beggar Maid\\" and \\"The Bashful Suitor.\\" Mary Astor, who appeared in the first of these productions, has developed noticeably. She not only looks her part, but makes her character mean something. And Pierre Gendron, too, wins the healthy sympathy without the sentimentality his-rôle calls for. Furthermore, Herbert Blaché, the dramatic director of the picture, has employed the camera to put meaning as well as beauty into his scenes, with the result that they have a vitality no merely beautiful motion picture can acquire. But nothing of the true beauty of restraint and harmony in feelingly photographed settings has been sacrificed, for which, presumably, chief credit should go to Lejaren à Hiller, the art, director of the film.In Defense of the Ushers.THE ex-usher whose confession of brigandage, originally printed in The Film Daily, was reprinted in this department last Sunday, is vigorously and indignantly attacked in communications from S.

To support this statement, he adds that\\" any patron who will report a specific case of dishonesty or graft\\" at the theatre under his jurisdiction\\" will find his satisfaction complete and immediate.\\"Mr. Rothafel then explains that the Capitol staff \\"is handled on the honor system,\\" that \\"the boys are given every incentive to be industrious, conscientious and courteous,\\" that \\"so-called 'wise guys' who know how to side-step the rules\\" are not employed, and that \\"esprit de corps\\" and \\"institutional pride\\" are established among the ushers by \\"frequent salary increases and promotions in rank,\\" monthly bonuses for meritorious service, physical instruction, military drill, personal inspections and institutional talks, &c.Speaking for ushers and the theatres in general, Mr. Lustgarten says that, while \\"there is an element in every theatre that must of necessity be controlled,\\" he can testify that the majority of ushers are \\"sincere in their desire to please.\\" They are justified, he thinks, in accepting tips, because \\"their salaries are insufficient\\" for their support, but he does not stand for, and gives the managers credit for attempting to prevent, \\"excessive and unwarrantable tipping.\\"Continuing, Mr. Lustgarten presents the situation from the usher's point of view as follows:The theatre is an interesting institution for studying human nature. People, in the presence of a uniformed man, think it unnecessary to restrain their speech or actions, and quite unconsciously act their natural selves. The usher coming in contact with so many different individualities realizes the necessity of approaching the patrons in different terms of speech and action.Should he be condemned for being in uniform, much as he detests it? If you find him pleasing and courteous, should he be put in the category of a disguised Jesse James? The discipline in the organization compels him to be so, but because the uniform covers the man, some of them truly fine characters, his actions are misinterpreted. Because he comes in such personal contact with the patron, the usher unintentionally leaves an impression as to the management of the entire theatre. He is subjected to more insults and humiliation in his daily routine than would seem imaginable. I don't wish to extol his virtues. He isn't any more immune from having faults than an office clerk. However, he has qualities that should not be wholly disregarded or, having faults, not be altogether cendemned for them. He is very human and—sensitive as to what others say of him. Being in uniform, he is not expected to have any initiative or, having any, the omnipotent gods (managers, &c.) prefer that he should not use it.If he is so unfortunate as to have a narrow-minded manager or chief usher, he is subjected to their petty likes and dislikes: must eater to their whims, to insure the safety of his precarious position. Treated with human decency, and well regulated discipline, he is easily managed. It must be renumbered that they are young men, each with an individual temperament (ushers can be temperamental), and to expect them to be ideal is quits impossible. But in all fairness, let whatever abilities they may have be appreciated.All of which would make it appear that an usher is a human being, after all.New Color pictures.THE day will come eventually when entire photoplays will be made in really natural and dramatically effective colors, and it will be a great day for the screen when it arrives. So each advance toward this goal is noteworthy and encouraging. The reports from London indicate that the new Prizma process used in J. Stuart Blackton's \\"The Glorious Adventure\\" marks such an advance, and another was evident here recently when the Eastman Kodak Company demonstrated the color photography possible with its new camera and method of printing positives.The new Eastman camera contains two lenses, placed side by side, one of which admits the light through a red filter and the other through a green. Two frames of negative film are exposed simultaneously through these lenses and the respective images are printed opposite each other on the same positive strip, which is then dyed so that the colors shown on the screen appear in the film. This means that, though requiring a Special camera and special treatment in developing and printing, the pictures, when finished, can be shown through any projection machine.Dr. C. E. K. Mees, head of the Eastman laboratory in Rochester, who was in New York week before last when a specimen of the color work was shown, said that J. G. Capstaff, one of the workers in the laboratory, was chiefly responsible for the results attained. He did not, however, make any startling claims for the pictures. He said that they represented certain improvements rather than any revolutionary innovation in color photography and that the Eastman company was recommending them for use in close-ups only.The specimen seen by the present writer easily substantiated Dr. Mees's claims. Its flesh tints were remarkably true, and the articles of clothing and jewelry worn by the subject seemed to possess their full chromatic value. Lights and shadows also were effectively registered. One felt, seeing the pictures, that, despite the modesty of Dr. Mees's statements, a real advance in the photography of natural colors had been made.

PROVISIONS THAT WERE RETAINED DESPITE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION OBJECTIONS...     CONFERENCE COMMITTEE  FOOD STAMP SPENDING  Cuts projected spending on food stamps by roughly $24 billion over six years, with at least $3 billion more saved by denying food stamps to legal immigrants. Limits food stamps for unemployed workers not raising children.    CLINTON ADMINISTRATION  Had wanted the cuts scaled back and criticized the restriction on food stamps to the unemployed.    VOUCHERS  CONFERENCE COMMITTEE  Prohibits states from using Federal block grants to provide vouchers or other noncash benefits to families who reach the five-year limit on cash assistance. However, states could finance them under a separate law that authorizes social services for poor.    CLINTON ADMINISTRATION  Had sought approval for block-grant spending, to help families buy diapers, clothing, medicine and school supplies for children.    CONFERENCE COMMITTEE  IMMIGRANTS  Future legal immigrants who have not become citizens would be ineligible for most Federal welfare benefits and social services during their first five years in the U.S. Supplemental Security income and food stamps would end for non-citizens now receiving benefits.    CLINTON ADMINISTRATION  Wanted these cuts scaled back.    ...AND PROVISIONS THAT WERE CHANGED    CONFERENCE COMMITTEE  FOOD STAMP ALLOCATION  Dropped a provision that would have allowed state to receive their food stamp money as a lump sum and let them redesign the food stamp program by setting their own eligibility criteria and benefit levels.    CLINTON ADMINISTRATION  FOOD STAMP ALLOCATION  Managed to preserve the Federal guarantee of food stamps for poor people, with uniform national standards.    CONFERENCE COMMITTE  CHILD CARE  Increased the amount available to provide day care for the children of welfare recipients to $14 billion over six years.    CLINTON ADMINISTRATION  CHILD CARE  Succeeded in strengthening provisions for child care.    CONFERENCE COMMITTEE  MEDICAID  States must provide Medicaid for anyone who qualifies under current law. States must provide Medicaid coverage for one year for families that lose eligibility because of new standards. Allows states to provide Medicaid for legal immigrants already in the U.S.    CLINTON ADMINISTRATION  MEDICAID  Managed to preserve Federal guarantee of health coverage under Medicaid.    OTHER MAJOR PROVISIONS  * The Federal guarantee of cash assistance for poor children would end. Each state would receive a lump sum to run its own welfare and work programs.       *The head of every family on welfare would have to work within two years, or the family would lose benefits. After receiving welfare for two months, adults would perform community service unless they had found jobs. States could choose not to have a requirement.      *Lifetime welfare benefits would be limited to five years. (States could set stricter limits.) Hardship exemptions would be availabel for 20 percent of families.       *States could provide payments to unmarried tenn-age parents only if a mother under 18 stays in school and lives with an adult.      *States could shift 30 percent of money in block grants to child care, social services and child protection (with a maximum of 10 percent going to social services).      *States would have to maintain their own spending on welfare at 75 percent of the 1994 level 0 or 80 percent if they failed to put enough welfare recipients to work.      *States could pay additional benefits to cover children born to women already on welfare, as many states now do.      *States that did not meet goals for employment of recipients would lose block grants. Penalty would rise from 5 percent in the first year 21 percent in ninth year.      *Stricter eligibility standards would exclude many disabled children in low-income families seeking Supplemental Security Income.      *States would generally have to deny cash assitance and food stamps to people convicted of drug felonies, unless they explitictly adopted different policies. In any event, pregnant women and adults in drug treatment would not be denied assistance.      *States would not penalize a woman on welfare who did not work because she could not find day care for child under 6 years old. (House and Senate had both protected women with children under 11.)      *A woman on welfare who refused to cooperate in identifying the father of her child would lose at least 25 percent of her benefits.      *Innovative state welfare programs could continue under Federal waivers granted before Oct. 1, 1996, even if they did not comply with all terms of the new welfare bill.

The Wish List"},{"year":"1943","title":"Behind the brief announcement that \\"formations of United States and Canadian planes yesterday attacked Kiska\\" lies one of the enigmatic campaigns of this war—a campaign fought upon an almost forgotten atoll of the American continent, and fought against one of the eeriest and loneliest backgrounds in the world. For a long time Americans have had only that sparse information which has been allowed to pass through the strictest censorship. But now at last the War Department itself has released a film which for the first time will relate and clarify to Americans the strange war that is being fought far past Hawaii, far past Midway. That film is \\"Report From the Aleutians,\\" now at the Rialto.And what a fine report it is! It was photographed last autumn and winter on 16-mm. Kodachrome and later expanded on 35-mm. Technicolor by a Signal Corps camera unit which accompanied the task force which landed on Adak and during the ensuing months suffered all of the hazards and privations of the troops themselves. The unit of six men was commanded by Capt. John M. Huston, who has directed the film with the same regard for terseness that marked his Hollywood films, and as chief camera man he had the services of Capt. Rey Scott, whose earlier film on China, \\"Kukan,\\" was one of the noteworthy film documents of this war.Most of the film was shot at Adak, the large barren island on which American forces first touched the beach one day and the first plane set down its wheels eleven days later on a runway which at landing had been only a tidal flat. It shows the unloading of ships bringing equipment to islands which offered no more than air, fresh water and rock, nothing else. Every nail, every piece of wood, everything that a modern army needs had to be brought in through waters as treacherous as any in the world, and after unloading—as like as not—be carried on soldiers backs across tundra impassable to vehicles.Here is much of the cost—though not all—of our seven-league steps toward Kiska, toward Attu, and perhaps one day, beyond. Here are the clusters of tents on the deceptive tundra, the smoke curling upward, then swept horizontal by the unending wind","excerpt":"here are the bulldozers pushing through the sludge to build airports almost overnight; here are the men with their muffler beards often joshing like little boys over a batch of mail from home. And here too are the planes going out on missions from fields partially inundated in seepage and sea water, and those same planes sometimes bringing back their dead.Kiska is a very small target, but its anti-aircraft defenses are immensely strong. The film, taken at great risk by Captain Huston and his men, shows that—the take-off of the great Liberators, the steady routine checks of pilot and crew over the interphone, the tightening of the formation, then the closing in on North Head with bomb bays open and black shrapnel bursts and red tracers threading the sky. There are the little puffs from the ground below, the heart-stopping jolt caused by a shell too close, and then the homeward flight. It is as exciting a passage of combat film as we've seen.The great enemy in the Aleutians, of course, is the weather, and \\"Report From the Aleutians\\" manages to create a good deal of that climatic environment. It is a pity, however—and only the limitations of the camera are to blame—that the unit was unable to take those other shots of fog so thick one can hardly see the wings of the plane, of the ice that clusters on a plane in a matter of seconds, of the hazards of \\"letting down\\" through the stuff, and finally of the ground installations that have made flying in the Aleutians a much safer task than when Adak was the base for Kiska missions.But here, in short, is one of the war's outstanding records of what our men are doing. It is furthermore an honest record. It tells as much of the story as can now be told, and that is a good deal more than most Americans yet know. It is imperative that \\"Report From the Aleutians\\" be seen by anyone intent on knowing something of the labor, the hazard, and the importance—both real and potential—of one long-forgotten theatre of war.On the same bill at the Rialto is \\"Bomber's Moon,\\" which ordinarily might be quite acceptable as a routine, synthetic melodrama about the escape of a Russian nurse, Annabella, and an American flier, George Montgomery, from a German prison camp to England. Beside the tension and authenticity of its companion feature, however, \\"Bomber's Moon\\" is revealed all too clearly as the second-rate Hollywood shoddy that it is.

In the process, he created a fictional portrait of a community and way of life in this region, which he often identified as ''Greenwood'' in his books.   Jesse Stuart died last year at the age of 78, having created nearly 4,000 characters in 57 books, including 9 novels, 18 collections of short stories and 8 volumes of poetry.

In the three years I claimed to work there I visited the place only once. My employer, Salomon Brothers, required all new recruits to spend a full day on the New York Stock Exchange. That day four of us trooped from the southern tip of Manhattan to the stone fortress on the corner of Wall and Broad with an indifference that called to mind a middle-school field trip to a Civil War museum, except there was no one to punish you when you shoved your bubble gum down the musket barrel. After a brief tour -- \\"there is where they put the bomb","excerpt":"here is where they put the TV cameras\\" -- our ancient guide, who handled Salomon's business on the Exchange, let slip what we all suspected: he made no real money. No one he knew on Wall Street made real money -- at least not compared with the average Salomon bond trader. All at once eight eyes sought the nearest exit. And a few minutes later, with what I took to be touching generosity but now see as an understandable desire to be rid of us, our guide left us in a local bar with an open tab and a few hours to kill. We drank the time dry, then stumbled off Wall Street and back south, into the drama of the 80's.   Now, 10 years later, a similar bribe to stay put and behave is being offered to grown-up financiers on Wall Street. The Giuliani administration is forking out hard cash, in the form of real-estate tax breaks, to companies that agree to remain in the neighborhood. Between 1990 and 1993, according to the real-estate firm Jones Lang Wootton, nearly a third of the buildings in the Wall Street area were in foreclosure. To the naked eye the Street looks as it always has -- an El Greco cityscape of fingerlike buildings straining higher and higher, as if trying to pluck money from the sky. But no large American investment bank has its offices there anymore. Wall Street now belongs to Japanese tourists in red double-decker buses trying to figure out which seemingly abandoned building used to be the world's tallest skyscraper (40 Wall). It's a museum.

Primarily a conversation piece, although it has its comic situations, too, the film is bound to find more favor with those who understand its language than with the many who are compelled to rely upon the subtitler's interpretations. Having to read while the picture runs is a disadvantage at any time","excerpt":"here it seemed doubly a hardship.Louis Jouvet's direction indicates greater familiarity with stage methods than the cinema's. He has done little more than transfer the Romains play bodily into the studio. But he compensates for the static and repetitious quality of his film by playing the rôle of Dr. Knock with the galling impertinence it requires. As the quack doctor who takes over a non-existent practice in the disgustingly healthy community of St. Maurice and then persuades its citizens they are tottering on the grave, M. Jouvet is the perfect charlatan: unscrupulous, rascally, dignified. He is so good, in fact, that he almost convinces himself.The film is extremely slow in getting under way, but it moves amusingly thereafter through the burlesque free consultations and treatments, which show husky peasants striding into Dr. Knock's office and staggering from it, to the sardonic conclusion which finds the former village doctor—and an anti-Knock—obediently turning over in a hospital bed to permit a crosseyed attendant to take his temperature. He, too, has been claimed by the quack's reverse Coue, and day by day can be counted upon to feel sicker and sicker. It is a frivolous theme, and it has been enjoyably performed; but it could have been told more resourcefully, and we still think the title writers cheated us of half the fun. THE SCREEN; At the Cinema de Paris"},{"year":"1990","title":"In recent years, Charles Dutoit has presided over some of New York's most elegant and refined orchestral concerts, whether he was conducting his own Montreal Symphony, the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra or some other ensemble. The current Philharmonic subscription series at Avery Fisher Hall might seem stocked with his specialties. But it cannot be said that Wednesday evening's opening concert was very successful.    The problem was a prevailing looseness in the playing and lack of intensity in the phrasing. The opening Stravinsky \\"Danses Concertantes\\" did have an easy grace, despite some sloppy execution -- relaxed but not slack, lyrical but crisp.    But the Szymanowski \\"Symphonie Concertante\\" for piano and orchestra (Op. 60) -- a nice coupling with the Stravinsky both in terms of its title and the influence Stravinsky exercised on Szymanowski -- sounded ragged and unblended. One might blame the Fisher Hall acoustics, but Mr. Dutoit has overcome those acoustics before. This is a score that can sound sumptuous and rich","excerpt":"here it seemed tawdry.    Tawdriness was no problem in Liszt's \\"Totentanz,\\" again for piano and orchestra, a cheerful example of the sort of cheesily extroverted music that has unfortunately fallen from favor in our earnest modern age. It harrumphs and thumps and tinkles, having little in its head other than to please. And if a listener isn't being hypercritical, it can do just that.    Once again, though, Mr. Dutoit failed to muster the dash and snap that would have swept the piece along with optimal bravura. Jean-Yves Thibaudet, in his Philharmonic debut, was the soloist for both scores, and while he certainly dashed up and down the keyboard with enthusiasm, he, too, lacked grandeur in the Szymanowski and spunk in the Liszt.    The program ends with a Dutoit favorite, \\"La Mer\\" of Debussy. Maybe he's conducted it too often. Here, too, the playing failed to build to the climaxes in the first and third movement, or sweep along with the controlled tension of, say, a Charles Munch. There were some lovely delicate effects, as in the intimate interplay at the end of the second movement. But all in all, this was hardly one of Mr. Dutoit's finer outings here.    The program will be repeated tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Tuesday night at 7:30.

And staying power is something St. Croix has in abundance. Perhaps the secret is diversity. St. Croix is the largest of the United States Virgin Islands, but not so large that one can't drive its 28-mile length in an hour. It has mountains, beaches, shopping, good restaurants and a full array of land and water sports. Yet it is not as commercial as neighboring St. Thomas. The landscape, also, provides contrasts: a bona fide rain forest on the west end, more of a desert climate on the drier, sunnier east end.    St. Croix's comeback from the devastation of Hurricane Hugo two and a half years ago is further evidence of the island's tenacity. Downtown Christiansted, with its boutiques and historic Danish architecture, has been given a face lift. Resorts like the Buccaneer and the Carambola have been renovated and, in some cases, expanded.

Ubiquitous music, endless boutiques, rainbow gelato stands, garish night auctions, crowded street markets and menus that feature 21 pastas and 25 desserts help to persuade that here is a potential slice of heaven on earth - a melange of Tuscan cuisine and culture; a legendary spa, with a lingering air of Dolce Vita.   What makes Montecatini different from other spas is the diversity of its therapeutic waters. The benefits of the waters have been known since the Etruscans settled in the area during the eighth century B.C. The Tettuccio Terme dates back to the 14th century. However, it was not until after World War II that Montecatini and its Grand Hotel e La Pace had its first modern renaissance. From 1955 to 1965 it was an international playground. The waters drew movie stars, soldiers and sheiks, including Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn and Prince Rainier. Recent guests have been Stephanie Powers, Robert Wagner and a sheik who arrived with an entourage of 40 wives, dozens of servants and armed guards.

The Kitchen, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary, has been one of the centers for what was once called the avant-garde. Of course, the notion of the avant-garde is somewhat passe since esthetic and political opposition have become commonplace sentiments. But the polemical spirit remains, and in video and performance art it regains some attraction and novelty through the use of electronic media. Television and video, commercial advertising techniques and electronic processing of sound become the objects of attention as well as the methods for expression, the message as well as the medium.   Thus, in a rather sardonic video piece, \\"Made for TV,\\" Tom Rubnitz created a television video about television. Punctuated by the static of purported channel hopping, it is a 15-minute portrait of pop American culture. As the screen flickers from channel to channel, the actress Ann Magnuson appears as a teary television missionary appealing for money, as a newscaster with an almost plastic face, as a mad grotesque romping through a cemetery in a rock video and as a sincere drinker of great coffee.

It is called \\"West of Zanzibar,\\" is in color and it opened yesterday at the World.Mr. Watt was recounting in \\"Ivory Hunter\\" the heroic endeavors of one man, a national park warden in Kenya, to protect the local game from infection by herds of diseased cattle and especially from ivory poachers in the preserve","excerpt":"here, he is telling of the same man's endeavors to trace the ivory poaching back to its source. His warden, turned detective, is ranging outside his national park and is chasing despicable ivory smugglers right into the city of Mombasa and even across the waters to the nearby island of Zanzibar.Mr. Watt is nobody's shy one. His taste is for action and colorful stuff, and when they don't logically flow before his camera, he is not reluctant to turn aside to pick some up. Thus, when his man is shipwrecked aboard a dhow off the coast of Mombasa and is rescued by a passing fisherman, Mr. Watt takes the occasion to show a novel method of catching sea turtles, with sucker fish attached to fishing lines. The method is probably the most unusual known to fishermen.Or when in recounting his man's endeavors to save a native tribe (whose youths are being corrupted by the ring of smugglers), Mr. Watt goes back into the bush, he cannot resist the temptation to film the varieties of animals there, from herds of elephants, rhinoceroses and wart hogs to slithering crocodiles.The consequence is a picture of dramatic extravagance and, indeed, of sublime exaggeration, that is kept from seeming absurd by the nature of the locale. Mr. Watt's heedless hops from the bush country across to Zanzibar, back to Mombasa, back to the bush country, across to Zanzibar again, and all the while finding dire adventure, are unrestrained thriller stuff. But the genuine characteristics of the African background, where all this was filmed, give some logic to the tale.The cast, too, conveys authority. Even though Sheila Sim, as the tag-along wife of the warden, becomes a nuisance and a trial before it's done, Anthony Steel, the same fellow from \\"Ivory Hunter,\\" is spirited and natural in the warden role. Edric Connor, Orlando Martins and others play African natives with solemn dignity, and Martin Benson is both wicked and forceful as the renegade lawyer who runs the smuggling ring.The purity and high purpose of \\"Ivory Hunter\\" may not be in \\"West of Zanzibar,\\" but it is an exciting and generally creditable picture of a contemporary aspect of East Africa.

It is, in fact, only now, after seeing \\"Dark Rapture,\\" that we can begin to understand how thin, how trumped-up, how badly photographed most of its predecessors have been. For here is a portfolio of anthropological facts more exciting and wonderful than the best of the fictions to which we have previously been exposed","excerpt":"here, in effect, is the very heart of darkness, immense, unknowable and savage to the point of the unspeakable.There is something engagingly unprofessional about the way the Denises (the Roosevelt part of the firm is Mrs. Denis) begin with ashot of their motor caravan rolling out of Brussels; thence, in a rapidly telescoped sequence, down through Spain and Morocco and across the Sahara; it makes the Dark Continine seem as accessible as Bryce Canyon or Zion National Park.But don't be misled; Africa is still Africa, brought nearer in space, perhaps, by the motor car, but still thousands of years removed in time. As soon as you meet the \\"Long Heads,\\" who got that way from having their skulls carefully bound in infancy, or witness the tribal ceremony of flagellation as a test of manhood (the youth who changes expression at the contact of the lash apparently is flunked), your geographic perspective will be restored.Any criticism of \\"Dark Rapture\\" must eventually resolve itself into an enthusiastic catalogue of the brilliant scenes and incidents which compose it. The climax of beauty, undoubtedly, is the joyous and abandoned dance of the strange people in the \\"Valley of the Giants.\\" The climax of humor is a matter of taste; perhaps it will be the building of a forest bridge by the pygmies, who send one of their little people across the stream with the first strand on a giant swing, or perhaps the training of an unwilling African elephant, which screams with temperamental rage.The crossing of the volcanic region of Nyamlagira, the capture of an elephant in the plains country, and finally the cataclysmic grass fire before which the whole world flees are sequences any one of which might have established the reputation of a lesser film. We congratulate Mr. Denis for restraining any impulse he might have had to pipe his story: Africa is so much more dramatic when it isn't dramatized.

But as a rule, roll roofing (sometimes referred to as built-up roofing) does require more frequent inspection than shingles if leaks are to be prevented from developing as the years go by.    One of the most common problems that will occur on a flat or shed-type roof is the formation of blisters in the top layer of roofing material (there may be anywhere from two to four layers of roofing in a properly built-up roof covering). If these blisters are only in the top layer (in most cases they are), and if the material still seems solid - that is, there are no cracks, breaks or splits in the roofing - the chances are there is nothing to worry about and you can leave them alone.

And with good reason. This was not just a recital, it was an act of reverence. In 20 of Schubert's songs that ranged widely over the composer's career, Mr. Prey, accompanied by James Levine at the piano, created astonishing miniature universes.    They were sculptured with the assurance of a master. Nothing was ornate or excessive. Mr. Prey didn't need to \\"emote\\" or impose feeling on a phrase. He seemed to take on the persona of each song, becoming the young lover, the worshipful son, the wizened wanderer. In \\"Alinde\\" he presented an eerie Romantic drama of dialogue and yearning. In \\"Der Schiffer\\" -- \\"The Boatman\\" -- his voice seemed to embody animal energy, the recurring accents suggesting the repeated swell of waves. \\"Die Allmacht\\" -- a paean to the power of Jehovah -- had the authority and wonder of authentic faith. These performances were acts of creative imagination. And Mr. Levine was an exemplary accompanist, always supporting and often expanding on Mr. Prey's expression.

Avoiding dramatic extremes, the Seventh deals in ambiguities and half-tints: its musical materials point simultaneously to Viennese modernism and the Romantic nostalgia popularized by Hollywood composers.

In Jewish tradition he is remembered as the Idumean who was made king by the might of Rome, not by the grace of God. Yet archeology reveals another side of Herod: a genius for architecture. Two thousand years after his reign the modern-day traveler can visit the remains of Herodian structures scattered through Israel.   Herod ruled Judea from 37 to 4 B.C. He came from a family that had been forced to convert to Judaism in the second century B.C., when the Hasmonean John Hyrcanus conquered Idumea. Herod's father, Antipater, rose to power under Julius Caesar, who appointed him commissioner of all Judea, a position he exploited to advance the fortunes of his own family. Since the victorious Jewish revolt in 169 B.C. - the event which Hanukkah commemorates - the Hasmonean dynasty had governed the land. But subsequently the battles between the heirs of Queen Shlomzion Alexandra weakened the royal house and tore the country apart.   Ever suspicious of the rebellious Jews, Rome took advantage of the schism. With the support of the Senate, Antony declared Herod King of Judea, counting on his collaboration.

The concert will be repeated tomorrow night.   Very different pieces these, even though Weber's opera (finished in 1821) precedes the final version of the Ninth by only a year. \\"Der Freischutz\\" remains locked in its own time, in a world long past. But so eloquent is its spirit and imagination that it continues to refresh the receptive listener. The Beethoven, on the other hand, travels with more ease, attaching itself to every succeeding Zeitgeist. The symphony's half-mad extravagance, its bulldozing power and breathtaking ambition, its appeals to ecstasy: all offer a nigh-on indestructible common denominator for vast ranges of listeners. No matter what new world the Ninth may be cast into, it finds a home.

And for those who have been daunted by the prospect of embarking on a 17-volume series, here is the perfect way to test the waters. THE UNKNOWN SHORE (Norton, $23) first came out in 1959, but it has the same elements that mark Mr. O'Brian's more recent works: the wealth of social detail, the quiet humor, the harrowing shipwrecks, the swashbuckling adventures  in foreign parts -- and, most important, the abiding and unlikely friendship between two young men, one a sociable creature born to the sea and the other a surgeon's mate, brilliant in scientific understanding but lacking in social graces. Jack Byron and Tobias Barrow are a bit younger than Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, but the dynamic is the same. When Toby is in a haze of oblivion, Jack helps him navigate the puzzling terrain of human relations: in an early escapade, when Toby has become lost in London, wandering around dressed in a sack after having been set upon by thieves, Jack arranges for a flock of turkeys to be released from the top of a monument, knowing that Toby, an ardent  naturalist, will be irresistibly drawn to the spectacle. Once at sea, the action becomes more grisly, as the 220 men who set out from England to circumnavigate the globe dwindle down to a mere handful. Jack and Toby stick together through it all, painfully making their way across swamps and stormy seas, from barren islands to Indian camps, finally arriving safely in Valparaiso. From a cozy, well-lighted 20th-century home, their travails could not be more delightful to contemplate.

Shielded by hills from the cold air of northern Europe, the Algarve enjoys African weather all year round and claims more sunshine than any other European resort. From June until October, a scorching blanket of dry heat settles over the coast, with its immense sandy beaches, its tiny smugglers' coves and its crumbling cliffs of golden stone, honeycombed by wind and tide. The pace of life is African too, with peasant women swathed in black driving mule carts down narrow lanes and barefoot fishermen mending nets on the beaches. To reach the Algarve, fly direct to the international airport at Faro, Portugal's southernmost city, or take an air-conditioned bus from Lisbon. Once there, you will need a car","excerpt":"Hertz, Avis and Europacar have offices at the airport and in most of the coastal towns. Many visitors rent villas, but if that is impractical, stay at a pousada, one of the Government-owned inns that are clean, comfortable and often spectacularly beautiful. There are two on the Algarve. The more dramatically situated is the pousada at Sagres, on the cliffs at Europe's most southwesterly point. The other, in an old monastery, is up in the hills at Sao Bras de Alportel. Both have excellent restaurants but are small, so reserve in advance. The road running eastward from Sagres passes through the old whitewashed port of Lagos, from which Henry the Navigator's ships set out to explore Africa and Latin America.

HOLLYWOOD DOGS and HOLLYWOOD CATS (Collins, each $14.95), two engaging photographic compilations edited by J. C. Suares, salute Tinseltown's hairiest hunks and heavies. Today some of the shots seem like witty parodies of certain stars' images. One publicity still catches Clark Gable on the set of \\"Red Dust\\" gazing deeply into the eyes of an adoring Irish setter. Another shows a creamy-complexioned Grace Kelly hoisting a kitten up to a bowl of actual cream. These images seem especially stagy when contrasted with the revealing at-home images rounded up by Mr. Suares, whose previous books include \\"The Illustrated Cat\\" and \\"The Literary Dog.\\" There is a remarkably intimate portrait of a young Marlon Brando typing moodily with his cat draped around his shoulders. Another unlikely shot captures Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor holding their Lhasa apsos and their Pekingese aboard their yacht, where they lived during a 1971 London stay so their pets would not have to be quarantined. On-screen performances don't get stinted, although fans of Asta will have to settle for one classic checking-out-the-icebox picture from \\"After the Thin Man.\\" Feline fans will savor the career of Orangey, Audrey Hepburn's irritable tabby co-star in \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\\" who frequently had to be restrained from stalking off the set.
