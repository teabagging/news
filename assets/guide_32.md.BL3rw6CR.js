Linda Gottlieb, executive producer, and Michael Malone, head writer -- a team who joined the show just in July -- decided to hit her with an immune-deficiency illness, in this instance lupus.

Wells' literary sights often were trained on lofty levels, it is recalled now that he could also lower them effectively. For, in \\"The History of Mr. Polly,\\" which slipped into the Art Theatre on Eighth Street yesterday, the author, Anthony Pelissier, who adapted and directed this British-made import, and John Mills, who plays the title role, give impressive stature to a little man. More important, however, is that in elaborating a basically ordinary and trifling theme they have lent it genuine wit, humor, charm and dignity.It is obvious that this team was not attempting to fashion the most stupendous motion picture of their time. Like its title, \\"The History of Mr. Polly\\" is unexciting. It is largely the placid tale of an introspective, sensitive soul, whose efforts to escape his commonplace rut are unsuccessful until he blunders into happiness.Blunders is the proper word. For Alfred Polly, the meek draper's clerk, whose daydreaming about knights errant and use of multisyllabic words get him fired, is a confused gent. His father's death brings him a legacy of £500 but no contentment. The schoolgirl he meets and loves at first sight takes his ardor lightly and, as a result, he hastily marries his cousin.Life with that shrewish dame is not the place in the sun he is seeking. He is still the henpecked husband hating his wife, neighbors and business when he realistically decides to burn down his shop and destroy himself. But fate, as has been noted, takes a hand and lifts him from the flames to a hero's pedestal. And, at this point, Mr. Polly avoids the routine by running away from it all. This, it turns out, is the best move he could have made for in so doing he achieves the prosaic but serene goal of his dreams.Essentially, Mr. Polly's \\"history\\" runs a well-marked course. But the producers have given it expert touches that make it all seem extraordinary. His father's funeral is, strangely enough, funny—not funereal. His attempt at arson is not grim but chuckle-filled, as is his triumphant tussle with a plugugly old duffer who has been mulcting a widow with whom Mr. Polly has found peace.Since Mr. Wells' story begins in 1896 and runs some fourteen years, John Mills and the rest of the cast are properly bourgeois and Victorian in behavior. He is diffident but correct in his mannerisms, and his final revolt is in good, quiet taste. And, Betty Ann Davies, as his harridan mate","excerpt":"Megs Jenkins, as the inn-keeping widow with whom he finds sanctuary, and Finlay Currie, as her tough old oppressor, contribute expert characterizations in support.

He conducted it authoritatively on this occasion, too, putting much emphasis on the luxuriant scoring of the interludes and the quasi-operatic excitement of its choral and solo vocal parts.

This year, the series, which opened its 22d season on Sunday, is devoting all five of its programs to Jerome Kern.
