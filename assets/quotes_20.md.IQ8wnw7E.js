Even an intended compliment could hold hidden barbs -- as when a male co-worker remarked on June's resemblance to \\"a young Marina Oswald,\\" then immediately apologized, saying he \\"didn't mean to insult her\\" by invoking the infamous name.

Hutton Presents an Evening with Bill Cosby.''   Lloyd Kolmer, who is in the business of securing hard-to-get talent for the advertising community but is not involved in this contract, said that with the concerts this could easily be a $3 million to $5 million deal.

This was something new for Mark Hutton, who had not started a major league game for almost three years. A fresh start to a game? This was Hutton's appetizing opportunity in a crucial contest. He did not fumble it.         Hours after the Yankees revoked a minor league offer to Jack Morris, Hutton temporarily halted the search for an elusive fifth starter today by pitching competently into the fifth inning and helping steer the Yankees to a 4-2 victory over the Brewers. So the Yankees ended an annoying three-game losing streak and  found a starter. Not a shabby afternoon. The 26-year-old Hutton has waited for the chance while he floated among the bullpen, the disabled list and the minors. He waited and wondered why the Yankees started Brian Boehringer and Ramiro Mendoza and almost shook hands with the 41-year-old Morris. The frustration ended today, and Hutton would have recorded five unblemished innings if Ruben Sierra did not mishandle Fernando Vina's sinking liner into a triple that fueled Milwaukee's two runs.

I'll know when I find the ultimate sound, because I'll be completely fulfilled just by the sound of it and by what I'm able to do with it instrumentally.

Here are excerpts from their entries in the registry (in italics) and some things they said during telephone interviews about their desire to be on air. SARAH BOXER  A Disney Fanatic George Reiger Jr. has permanently tattooed his body with Disney characters from Mickey Mouse to Snow White. Every room in his home is \\"Disney themed,\\" using over 4,500 Disney-related items. He has visited Disney World 72 times and Disneyland 52 times.  I want to go on television for the exposure and to show the world my tattoos. I have 415 Disney tattoos, and I can show all but 20 of them. I'm Disney's number one fan. It all started when I was watching the Mickey Mouse Club as a child. My first tattoo was 15 years ago. I was quiet about it for years. I was going to Disneyland five or six times a year, to Disney World seven or eight times a year. Then I learned there was a guy in Florida who has 100 characters tattooed on his body. He was getting all the publicity, even though he lives by Disney World. I live 2000 miles away. This is my life, my religion. The movie \\"Pocahontas\\" comes out in June","excerpt":"I already have the tattoos. I'm going to be cremated and my ashes will be scattered over the Seven Seas Lagoon. A Lost Dog's Guilty Master In 1988, Ronald Freed's daughter, Tina, was walking through the forest when she fell and hit her head, causing a severe concussion. Luckily, her dog, Spook, stayed with her. Tina was found after Mr. Freed heard Spook barking. On Oct. 19, 1992, Spook disappeared and Ronald blames himself for the dog's disappearance: \\"That dog SAVED my daughter's life. I sold him down the river.\\"  I want to be on a talk show because I have a dog who's been missing for 30 months. It's the only way I can get national coverage. I have spent thousands of dollars trying to find my dog. I can't get a billboard with his picture on it. I've got millions of leads but never the right one. I should have hired cops, the way you'd do for a missing child. When you watch the morons on talk shows, you see people who cheat on their mother's lawyer's boyfriend. I am a college graduate and a rabid antivivisectionist. I'm putting together a mini-book titled \\"Test America's Prisoner's, Not Animals.\\" If I got on a talk show and nobody called, maybe I could put this thing behind me. I have to take care of my two cats. I can't commit suicide. An Imaginary Mother Patty McNeil (a pseudonym) had an extramarital affair. The affair ended with the man \\"tossing her aside like trash.\\" When she discovered that she was pregnant, the ex-lover demanded that she have an abortion. She refused but then ended up miscarrying. \\"I never told him of the miscarriage. In fact, I told him that I delivered a sweet baby girl that had 'his eyes' for no other reason but to destroy his peace of mind.\\"  You see a talk show and think: How can they talk about that awful stuff? But I suffered for a long time in silence. And talk is healing. You just purge it. You can't go into a supermarket and say, \\"I was raped by my brother.\\" In supermarkets people talk about diapers. But talk shows are for talking about painful or bizarre things. You're anonymous there. There are things I would say on television that I wouldn't say to my therapist. I was on once to talk about my affair with a younger man, and nobody knew I was on. I didn't tell anybody -- just one friend, my sister and my son. If my mother saw it, she'd think she was having D.T.'s. This time, if the story about my imaginary child comes out, the man will want to kill me. I would have to wear a wig or something. But he's a man; he's not going to be at home watching. He's got a job. An Elvis With Implants Mike Memphis has been an Elvis impersonator for 13 years (since he was 16 years old). In 1994, Mike underwent 7 facial operations to look more like \\"the King,\\" including cheek implants, a lower lip implant, a chin implant and liposuction of the neck and chin.  I'm an entertainer and there's one thing you can expect from being on a talk show: that you'll have another line for your resume. I have before-and-after pictures of myself and pictures of myself on the operating table. I have only one regret -- that I didn't do it earlier. But I'm not a psychopath. I'm using this as a stepping stone to other acting jobs. I could downplay the look, shave the sideburns, let the black dye wash out. I don't want to be Elvis when I'm 40.  Multiple Personality Lori Crocker, R.N., is a psychiatric nurse who was assisting therapists in treating people suffering from multiple personality disorders when she suddenly realized that \\"someone inside\\" was talking to her as well. \\"For the next year and a half,\\" she says, \\"I worked intensely with a therapist, uncovering 45 different alters.\\" God has helped me and it's time to give something back. I want to tell everyone that there are a lot more people with multiple personality disorders than they recognize. People associate hearing voices with being crazy. But it may be people inside talking. Becoming a multiple personality is a coping skill, and not everybody has the ability to do this. Something very bad has to have happened. My opinion is that there has been satanic involvement in 80 percent of the cases. Both of my kids went through stuff like that -- satanism, orgies, drugs. The satanic cults have people, men, who get females pregnant, so they can take the children and sacrifice them. Or they will take infants in deep dark boxes and put them in the ground -- with bugs and stuff. I saw these rituals in flashbacks of my alters as they came out to heal. The alters are like best friends. They've taken on the pain for me. I know what I have been through. I know that if people attack, it's only out of fear. A Man With Long Second Toes Ron Chappell has researched historical references and myths about longer second toes for over 10 years. He avidly collects paraphernalia that make reference to the giftedness of people with this special trait.  I'm trying to get some publicity for research I've done on second toes. The major works of art, pretty much all of your Italian artwork, and all your gods and goddesses have that toe. I put all the information together so people can feel good about themselves, so they can identify with Marilyn Monroe, Baryshnikov, the Greek gods and goddesses. Most people think a big second toe means something special -- that it means you're smarter, that you'll live longer or that you're royalty. I think it definitely connects us with fertility, with the earth and the gods. The earth gives off electromagnetic energy. Our toes are our antennas; the longer second toe enables people to draw in more energy. When I was little I asked my mother: How come my second toes are longer? She said I was special. But she is surprised that I took it this far.

But I had been hearing about Southwest's no-frills approach and low fares for destinations all over the midwest, west and south; and I was planning a trip to New Orleans anyway. So when I discovered I could buy a round-trip ticket between the Big Easy and San Antonio on Southwest for $111 (virtually the same as it would have cost to take the train, and about $100 less than I would have been charged had I added the Texas leg onto my New York-to-New Orleans Continental ticket), I snapped it up. \\n\\nThen, while in New Orleans, I realized I had landed in the middle of a regional fare war; every day new ads appeared in the newspaper touting low-cost tickets from New Orleans to all sorts of intriguing places, and at the airport I happened by the counter for an airline called Valujet, offering one-way fares to Chicago, West Palm Beach and Washington for $89.

Kushner had discovered he was not the university's first choice to speak (Jon Stewart was), and he stepped up to the podium and said: ''I think I should begin by acknowledging your disappointment that I am not Jon Stewart. Think how I feel. Your disappointment that I am not Jon Stewart will last one morning","excerpt":"I am disappointed at not being Jon Stewart every morning of my life.'' Funny graduation speeches, alas, are rarely turned into bite-size books to be marketed around the time of later graduations. Earnest speeches frequently are. Anna Quindlen's new book, ''Being Perfect,'' is based on the graduation speech she gave at Mount Holyoke in 1999. And Maria Shriver's new book, ''And One More Thing Before You Go . . . ,'' is expanded from a luncheon speech she delivered not long ago to graduating high school girls and their mothers. (Shriver's bold advice includes ''Learn from your mistakes'' and ''You'll need a lot of courage.'') Shriver's book hits the hardcover miscellaneous list this week at No. 3, pushed along by an appearance on ''Oprah,'' during which Oprah introduced her by intoning the 11 words every woman with a new book dreams of hearing from her: ''My old girlfriend, old, old, old, we go so far back.''    FREAK FACTOR: ''If Indiana Jones were an economist, he'd be Steven Levitt.'' That's a Wall Street Journal reviewer's take on Levitt, a 37-year-old University of Chicago economist whose new book, ''Freakonomics,'' written with Stephen J. Dubner, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 5. But ''Freakonomics'' is so sly, finicky and micro-observant that the Indiana Jones comparison feels a little off -- Levitt is more like the Nicholson Baker of economists. His specialty is asking some unusual questions: ''How is the Ku Klux Klan like a group of real estate agents?''; ''Why do drug dealers still live with their moms?'' The answers tend to be provocative. The most eye-popping assertion in ''Freakonomics'' may be that the drop in crime during the 1990's had little to do with a strong economy or new police strategies. The real reason, Levitt says, was Roe v. Wade. ''An entire generation came of age minus the children whose mothers had not wanted to bring a child into the world,'' he and Dubner write. ''Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness; unwantedness leads to high crime.'' On NPR, Scott Simon asked Levitt if it was true he'd been offered a job in the Bush administration. Yes, Levitt said, then added, ''I told them you better go back and look at the study I did on the link between abortion and crime and if you're still interested, call me back, and I never did get that return phone call.''

He gesticulates broadly, smokes incessantly and talks rapidly in heavily accented English.   But rather than act the part of the tycoon-producer and greeting visitors from behind his imposing 18th-century English partners' desk - which is so vast an entire board of directors could sit around it - Mr. De Laurentiis is waiting at the door. The desk overwhelms its diminutive owner and his spacious Central Park South office, but Mr.  De Laurentiis says he will never part with it.

''The capuchin has a small brain, and it's pretty much focused on food and sex,'' says Keith Chen, a Yale economist who, along with Laurie Santos, a psychologist, is exploiting these natural desires -- well, the desire for food at least -- to teach the capuchins to buy grapes, apples and Jell-O.

Because I write about sports professionally, everyone assumes I play golf regularly. I don’t. I don’t like golf. I think it’s a waste of valuable land.

Rockefeller's Manhattan residence and offered the job of New York State Superintendent of Banks - a post that would have made him watchdog over the biggest and most powerful banks in the United States. No Jewish person had ever held the job.   But Mr. Berkovitch declined the offer. He was doing well as an executive at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and the superintendent's post, while prestigious, was essentially a political appointment that would have taken him outside the mainstream of American banking. At 48, he decided to press on with his career at Morgan, although the big commercial bank had no Jews in its upper echelons.   His decision paid off and in 1983 he reached the lofty post of vice chairman and member of Morgan's four-man Corporate Office, which runs the banking company. ''I did not see it as a gamble or think about it that much","excerpt":"I assumed that if they hired me, my being Jewish didn't matter to them either,'' said Mr. Berkovitch, who retired last March at 65.

Thus wrote Katherine Anne Porter about her first and last full-length novel, written over a period of 20 years and published in 1962 when she was 71. Basing the work on a 15th-century moral allegory, the distinguished short story writer drew on her impressions of her first trans-Atlantic voyage in the early 1930's for an analogy with our own times. Though it provoked controversy among the critics, the novel had the full approval of our reviewer, Mark Schorer: ''Her perfectly poised ironical intelligence is constant and in complete authority. . . . As in any great work of art, something larger is in the air and we know we are in another ship as well, another voyage, sailing to another harbor.''

It seems the Office of Management and Budget has decreed that electrocardiograms no longer have value for patients","excerpt":"I believe that the millions of patients whose cardiac abnormalities have been detected through skillful interpretation of electrocardiograms would say otherwise.   Medicare may have been paying too much for electrocardiogram interpretation, but the issue is whether or not electrocardiogram interpretation requires any skill or has any value for patients. The Government-commissioned Harvard study, which will be the basis for Medicare physician fees beginning in 1992, says yes on both scores. Although concluding that electrocardiogram interpretation should be paid less, the study found that it does take significant time and skill that should be recognized by Medicare.   The Administration argues that the interpretation of electrocardiograms should be included in the fees for office visits, which are supposed to increase in 1992, based on the same study. But the recommended higher fees for visits were not for covering additional services (such as electrocardiogram interpretation) that have always been paid separately.   It's wrong for the Government to declare arbitrarily that interpreting electrocardiograms has no value, requires no skill and should be provided free. Electrocardiograms can save lives by detecting heart problems. But the test is only as good as the skill of the physician who interprets it. MILFORD C.

Brennan Jr.'s speech at Georgetown University opposing the legal views of the Administration (front page, Oct. 15), it should be said forcefully that no acceptable constitutional scholar is willing to confine constitutional construction to the intent of the framers.   Who, in his or her right mind in 1985 America, would want the ban on cruel and unusual punishment to outlaw only those sanctions, such as quartering and burning at the stake, that our 18th-century predecessors intended to ban? Ever to be kept in mind is the real danger, in the words of Associate Justice William H. Moody of the Supreme Court, that the views of the framers' generation ''would be fastened upon the American jurisprudence like a straitjacket, only to be unloosed by constitutional amendment'' (Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78, 101, 1908).   Furthermore, the best of the Founders knew well that the broad concepts they used would have to be construed by later generations with reference to the imperative values and social interests of a developing morality and culture. Listen to Thomas Jefferson in 1816:   ''Some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, and deem them like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched. They ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment. I knew that age well","excerpt":"I belonged to it and labored with it.

My native Denmark was occupied by Germany, and in agricultural Denmark certain things were already scarce.    We recycled everything. Newspapers were bundled for pickup, glass and bottles were returned for refund, all metal and foil went into one bag, all paper into another to be burned in the coal stove. Potato and vegetable peels and food scraps went into a covered pail picked up twice weekly by a pig farmer.   My mother saved all the eggshells in water in a large covered jar on the terrace. This became fertilizer for her house plants. Oh yes, and the neighbor's dog was happy to get any bones. Discarded clothes were woven into rag rugs (I still have some). So what did we throw out? Not much. Sweepings of dust and coffee grounds, occasionally some broken crockery.   In this country, undisputed king of obsolescence and the throwaway mentality, it will be difficult to get a grass-roots movement going in favor of sorting and recycling, but we must. Not until enough people do this and demand more frequent pickups at central recycling points is this going to succeed.   The building I live in does not recycle, except newspapers. A weekly curbside pickup was stopped because it was too expensive. Now I take cans and glass to a container in a supermarket parking lot. It is discouraging to see bags and bottles strewn around or piled up around the container, because there are not enough pickups. Are we serious about this? Or are we just going through the motions to ease our consciences? What are we going to do when the landfill space is exhausted?    Recycling worked half a century ago because it had to.

So it's imperative not to forget that your best shot does not start with a firm handshake, a winning smile or the first question fired by the affable Lord High Executioner behind the desk. The interview begins the moment you open the door. So stand out but don't stick out. Two weeks from your meeting, if your interviewer says, \\"Remember the guy, the one with the great vest . . . ,\\" your clothes have done a good job. If you've been equally memorable, you may get to do one, too. \\"What you wear at a first meeting makes a huge impact because it indicates how aware you are of your surroundings. The key is grooming and understatement: a dark-colored suit, polished lace-up shoes, a pale shirt in a nice fabric. I'd be impressed by a moderate European-cut suit that doesn't call too much attention to itself. Even a double-breasted jacket is a little pushy for an entry-level position. But understatement does not mean underdressing. No sport jackets, button-down shirts, penny loafers, boots, funny suspenders or cuff links. Go for the richness, not brightness, of color and fabric -- like a woven tie. Make your impression with subtlety.\\" CHAD LEAT Managing Director, Chase Manhattan Bank \\"I'm impressed when someone doesn't wear his best suit to an interview. This is not a wedding. It's much smarter to dress just a little bit better than the customer you'll eventually be dealing with. Not flashier, just more affluent. I'm pleased by someone who looks as if he hasn't bought the outfit whole and then wears it that way all the time. Penny loafers and wingtips signify sure-fire bores. Monograms and pocket handkerchiefs lack originality. Spend a little more on a pair of shoes. One tip: You can tell a man knows how to dress by the way he matches his shirt collar to his suit.\\" BILL MCDERMOTT District Market Development Manager, Apple Computer \\"Different jobs have different criteria. Writers should look as if they fell out of a bar. Account executives should wear classics with a twist: colorful blazers, soft wool pants. Art directors should art-direct themselves. If one shows up in black with a ponytail, I know he never got out of the 80's. For someone in accounting, however, polyester is a plus. It says, 'I don't care about fashion","excerpt":"I care about collecting your money.' But most important is to see how people dress normally.

Honesty helps.\\" RICHARD KIRSHENBAUM Executive Creative Director, Kirshenbaum & Bond \\"An interview is unlike other conversational situations because there are going to be judgments made all along the way. What I'm looking for is a person who's comfortable with his own package. When someone dresses in a manner unlike his normal habit, it always shows. Dress at the upper end of your daily repertoire. True, in my profession, anything goes, but what impresses me most is when, within 60 seconds, I no longer see the clothes and begin to focus on the person. If I were interviewing me, I'd wear a dress shirt, open at the collar; the best belt I could find, because it's a detail that isn't oppressive; jeans, for sure, because they're the only comfortable pants for me, and casual shoes.

Once inside a library's portals, the rush of sightseeing can be put aside; in hushed silence I can rest my feet, collect my thoughts, browse through best sellers, and even take a look at a historical manuscript or two.   Libraries in many cities, in fact, should be included on the traveler's sightseeing schedule - if not for their promise of rest or for their collection, then for their architectural interest. And for the bibliophile, London is ideal. The city boasts countless libraries tucked away in its many corners; between them, they provide entry to some of the world's more priceless collections in settings that range from Victorian to Art Deco. As Boswell once ruminated: ''In London I suppose we may find every book that should be found anywhere.''   Certainly almost any book one could want can be found at the British Library. Housed inside the British Museum, the library's collection is staggering: some 15.5 million volumes, manuscripts that range from Magna Carta to Scott's Antarctic diaries. By law, a copy of every newspaper and book published in Britain must be deposited here.

But by the end of the 1967 season, his major league career was over.   \\"I was in two other World Series with the Dodgers, but I don't hardly remember them,\\" Nick Willhite was saying now. \\"When you're half-loaded, you don't know if you'll be able to perform.\\"   For 30 years he drank too much. After three divorces, he was without a job, almost without a family. His six children were scattered. His grandchildren shied away from him.   \\"There were times,\\" he said, \\"when I didn't even know my grandchildren were around.\\"   On Oct. 14, 1989, he awoke in a stupor. The World Series would open later that day but Nick Willhite's world was closing. He was living in Salt Lake City in a two-room apartment, which he remembers as \\"a filthy little hole.\\" Then 48 years old, he knew that his drinking had cost him farm-system jobs with the Kansas City Royals, Milwaukee Brewers and the Yankees.   \\"I hadn't made up my mind to commit suicide, but that's how I was thinking,\\" he said. \\"I had no money, no car, no nothing. I went to my son Monte's office to call some people, figuring I'd never see them again.\\"   Thumbing through his address book to the W's, he phoned his parents. No answer. The next number was that of Stan Williams, now the Cincinnati Reds' pitching coach and once his Dodger teammate. Williams answered the phone. As they talked, he realized Willhite's desperation.   \\"Have you thought about treatment?\\" Williams said.   His body shaking, Willhite agreed that he needed it.   \\"Promise me you won't do anything crazy,\\" Williams said. \\"You'll be hearing from the people at BAT.\\"   In his stupor, Willhite fell asleep. Then the phone rang.   \\"Nick, my name is Frank Slocum,\\" a voice said. \\"I'm the executive director of BAT, the Baseball Assistance Team that helps former ballplayers. Stan Williams told me about you and I have only one question: Do you really want help?\\"   \\"Yes,\\" Willhite said, \\"I really want help.\\"   Two days later, Willhite was on his way to entering an alcohol-abuse rehabilitation center in Fort Collins, Colo.   \\"I literally owe my life to BAT,\\" Willhite said.   Based in the baseball commissioner's office in New York, BAT is the other side of baseball's big money. If a former ballplayer, a ballplayer's widow or anybody in the baseball family is down on their luck or really wants help dealing with alcohol or drug problems, BAT is there to provide it.   Almost all those helped by BAT have preferred anonymity. But hoping to help others, Willhite told his story, which began in 1959 when he had his first beer at age 18 upon returning from his first season in the Dodger farm system. He had been a $50,000 bonus prospect out of high school.   \\"As a boy, I had a learning disability","excerpt":"I couldn't decode the teacher's language,\\" he recalled. \\"On the ball field natural instinct took over. But that first beer gave me a feeling I never had before. My fear and frustration were over. After that, I drank to get that feeling.\\"   Despite his drinking, Willhite made the Dodgers at age 22, a left-hander with a slinky motion that baffled left-handed hitters.   \\"If he had Bill White to pitch to all the time,\\" White, the current National League president, recalled, \\"he'd have never lost a game.\\"   \\"The worst swing I ever took at a pitch was against Nick Willhite,\\" remembered Rusty Staub, then with the Houston Astros.    After the 1964 season the Dodgers traded him to the Washington Senators, then reacquired him in 1965. After finishing with the Angels and the Mets, he had a 6-12 career record. He also had a reputation for late hours and late arrivals at the ball park, a reputation that followed him as a minor league pitching instructor.   \\"I blew jobs; I'm not blaming anybody but myself,\\" he said. \\"I bottomed out after my last divorce.\\"   Shortly after Willhite returned to Salt Lake City following his 30-day rehabilitation, another familiar baseball name, Herman Franks, once the manager of the Giants and Cubs, helped him find his own place. Now he's studying to be a drug-addiction counselor.   \\"I got my 1963 World Series ring back,\\" Willhite said. \\"I'd hocked it to a friend of mine when I needed $1,100 to get my car fixed. When Don Newcombe told Peter O'Malley of the Dodgers about how I'd hocked my ring, Peter paid my friend what I owed him.\\"   Nick Willhite also has his family back. His six kids from his three marriages, and his six grandchildren.   \\"My kids talk to me now,\\" he said with a soft laugh. \\"My grandchildren even want to sit on my lap.\\" When Phone Rang For Nick Willhite"},{"year":"1974","title":"Many players of moderate experience are fearful about verturing into tournament play. &#8220","excerpt":"I couldn't do it,&#8221; they say, &#8220;I don't understand all those modern conventions.&#8221; Their fears are to a great extent. groundless, for two reasons.

My Uncle Ivan, who was something of a tosspot and therefore irresistible to a small boy growing up amid the middle-class verities of Akron, Ohio, showed me one day some faded photographs of his prewar trip across the Gobi Desert, and I was hooked. As simple as that.   Since then, I have meandered through all 50 states, through the Caribbean and Africa, Europe and Asia, Australia and the Middle East - more than 100 countries all told.

Saddened, because of the bitterness that infused the piece. Puzzled, that our almost precisely parallel backgrounds and experiences should lead us to such different outlooks.   I am in my 36th year as a professional and senior officer in the same company where he spent the last 15 years of his career. Our titles and \\"perks\\" are the same. I, too, am a lawyer, veteran, husband, father and suburban resident. I am (still) a registered Republican.   As I contemplate my own retirement a few years hence, I do not look back upon \\"arrogance and greed that characterized so many of our actions as corporate officers\\" in a \\"vacuous\\" corporate environment. Quite the contrary. I have spent my entire professional career with a corporation whose business is saving and prolonging lives and enhancing the quality of those lives -- the pharmaceutical industry, which is also an important contributor to the economy of New Jersey.   My company is law-abiding, socially aware and politically conscious. It puts its money where its mouth is. I have had and continue to have the opportunity to create and define its policies and practices in the legal, legislative, public and community affairs and philanthropic areas. I have never been asked to do anything illegal, unethical or improper in any way.   I am well compensated","excerpt":"I deserve every dollar I receive, and I am not ashamed to take the money.   I will thus be positioned when I retire to direct my time, effort and energies \\"to some decent, indeed noble cause\\" that fully engages my mind and heart \\"without consideration of power, status or financial gain.\\"   Two things will enable me to do this: I will have the needed financial independence, and I will have matured in a business atmosphere that has nurtured, not stifled, the instincts that cause me to want to engage in some laudable pursuit. I will be doing it not as penance, but with pride.  ALLAN S. KUSHEN  West Orange When Executives 'Give Something Back'"},{"year":"1952","title":"Standiford, Harry R tt. R.

The museum is entered through the back side of Rome’s ugliest monument, Il Vittoriano, a bright white late 19th Century creation to commemorate Italian unification. (For those who have just done the Schnabel exhibit, Il Vittoriano is the bright white monstrosity right across Piazza Venezia.) The Chagalls could be better organized and displayed, but there are dozens of terrific paintings spanning 6 decades of the artist’s work. Particularly interesting for those in Rome who are overdosed on traditional religious art, are Chagall’s unconventional renderings of the Bible, in which Jesus is shown with all the trappings of Judaism (notice the Torah), placed in what looks like Chagall’s birthplace in a village in Russia. To finish your visit, head upstairs to the museum’s outdoor cafe, on a terrace overlooking the ruins of the Imperial Forum. The coffee is excellent. The sangria not bad. Most important, the terrace has one of the best panoramas of Rome, with excellent signs that help you make sense of the forest of spires and arches you are seeing.

A good escape just might be Friday's It's Alive: the Monster Party, at the newly renovated Webster Hall, at 125 East 11th Street, once the home of the downtown Ritz. Featuring 20 or so disk jockeys in four different rooms playing four different styles of music -- deep house, rave, dance-hall reggae and industrial -- it brings together the avant-garde of the club scene. And it's only $10.   But best of all, the money earned by the show (none of the disk jockeys are charging for their work) will go to Lifebeat, an organization formed by members of the music community to raise money to support AIDS research.   For DB, a disk jockey who will be featured in the rave section of the show and is one of its organizers, the party has a personal side to it. \\"A friend of mine got sick from the disease,\\" he said. \\"It was the first time it had happened to me, and I felt helpless","excerpt":"I didn't know how to deal with it. I know how to throw parties, so that seemed to be a solution.\\"   DB went to Gari Pini, a vice president for Profile Records, and asked him to help.   \\"We pretty much figured out the whole concept,\\" Mr. Pini said. \\"We got all the D.J.'s and the printers for the invites and the posters and got everybody to volunteer. We had to rent the hall and we really wanted to keep the ticket price to $10. We see benefits, and they're all $50 or $900 or something crazy. We wanted a benefit for normal people. To keep the prices down, we went to the record companies and got them to contribute money in advance to pay the overhead. We're still $2,000 short, but we figure something will come up. But every ticket we sell, the money will go to Lifebeat.\\"   The show's idea is to mix subcultures. Each of the four categories has its own constituency and its own specific codes, but the producers want people to experiment with each genre, to hear the possibilities. The disk jockeys, including Tony Humphries and Todd Terry for the deep-house room, Kevin Saunderson and DB for the rave room, Bobby Konders for the dance hall, and Reese for the industrial room are among the most popular disk jockeys working. Each genre is made for dancing, but clubgoers pay attention to the differences among styles, from Jamaican dance-hall music -- with its syncopations and its raplike toasting -- to the dissonance-filled grinding sounds of industrial music.   \\"I hope people move around from room to room,\\" DB said. \\"I think the club scene has become a bit stagnant over the last year or so. People are closed to different types of music; they just want to hear one type. The idea is to really soak up what these D.J.'s can do, really taste all sorts of stuff.\\"   Mr. Pini said: \\"These are the four kinds of music that are on the cutting edge of new music. It's all great, really exciting music. We also tried to keep the emphasis on D.J.'s instead of live acts, because with live acts so many things can go wrong. D.J.'s, we know them all, and they were all happy to do it.\\" Dark, but Not Sinister    A new love man has entered the pop world in the form of the 24-year-old English singer Ephraim Lewis. Mr. Lewis, like so many of his musical predecessors, comes with a church pedigree; he grew up in a Jamaican pentecostal church, listening to records by Andre Crouch and Al Green. He has just released his first album, \\"Skin\\" (Elektra), and it's a trip behind closed doors. Not so much because of the subject matter, but because the production, full and whispery, gives the record the sound of intimacy.   \\"It's very mellow and there's a kind of dark quality to it, but it's not sinister,\\" Mr. Lewis said. \\"There's an underlying melancholy to it, but there's also the positive side that appeals to people. Pop music tries to make you feel a certain way, but I'd rather evoke a mood that can be translated different ways even in same song.\\"   The album mixes bits of American soul and gospel with a cool English soul approach. Mr. Lewis can move his voice around easily, and he can make it sound as if passion were his thing, even if he's showing it off quietly. Touches of the English singer Sade appear, and a lot of thought went into writing the melodies. And while Mr. Lewis produced mostly love songs, they're elliptical and vague, perfect for the gauzy sound of the music.   \\"The songs are stretching the boundaries a bit, they aren't made up of traditional lyrics, they're a bit intellectual,\\" Mr. Lewis said. \\"Honestly, you get a bit tired of 'Baby, baby I love you.' The music on the album is about sharing the same outlook on life and spirituality.\\" The Pop Life"},{"year":"1995","title":"LARRY and I were married on Dec. 17, and I moved from Manhattan into his house in Verona.

Maybe you think I'm just throwing words out, but that's how I feel.\\"   On the three previous days -- Sunday through Tuesday -- the Braves won their games, only to have the Dodgers later win theirs and retain their one-game advantage. This time, though, the Dodgers' half of the trick did not work. After the Braves beat Cincinnati, 6-3, Wednesday night, the Dodgers lost to San Diego, 9-4, before a barrage of bizarre bunt hits and other infield singles, and the teams suddenly had the same record: 92 victories and 67 defeats.   Each has three games left, the Braves here with the last-place Houston Astros, the Dodgers in San Francisco with the fifth-place Giants. If they emerge with the same record after the weekend encounters, they will play Monday night in Los Angeles for the championship. However it is done, the winner will meet the Pirates beginning next Wednesday in Pittsburgh for the National League pennant. The Pendulum Swings    Although the consensus in recent weeks had given the Dodgers the edge because of their race-hardened experience, the Braves suddenly must be viewed as the team with an advantage.   They are playing at home; the Dodgers are playing on the road. They are playing the Astros, a scrappy team without a single ever-present threat; the Dodgers are playing the Giants, a disappointing team with an injured Kevin Mitchell but with a revived Will Clark and Matt Williams and a chance to leapfrog past the defending champion Reds into fourth place.   The Braves also have an overwhelming edge in pitching, at least for the first two games of their series. Steve Avery, a 17-game winner, who held the Dodgers to one run in 18 innings in two successive starts last month, will pitch Friday night against Jeff Juden, a rookie with major league experience totaling two starts and one relief appearance, not to mention a 6.23 earned run average.   John Smoltz, who has an 11-2 record since the All-Star break, will pitch Saturday against Mark Portugal, a veteran with a 10-11 record, who was skipped in his last two turns while Juden and Brian Williams, another rookie, started. Sunday Could Be Dicey    The thorniest problem for the Braves could come Sunday, if the race is still alive. They will use Charlie Leibrandt, who has 15 victories but none in his last four starts (the Reds scored six runs off him in the first inning Tuesday night). The Astros are scheduled to start Pete Harnisch, their best pitcher with 11 victories and a 2.64 earned run average, the league's fifth lowest. But he has had a sore shoulder and there is a chance he will not pitch.   But the Braves were not pondering those matchups today. They were hunting deer and doing all of those other fun things.   For the Dodgers, though, it was a different matter.   Candlestick Park is where the Dodgers lost the 1982 division championship, which the Braves won on the last day.   \\"They've got to be thinking about '82,\\" said Olson, who today wasn't thinking about '91. \\"Especially if it comes down to the last game. Even though probably none of them were there, except Tommy Lasorda and maybe a couple coaches.\\" Calm Braves Are Happy Hunters"},{"year":"1973","title":"George Foreman, the financially pressed heavyweight champion, frowns on one method of making ends meet: &#8220","excerpt":"I don't care about making movies and television commercials.

He had just completed a nearly flawless performance in the technical program at the European championships, and his compact frame was quivering with emotion.   This was no exhibition, no routine evening's work in yet another North American arena with only the applause meter as his judge and jury.   This was genuine competition, exactly the kind of forum he had been craving when he sat down with his American agent, Michael Rosenberg, last spring and laid out his plans to regain eligibility for the 1994 Olympics.   While the voluble Rosenberg railed on about the \\"high six-figure\\" earnings Petrenko would be kissing goodbye during the coming professional season and the damage an Olympic flop could inflict on his future drawing power, the Ukrainian with the Las Vegas, Nev., address calmly turned, and according to Rosenberg, said: \\"Michael, I am an athlete. The Olympics says I can come back, so I must go back.\\"   End of conversation. End of high six-figure earnings, at least temporarily. 'Nothing to Lose'    \\"I have nothing to lose,\\" said Petrenko, who turned 24 in June. \\"Skating is what I live for.\\"   Skating has certainly shaped his life. Born in the Black Sea port city of Odessa in what was then the Soviet Union, Petrenko began working with the coach Galina Zmievskaya at the age of 10. He has never had another teacher, and in the summer of 1992, several months after he won the gold medal in the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, their long association took on an added dimension when Petrenko married Zmievskaya's daughter, Nina, in Odessa.   The newlyweds soon set up house in Las Vegas, a city where ice is usually restricted to cocktail glasses. Petrenko picked it as his professional training base because one of his friends was the director of skating at the Santa Fe Ice Rink, which lies in the Nevada desert about 10 miles away from the myriad, man-made distractions of \\"The Strip.\\"   \\"I see a lot of casinos, but I don't play","excerpt":"I don't like to gamble,\\" said Petrenko, who owns a comfortable townhouse near the Sante Fe rink in a fenced-in development (Rosenberg prefers the term \\"gated community.\\")   After headlining a 72-city ice show tour and participating in the 59-city Tom Collins tour, Petrenko flew back to Odessa with Nina in June last year to begin preparations for his third Olympics. Once again, he will be marching behind a different flag in the opening ceremony. Won Bronze in Calgary    In 1988, Petrenko won bronze for the Soviet Union in Calgary, finishing behind Brian Boitano and Brian Orser. In 1992, he won gold while representing the euphemistically titled Unified team. This year, he will be skating for Ukraine.   \\"It will be a great chance to skate for a new country; it makes me more happy,\\" he said.   Petrenko would be happier still if his surrogate sister-in-law, Oksana Baiul, could soar to a gold medal of her own. Baiul, who won the world championship last year at age 15, was taken in by Zmievskaya in 1992 after losing her mother, Marina, to cancer and her coach, Stanislav Koritek, to a secure job in Canada. (Baiul's father, who is still alive, left the family when she was an infant.)   Petrenko has been supportive of Baiul from the start, supplying her with equipment and financial assistance. The two skaters have developed a close relationship, training together with Zmievskaya for the last five months on the soft, unpredictable ice of the Odessa Sports Palace.   Though some could question Petrenko's decision to train in such conditions (he recently felt obliged to purchase a skate-sharpening machine for the rink), he claims to have never hesitated. \\"My family is in Odessa, and all my friends; it's home,\\" he said. No Illusions    But Petrenko harbors no illusions about the role of figure skating in a nation where people remain concerned with finding and affording their daily bread.   \\"There are no popular athletes in Ukraine,\\" he said. \\"People are more interested in political situations. Yeltsin and Kravchuk are more popular than athletes. People are too busy thinking about what's going to happen tomorrow.\\" He was referring to the Russian president, Boris N. Yeltsin, and the Ukrainian president, Leonid Kravchuk.   Perhaps. But when a Russian television broadcaster erroneously reported last month that Petrenko was in danger of not qualifying for the final round of the European men's competition (he ended up winning), hundreds of Ukrainians were interested enough to call the federation and express their shock and dismay.   \\"Our director was pretty busy for a day,\\" said Vladimir Geraschenko, a spokesman for the figure-skating federation.   Whether Petrenko can bring a psychological lift to his troubled homeland depends a great deal on his ability to skate cleanly. In all his years as a world-class competitor, he has always stumbled in either his original or free program in the big events. In Albertville, he fell on a triple axel in his long program but still won because nobody else kept their feet either.   This time, the competition will be considerably stiffer with Boitano, a healthy Kurt Browning and two emerging talents in Scott Davis and Elvis Stojko.   \\"Most of all, I want to be in the Olympics and do a good job of showing my programs,\\" Petrenko said. \\"What place I get doesn't matter.\\"   It might matter to his earning power, but even Rosenberg, the man who monitors the cash flow, has learned to live with that risk.   \\"Viktor always laughs with me that he is going to do three more Olympics,\\" Rosenberg said. \\"I tell him I'll catch up with him when he's 40.\\" To Petrenko, Olympics Worth More Than Gold"},{"year":"1959","title":"We need another Harold Ross.

Seem too good to believe? Read on.    The prices cited above appeared in The New York Times on Feb. 5 in big, bold type in a full-page advertisement of International Weekends of Boston, which describes itself as ''America's Largest Charter Vacation Enterprise.'' As is typical for vacation packages using charter aircraft, however, each price was accompanied by an asterisk, and that's where the arithmetic begins.   Take the week in Peru, for example. Smaller type said that $379 was a ''sale'' price, good only on a tour leaving March 5 and only if tickets were bought by ''Saturday,'' which meant Feb. 11. Other small type cautioned that sale prices ''may be limited to the lesser of 25 or available seats.'' Asked by telephone what ''available'' meant, Rodney E. Gould, vice president and general counsel of the company, replied: ''A whole bunch of empty seats which we have to fill","excerpt":"I don't think it would be one, two or three.'' The regular price for the March 5 departure was listed as $459. Later departures were listed at $469 for March 26 and $499 for April 9 and 16, with no ''sale'' prices offered.

On the walls, she hung her one&#8208;of&#8208;a&#8208;kind, brilliantly colored wool rugs. &#8220;They're all made of Paternayan yarn, the kind often used for needlepoint,&#8221; Miss Swanson said. &#8220;Instead of a hand tapestry technique I use the mechanics of the loom. There's an infinite variety possible, depending on the colors and the width of the stripes.&#8221; Her weft&#8208;faced rugs are either solid or striped. They are durable, meant to be walked on and can be dry&#8208;cleaned. She designs the patterns, draws the designs on graph paper to scale and picks out the colors, but hires other weavers to make them. She also works with designers and clients on special commissions. None of the rugs are more than four feet wide because &#8220;that's basically the limitation of my loom,&#8221; she said. The rugs cost $40 a square foot; 4- by 6&#8208;foot rug is about $1,000.

What I did not realize was that there were nine caves open to the public at Jenolan, and on a day trip from Sydney it is possible to visit only one. On that visit I chose Lucas Cave from the options offered on the tour, and marveled at its vast chambers adorned with stalactites and stalagmites. But curiosity about the caves I didn't see made me want to return","excerpt":"I finally managed to do so last August. As a cave lover who has roamed through caverns in the United States, France and Italy, I was delighted by what I found.    About 300 caves are estimated to exist in the Jenolan region, all thought to be part of a vast interconnected system. Although Jenolan derives from an aboriginal word meaning \\"high mountain,\\" the aborigines are not known to have explored the underground labyrinths. Each of the caves that tourists see has its own name, and the entrances to most are inside an enormous natural bridge called the Grand Arch.

If you have a man, that is, in the way that Bertie Wooster had Jeeves, the nonpareil gentleman's gentleman, the sort that they do not make them like anymore.   This delightful session of theater is brilliantly performed by Edward Duke, who also conceived it and adapted the amusing words of the author, P.G. Wodehouse, from print to proscenium.   Bertie Wooster and Jeeves were creations of Wodehouse, who set the vapid 24-year-old master and his imperturbable valet in so many hysterically funny stories back in the 1920's and through the 30's.  Perhaps you are, like the young lady out to ensnare Wooster in matrimony, ''steeped to the gills in serious purpose.'' If so, you might look for deep sociology in Wodehouse and realize that he is a super social anthropologist who has made a significant case study of Britain's decadent upper classes, members of the club Wodehouse calls ''The Drones.''

In ''Patterns of Intention'' (Yale University) by Michael Baxandall, Picasso rejects the idea of painting as research.   Among the several sins that I have been accused of, none is more false than that I have, as the principal objective in my work, the spirit of research. When I paint, my object is to show what I have found and not what I am looking for. . . . The idea of research has often made painting go astray, and made the artist lose himself in mental lucubrations. Perhaps this has been the principal fault of modern art. The spirit of research has poisoned those who have not fully understood all the positive and conclusive elements in modern art and has made them attempt to paint the invisible and, therefore, the unpaintable. . . . The several manners I have used in my art must not be considered as an evolution, or as steps towards an unknown ideal of painting. All I have ever made was made for the present. The Eyes of the Overwhelmed In one of the essays in ''River Journeys'' (Hippocrene), Germaine Greer describes an old man in a market in the valley of the Rio Sao Francisco in Brazil. When she asks him for something he can't supply, a hopelessness comes over his face, the look of a man who will never have what he needs.
