The man was a connoisseur, and he spent Saturday mornings visiting some of the city's leading wine stores, looking for bargains, seeking out wines that were relatively inexpensive in their youth but that would appreciate in value rapidly as they aged, wines that would taste better if only because they were consumed when their value had become awesome.

We were rewrite men who were supposed to write late-breaking stories right until the last edition closed. It was a time when many things happened at night: riots, student seizures of campuses, the shootings of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. Still, for my friend and me there was plenty of time for talk and confession. Often the two of us were too excited to head home when our shift ended, and we would walk the streets in argument and conversation, heading for breakfast in Chinatown.   When I first came to know my friend, he reflected a short-back-and-sides view of life. He had been an officer in the Air Force and one of the first Peace Corps volunteers. Amid the psychedelic rebellion of those days, we were all changing, but my friend's transformation turned out to be more dramatic and more lasting. He let his hair grow long and was one of the first men I knew to put on an earring. He spent an increasing amount of energy on his hobbies and showed less and less concern for career and family. With manic delight he would throw himself into artistic projects, one of which involved making rubbings of manhole covers and reproducing the designs on plywood by silk-screening them in bright colors. About Men","excerpt":"Notes From Underground"},{"year":"1996","title":"What was it like to be an insider in Andy Warhol's Factory? You'll get only a vague idea from Mary Woronov in SWIMMING UNDERGROUND: My Years in the Warhol Factory (Journey Editions, $19.95), her account of the years she spent as a dancer with the Exploding Plastic Inevitable and an actress in movies like \\"The  Chelsea Girls.\\" This is no how-it-was memoir seen from sober, reflective middle  age. Ms. Woronov writes as if she had been in a perpetual amphetamine haze, too high to notice much of what was going on besides drugs. In her Factory, there was no music, except for a mention that the Velvet Underground's Lou Reed  \\"had two iron mistresses, music and heroin,\\" and no art but for the night Warhol was seen sketching noses. There was a lot of crawling on bathroom floors and hanging out with drag queens at Max's Kansas City. Ms. Woronov recalls filming \\"The Chelsea Girls,\\" and possibly another movie, but she wasn't sure if the camera was on. This Factory alumna offers few insights into the famous-for-being-famous people around her. THE VELVET YEARS: Warhol's Factory 1965-67 (Thunder's Mouth/Publishers Group West, $24.95) brings the Factory into  focus, and not just because the book consists principally of photographs. Stephen Shore, who had the run of the loft, took enigmatic, posed but casual portraits of the Factory's denizens: Edie Sedgwick, Lou Reed, International Velvet, Ondine, Ingrid Superstar, Billy Name, Ultra Violet, Mary Woronov. In accompanying interviews by the novelist Lynne Tillman, we hear about Warhol's dedication to his work, and about the critical reaction. Paul Morrissey describes the artist as dependent on others to do things for him, and claims there were no wild parties, while Jonas Mekas remembers great parties with guests like Montgomery Clift and Tennessee Williams. And Billy Name recalls the  day Warhol was shot by Valerie Solanas and nearly died. Andy Warhol remains elusive, but it's clear his acolytes loved him -- even though they agree he wasn't much of a talker and was cheap.

After hauling two duffel bags stuffed with bills from a park in upper Manhattan, two suspects, one of whom was an employee, were arrested and a third was arrested later.
