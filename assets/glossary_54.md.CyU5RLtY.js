Neither political expediency nor judicial desire was sufficient to change the clear import of the language of the Constitution. The Bill of Rights did not apply to the states - and, he said, that was that. ''Until 1925, that is.

This past year Mrs. Mellon has been occupied overseeing the completion of her own new garden library, a building designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, on the grounds of Oak Spring, the farm where she lives with her husband, Paul Mellon, the art patron and philanthopist.

One of those active little pictures in which the \\"stolen document\\" trades hands so often that one marvels at its durability, the film comes through gallantly with an hour or so of fairly routine entertainment.The object of the espions' affections appears to be a treaty stolen from a French officer. He is sentenced to Devil's Island, but his wife resolves to save him by recovering the paper. She suspects one Dr. Van Wyke and sets her cap—to put it mildly—for the doctor. But little do either of them reckon with Juan Santanda, agent of another power, who has his own designs upon the document. And, when he obtains it, the mystery woman has to reclaim the cap she set for Van Wyke and turn the full barrage of her charms upon the equally impressionable Mr. Santanda.By land and by sea the game goes on, with the espions and the counter-espions cutting the usual capers of their trade: ransacking each other's rooms, leaving knives in the backs of casual victims and, when their cerebral rivalry palls, settling matters once and for all with fisticuffs and gunplay.There's really nothing that can be said of pictures like this","excerpt":"nothing, at least, that has not been said before.

But thanks to the sly dexterity of the writers (and let's include those who provided the basic story, Denis and Mabel Constanduros), \\"The Facts of Love\\" adroitly dances along the borderline and we are permitted to enjoy some hearty guffaws out of naughtily suggestive capers.Don't let the unfamiliarity of the players listed above deter an inspection of \\"The Facts of Love,\\" for they are truly wonderful. Under the circumstances it would not be unreasonable to encounter caricatures instead of characters, but these people manage somehow to maintain an acceptable degree of reasonableness. There is, therefore, enough plausibility to this frothy broth to keep it from skittering off into sheer fancy. We could temper this report just a bit by saying that sometimes the humor misfires and that Carla Lehmann's exaggerated portrayal of a lady on the make is off key, but those are minor matters and we feel sheepish for having mentioned them at all.Now after that build-up one would naturally expect an intriguing plot synopsis.

There is sly suggestiveness and rollicking fun in the impatience of an engaged couple who want to play house in earnest and get into some heated arguments about the respective merits of their future in-laws. And there is more amusement in the awkward eagerness of a young man to learn about life from a lady who is only too willing to teach him.These are ingredients that don't sound captivating in cold type, but in the hands of a capable cast can be surprisingly entieing.

Judging by the general lack of success that follows such takeovers, the latter seems to be the more difficult. The new owner must tailor his style and instincts to those of his predecessor, and he may wind up alienating the very customers he hoped to inherit.   A case in point may well be the newly reopened Le Plaisir on Lexington Avenue, near 70th Street. Formerly owned by Stephen Spector and Peter Josten, this highly successful and trendy establishment featured the intricate dishes of Masataka Kaboyashi, the chef who specialized in the most avant-garde and esoteric expressions of the nouvelle cuisine modified by Japanese garnishes.  Although we were not enthusiastic about his efforts because they seemed contrived and precious, it was obvious that the man had style and achieved what pleased himself.

Among the twenty-nine subjects are an interview with Sinclair Lewis on how it feels to win the Nobel Prize in literature, a demonstration of England's air power, an exhibition of marksmanship by a fleet of American bombing planes, scenes of gayety in a Danish night club, the reception of Coste and Bellonte in Paris, and Chicago's new crime commission in a discussion of the steps taken to combat racketeers.Mr. Courage and Mr. Fear again engage in a dispute on the depression in business, Mr. Courage pointing out that the consumer may be blamed for the absence of prosperity. President Miklas of Austria addresses the enthusiastic populace of Carinthia, kings and princes wind through the narrow streets of Assisi, Italy, in the rain to witness the wedding of King Boris of Bulgaria and Princess Giovanna of Italy, and King George and Queen Mary of England preside at the colorful ceremonies surrounding the opening of Parliament.The most unusual scene is a close-up of a herd of bison at a waterhole on the prairie. Miss United States, just returned from an international beauty contest in Brazil, tells a sad tale of scheming foreign belles and misguided judges. Other scenes show the Maharajah of Mysore making an official visit to one of his Indian shrines, some of the rare manuscripts in the Huntington library, the U. S. S.
