Some Lennon supporters felt then that his anti&#8208;Vietnam war activities had prompted Government plans to deport him. But it was the same judge who ruled yesterday in Mr. Lennon's favor. The testimony of several prominent witnesses in Mr. Lennon's favor apparently made the difference. &#8220;It's great to be legal again,&#8221; said Mr.Lennon.

The cause of the mirth was the audible picture, \\"The Cohens and Kellys in Scotland,\\" which, notwithstanding its execrable punning and its boisterous form of humor, is perhaps the best of the series of adventures of these bickering families.This film has been produced with a keen eye on Scottish atmosphere, and, while the characters are clowns, their antics, whether in business or on the golf links, are certain to afford entertainment for most persons.George Sidney and Charlie Murray are again pitted against each other in this production. They figure respectively as Cohen and Kelly. Vera Gordon acts Mrs. Cohen and Kate Price officiates as Mrs. Kelly.Soon after their arrival in Edinburgh, Cohen and Kelly barter for the sale of plaid material with different Scottish firms. They hope for millions to wear plaids, as the Prince of Morania, who is an arbiter of fashion, is expected to startle society by arraying himself in tartan cloth. At a race track they find their prospects for an enormous increase in their respective fortunes blown sky-high, for the Prince fails to set the fashion with the expected design of cloth. But, toward the end, there is a turn of events that is distinctly disappointing to the Scottish merchants and no end of joy to Messrs. Cohen and Kelly.At the outset Cohen and Kelly are rivals. They hate each other. During one sequence they perform in kilts on a golf links, both knowing that the chief aim of the game is to hit the ball, but both believing that the greatest number of strokes wins the contest. Cohen misses the ball twice, but the third time he hits it. Then he runs, turning up at what he assumes to be the home plate, exhausted but satisfied with his prowess. As the game proceeds and he realizes that it is after all somewhat different from baseball, Mr. Cohen cannot resist the temptation to pick up stray golf balls. Kelly knows better, but far be it from Cohen to believe that Kelly could ever be right.In calling attention to the parsimonious Scot, William James Craft, the director of this offering, shows the agony of an Edinburgh business man pouring out a drink of the native wine for Mr. Kelly, who tries to pretend the word \\"when\\" is not in his vocabulary. McPherson, the Scot, however, finally manages to get it out of him in an unexpected fashion.At the races Cohen is told confidentially that Paradise will win the race. He is admonished by one McDonald not to breathe a word to a soul about the tip. Cohen keeps the secret so well that when he puts up his money with a bookmaker he walks away without mentioning the name of the horse, which, incidentally, comes in first.Both Mr. Sidney and Mr. Murray play their parts effectively. Their voices are admirably recorded. Miss Price and Miss Gordon contribute in a minor way to the gayety of this picture.

The current exhibition, which will be at the Daniel Wolf Gallery, 30 West 57th Street, through Oct. 29, makes no attempt to be definitive.

In this world of mingled fantasy and reality, where cause and effect are often irrelevant, and fears are formless, a child's only tools - weapons, if you wish - are wit and imagination: internally consistent, but often not grounded in experience.    The charm and reassuring moral of stories such as \\"Home Alone,\\" \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" (where a witch is melted) or \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" (where a witch is roasted alive) is that children can deal with their fears by relying on their own resources. Macaulay Culkin does just that after spending a night cowering under his absent parents' bed. It does not matter that only perfect buffoons would be outwitted by an 8-year-old; children know them for what they represent, not what they are.    In this sense, the best children's stories are far from innocent, but also far from pointless. I am more concerned about letting my children watch the daily recitation of the police blotter on local television news.    I submit that the childish yuks in Ms. Weber's theater sprang from relief, from a juvenile faith in the triumph of good over evil, rather than from some baser level.

In 1989, just before the fall of the German Democratic Republic, Christiane (Katrin Sass) sees her son beaten by police during a riot. She falls into a coma and the Berlin Wall — and all that implies — collapses during that time. &quot;Mother slept through the relentless triumph of capitalism,&quot; Alex notes. Any sudden shock could kill her, so Alex contrives to keep her convinced that things are still the same. Alex has to rescue the paste-board furniture that he and his sister were happy to heave onto a junk heap; the utilitarian design of the furniture seems to inform us that East Berlin may have been where Ikea got its ideas from. There are a few bright jokes and sharp observations in &quot;Lenin!&quot; Alex's determination eventually pulls in everyone he knows; instead of paying off East German officials for better supplies, he's now giving money to kids to dress as Young Pioneers — the East German equivalent of Boy Scouts — to serenade his mother. His boyhood idol — a cosmonaut who now occupies a reduced station in life — becomes part of the imposture. And his best friend and fellow satellite television installer recreates old-school newscasts. The laughs grow out of the elaborate lies they have to construct when Christiane inadvertently glimpses the new world. But the zing of the &quot;Lenin!&quot; highlights doesn't keep the movie breathless enough.

Arguing that the book is \\"Gorbocentric,\\" Mr. Starr describes me as \\"the proponent of the view that all change has arisen from Mikhail S. Gorbachev's initiative and is dependent upon his continuing activity.\\"   This is flatly inaccurate","excerpt":"my book argues the opposite. Not only does \\"The New Russians\\" lay out antecedents of reforms apart from Mr. Gorbachev, point out his repeated failures in the economy and on the nationalities issues, purposely omit his name from the title and present the dynamic pressures for faster reforms from Boris Yeltsin and democratic reformers now running city governments and republics around the country. But in the very first few pages, in the introduction, \\"The New Russians\\" asserts the thesis that \\"all too much of the time, our focus has been on Gorbachev and whether he will 'make it'; but the most important questions reach beyond Gorbachev personally. In fact, one of the most important things I hope this book will show is that whether Gorbachev 'makes it' or not, the process of change has taken root in the Soviet Union. It may be halting, untidy, embattled, and its course unsteady and sometimes uncertain, but whether or not Gorbachev survives, reform has now acquired a momentum of its own, and it will carry on regardless of his individual fate. . . . Others, now maturing and learning the skills of democracy, will emerge to carry reform forward to another stage, further than Gorbachev himself either intended or was capable of realizing. In time, we may come to see Gorbachev as a transitional figure.\\"   Many other chapters illustrate and support this thesis; in fact, the entire book does.  HEDRICK L. SMITH  Chevy Chase, Md.

At the outset, I think I am obliged to declare myself. From an intimately subjective perspective, this story begins on a subway train in 1946, when my mother and father and I were returning home from visiting friends in Brooklyn. During the evening, my father had used the Polish verb ''to sit'' in a way I had never heard it used before. ''Yes, I sat with him,'' he had said, or, ''We sat there for two years.'' On the train home, I timidly asked him did that mean he had been in jail.

Yet while Chinese regard Mount Tai as one of the most famous places in their land, redolent with a history that goes back to visits by Confucius 2,500 years ago, it rarely appears on tourist itineraries.   It has been about 15 years since China opened up its doors to Western tourists, yet foreigners still crowd into just a few big cities, seeing standard sights, without ever meeting a peasant, even though three-quarters of the nation's 1.2 billion people live in the countryside. The tourism industry, in other words, has fostered a cocoon that allows Westerners to pass through China without ever quite stepping into it. Since returning to the United States after five years in Beijing, I have found that the most common query I get is not about Deng Xiaoping's health but rather about how to escape this cocoon.    What I tell people, to start with, is that it has never been easier to visit the \\"real China\\" beyond the tourist circuit. Independent travel can be frustrating, but with many hotels offering airport pickup and concierges arranging train and air tickets, few foreigners get irretrievably lost. Certainly it is hard to imagine a safer part of the world in which to roam about. While it is possible to take a regular tour of the main cities in China and then tack on a week of individual travel at the end, my recommendation is to go without a tour group if you are comfortable doing so.   The place to begin a self-guided two-week tour is in a Chinese-style courtyard hotel like the Lu Song Yuan or the Hao Yuan, in Beijing. Both hotels are built in the traditional courtyards that were once home to the aristocracy, and the 17-room Hao Yuan was the residence of the former Chairman, Hua Guofeng, until he was ousted by Mr. Deng at the end of the 1970's. Neither is convenient by Western standards -- the staff usually does not speak English and a request for a bucket of ice may take an hour to convey before it is understood and ignored. But the rooms are comfortable and the courtyards are full of the charms of China. On the other hand, if you place a premium on comfort and convenience, stay at the totally modern Palace Hotel, with its pair of gold Rolls-Royces to ferry you around the city. An alternative, also in the center of Beijing, surrounded by little shops and narrow alleys, is the Sara Hotel.   Any guidebook will tell you what to see in Beijing","excerpt":"my favorites are the Forbidden City, the Tibetan-style Yong He Gong temple and Tiananmen Square (including the Mao Zedong mausoleum; despite the rumors about wax, it really is Mao's corpse on display). You might also notice the high red walls of Zhongnanhai, an old imperial compound on the Avenue of Eternal Peace less than a mile west of Tiananmen. It is the new Forbidden City, the workplace and playground for today's Communist leaders. Visitors are not allowed beyond the soldiers at the gate.    Several Beijing hotels and shops rent bicycles for a dollar or so a day; they are one-speed contraptions but are usually functional, and in any case it is far safer to bike in Beijing than it would be in Western cities. Instead of sticking to the main streets, meander through the hutong, or back alleys, where residents live in one-story housing and share toilets with their neighbors. Rooms are so cramped that people often sit in their doorways, munching on watermelon or chatting with neighbors.   Almost everybody makes a side trip from Beijing to the Great Wall, but instead of going by bus, take a taxi and an interpreter. Your hotel can arrange an interpreter for $2.50 an hour or so, or you may simply run across an English-language student who is willing to accompany you for the day and interpret free of charge.   On the way back from the Great Wall, have the taxi driver take a dirt road randomly off the main route until you find yourself in the middle of a little village. You will find the peasants happy to talk to you, through the interpreter, and they'll be thrilled if you have brought a Polaroid camera and can take their photos.   AFTER a few days in Beijing, take the night sleeper train seven hours west to the much-overlooked city of Datong in Shanxi Province. Fifteen hundred years ago, Datong was the capital of the Northern Wei Dynasty, whose legacy is a spectacular cliff of carved Buddhas 10 miles outside the city. The Yungang Grottoes include 53 caves decorated with 51,000 statues and carved reliefs, yet what is most awe-inspiring is the scale of the sculpture: stone Buddhas that soar up to 55 feet high. To me these huge, serene statues in the middle of nowhere are as exhilarating as Europe's Gothic cathedrals, for the offer a similar mix of artistry and spirituality.   While modern Datong itself is a rather grim coal-mining metropolis -- offering a much more realistic slice of urban Chinese life than either Beijing or Shanghai -- it is also less than an hour's drive from the Great Wall. Unlike the reconstructed parts of the wall near Beijing, the wall near Datong is the original -- a crumbling, worn mound of rocks overgrown with shrubbery 2that extends endlessly toward the horizon.   After five or six days in Beijing and Datong, head south to Taian in Shandong Province -- again by train, the means of locomotion for most Chinese traveling between cities. One of your short rail journeys in China should be by hard seat, the cheapest class, which is how ordinary Chinese travel, but the nine-hour journey from Beijing to Taian is not the one to spend jammed in an uncomfortable railroad car as people spit on the floor and converse raucously about the large size of foreigners' noses.   Taian is the town at the base of Mount Tai, or Taishan as the holy mountain is called in Chinese. It is possible to check your luggage by the train station and take a small bag or backpack for the overnight trip up the mountain. Stone steps have been carved up the hillside, so it is not so much mountain climbing as stair climbing. Most people can manage the trek up, with plenty of time for breaks and photographs, in five or six hours. A hotel on the summit, Shenqi Guest House, has private rooms with bath and a decent restaurant; it also offers sleeping bags and rents jackets against the chill. An alarm wakes guests at dawn to see the sun rise and proclaim, as Mao Zedong did, that \\"The east is red.\\"   Confucius climbed Mount Tai and came from a nearby town, Qufu, that is still dominated by the Kong family (Confucius is a European rendering; Confucius himself went by the name of Kong). Qufu is a typical country town, sleepy and gritty, yet it is chock full of temples and historic sites such as the family cemetery of 78 generations of Confucius's descendants. The town is an easy side trip from Mount Tai, or you can get back on the train for the daylong journey to Shanghai.   After several days of roughing it, you may enjoy the plush luxury of a place like the Garden Hotel, in the old French Concession of Shanghai. For the adventurous, the Chinese-run Red Flag Guest House, which used to accommodate only top party officials, now opens its bungalows to capitalists. A charming location and a sense of history and place are the rewards, but don't expect a concierge to arrange tickets or a maid to put mints on your pillow. Shanghai has some wonderful little privately owned restaurants and astonishing discos replete with Madonna-look-alikes, strobe lights and prostitutes who conduct their business with the help of cellular telephones.   The city also abounds with English speakers eager to ply their skills, and one or more of them will probably strike up conversations when you walk along the Bund, the historic riverfront district. Some are aiming to change money or act as paid tour guides, but others simply want to chat in English, and you may be able to find a terrific unofficial tour guide in this way. There are also con men on the waterfront, however: I once saw a pickpocket run down the Bund, chased by his victim and several onlookers; when a bus stopped on the main avenue, people inside jumped out to join the chase as well. The pickpocket was tackled, beaten up and then handed over to a policeman before the bus resumed its way.    After a couple of days in Shanghai take the two-hour, 20-minute flight to Guilin, a southern city in Guangxi Province that is the jumping-off point for daylong boat trips on the beautiful Li River. Three-day and four-day cruises on the Yangtze River in central China have become popular among foreigners as well, but the Li River is more scenic and eats up much less of a two-week vacation.   The Li River courses through spectacular rocky crags that are the inspiration for much of traditional Chinese watercolor landscapes. Children swim naked in the river as the boats pass, and peasants till the soil with water buffalo. The countryside is enchanting, so hire a taxi driver and an English interpreter for a half-day excursion to a nearby village, where you are likely to find mud-brick homes, a small elementary school with ramshackle desks, tiny backyard plots with pigs and chickens and flocks of little children who will make you feel like the pied piper. If you bring a few trinkets, someone may well invite you to a dinner of stir-fried vegetables and tofu with rice.    From Guilin, take a 60-minute flight to Guangzhou, the bustling southern metropolis also known as Canton. Ever since the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century, Guangzhou has been at the front line of interaction between China and the West, and it was partly because of intrigues among Western traders here that the Opium War broke out and Hong Kong was ceded to Britain. The free markets of Guangzhou are among the most vibrant in the nation, and the Cantonese have a national reputation as sophisticates and gourmets. Yet while the Cantonese make great food, they don't know where to draw the line with ingredients.   One interesting but depressing sight is the Qingping Market, where turtles, salamanders, snakes, dogs and just about everything else are sold to be eaten. Afterward, intrepid tourists may wish to go to a snake restaurant or rat restaurant in Guangzhou. Snakes, in particular, are regarded as a virtual health food, a Chinese equivalent of alfalfa sprouts.    For those on a two-week itinerary, it is time to move on toward Hong Kong for the flight back. If you do not have too much luggage, take a bus or taxi for a few hours to Shenzhen, the boom town next to Hong Kong. Fifteen years ago Shenzhen was just a sleepy farming town; now it is a dynamic industrial city with a stock exchange, glass-and-steel skyscrapers, pin-striped lawyers and hundreds of factories churning out televisions, shoes and toys for consumers around the world.   From Shenzhen it is easy to walk across the border into Hong Kong, with only brief formalities with Chinese and Hong Kong immigration officials. On the Hong Kong side, trains take everyone to the urban areas. Alternatively, express trains run direct from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and minimize problems for those burdened by lots of luggage. The overland route is worthwhile simply because it conveys the feel of an endless construction zone; Guangdong Province has the fastest-growing economy in the world, and everywhere you look buildings are going up. Westerners joke that the official local bird is the crane.   For those with an extra week, Tibet makes a delightful side trip from Beijing. But be sure to get out of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, and visit smaller towns such as Shigatse, site of a beautiful monastery and the traditional headquarters of the Panchen Lama, second only to the Dalai Lama in the Tibetan hierarchy. As everywhere in China, it is fascinating to visit the nomads and peasants who make up the bulk of Tibetans. Rural Tibet is still one of the most remote places in the world. I once met a Tibetan woman who was puzzled when I asked her whether her village had electricity. It turned out that she had never heard of electricity.   Most flights to Lhasa stop over in Chengdu, in Sichuan Province, the potbelly of China, and Chengdu makes a terrific break for a day or two. It is a somewhat grimy, very typical Chinese city of narrow lanes, tiny family-managed restaurants and, in the outskirts, peasants toiling over doll-sized plots of land. Moreover, Chengdu has, for my taste buds, the best food in China. I once took two Americans to dinner at a hole-in-the-wall restaurant near the Jinjiang Hotel, and our table was soon laden with delicious spicydishes; there was more than the three of us could eat, yet the bill -- including beer -- was less than $5.    IN any case, wherever one goes in China, perhaps the most important thing is to spend time with the people.    In many cities, so-called English corners are set up one or more nights a week for local people to get together and practice English. Americans are hugely welcomed. Similarly, university campuses are a good place to meet English-speaking Chinese, and even on the streets you may meet someone who will invite you into a home for dinner.   In particular, spend at least a day in the countryside. My most interesting moments in China were spent in the villages, and the fascination was often mutual. On my first trip to China, in 1983, I was waiting for a train at a station in a rural part of Shandong Province, and so I sat down and began reading my guidebook. A few peasants gathered in front of me, watching me for entertainment, as if I were a movie. Then others approached, and soon dozens of them were sitting in a semi-circle around me, pointing and staring.    Soon nearly 100 peasants were sitting on the ground in front of me, the adventurous ones crawling in front of me to look at the cover of the book I was reading, and the episode ended only when the alarmed authorities led me to a small room and barred the audience from following. It was an encounter between two worlds, and I found it just as extraordinary as they did. IF YOU GO    In Beijing, an interpreter, official or unofficial, can negotiate to rent a regular taxi for the day for about $80 or a minivan (which are not allowed to pick up foreigners up at hotels) for $40. In other cities taxis should be a bit cheaper. Train travel is not expensive: a first-class train ticket from Shanghai to Guangzhou costs about $30.   Hotel prices are for a double room, calculated at the rate of 8.5 Chinese yuan (renminbi) to the dollar. The country code for China is 86.

I discovered this for myself two years ago when I was asked to give a speech to a teachers' convention in Miami on what I had learned about multiculturalism from living in Beirut. I explained that watching Lebanon, a multiethnic society, unravel had instilled in me two very strong beliefs: one was the importance of the American public school system.

They're mostly interested in making a living.   As an impressionable Ivy League youth in the 1950's I studied the Western cultural tradition; this was also known as getting through. If the teacher liked Marx, I became a leftist. To my middle-of-the-road history teacher I was a liberal. With the right-wing religion professor, it was conservative all the way. And in science classes, I was totally objective and apolitical.   I had some worthwhile extracurricular experiences, passed my tests with flying colors, received great recommendations, handed my ticket of admission to the next institution and happily forgot all courses, 99 percent of the ideas and most of the professors soon after the final examination.   Eventually, consistent with research on the subject, I adopted my parents' iconoclastic and humanistic values, which calls to mind the words of Kingman Brewster, late president of Yale University: \\"To many students of proven intellectual capacity, the prospect of 20 unbroken years of competition for nothing worthier than test scores dampens all aspiration, intellectual as well as active.\\"   It might also help to resurrect the spirit of George Bernard Shaw, who once said, \\"The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school.\\" ROBERT E.

Jim Florio. Now Mrs. Whitman appears to be trying again, this time without a stand-in.    Since the Senate election, she has continued to campaign across New Jersey without letup. She has formed a political action committee, ostensibly to develop issues and to help Republican candidates for the Legislature in November.    But the ultimate goal may be hidden in the committee's telephone number in Somerset: 704-1993. Mr. Florio is up for re-election in 1993. The name of the committee is the Committee for an Affordable New Jersey. Jim Florio is the Governor who engineered the biggest tax increase in the state's history.    Mrs. Whitman laughs off the telephone number as a kind of political joke to needle other potential Republican candidates for governor. \\"That number was fun,\\" she said. \\"Everybody was insisting that I was running for governor when I was running for the Senate.\\"   \\"Cary Edwards said the day after the election that I was going to have to get past him if I was going to run for governor, and I said, all right, I'll make you think a little bit more.\\"    Mr. Edwards, a former Attorney General, lost the Republican primary for governor in 1989 and has made no secret of his intention to run again.   Mrs. Whitman, a former Somerset County Freeholder and former president of the State Board of Public Utilities, turns away questions about her plans with a smile and a standard response: \\"Ask me next year.\\"   Pressed, she adds, \\"Clearly I am interested in what happens in the state, and I want to be a player.\\"   Mrs. Whitman's approach to being \\"a player\\" is at the moment to crisscross the state, speaking to any group that invites her, meeting with candidates, writing a newspaper column, and hosting a regular biweekly talk show on Trenton's WKXW-FM, the radio station that brought the statewide tax protest against Governor Florio and the Democratic Legislature into being.   She talks about the issues, from taxes to teachers, but everywhere there is a consistent and underlying message: \\"People are angry and concerned. Nobody listens, you are being ignored. People are saying politics is so dirty and corrupt that the people who are in it don't really care, and it isn't going to get any better. There is no accountability. There is no credibility.\\"   They are phrases that come up repeatedly in her personal appearances and in her stints as a talk show host. She also often says \\"I don't know all the answers\\" -- but she listens to the questions and she responds sympathetically.   And while she rails against negative campaigning, she is not above slipping in a gibe here and there, as when she told a caller on her radio talk show last week, \\"If the present Governor was a weatherman and predicted sunny, dry weather, people would start reaching for their umbrellas.\\" Plays in Princeton     Nor is she reluctant to tell women, as she did at a panel discussion before a gathering of the Women's Resource Center in Summit last week, \\"Women should support women\\" -- if, she amended, they are qualified.   The whole package seems to play well with her audiences.   At Princeton University, where she spoke to a seminar at the Woodrow Wilson School attended by an audience of about 60 students and townspeople, one young man proclaimed in a question-and-answer period that he had worked for Mr. Bradley in the recent Senate campaign but would work for Mrs. Whitman if she ran for governor.   The young man, 20-year-old Jeff Trost, a junior in the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton, said later: \\"Yeah, I would support her for governor. I would work for her against anybody except Bradley.\\"   An administrator at the Woodrow Wilson School who acted as host, Richard Roper, said afterward that Mrs. Whitman's performance against the Senator, in a race in which he spent $12 million to about $1.6 million for her but barely won by a ratio of 51 percent to 49 percent, established for Mrs. Whitman \\"a national reputation as a rising Republican star.\\"   But Mrs. Whitman concedes that the near victory was not all her doing. Benefit From Backlash     In fact, she \\"ran ahead of her name recognition,\\" as the phrase goes among political analysts.   That means that in her race against Mr. Bradley when voters were asked to name the Republican candidate, many of them could not do so. In fact, though only 34 percent of voters could name the Republican candidate, Mrs. Whitman, 49 percent voted for her. Or rather, they voted against a name they did know -- Bill Bradley.   Mrs. Whitman does not deny that much of her success resulted from a backlash against Mr. Bradley because he refused to condemn -- or even discuss -- Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase, highest in state history.   \\"It was not so much people voting for me to send a message to Florio, although people were certainly doing that,\\" she said at the Princeton appearance, \\"but they were so upset about what was happening in this state that they began questioning people they had never questioned before. If I had asked the same questions of Bill Bradley two years ago that I asked last year, people would have not wanted to listen. But after the tax increase, they were willing to listen and question -- 'What is Bill Bradley doing?' \\"    Mrs. Whitman's stands on the issues are measured and moderate. She says, for example, that she was not nor is she now steadfastly against tax increases. \\"I never took the no-new-taxes pledge when I was running for the Senate,\\" she told a caller on her radio talk show. \\"I don't think you should promise that you won't need new revenues for six years. But I don't think you should turn immediately to the taxpayers every time you have a money problem.\\" Money for Classrooms     Her stands on the issues are standard moderate Republican. She supports a cut in the capital gains tax, for example, but says it should be tailored to \\"help people\\" -- such as eliminating the capital gains tax altogether for money made on investments in the nation's inner cities.   She also supports increased spending -- and taxes to pay for it -- in the schools, if there is \\"accountability -- a guarantee that the money is actually going into the classroom.\\"   She had gained a high profile and important support. Among her advisers is Roger Stone, a partner in the Washington political consulting firm of Manafort, Black, Stone & Kelly that was sold a few months ago to a large lobbying and public relations concern, Burson-Marsteller. 'Strong Potential Candidate'     \\"I gave a thousand dollars to her PAC,\\" Mr. Stone said. \\"We have been talking.\\"   Robert Franks, chairman of the New Jersey Republican Party, said, \\"I think she is an exceptionally strong potential candidate. The 1990 election demonstrated she is strong.\\"   \\"Clearly she's still basking in the glow of 1990 -- she might be considered a frontrunner for statewide office, clearly an outstanding statewide candidaate.\\"   On the other hand, Mr. Franks said, \\"There are a lot of potential candidates, and the whole thing is wide open.\\"   One thing Mrs. Whitman could probably count on if she runs for governor is the support of members of Hands Across New Jersey, the citizens group that spearheaded the tax protest against Mr. Florio and gathered about 800,000 signatures in an anti-tax petition drive.   \\"I hope she'll run,\\" said Pat Ralston, the co-founder of the group, who emphasized that it is nonpartisan. \\"Very definitely there is stong feeling for her among the Hands people, but it is a personal feeling, not a partisan thing.\\"   In looking toward the next campaign, Mrs. Whitman is unabashedly partisan -- \\"My father was Republican state chairman for 10 years","excerpt":"my mother was a Republican committeewoman and head of the New Jersey Federation of Republican Women, immediately preceded by her mother\\" -- but she is gently critical of her own party.   \\"My great concern,\\" she says, \\"is that we Republicans will just say, 'Look at what Florio has done; elect me instead.'

As an early high school graduate, she left Queens, NY for the first time in her life, and began her journey toward a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. The use of the word “journey” is fundamental in this context because one of the most inspirational stories she has to her name is what my mother fondly recalls as her “circuitous path to self-discovery.” This winding route took her to and from various schools across the globe, culminating with an eventual Bachelor of Fine Arts from Minneapolis School of Art and Design and, many years later, a medical degree from Cornell University Medical School. Today it is 2007, and while there is another oil crisis devastating the economies of many American communities, and high ranking officials continue to disregard subpoenas, the college experience has certainly diverged from what it once was. We have come from a generation whose youth believed that the answers to life’s most significant questions were “blowing in the wind,”–to become a new generation of students who want those same answers, right here, right now. Preferably collated. My mother’s college experience, while unique, was not unheard of in the 1960’s and 70’s. Those decades brought about an incredible generation of American adolescents who set out to change the world, one campus at a time","excerpt":"my mother was no exception to this trend. These days, my parents both happily recount experiences of peaceful yet poignant dissidence–my father even has a trove of brightly colored (yet, seldom tie-dyed) pins and badges documenting his participation. To be sure, they were fortunate to grow up in a time where this youthful dissent, while discouraged and opposed, was never effectively quelled. Students felt that their opinions warranted change and consequently, united in their beliefs to create a revolution. Through these demonstrative efforts, they fought for myriad causes of paramount importance: civil rights, humanitarian goals, and of course, peace. In turn, college became a critical time in which students learned from the experience of others and put a unified, tangible strain on conservative minds to consider a more progressive way of life. In March of 1970, for example, there was a protest on the steps of Colby College’s Lorimer Chapel. The protestors quietly assembled for a full week to draw attention to college policies they found were unfair toward minority and underprivileged students. I attend Colby, a private liberal arts college in New England, and I feel extremely proud to be a student at an institution with such a rich history of protest. Yet I admit with resignation, that my college no longer embodies the same activist spirit it once did. Although students sometimes have concerns similar to the Lorimer protestors, nothing remotely comparable to the sit-in would ever occur there today. Indeed, to the dismay of unconventional thinkers everywhere, many of them our own parents, students of my generation are more likely to step either in line or in ‘the box’ then sit down firmly and block the queue.

She never fetishizes food, never revels in its currency or the way it can confer coolness on its partakers. She is not, and never has been, interested in anything trendy. To her, cooking is about using everything at hand -- from leftover Halloween jellybeans to the leafy tops of beets that she bought at the farmer's market that morning to a bunch of marrowbones that the butcher was selling cheap. Unlike the home cooks who seem to be mostly concerned about the image their food projects, Stella is only really interested in pleasing herself. To her, cooking is a sensuous mystery -- a kind of delicious science project -- rather than a referendum on identity.    My mother's relationship to food is directly linked to her upbringing. Stella is a Holocaust survivor. She and her father, mother and older sister were in hiding in what was their barn during the war and then they made their way by foot to a displaced-persons camp in Germany. Her family went from being wealthy landowners in the part of Poland that is now Ukraine to starving nomads in search of safety. In 1949, the family emigrated to Cincinnati. My grandfather felt that New York was teeming with new arrivals and that Ohio would offer more opportunities. Immediately, they learned English, although my mother and her parents usually conversed in Yiddish","excerpt":"my mother will still only count in Polish. Like many immigrants, they built up their income by opening a diner, where my grandmother (along with a short-order cook) was the chef. She mostly specialized in hearty soups and stews. My grandmother made a remarkably delicious apple strudel that my father would ask for long after my parents' divorce. The fact that my grandmother baked my father strudel, even though he'd been banished from her family, tells you a great deal about why her Cincinnati diner was a success: she loved men (the diner was near a factory, and the clientele was primarily male); men loved her (she had four older brothers -- all killed in the war -- and they had doted on her); and even though she had not been raised to work, she was both tough and forgiving, traits that greatly contributed to her survival.

It was as if Ringo had been allowed to front the Beatles, and the Beatles had been permitted to succeed without a single song actually breaking through on the charts. In the mid-70's, when the Ramones first appeared, the band might have seemed a bit of a practical joke, and in many ways that's what it was: exactly the practical joke needed to slash rock music back to its essential mixture of rebellion, frenzy and goofy joy, all in songs lasting less than three minutes, sometimes less than two.    The outpouring of grief at the passing of Joey Ramone on Sunday is partly evidence of the still frustrated cultural identity of a slice of listeners, those of us who will never have an oldies station to call our own.

PART 2    What were these people talking about when they spoke these words?    1) In April, a senior Bush administration official said, ''It would be like having a cheeseburger without cheese.''    2) In March, Dick Conway, an economist in Seattle, said, ''Well, it has made us forget the earthquake all of a sudden.''    3) In September, Alexander Danielides, a junior at the Bronx High School of Science, said, ''The Vietnam generation is a little more cautious than we would be.''    4) In April, Ira Kay, a consultant at Watson Wyatt Worldwide, said, ''It's the gift that keeps on giving.''    5) In June, Representative Richard H. Baker, Republican of Louisiana, said: ''It is one thing for one shark to eat another.

At the point of disembarkation, my camera was missing, my husband was drenched in maple syrup, my son's head had been scalded with burning butter, and I was in a near state of frenzy because we had been detained over three hours from the scheduled time of disembarkation.    If this is the official cruise line of Walt Disney World, calling it a Mickey Mouse operation would be a kindness. Calling it a nightmare would be more accurate.   I felt that we had just paid Premier Cruise Lines over $1,500 to put us through three days of torture. Our \\"elegant\\" cabin A134 was so noisy that the walls vibrated continuously as long as the ship was moving. As a result we could hardly sleep. And the movie screen in the theater was inoperable","excerpt":"my son had to watch movies on a regular-size color TV set in a small, crowded lounge.    A lot of other unfortunate mishaps occurred, and our complaints were generally not addressed. My husband and I are both professionals. If either of us treated our patients the way we were treated on board this ship, I dare say we would be out of business. SHARON WEXLER Clearwater, Fla.    The customer service representative of Premier Cruise Lines replies: A thorough investigation was conducted concerning vibrating walls in cabin A134. No record was made of this complaint in the purser's office or at the housekeeping desk. Nor were any complaints made concerning this cabin in the past. Although we were unable to discover the origin of the noise, we wrote to the Wexlers, expressing our regret for the discomfort they suffered. Disembarkation procedures conducted by the United States Customs and Immigration services are affected by the number of non-United States citizens on board. Additional Customs and Immigration agents were present to process our non-U.S. citizens, but there are variables beyond our control. As a gesture of goodwill, we refunded the Wexlers $48 for their tour of Nassau. We feel we are providing a product and services true to our representation, but we cannot guarantee a vacation experience to the point of providing compensation for a lost camera.

The President will be suspended from office for six months and now faces trial by the Senate.  A1  HAVEL IS READY FOR MORE    Vaclav Havel resigned in July as Czechoslovakia's President, not wishing to preside over the country's breakup. But the onetime dissident's interest in politics, having been kindled, will not disappear. He is girding for a comeback as titular leader of the Czech republic.  A3  VOTING BEGINS IN ANGOLA    Angolans voted on the first of two days in contested elections. Many in the ravaged country seemed uncertain whether they were courting democracy or disorder.  A8  TAJIKISTAN'S WORRIED NEIGHBORS    Russia sent reinforcements to Tajikistan, where 10,000 Russian troops risk becoming caught up in a civil war. Uzbekistan sealed its borders to refugees.  A12  DREADING THE WINTER IN BOSNIA    American intelligence experts warn that winter could cause well over 100,000 deaths from hunger and overexposure in Bosnia if the fighting continues to hamper relief and if aid is not increased.  A13  OUSTED HAITIAN FAULTS THE POPE    In a speech at the United Nations, Haiti's deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, denounced the Vatican as the only state to recognize Haitian coup leaders.

A4  National A14-22  BUSH'S DEBATE CHALLENGE    Unveiling one of the boldest tactical moves of the campaign, President Bush offered to debate Gov. Bill Clinton on four consecutive Sundays. The action, aides said, was partly inspired by the possibility that Ross Perot could enter the race.  A1  SHAKING UP THE RACE    Ross Perot has lost much of his magic, the Clinton and Bush campaigns agree. But Republicans are hoping a revived Perot candidacy will shake up a race in which the President is lagging in the polls.  A1  PEROT AND HIS PEOPLE    As Ross Perot awaits the word from his supporters about whether he should run for President, there are increasing signs that his organization is neither as large nor as independent as he says it is.  A20  SHORT SHRIFT FOR ISSUES    Wherever he shows up, Ross Perot rails about his opponents and their fuzzy approach to politics. But given broad latitude to discuss almost anything he wants, including what are commonly known as \\"the issues,\\" Mr. Perot rarely does so.  A20  THE CHICKEN STRATEGY    Mr. Clinton's unexpectedly wide strength this late in the race is allowing the Democrats to play a highly offensive game, aides say. A notable tactic: stationing supporters costumed as giant chickens at the President's campaign stops.  A21    Senator Gore attacks Mr. Bush on his dealings with Iraq.  A21  A SHRINKING SEARS, ROEBUCK    Sears, Roebuck plans to dispose of its securities business, Discover credit card and real estate operations and to sell part of Allstate in a public stock offering. The move represents the end of its vision of providing middle-class consumers with a variety of services.  A1  WASTE PLAN DROPPED    The White House has dropped a proposal to allow manufacturers to ship hazardous wastes to town dumps, prompted, Administration officials said, by concern that President Bush has become vulnerable to Democratic charges on the environment.  A1  TELEVISION LESSONS    A children's broadcasting law passed two years ago was heralded as a way to encourage educational programming on commercial television. But consumer groups say broadcasters are obeying the rule by defining cartoons like \\"Super Mario Brothers\\" as educational.  A1  QUESTIONS ON SALARIES    In recent years, executives at nonprofit hospitals have enjoyed fast-growing salary increase, with some earning more than $1 million a year. Now the I.R.S. is asking if such generous hospitals are straying from the rules on tax-exempt organizations.  A14  CHARGE IS DISMISSED    A judge dismissed one of the five felony charges against Caspar Weinberger stemming from the Iran-contra affair. The action removes an accusation at the heart of the case against the former Defense Secretary.  A14  THWARTED INDICTMENTS    A grand jury hearing a case against a contractor running a polluted nuclear bomb factory so badly wanted to indict the people who ran the plant that it wrote the indictments itself, a member of the jury says. But the prosecutor blocked the grand jury, the juror said, and ultimately, no individuals were charged.  A18  Education Page B8  College officials puzzle over Federal ruling on race and admissions.

My boyfriend and I are moving into our first apartment in New York City. He earns about 25 percent more than I do -- and on top of that gets money from a family trust fund. Do you think it's fair that we split rent and expenses equally?\\nA. Fair? \\"All's fair in love and war,\\" wrote Francis Edward Smedley back in 1850. But seeing as Smedley wasn't setting up housekeeping in a pricey Manhattan rental, we'll disregard that advice. After all, a quest for fairness can easily put a couple on the warpath.\\n\\nEveryday money matters require a certain finesse by cohabitants -- a significant group these days. More than three million households are composed of unmarried couples -- roommates, people trying out a relationship, those planning marriage, heterosexual and homosexual couples and committed partners not planning marriage.\\n\\nTo be sure, many of these couples, especially the young ones, just make ends meet in cities with high costs of living. \\"We call ourselves the new poor,\\" says the female partner in a New York twosome with combined annual income of $135,000, which certainly amounts to middle-class comfort in most places.\\n\\nStill, a pinched pocketbook may be less disruptive than pinched expressions. \\"Most financial fights in a relationship are not about a shortage of money but disorganization, lack of communication, fuzzy goals and a confusion over investment choices,\\" says Adriane G. Berg in \\"Financial Planning for Couples\\" (Newmarket Press, 1993, $10.95).  Once people have a blueprint of what works best for them, together and as individuals, cohabitation becomes a lot less fractious.\\n\\nSo, the safest course is to determine your expectations for the budding relationship before deciding whether to split expenses evenly or proportionately, based on resources. The formula, of course, will most likely change along with the relationship.\\n\\nFor lack of any hard and fast rules, roommates and couples who are test driving their relationship often split expenses like rent and food. To avoid squabbles over \\"my cereal\\" and \\"your paper towels,\\" many contribute equally to a joint household account.\\n\\nWhen Debbie Kohnstamm and Leon Baranovsky started living together, they split expenses by keeping a list on the fridge with columns marked \\"his\\" and \\"hers.\\" When one paid the electric bill or bought groceries, the cost was marked in the appropriate column. Every few months they added up the columns and balanced them out.\\n\\n\\"This way we weren't constantly exchanging money and didn't need a joint checking account,\\" she said. It was the same system she had used with her college roommate. \\"We even bought two kittens.\\"\\n\\nTheir system was based on equality. After a few years, they decided to get married and pooled their resources. As they found, the financial arrangement usually changes when you become a \\"committed couple,\\" whether marriage is in the air or not.\\n\\n\\"Equality and fairness are not the same thing,\\" Ms. Berg says. \\"Feelings of fairness most often prevail when couples split expenses proportionately. If one partner is making 25 percent more, then he or she should be spending 25 percent more on necessities.\\"\\n\\nFor 18 months before being married, Kathy and Kevin McKinney lived together in San Francisco and split their expenses according to their salaries. \\"We sat down and figured out our total income -- he earned 70 percent, and I made only 30 percent, so we added up the rent, bills, and groceries and paid accordingly,\\" Ms. McKinney said. \\"We kept separate saving accounts for personal spending, and we never argued about money. In fact, we still use a similar system now that we're married.\\"\\n\\nTrust funds, however, do not really belong in the pot. \\"If one partner has a special asset, which may have been inherited, shares of stock, a precious antique or a piece of real estate,\\" Ms. Berg notes, \\"the other partner should respect the privacy of that.\\"\\n\\nIt is not unheard of, though, for someone with additional income, to suggest a better apartment or a more expensive vacation and to offer to pay the difference.\\n\\nNot surprisingly, feelings of unfairness among committed partners arise most often about discretionary spending. You know, the type of disagreement in which one person wants to buy a big-screen TV and the other longs for a 14-day Caribbean cruise. That's more the stuff of soap operas than real life, the experts say. Far more common is that one person wants to spend and the other prefers to save. Ms. Berg suggests that couples treat saving and investing as they would a car purchase -- something to plan for so both partners get what they want.\\n\\nWhen it is time to spend, a dash of indulgence may not be all bad. A survey by Savvy magazine showed that couples are rarely happy if they feel they are always compromising to accommodate the other. It works better to take turns getting what you want -- as long as the items are affordable.\\n\\nSuppose \\"he\\" wants a new stereo and \\"she\\" wants an expensive sofa. Rather than upgrading the old stereo by buying new speakers and settling for a cheaper sofa, they should instead forgo some other item they both want or delay the stereo or sofa purchase a few months. \\n\\nOne way to help make record keeping fair and easy is to keep separate bank accounts and open a joint checking account to cover household and other shared purchases and expenses. Many landlords prefer not to have two names on a lease and may resist the idea of two checks.\\n\\nThough some experts recommend a joint brokerage account and other investments to instill togetherness, don't overlook the tax consequences. As long as you are filing separate tax returns, how will you report capital gains, losses, dividends and interest?\\n\\nKeeping separate credit cards makes it easy to pay for personal items, and to preserve your credit identity. Most important for harmony's sake, put a car, house and big-ticket items bought with joint money in both names. For smaller items, like a TV, save receipts and note who paid how much. In case of a split, a settlement comes quicker with the original cost in hand.\\n\\nAfter a relationship fizzled in my early 20's, I owned the left side of a Jennifer Convertible sofa bed and the cups and plates, but not the saucers and cereal bowls, of a Pottery Barn dinnerware set. We couldn't agree on who had paid for what and how much each item had cost.\\n\\nOccasionally, committed couples revert to roommate status. Take two friends of mine who have a great deal on a West Side apartment in Manhattan. After a tumultuous five-year relationship, they broke up, but neither will give up the inexpensive living quarters. From Neil Sedaka's popular song \\"Love Will Keep Us Together\\" has sprung a new urban refrain, \\"The Lease Will Keep Us Together.\\"\\n\\n Questions about investing, careers and personal finance can be sent to Minding Your Business, Money and Business, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York 10036.

The prosecutor spoke on Friday, the defense lawyer yesterday. JOHN GLEESON  The Prosecutor    This is not a media event. This is not a movie. It's not about movie stars. This is not a stage for oratory.  This is a trial in an American courtroom, a trial in which your decision will be based on the evidence that came from that witness stand, from the tape recordings, the other physical exhibits, and on that alone. It's not nearly as exciting as the other stuff. .  .  .    These two defendants, ladies and gentlemen, together with Salvatore Gravano, ran a crime family, La Cosa Nostra, the Gambino crime family.   I submit to you, based on the evidence, that no reasonable person could dispute that John Gotti is the boss of that enterprise, of that crime family, since the time Paul Castellano was murdered in December of 1985. I further submit to you that based on this evidence, no reasonable person could dispute that Frank Locascio, at the time that the Ravenite bug was in place in '89 and '90, was the acting underboss.  .  .  .    Out of his own mouth, John Gotti told you that he has people in his crime family who control the docks, who control garbage hauling, who control the construction industry, who control virtually the entire concrete industry in New York City. . . .  Murder plays a central role in the business of this enterprise. It is the way in which discipline was maintained. It's the way in which power was consolidated. It's the way in which power was obtained. It was the way to deal with people who have the audacity to speak to the Government about the enterprise. It was the way to deal with people who have the audacity to be someone John Gotti thinks might be a rat some day. Murder is the heart and soul of this enterprise.\\" .  .  .    \\"I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, when you have this type of criminal committing this type of crime, there are only two ways to prove it. . . . There are two ways to do it: One, catch them talking about their crimes. Figure out a way to find those secret meetings and record them.  There's one other way. Get one of them to come in and tell you about the crimes. We did both. .  .  .    We would love to bring you witnesses with absolutely impeccable credentials, of unquestionable honesty and integrity, of good moral character. The problem is they don't know any such people. The people that they commit their crimes with, the people in the Gambino crime family, are people like Salvatore Gravano. They picked him. He's theirs. He is what he is. . . .  ANTHONY M. CARDINALE  Lawyer for Frank Locascio    I'd also like to try to explain and almost apologize, if you will, for the nervousness and anxiety you might see as I give this summation.   It is usually that nervousness is brought about by the nature of the charges. Quite frankly, it's quite a responsibility to have someone's life in your hands. But I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen, after listening to Mr. Gleeson sum up yesterday, after sitting through this case representing Frank Locascio for the past several weeks, I couldn't wait to get up.   What you see now is not nervousness because of what I have to do and because I have his life in my hands, but what you see, ladies and gentlemen, is outrage -- outrage at what the Government is trying to do. .  .  .    Yesterday Mr. Gleeson, in a poignantly humorous remark, called my client Frank \\"Correct Me if I'm Wrong\\" Locascio. Well,    his    name, Mr. Gleeson's name, is John \\"Get John Gotti at Any Cost\\" Gleeson.   These charges should not have been brought. He shouldn't have been dragged from his home. He shouldn't have been put in jail for 16 months. He shouldn't have been put in a courtroom ringed with F.B.I. agents. He shouldn't even be sitting there. .  .  .    This case is the single most important criminal trial in America today. When the stakes are this high, ladies and gentlemen, when careers, when ambition are at stake, you can't expect that everything is going to be on the up-and-up, if you will, that everything is going to be absolutely by the letter, everything is going to be totally fair. .  .  .    When you can't catch fish, you poison the stream. That's what's going on here. That narcotic stuff is just to poison this atmosphere. It's part of the stage, part of the production. It's part of the F.B.I. agents ringing this room. It's part of an effort, I submit -- accept it, reject it, but if you accept what I am saying, act accordingly -- to have you people ignore the true set of facts and the true evidence in this case.  ALBERT J. KRIEGER  Lawyer for John Gotti    I walk into that door 10 feet tall, three axe handles wide across the chest. My eyes shoot lightning","excerpt":"my voice is thunder. I represent the people. I speak to you on behalf of Constitutional liberties. A bar association to which I belong has as its motto, \\"We are liberty's last champion.\\" We are the ones who defend those accused of crimes.  .  .  .    Mr. Gravano testified that he expects less than the maximum. I think that's very informative and tells you where his head is and what he had been, perhaps, led to believe will occur.   Let's think about that. Let's think about it. Nineteen murders, according to his calculations, roughly 18 years in jail, less than a year a murder. Where are we? Where are we?

Located on the alluvial plain of the Ganges River northeast of India, Bengal was ruled by Buddhist kings from the eighth to 12th centuries. Conquered by Muslim invaders around 1200, many inhabitants converted to Islam and Bengal became part of the Moghul Empire in the 16th century. The British East India Company established a settlement in 1642, and by 1750 all of Bengal was under British rule. The diverse agricultural economy became dominated by export crops of opium and jute, while rice continued to be grown in the fertile delta. The region's trade flowed through the British-built city of Calcutta. With Indian independence in 1947, Bengal was partitioned along religious lines, Hindu West Bengal (including Calcutta) remaining with India and Muslim East Bengal becoming the eastern province of Pakistan. In the elections of 1971, the Bengali Awami League gained control of Pakistan's National Assembly. Seating of the new National Assembly was postponed, and riots broke out in East Pakistan. Troops from West Pakistan were sent to quell the riots on May 25; the following day East Pakistan declared its independence as Bangladesh. Civil war followed; 10 million refugees fled to India. Following Indian intervention, Pakistan acknowledged Bangladesh's independence on Dec. 15. Since independence, Bangladesh has consistently been one of the world's poorest countries, plagued by violent political instability, military coups, overpopulation, a flagging economy, and frequent catastrophic floods (including one in 1975 that killed half a million people). The first president, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, was assassinated in 1975. Lt. Gen. Hossain Mohammad Ershad, who seized power in a coup in March 1982, was elected president in 1986, but resigned in 1990 in the face of opposition unrest. In 1991, the Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) of Begum Khaleda Zia (widow of former president Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981) won 138 of 330 parliamentary seats running on a platform of free enterprise and an Islamic state. In 1991, the constitution was amended to put the prime minister in charge of the government. In 1994, nearly 150 opposition members of Parliament resigned en masse, eliciting a promise from Prime Minister Zia to hold general elections in June 1996. In those elections, the Awami League, led by Sheik Hasina Wazed, returned to power for the first time since 1975, when the military massacred most of her family, including her father, Pres. Sheik Mujibur Rahman. In 1998, fifteen were convicted and sentenced to death for their role in the assassinations. Zia's call for nation-wide protest strike went unanswered, but her BNP (in Jan. 1999) was one of three parties, with General Ershad's Jatiya and the Moslem Jamaat-e-Islami, to form a bloc seeking to force early elections upon prime minister Hasina. After completing Bangladesh's first-ever five-year term, premier Hasina and her Awami League faced the voters in Oct. 2001 only to be buried in a surprise landslide victory by former premier Khaleda Zia and her Nationalist party coalition.

By Victoria Jenkins. (Peregrine Smith/Gibbs Smith, $15.95.) Lost in urban and suburban anomie, many readers might find it hard to imagine a contemporary setting for good old-fashioned tragedy. But Victoria Jenkins has found such a place in the isolated new West, on the cattle ranches of Wyoming. Thirty-five-year-old Myra Wells, ambitious to recapture the sense of possibilities she recalls from her youth, sets the plot's dominoes in motion by returning to the region where she grew up and married early. There her cousin and first love, Arlen Dyer, has patched together a large ranch, with debts to match. Her son, Tom, whom she left behind long ago, and Arlen's son, Neal, work together as Arlen's ranch hands. As winter slowly yields to spring and summer, Myra turns not to Arlen but to Neal for solace and new life. And in the process, Arlen's need to dominate his son clashes with Neal's need for freedom, with grim results. Although its plot hinges on a parent in love with a child's best friend, \\"Relative Distances\\" feels considerably less manipulative than it sounds. This is largely due to Ms. Jenkins's careful, attentive prose, which is grounded in everyday details yet portrays the characters' hopes and memories with sympathy and even lyricism. It's sometimes hard to understand why these people are so obsessed with one another","excerpt":"Myra, in particular, hardly seems as distant and unattainable as both Arlen and Neal think she is. But if these particular fixations aren't convincing to the reader, the characters' fateful submissions to them are. These people might not talk a lot, but they sure do feel.

Barkley sustained the injury with 6 minutes and 23 seconds remaining in the third period of the 76ers' 110-101 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers in Philadelphia when he collided with teammate Rick Mahorn going for a rebound. Barkley had 18 points and 12 rebounds in the game.   Gene Shue, the 76ers' general manager, said yesterday that he believed Ron Anderson would replace Barkley, the National Basketball Association's second-leading scorer with a scoring average of 28.3 points, in the starting lineup.   \\"Barkley missed eight games with a sprained ankle right before the All-Star Game in February,\\" Shue said. \\"Ron did a very good job replacing him.\\" Charges Filed Against Tarpley     Charges of driving while intoxicated were filed in Dallas yesterday against the Mavericks' Roy Tarpley. The Dallas County District Attorney's office said it would ask that Tarpley's probation for a 1989 drunken-driving conviction be revoked.   The 7-foot, 250-pound Tarpley, who has twice violated the N.B.A.'s anti-drug policy, was arrested early Saturday on suspicion of driving while intoxicated after he was clocked driving 28 miles per hour over the speed limit in a 35 m.p.h. zone, police officers said.    Last September, in granting Tarpley probation on a drunken-driving conviction after a Nov. 15, 1989, arrest, County Criminal Court Judge Mike Schwille warned Tarpley that if he failed to meet the terms of his probation, he would be sent to jail for one year.   Tarpley has been sidelined since last Nov. 6, when he suffered a knee injury.   Brian McIntyre, the N.B.A.'s vice president of public relations, said yesterday that the league was \\"looking into the situation\\" surrounding Tarpley's arrest over the weekend. But Tarpley will not be banned from the league under its anti-drug policy, which only applies to the use of cocaine or heroin.   Tarpley could, however, be suspended without pay if Dr. David Lewis, the medical director of ASAP Family Treatment Center in Van Nuys, Calif., which has an arrangement with the league to treat its players, determines that Tarpley has not adhered to his after-care program for substance abuse. Scouts in Overdrive     There is little time for rest in the N.B.A. With the regular season winding down and the designation \\"rookie\\" about to be removed from members of the college class of 1990, the highest-paid crop of first-year players in league history, a certain focus is switching to the college class of 1991.    It took a total of a little more than $90 million to sign the first 10 players chosen in last June's draft to contracts ranging from four to six years. But for general managers, personnel directors and scouts, this is no time to look back. Today, most are leaving Indianapolis, site of last night's National Collegiate Athletic Association championship game, and heading for two invitational events designed to provide a last look at college players before the league draft, June 26.    First, they'll attend the Portsmouth (Va.) Invitational this week, then they'll go on to Florida, where the Orlando All-Star Classic will start Monday.   Last year, the Houston Rockets wound up with Dave Jamerson as their first-round draft choice after he was named the most valuable player at the Portsmouth Invitational. The Celtics found out a lot about Dee Brown, now a Boston backcourt star, in Orlando.   This year, the pro scouts already know a great deal about Larry Johnson and Stacey Augmon of Nevada-Las Vegas, Mark Macon of Temple, Dikembo Mutombo of Georgetown and Steve Smith of Michigan State. What they are hoping for in the next two weeks is more information on players like Greg Sutton of Oral Roberts, a 6-2 guard","excerpt":"Myron Brown of Slippery Rock State, a 6-3 guard; and John Turner of Phillips University in Enid, Okla., a 6-8 forward.
