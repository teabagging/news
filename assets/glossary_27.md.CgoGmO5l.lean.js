At best, the Shultz-Gromyko meeting is only the first in a long series of discussions about holding future talks.\\n\\nIn the meantime, both sides will go on amassing ominous new nuclear ar\\n\\n senals. America is building about five or six nuclear weapons each day to satisfy plans for 17,000 new nuclear weapons by 1992. It is clear that the Soviet Union will keep pace. Both sides are building new strategic missiles, intermediate-range missiles, cruise missiles, bombers, submarines and battlefield weapons, We are therefore in danger of witnessing a replay of the 1970's. America and the Soviet Union actually concluded 10 arms control agreements in that decade. In the same period, America added 6,056 weapons to its strategic arsenal aimed at the Soviet Union while the Russians added 3,903 strategic weapons aimed at us. It is clear that both sides built far faster than they talked.  Another problem is that time is running out. Two events will occur next September that make it imperative that there be some progress on arms control soon. First, the Alaska, our seventh Trident submarine will go on sea trials.

The presentation concluded with a collaborative \\"Improvisation,\\" in which Ms. Li moved diagonally back and forth from upstage left to downstage right to agitated piano music by Ms. Crispell. The rest of the evening featured selections by Ms. Crispell without dancing and a long solo by Ms. Li set to taped scores by several composers. Ms. Crispell's music brooded, smoldered and often became fiery, and it received fine performances by a trio that included, in addition to the composer, Reggie Workman on bass and Gerry Hemingway on percussion.

But a program it presented on Tuesday night, opening a weeklong season at the Joyce Theater, suggested that the company is no longer as involved with dance or physical theater as it was at its start six years ago. Now called Isobobs, by virtue of its collaboration with a quartet of singers called the Bobs, Iso also appears to be running out of steam.    The program of 24 smooth-flowing short pieces opened with the dramatic \\"In the Beginning,\\" which immediately establishes that singers and dancers are of equal importance here and that visual effects are another important ingredient. Most of the effects that follow are not so well conceived or executed, but there is undeniable power in the eerie shadow dancers who step through the paper backdrop in the opening number.

The director will be Robert Allan Ackerman, best known for his staging of ''Bent'' on Broadway.   ''Extremities'' deals with an attempted rape and its aftermath for both the intended victim and her two roommates. The play was first staged in July 1980, at Douglass College in New Brunswick, N.J., and had another production last March at the Actors Theater of Louisville during its Festival of New American Plays. Along the way, Mr.  Mastrosimone has frequently been asked how a man could write knowledgeably and convincingly about rape. He once replied that this play came about largely ''from knowing a woman who was raped, went through the whole trial process and then lost her case.''   Mr. Sugarman reports that he acquired the play without ever having seen it staged: ''I read it and bought it on the spot. It makes a major, bold statement - not only about rape, but about the judicial system, too.''

Talking Movies","excerpt":"Movies"},{"year":"1984","title":"The most romantic film of the year may also be the year's most unmistakably political, Andrzej Wajda's ''Love in Germany,'' in which Hanna Schygulla gives one of the finest performances of her career or, for that matter, of anyone else's. The film, at the Lincoln Plaza 1 Theater, ranks with Mr. Wajda's best, including the recent ''Danton'' and ''Man of Marble,'' and going all the way back to his early classics ''Kanal'' (1956) and ''Ashes and Diamonds'' (1958).   It's based on Rolf Hochhuth's novel, set in Germany during World War II, about Paulina Kropp (Miss Schygulla), an apolitical, small-town housewife and storekeeper, who falls heedlessly in love with a much younger Polish prisoner-of-war (Piotr Lysak). Each is fully aware that, according to Nazi law, she faces imprisonment and he the death penalty.

But the other nominees are anyone's guess. ''Master and Commander,'' ''Seabiscuit'' and ''Lost in Translation'' are in the running, say Oscar watchers. But the real question is whether ''Cold Mountain,'' the Civil War epic, has enough momentum to make the cut.
