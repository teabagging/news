It is with sadness that the students, faculty, staff and alumni of the NYU College of Dentistry announce the passing of Dr. Edward G. Kaufman, Dean Emeritus of the College. Dr. Kaufman served as dean from 1985 to 1998. He was associated with NYUCD as a student, faculty member and administrator for over 50 years. As dean of the nation's largest dental school, Dr. Kaufman proved himself an innovator during a decade when a significant number of other dental schools were closing their doors. He improved NYUCD's facilities","excerpt":"increased the College's endowment and research grants; and enacted numerous community outreach programs to help the less fortunate. In his more than half a century of service to NYUCD, Dr. Kaufman introduced major curriculum initiatives in the basic and clinical sciences, including a comprehensive care approach to dental education, business-management training, and computer-assisted learning for students. He increased the number of women and minority students on campus, and dramatically expanded the College's international studies programs. Dr. Kaufman was consistently guided by a commitment to clinical excellence, improved access to care for New York's poor, and increased resources for dental education.

Perhaps then, instead of a mass media event, we could have witnessed a constructive discussion focusing on some of the real issues of international trade:   * The debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement is not a clash between \\"free trade\\" and \\"protectionism.\\" Neither of these code terms accurately describes the accord or the positions of most of those who oppose it. These terms just make it harder for people to focus on the agreement's actual provisions and their likely effects.   * Before the North American Free Trade Agreement was negotiated, and whether or not it passes, the strategy of transnational business has been, and will continue to be, to move operations to lower-cost sites. The issue is whether or not we will change our trade policy to discourage that strategy.   * When the European Community countries formed their trading bloc, they made agreements that will raise the wages and standards of the countries at the low end of the scale.   * There is significant opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement in Mexico (as I learned when I studied there this year) from independent unions, small farmers and community groups. They fear the trade agreement will bring more exploitation of low-paid Mexican workers","excerpt":"increased unemployment of some of the higher-paid workers employed by Mexican companies that cannot compete with higher-tech companies based in the United States; radical changes to the traditional culture of Mexico, and benefits for a very small number of upper- and middle-class Mexicans.   * If this version of the North American Free Trade Agreement is defeated (and I think it should be defeated), trade with Mexico and Latin America will continue.    The real issue, as I see it, is whether or not the people of the United States, Mexico and Canada will demand a trade policy that promotes real development of the Mexican economy and that sets and enforces decent standards of living for workers in North America and throughout the world.

Last year, we consumed a mere 13 pounds of fish and seafood per person &#8212; compared with 52 pounds of chicken and 165 of red meat. And it is no wonder. The aquatic woria of fins, scales and shells can indeed be mysterious. And aside from familiarity with fish and chips dinners and an occasional lobster tail, many Americans would have difficulty describing the differences between a mullet and a mussel, a whiting and a weakfish. There are, of course, as many varieties of food of the deep as there are ways to prepare them. And to be at home with the soft brininess of a freshly opened oyster, to drink in the perfume of wine&#8208;steamed mussels, to savor the essense of salmon in the form of faintly sweet, dill&#8208;pungent gravlax, is to want to experiment with an even greater range of possibilities. Summer is an ideal time to experiment, to &#8220;go fishing,&#8221; since many types of fish and seafood are at their peak now, and can be served raw, lightly pickled or marinated, or cooked and then chilled. While raw fish dishes are common to the Japanese, some Western Indian tribes and the Eskimos, Americans, who have eaten steak tartare and fresh raw oysters for centuries, are just learning to like the delicate aroma and flavor of the Japanese sushi and sashimi. Caution should, of course, be exercised here, limiting raw fish to salt water, not fresh water, varieties. More familiar are the pickled or marinated fish and seafood, in the form or the classic Peruvian seviche, Spanish escabeche or Norwegian herring. Many kinds of fish and seafood can be &#8220;cured&#8221; by brief marination in a citric acid base combined with onions, red pepper, oil and spices for a sharp and piquant summer dish. Here, leaner fish are best, with many local varieties reaching peak production this month. Whiting, red snapper, floun- der, halibut and mackerel are all &#8220;in season,&#8221; and excellent for marinating. Sea scallops, used for the traditional seviche, also reach peak production in August. Finally there are the many dishes that, while delicious served hot during cool months, take on a totally different flavor in the summer. Among them are poached red snapper, steamed mussels and cooked squid.

More ''name'' actors seem willing to work in the medium, evidently for the very practical reason that the unemployed tend to flock to where the action is. As the number of feature films declines each year, TV-movie production is booming. In addition, independent stations in their pursuit of a share of the increasingly fragmented audience for television are now more aggressive and ambitious, becoming for the moment more of a threat to network ratings than the still struggling cable entities.

Last April, he authorized the indictment of John J. Kearney, an F.B.I. official, on charges involving &#8220;black bag&#8221; jobs, warrantless wiretaps and break&#8208;ins. It looked like the first in a commendable series of cases demonstrating that the law applies to everyone, including law enforcement officers. But the months have passed, leaving us and others to wonder, what series of cases? And now, in a startling act, the five Justice Department lawyers handling the Kearney case have resigned from it because the Attorney General has refused, in the hiatus, to authorize any more indictments. Mr. Bell's logic grows steadily more mysterious. No one thinks the indicted F.B.I. man dreamed up the illegal activity on his own; so to prosecute only him is perverse justice. Why not indict others, then? Mr. Bell has said he wishes to pursue the standard prosecutive strategy of indicting one defendant and pressing him to implicate others. But that hardly seems a sensible strategy when there is, obviously, considerable evidence about other potential defendants&#8212;and when, in any event, Mr. Kearney steadfastly refuses to tattle. So what can Mr. Bell be thinking of? Perhaps he now feels he was too hasty in approving the Kearney indictment in the first place and it is wrong to indict other law enforcement officers for similar conduct. But if that is so, why does Mr. Bell let the solitary Kearney case drag on? The Government should not ask agents to do black bag jobs; still less should it make them scapegoats.
