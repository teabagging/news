This is again manifested in Mr. Disney's \\"Secrets of Life,\\" the fourth of his True-Life Adventure features, which came to the Sutton yesterday.With the zest and some of the humor that his people used to expend on the doings of cartoon creatures, they are now having at the ants and bees and other fauna and flora that inhabit this fabulous world. And, of course, they are happily discovering that genuine living things behave in much more miraculous fashion than was ever dreamed for the creatures of their cartoons.While there is no particular pattern to this latest Technicolor nature film, other than a general, random survey of typical wonders to behold, it is full of the usual fascinating and entertaining views of nature on various levels \\"working her magic of change.\\" If the picture has any thesis it is simply that life goes on because of the myriad ways in which nature has arranged for its creatures to adapt and preserve themselves.From a beautiful sequence of close-ups of milkweed and wild-oat seeds scattering on the wind and by their own \\"legs,\\" the picture continues with a lovely series of time-lapse photographs of sprouting seeds and blossoming flowers. The trick, which simply speeds up the motion by compressing the time that nature takes, allows for some gorgeous revelations of the colors and varieties of plants. With an interesting musical accompaniment, imitative of Rimsky-Korsakoff, this series might well be designated the Botanist Ballet.From plant life, the Disney cameras move on to inspect the ways that nature provides for pollination and quickly come to the bees, which are studied in magnified close-up and in highly revealing detail. The manufacture of wax is intriguing, but do you know how queen bees are born? And would you believe that bees protect their honey during a forest fire with air-conditioning \\"fanning squads\\"?Then the ants—these wonderful creatures, of which there are some 5,000 classifications—are observed in their busy activities, including the clearing of a small snake out of a burrow","excerpt":"protozoa are seen in a drop of water (through a microscope, of course), and various odd fish, especially the angler fish, which is a perfect Disney \\"character,\\" are viewed, amusingly.The picture concludes with a spectacular but slightly irrelevant series of views of volcanoes belching hot embers and sending streams of lava flowing down hills.Most of \\"Secrets of Life\\" is in close-up, which gives it a feeling of intimacy. And Mr. Disney's people have stayed away from the nonsense of trick effects, for which we are very glad.Also on the program at the Sutton are two Disney shorts—one a cartoon, \\"Cowboy Needs a Horse,\\" which sings a delightfully animated song about the Western dreams of glory of an apartment-dwelling tot, and one a factual film, \\"Cow Dog,\\" about ranching and riding in California.

He is also survived by his adored sister, Loyce and his close cousins, the Smiths: Penny, Ron, and Pat; and by the Coons cousins. Richard Burdick was born in Pittsfield, Mass. in 1916 among his treasured Berkshire Hills. A magician and writer even as a boy, he spent his stint in the Army as cowriter of This Is the Army with Irving Berlin. During that time he also wrote many stage musicals, radio dramas, and short stories. In the lifetime of a multifaceted career -writer, producer, actor, director, composer-lyricist, magician, and broadcasting executive -he enjoyed singular encounters with a mosaic of celebrated people: Ethel Barrymore, Mae West, Max Baer, Joe Louis, Tallulah Bankhead, Jimmy Durante, Gary Merrill, Helen Hayes, Kay Kyser, Dinah Shore, Duke Ellington, Dr. Dinton Cooley, Eleanor Roosevelt, President Truman, Reverend Billy Graham, and Dr. Timothy Johnson. Richard Burdick was a visionary pioneer in public broadcasting. He was a theatrical director and operations manager in early radio and he helped launch one of the first educational TV stations in the country -WUNC-TV in Chapel Hill, N.C. Following this, he was managing director at the public TV station WHYY in Philadelphia, always contributing original scripts. He was on the founding management team of WCVB , one of the top-rated TV stations in Boston which produced great quality, quantity, and diversity of local programming, and which the NY Times called the finest commercial TV station in America. He became a board member, contributing playwright ( of eleven plays), and supporter of Florida Studio Theater in Sarasota, Florida and also was cherished by other theatres including Shakespeare & Co. in Lenox, Mass. where he was a Founding Trustee member and where he contributed three plays. Richard had a talent for living, an unflagging and exceptional creative drive, and a generosity of spirit and mind that was highly motivating to his family, friends and associates. In his autobiography entitled: Next Time I Want To Come Back As a Yellow Bird, he opens with his usual flourish and excitement, asking ''Do you believe in magic?'' and he clearly did delight in Life's great mystery and drama; and always with his unique, Burdick wit. He closed the book with this comment: '' ...as the river of Life continues its eternal flow, my personal tributary will rejoin it on its way back to the source.''

They like to know what to do and when to do it. The following calendar of chores may help.   January: Nursery and seed catalogues start arriving. Make decisions and mail orders promptly. Keep the soil of gift house plants moist, but discard paperwhite narcissus bulbs after bloom. Plant the live Christmas tree as soon as possbile.   February: Save ashes from wood stoves as a good source of lime, but store them outdoors until they are cold to prevent fires. Indoors, start seed of geraniums and petunias","excerpt":"provide bottom heat to aid germination. Reapply anti-desiccants to evergreens, especially hollies and rhododendrons. Cut branches of forsythia and other early flowering shrubs to force indoors. Inspect house plants for insects.    March: If the temperature remains above 45 degrees, apply dormant sprays to ornamental shrubs and trees to control aphids, scales and other insects. Use half-rate, water-soluble fertilizer on seedlings growing indoors. Visit flower shows for new plants and ideas. Finish hand pruning.    April: Start spraying fruit trees. Prune rosebushes as buds start to break. Cut daffodils. Clean out and set up birdbaths. Divide fall-blooming perennials such as chrysanthemums and asters. Seed outdoor rows of hardy vegetables like spinach, peas, lettuce, onion sets. Prune late-summer flowering shrubs, like rose of sharon and hydrangea.    May: Finish planting. Set out tomato, pepper and eggplant seedlings and seed rows of corn, pumpkins and squash. Move tubs and patio boxes outside and plant geraniums, alyssum, marigolds, ivy and other showy summer flowers. Lawn care and mowing are weekly chores now. Remove faded flowers from pansy plants to keep them blooming.    June: This is the rose month; cut them, arrange them, dry them, and enjoy them. Look for insect invaders on vegetable crops and in flower borders; control promptly. Be alert for slugs and use traps for control. Mulch to preserve soil moisture and cut down on weeding. Propagate woody shrubs, particularly azaleas and hollies. Cut old flowers off lilacs and tree peonies to prevent seed pods.   July: Keep on top of weeds and pull them out or use a tool that will reach their roots. Mulches will keep soil cool and preserve moisture; water plants in containers and window boxes with water-soluble fertilizer. Cut to the ground canes of one-season raspberries to prevent brambles from overtaking their space. Finish bean harvest, and resow rows with chard and beets. Dig and divide spring-blooming perennials.   August: Check tomato plants for hornworms; hand pick and destroy. If there are no local watering restrictions, use the hose on woody plants, particularly azaleas and rhododendrons. Last call to plant seedlings of cabbage and broccoli. Dig, divide and replant iris. Take cuttings from border plants to root and grow indoors as house plants. Repair lawns by sodding bare patches; this is a good month to plant a new lawn.    September: Study fall nursery catalogues and order hardy bulbs for fall planting; order quantities of smaller bulbs, like crocus and scillas, to make a worthy show. Harvest crops daily; can and freeze excess. Keep up with lawn renovation, and plant perennials to provide spring and summer color. Prune overgrown hedges once again, and add the clippings to compost.   October: Bulb planting begins. Bulbs will bloom in spring before leaves are on trees so they can be set out in shaded places to provide early color. Be sure the soil drains well and plant sufficient quantity of minor bulbs to make a show. Start raking leaves. Harvest apples and store in a cool, dry place. Set out seedlings of wildflowers and finish transplanting perennials.    November: Last call to rake leaves. The lawn should be clean before snows come. Put leaves through a chipper or add to compost for easy decomposition. Finish planting bulbs, especially tulips. Check house plants, especially African violets and their kin, to be sure they are not too close to windows where cool nights hamper growth.    December: Use sand, fertilizer, cat-box filler or stove ashes on icy sidewalks, steps and drives to make them safe; avoid salt, which seeps into plant root zones. Trim holly, spruce, pine and other evergreens, and use trimmings for decorations.  Most indoor plants are going into a dormant period; do not overwater or add too much water-soluble fertilizer.

Next year they will begin producing plays as the New Provincetown Players.

''So in case those people are confused and think we're Eugene O'Neill and Susan Glaspell, we've let them know that we are not.'' Historians and artists had voiced their outrage in newspapers and on the Eugene O'Neill Society Web site over what they viewed as the usurpation of a name distinctive in American theater.
