He has just come away from seeing the Warners' \\"Barricade,\\" an outdoor drama in color which is now on the screen of the Strand, and he feels just as though he is covered with lumps and contusions, even though no one actually has laid a hand upon him. It is simply because this picture is so full of fist-flinging fights that to watch it and to listen to the sound-track is ultimately to feel oneself beat up.As a matter of fact, a calm observer of the passing events in this film can find little other reason for it than a glorification, of mayhem. Certainly its involuted story of a tyrant who runs a Western mine with cruelly browbeaten slave labor is cut directly to that end, and the major proportion of the action is a compound of snarling brawls and fights. Even the one little shred of romance in it, between a fugitive man and a fugitive girl, is achieved through maneuvers surrounded with physical violence.If this served some fair dramatic purpose one might conceivably endure the raw exhibitions of brutality that are the singular substance of this film—the knockdown and drag-out slugging matches, the slappings and beatings of terrified men and the two or three ugly demonstrations of the viciousness of the human pack. But it doesn't. It only serves to show off sadism and cold brutality, with Raymond Massey the center and beau ideal in these displays.As the cruel and relentless mine owner who holds his laborers in line with fist and gun, Mr. Massey is an ugly and villainous gent, as badly in need of come-uppance as he is of a bath and a shave. It is quite a cheerful little moment when he finally is beaten to death. Dane Clark is the fugitive from justice who ultimately provides this release from Mr. Massey's meanness and the vicarious torment of the film. Ruth Roman as the fugitive lady, Morgan Farley as a liquor-sotted judge, Robert Douglas as a slyly spying hostage and George Stern as a slave support them well. Well, as well as could be expected. This is to say that they all endure the bludgeonings of the script as well as those of Mr. Massey. No one escaped unbruised, however. Ouch!On the stage at the Strand are Billie Holiday, Count Basie and his orchestra, with Buddy DeFranco, Georgie Auld, J. J. Johnson, Emmet Berry, the Chocolateers and the Will Mastin Trio.

(Ecco/HarperCollins, $19.95.) Throughout this collection of verse gathered from a 70-year career, Milosz argues with himself about the nature of his poetics. While he long celebrated the power of poetry to rescue mankind, his later work expresses misgivings about the ability of language to capture reality. Because he is now in his 90's, his ''focus gradually shifts from the world he has left and the world he anticipates leaving to the drama of the aging poet,'' Harvey Shapiro said here in 2001. Yet his poems remain ''capacious, hospitable and often rise to quietly ecstatic heights.''    A THREAD ACROSS THE OCEAN: The Heroic Story of the Transatlantic Cable, by John Steele Gordon. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $12.95.) The laying of the first telegraph cables between Europe and North America in 1866 was a hugely ambitious undertaking marked by calamity, misfortune, failure and the amazing perseverance of men like Cyrus Field, who dreamed up the idea and overcame much -- including seasickness -- to fulfill his dream. The result is a ''delightful and unsettling book'' that ''reminds us, excruciatingly, agonizingly, unforgettably,'' how difficult a feat it was, Michael Parfit said here last year.    THE DREAM OF SCIPIO, by Iain Pears. (Riverhead, $14.) This novel braids together three stories, all set in Provence: the first concerns a cultivated aristocrat who wrestles with his faith in the twilight of the Roman Empire, the second a 14th-century poet who discovers a manuscript written by the aristocrat. The third tells of a scholar who during the Nazi occupation learns the secret of the poet's life and death. ''Pears builds a multilayered tale of moral choice, love, danger and loss,'' John Crowley said here last year.    THE EXTINCTION CLUB: A Tale of Deer, Lost Books, and a Rather Fine Canary Yellow Sweater, by Robert Twigger. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $12.95.) Skipping back and forth between esoteric, often personal asides (including the loss of his favorite sweater) and matters of gravity, the author recounts the strange story of the Milu, or P&#232","excerpt":"re David's deer, a rare species that became extinct in the wild in China during the Boxer Rebellion. Luckily, the deer survived in captivity under the protection of the eccentric 11th Duke of Bedford, who fed his pet owl at the breakfast table. Last year our reviewer, Robert Eisner, called this a ''deliriously clever chimera of a travel book.''    BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, by Edmund S. Morgan. (Yale University, $16.) An eminent historian portrays Franklin as a magnetic extrovert who channeled his sociability and extraordinary curiosity into a life of commitment to the Philadelphia community and the young nation. This ''engaging and readable'' book ''skillfully dissects the man's personality and mind, his social self and political beliefs, deftly exploring . . . how the two halves of his being lived together,'' Susan Dunn wrote in these pages in 2002.    GOING UP THE RIVER: Travels in a Prison Nation, by Joseph T. Hallinan. (Random House, $13.95.) The author, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, spent four years visiting prisons and concludes that they have essentially become public works projects in which conditions are typically severe and which require a steady flow of inmates. ''By documenting the vested interest many Americans now have in building more prisons, he has made a valuable contribution to the debates over crime and punishment in America,'' Michael Massing wrote here in 2001.    A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE FLOOD: Stories, by Jean Harfenist. (Vintage Contemporaries, $12.) The young narrator of these interlinked stories, set mainly in a small Minnesota town, proves both spirited and practical as she provides snapshots of herself and her large, struggling family from 1959, when she is under the spell of her manic, self-dramatizing mother, to 1970, when she graduates from high school. Last year in The Times, Michiko Kakutani called this an ''auspicious and stirring'' debut.    THE PIRATE HUNTER: The True Story of Captain Kidd, by Richard Zacks. (Theia/Hyperion, $15.95.) According to this lively account, William Kidd, a k a Captain Kidd, was hardly the bloodthirsty buccaneer of legend but a mercenary who lived in New York and was hired by the British government and some wealthy merchants to hunt down pirates and reclaim their booty. The result is an ''entertaining, richly detailed and authoritatively narrated'' yarn, one critic said last year.

The playwright is virtually precluded from getting a vivid visual drama out of the mass of mental and moral agitations that make up the bulk of this vast tale.This is conclusively demonstrated by the artistically supreme effort made by Georges Lampin, French director, to put this drama of conscience on the screen in an up-to-date version, set in a contemporary city in France. His pictorially impressive production opened at the Paris yesterday.It is hard to imagine anybody doing a more effective job of getting a sense of the sickness and the morbidity in this drama onto the screen. In dangerous-looking Robert Hossein, Director Lampin has got an actor who cannot be beat for an evil appearance or for an ability to project malevolent moods. And he has used him to full advantage in developing the heavy atmosphere that precedes and surrounds the willful murder of the old woman money-lender and fence.M. Lampin has built up to this violence with an extraordinary accumulation of personal strain in the appearance and deportment of the dour hero and in the sick people with whom he is involved. These include his ambitious mother, who is trying to make a match between her young daughter and a middle-aged lecher, the sickest and most unpleasant of the lot.And in a finely melodramatic \\"rising action,\\" crisply developed by Charles Spaak, one of France's best script writers, he gets the murder done, with details as gruesome and chilling as a close-up of the murderer using a blotter to soak up the dying woman's blood.M. Lampin and his camera man, Claude Renoir, have done themselves proud, pictorially.But then they get into that tangle of deep morality in which melancholy Dostoevski had room for so much verbal play, and even M. Spaak, for all his talent, cannot cut through it visually. The hero wrestling with his conscience doesn't constitute a very exciting sight when his adversary is but a sense of justice, symbolized by the laconic detective, played by Jean Gabin. And the torment of his acknowledgment of guilt is not so strong when it necessarily evolves in a lengthy conversation with Marina Vlady, as the saintly prostitute.All of this makes for very moody pictures, beautifully photographed in heavy black-and-white, but it doesn't make for stirring drama. And that's \\"Crime and Punishment,\\" every time.A word should be said for Gaby Morlay as the mother, for Ulla Jacobsson as the daughter and for Bernard Blier as the bald-headed, pasty-faced fellow who goes after little girls.A heavy strain is put on English subtitles, because so much of what is going on in the minds and the innards of the characters has to be explained with words.

His plan wouldn't work, however.   Mr. Duffy intends his proposal to be a modest one: ''In no way should we return to full regulation of the 1970's. . . .

(Picador USA, $13.) Jean-Claude Romand was a stolid French doctor at the World Health Organization. Except he wasn't: he was a pathological liar and scam artist who invented a phony life for himself and eventually murdered his wife, children and parents when they threatened to catch on to his charade. The author, a novelist and screenwriter, conducts a highly personal inquiry into this bizarre case, and the result is an ''obsessional stew of reportorial zeal and writerly introspection'' that is ''often mesmerizing, and revealing about the fragility of human relationships,'' Julie Salamon wrote here last year.    The Creation of the Modern World: The Untold Story of the British Enlightenment, by Roy Porter. (Norton, $17.95.) An English historian argues that Britain (think Isaac Newton and John Locke) had a far more central role in the European Enlightenment and its radically new intellectual agenda than is commonly assumed. In 2000 our reviewer, T. H. Breen, found this a ''splendidly imaginative'' work that ''propels the debate forward.''    Shopgirl, by Steve Martin. (Theia, $10.95.) The comedian uses a somber palette in his first novella, which revolves around the tentative love life of a young woman who works at the glove counter at Neiman's in Beverly Hills. It's an ''elegant, bleak, desolatingly sad'' story about missed romantic connections, and it's ''Martin's most achieved work to date,'' John Lanchester wrote here in 2000.    The Rising Sun, by Douglas Galbraith. (Grove, $13.) The narrator of this fact-based first novel is a young clerk who tells of a tragically misguided Scottish expedition at the close of the 17th century to colonize the isthmus of Darien, now called Panama. His salty account is rife with pirates, intrigue, Indian rituals, tropical diseases, battles and various forms of madness. The result is a ''completely convincing'' adventure yarn, Geoff Nicholson wrote in these pages in 2001. ''Galbraith's powers of description are immense.''    Ice Bound: A Doctor's Incredible Battle for Survival at the South Pole, by Jerri Nielsen with Maryanne Vollers. (Talk Miramax/Hyperion, $14.95.) The author, who decided to escape her bitter divorce and stressed-out job as an emergency room doctor by taking a job at an Antarctic research station, learned early on that she had breast cancer and managed to treat it herself before being evacuated in a harrowing airlift in the dead of polar winter. ''Nielsen is a hero, just as Scott and Shackleton were -- the same stiff upper lip in the face of adversity, the same love of the ice above all,'' Katherine Bouton said here last year.    Tigers in the Snow, by Peter Matthiessen. Introduction and photographs by Maurice Hornocker. (North Point, $15.) Visiting the few remaining habitats of the Siberian tiger, the author finds much to lament and a few glimmers of hope for a noble, versatile creature that ''resides at the summit of its ecosystem.'' In 2000 our reviewer, Adam Goodheart, called this an ''always lucid, often sad and affecting'' portrait of Panthera tigris.    The Death of Vishnu, by Manil Suri. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) Downstairs in a small apartment building in Bombay are two squabbling middle-class families. Upstairs is a prosperous Muslim family whose patriarch is grappling with spiritual questions. On the landing between them is a dying servant with the name of a god, who either haunts or adorns the building as he revisits his memories. The result is a ''deft and confident first novel'' that is ''beguiling and deceptively ambitious,'' Michael Gorra wrote here in 2001.    Walker Evans, by James R. Mellow. (Basic Books, $22.50.) The photographer, who did his most famous work in the Depression but continued taking pictures almost until his death in 1975 at 71, is portrayed as an astute, brazen artist whose images belied a crabbed and nasty spirit. ''In his clear way Mellow conveys Evans's considerable complexity,'' Nicholas Fox Weber wrote here in 1999.    Sometimes I Dream in Italian, by Rita Ciresi. (Delta, $12.95.) These linked short stories follow the lives of two modern American girls trapped in a traditional Italian family, driven by a forceful mother who has no intention of assimilating. ''Ciresi has a lovely ear for dialogue and the ability to nail the details in descriptions that are both funny and painfully accurate,'' Deborah Sussman Susser wrote here last year.

If Ms. Paglia understood feminism, she would not be tempted to reduce it to egregiously outdated stereotypes and to categorize the \\"real feminist,\\" Madonna, in opposition to this false opposite. Last time I checked, American feminists, academic ones in particular, were busy theorizing in some detail the radical possibilities of Madonna's persona. As an academic, I know that it never behooves us to oversimplify and misrepresent the intellectual scene to aggrandize our own ideas as new.   Finally, I am appalled by Ms. Paglia's reactionary and misogynist view of the date-rape furor as a fabrication by prudish American women who really want it when they say \\"No.\\" This perpetuates the most frightening and dangerous kind of misconceptions about rape -- misconceptions that only very recently have been slightly shaken by this very date-rape furor, which Ms. Paglia dismisses as a \\"cliche\\" produced by misplaced female fantasy.
