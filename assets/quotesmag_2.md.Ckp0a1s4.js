Besides being the only piece in which cans were actually thwacked during the eight-and-a-half-hour program, its underlying philosophy has much in common with that of this eclectic new music series. When Cage composed this percussion quartet 53 years ago, he retained ties to the conventional music world and produced a fully notated score. Eventually, he would grant his interpreters considerable leeway.   But in 1941 he was breaking away from the mainstream in other ways. Advancing the notion that music can be wrung out of anything, he proposed an ensemble in which found objects augment a standard percussion battery. He also celebrated the primacy of rhythm. In \\"Third Construction,\\" melody is an illusion, suggested by the different pitches of the instruments, and harmony is frozen out entirely. And another of its elements -- its edgy, unflagging energy -- was ably conveyed by the Talujon Percussion Quartet.

So I was torn on Friday night, watching this season's first presentation of the work at the Metropolitan Opera. This was a superior musical performance.

Hardly, for though it has most of the elements necessary for action melodrama there just isn't any real spirit or punch in the picture.Perhaps the poor quality of the acting has something to do with it. George Montgomery is far from being authoritative as a smart thinking marshal. Rod Cameron swaggers and smirks as the conventional meanie.

One corporation, Shell Oil, stood out for its inventiveness. THE SHELL POSTER BOOK (Godine, paper, $19.95), a collection of the company's finest posters from 1920 to 1952, shows that good design was good business. The company's poster tradition can be credited to one employee, Jack Beddington, who, despite lack of experience, was placed in charge of advertising after he complained that the company's promotions were mundane. Under his leadership, Shell's ads were transformed from crass and copy-driven to elegant image-dominated posters with catchy phrases. Styles ranged from the rectilinear Art Moderne renderings depicting speed by Tom Purvis, to modern country landscapes by Graham Sutherland, Paul Nash and Vanessa Bell, to the Surrealist fantasies of E. McKnight Kauffer and Zero (Hans Schleger). There were also frequent experiments with Cubist, Expressionist and cartoon styles by veteran and neophyte artists alike. By the early 50's the quality of the posters had begun to decline, a situation caused as much by the passing of the great artists as by changes in corporate priorities. As slick as later advertising became, however, it does not surpass the individuality and originality of the posters produced when Shell was fueled by art.

Edouard Molinaro's \\"The Hostages,\\" playing today and tomrrow at the First Avenue Screening Room, is an unusually intelligent action picture, partly because it stresses how dangerous a self-destructive persons can be.The movie is based on a recent case in France. A drifter with a fearfully short fuse falls in and out of prison; between assaults and armed robberies, he marries a call girl and the hold-ups continue until they're arrested. Then, they take a judge hostage to bargain for their release. Their ruthless teamwork has none of the sentimentally that oozed through \\"Bonnie and Clyde.\\" Here, the tension between the hard-headed practicality and the extreme carelessness of the outlaws yields an intriguing characterization.Daniel Cauchy and Bulle Ogier are first-rate as the pair on the prowl. His forlorn ??? face when he pulls a weapon or gets nabbed, established the deadly unpredictability of his character. Meanwhile, she's deceptively cherubic; that sweet little face masks a completely brutal nature. This beguiling waif is even more lethal than her husband, even though he's crazed and she is not.The plot thins in invention toward the end, so the suspense is muted. But there are many fine details, including a scene where some hoods devastate a bar with gaudy spray paint, to punish the proprietor. And I liked the man who's reluctant to surrender his beloved new car to the famous fugitives; as he protests that it's not broken in, that the monthly payments aren't finished, it's clear that his wheels are more important to him than his life.
