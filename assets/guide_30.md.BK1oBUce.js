Since his survival strategy involves feigning mental illness, Fabian must undergo a unique therapy at the not-too-gentle hands of Dr. Gonalves, a combination shaman and psychiatrist who  practices in the requisitioned office of a \\"disappeared\\" dentist. Sitting in the dental chair, surrounded by drills and other implements of the trade, the patient spins out tales that are part memory and part contrivance, all designed  to maintain his status as \\"a psychotic with severe and intractable disabilities.\\" It is not easy work, for the doctor demands quality stories: \\"These standard hallucinations! Vibrating canoes, anacondas! Old hat! Rivers fermenting beneath their cargo of leaves. . . . Always the same junk! Sexual symbolism for half-wits!\\" Obediently, Fabian digs deeper, inventing and reinventing himself, winding his way through love affairs, shootouts and voyages of exploration and discovery until finally, traveling upriver toward the source  of his imaginings, he appears to invent Dr. Gonalves himself. In Linda Coverdale's spirited translation, \\"Naming the Jungle\\" (which is the first of Mr. Volodine's books to be published in English) emphasizes the uncertainties of the characters and their jumbled lives by placing them in an especially well-defined world. The therapy Fabian goes through to maintain his supposed craziness involves establishing an Indian identity by naming the plants and creatures of the jungle. Only the people remain hard to pin down. But that uncertainty, that  refusal to locate themselves, Mr. Volodine suggests, is precisely what makes them worth caring about.

NEW ON CD  The bassist and bandleader Avishai Cohen releases ''At Home'' ($16.98, Sunnyside), which folds global folk and jazz influences into his sneaky and suave compositions; ''The Beekeeper'' ($18.98, Epic), from Tori Amos, is a collection of songs gathered around things that happen in gardens; Laurent Garnier's ''Cloud Making Machine'' ($16.98, Mute) finds the electronica master leaving chill-out music behind -- mostly -- for a ramble through harsh techno, random beats and complicated grooves.    BY THE BOOK  Michael Cunningham, the author of ''The Hours''; Shirley Hazzard, who won the 2003 National Book Award for fiction for ''The Great Fire''; and Andrew Sean Greer, whose ''Confessions of Max Tivoli'' made a number of best-seller lists in 2004, triple up for a reading in celebration of the 10th anniversary of their publisher, Picador.  Barnes & Noble Union Square, 33 East 17th Street; 7 p.m.; free.    WEDNESDAY 2/23    JOAN'S TRUE CALLING  As awards-show season sails on, Joan Rivers is needed elsewhere and must soon tear herself from the stage of Fez; her run of stand-up on Wednesday nights will close two weeks from tonight. After all, those Academy Award outfits won't mock themselves.  Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village; 7 p.m.; $25.    BIRD ENTHUSIASM  In honor of the recently opened ''Audubon's Aviary,'' an exhibition of 40 watercolors by John James Audubon at the New-York Historical Society, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Richard Rhodes will take the podium. Which makes sense, considering that Mr. Rhodes is the author of ''John James Audubon: The Making of an American,'' a hefty new biography of the naturalist and avian artist.  170 Central Park West, at 77th Street; 6:30 p.m.; $10.    NEW ON DVD: ''I heart HUCKABEES'' AND ''SOUTH PARK''  ''I heart Huckabees'' (Fox) comes in two flavors: the two-disc special edition has 5 outtakes and 22 additions for $39.98, while for $27.98 you get just the commentaries by the director and the stars -- and David O. Russell's film, of course. A not-so-surprising surprise ending alert: at the conclusion of the fifth season of ''South Park,'' Kenny finally really dies, and there's nothing the Make-a-Wish Foundation can do (Paramount, $49.99).    RETURNED E-MAIL  The second of three planned shows by students at New York University's Department of Photography and Imaging features the work of Cody Trepte, who gathered all his e-mail messages over the last year and converted them into punch cards: about 14,000 of them, arranged in five stacks, each a little under three feet tall. Binders provide guides to the e-mail stacks, grouped by either mechanical concepts -- random characters, time stamps -- or personal ones, like correspondence with his father.  Gulf & Western Gallery, 721 Broadway, at Waverly Place, East Village; 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; free. (Through March 12.)    THURSDAY 2/24    SCARY CREATURES  ''A Man's Best Friend,'' a new play by Jeffrey Jones, is a Beckettian nightmare about a smelly clown named Sluggo. Here's a clue to its ambitions from the author's production notes: ''I have intentionally provided no description of the Land Squid because it may be more effective as an unseen or largely suggested monster. It's very important that the Land Squid be scary.''  Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa; 7:30 p.m.; $15. (Through March 19.)    CYBORG MOVEMENT  Several performances accompany the opening of a larger show about relations between man and machine. In one piece, a dancer, Katie Shima, is strapped into a levered metal machine, which transforms her small movements into big mechanized gestures. Physical installations will remain after tonight's performances; don't miss peeking into the stairwell, where six peephole dioramas made of ferrofluid, a magnetic liquid, are hidden -- viewers can control time and space in the tiny landscapes by speeding up their rotation.  The Tank, 432 West 42nd Street; 7 and 9 p.m.; $5. (Exhibition continues through March 14.)    AMERICAN WEIRD  The normally staid 19th-century galleries of the National Academy Museum have been physically transformed into something, well, surreal for the exhibition ''Surrealism U.S.A.,'' which includes a wide cross section of works by American artists of the 1930's and 40's. A highlight: works by the Armenian-born Arshile Gorky, who made America his home as a teenager and who became a linchpin in the conversation between European and American art and the transition from Surrealism to Abstract Expressionism.  1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street; noon to 5 p.m.; $10, $5 for students, 65 and over and children under 16. (Through May 8.)    QUEEN ESTHER  J.C. Hopkins and his Biggish Band play straight-up big-band jazz; they will be joined for the evening by Queen Esther, a striking, strutting gospel-style singer of impressive range.  Slipper Room, 167 Orchard Street, Lower East Side; 9:30 p.m.; $8.    FRIDAY 2/25    NEW FILMS: MEET IRJA AND LUCILLE  In ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman,'' a chick flick based on the play by Tyler Perry, a housewife gets dumped on the night before her 20th wedding anniversary. Also at your local multiplex, ''Cursed,'' the latest from horrormeister Wes Craven, which finds Christina Ricci endowed with uncontrollable superhuman powers. ''Sunset Story'' (limited release, at Quad Cinema) is a documentary portrait of Irja Lloyd and Lucille Alpert, two freethinking friends living at Sunset Hall, a Los Angeles home for aging leftists.    ACTOR STUNTS  The Battle of the Bards is a new theatrical competition with a reality-show edge; seven Off Off Broadway companies were given 10 days to write and produce a one-act play. Tonight, those plays will be performed -- somehow squeezed into a two-hour show -- and both a winner and an audience favorite will be picked by a panel of judges and the attendees.  Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, Chelsea; 8 p.m; $10.    KITCHEN-SINK OPERA  Chinese opera melds acrobatics, juggling, song and really great outfits into an evening of stylized spectacle. This weekend, the Qi Shu Fang Peking Opera Company doubles as a living cultural preservation society and a wild night at the opera: tonight's performances include ''The Flaming Phoenix,'' in which the egret king of Egret Island battles an evil vulture and is transformed into a phoenix -- sort of like ''Godzilla'' meets ''Winged Migration.''  Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, Greenwich Village; 8 p.m.; $30 and $35, $15 for students. (Also Saturday.)    SATURDAY 2/26    COLLECTORS ON COLLECTING  The Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art puts on a very fancy daylong symposium on art collecting, at a private location in Midtown Manhattan. Participants will include the artists Chuck Close and Kiki Smith, and, from the other side, Gary Garrels, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art; and Werner Kramarsky, the noted collector of Minimalist art. (Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic for The New York Times, will also speak.)  Call (212)399-5030 for tickets and location; $150.    DIABOLIQUE  As part of a retrospective devoted to the French director Henri-Georges Clouzot, here's a chance to see the classic 1955 thriller ''Diabolique'' on the big screen. Creepy in the extreme, the black-and-white film stars Véra Clouzot (the director's wife) and Simone Signoret as conspirators out to murder the nasty fellow they've shared as wife and mistress. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn; 2, 4:30, 6:50 and 9:15 p.m.; $10.    YOUNG GUNS  The Julliard Pre-College Orchestra gets down with Leonard Bernstein's Symphonic Dances from ''West Side Story,'' some Haydn and Stravinsky's Violin Concerto in D, featuring Michelle Ross, 17, as soloist.  Juilliard Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; 8 p.m.; free.

Her dances are often dense and gnomic. But they repay the close attention they demand with continual small, surprising revelations: some slyly funny, some tender, and all springing from the unruliest of imaginations. Ms. Silvers, above, hasn't changed much from the keen-eyed political science major at Antioch College -- born in eastern Tennessee, too, for a little extra edge of exoticism -- who was turned on to performing partly by the avant-garde musicianship of the pianist Cecil Taylor. In New York, she was too odd to be chosen at auditions, and dance teachers suggested gently that what she was doing was nice enough, but not what everyone else was doing. She found herself in classes with Sara Rudner, who got the point of her. And she presented a first dance program that included a 30-minute piece in which she gave herself 30 problems to solve, like how to assume a sleeping position while standing up. Her anniversary program, at Performance Space 122 through Sunday, will feature a sextet called ''Puppy-Skills'' that will be performed by some of the favorite stars of the downtown dance and performance worlds, among them Vicky Shick, Paige Martin, Julie Atlas Muz and Jamie Di Mare. Two other starry types -- Pooh Kaye and Cydney Wilkes -- will perform an improvisation, dressed in inflatable-art costumes, with a different musician at each performance. And a different guest will create a dance on the spot at every performance in ''Live Choreography.'' Ms. Silvers's longtime collaborator Bruce Andrews will provide the music, with Michael Schumacher.

Jesters, jousters, tilters, maidens, minstrels, troubadours and a queen, dressed in velvet, armor and chain mail, will use the park's 67 acres for a daylong festival. What's in it for children? How about a joust with 24 knights (professional stuntmen) on galloping white steeds?    Milder forms of entertainment will include morris dancers, a Merlin the magician, a contortionist acrobatic show, puppets, sorcerers, jugglers and storytellers.   The festival is meant to emulate a market fair in Western Europe in the 1100's and there will be vendors selling everything from period-style leather clothes to hair decorations, along with food stalls where one can find such fare as turkey legs.   The event is sponsored by the City Department of Parks and Recreation, whose commissioner, Betsy Gotbaum, is giving up some vacation time to play the medieval queen who drops her scarf for the joust, and the Washington Heights and Inwood Development Corporation, a nonprofit community group. Even the Cloisters, which is on the grounds of the park, will participate, with ringing bells.   No rock will be left unturned, promised Jonathan Miller, the festival's director. \\"We'll have troubadours jumping out of the bushes and running after children,\\" he said. \\"We're making a special effort to encourage the fantasies of children.\\"   The festival will be from noon to 6 P.M.","excerpt":"performances for children will be given every half-hour on four stages. At 4 P.M., the 24 knights on horseback are to perform. The festival is free, but admission of $1 a person is suggested. The rain date is Sept. 27. The park is accessible by taking the A train to 190th Street, or the M4 bus. No parking is available.  'The Little Fugitive'  El Bohio Community and Cultural Center 605 East Ninth Street Lower East Side (212) 533-6835 Recommended ages: 4 and up Sunday    ZuZu, a new tabloid for children published every two months that suggests a sort of Village Voice for the 12-and-under set, is presenting \\"The Little Fugitive\\" at a family screening on Sunday. The 1953 black-and-white film is considered a minor classic; Francois Truffaut credited it with giving momentum to French New Wave cinema. Directed by Ray Ashley, Morris Engel and Ruth Orkin, the bittersweet story follows a 7-year-old boy named Joey around Coney Island as he plays a fugitive, more or less.   The movie made innovative use of a newly developed hand-held 35-millimeter camera, which enabled Mr. Engel, the cameraman, to rove along with Joey and the other characters. Indeed, the camera casts a steady artful eye on the freckled Joey's loopy forays among the Coney Island amusements. He's a fugitive because a prank arranged by his brother, Lennie, and Lennie's friends leads Joey to believe that he shot and killed his brother. (Ketchup plays a big role in this scene.)   Joey is naive, not foolish. With his holster slung on his small hips, he jumps on the BMT to Coney Island to escape the scene of the crime (and the electric chair, his brother's friends warn him). Once at Coney Island, he rides the carousel, the Ferris wheel, the boats and the roller coaster and takes potshots in a shooting gallery, living out his cowboy dream.   Richie Andrusco, who played Joey, was discovered at Coney Island by the film makers. Mr. Engel will attend the screening to answer children's questions and a selection of vintage shorts will be shown after the 80-minute film. Children are encouraged to bring their artwork, stories or photographs for submission to ZuZu. Clovis Noches, a country-swing band, is to perform.   The fee for the 3 P.M. event is $2.50; children are admitted free. Refreshments will be available; strollers are welcome.  Boat Building Workshop Y.W.C.A. of the City of New York 610 Lexington Avenue (at 53d Street) East Side (212) 735-9731 Recommended ages: 5 and up Tomorrow   At the Y.W.C.A., the boating season is not yet over, so children (accompanied by adults) have a chance to make boats tomorrow. But not necessarily seafaring ones, even for a bathtub.   Eva Goetz-Alderstein, an art teacher, will help students make artistic boats from such materials as seashells, nutshells, pebbles, ice-cream sticks, milk cartons and fabric (with some nuts, bolts and screws thrown in). The boats will be decorated with the kind of glitter awash on \\"Love Boat\\": sequins, rhinestones and feathers.   The 90-minute workshop, which starts at 10 A.M., is $6 a child (adults attend free). No preregistration is required. Children are asked to bring a secret object, like a ring or a note, to hide in their boats.

Across the ocean Massive Attack helped set the agenda for British music in the 1990's, helping to inspire a generation of singers and rappers and D.J.'s","excerpt":"performers ranging from Dizzee Rascal to Beth Orton owe this group a debt.    Suffice it to say that the group's 1991 debut album, ''Blue Lines,'' didn't thrill Americans quite the same way. But in the years since, Massive Attack has built a respectable cult of fans here. And this week it is scheduled to arrive in New York for a three-night stand at the Roseland Ballroom in support of a recent greatest-hits compilation (of sorts), ''Collected'' (Virgin).    The group emerged from the Bristol hip-hop scene, but right from the start Massive Attack's sound drew heavily from reggae and jazzy R&B. (The reggae singer HORACE ANDY is a longtime collaborator, and he is touring with the group.) Massive Attack often used hip-hop beats to build songs that were both dreamy and heavy, and early singles (like ''Safe From Harm'' and ''Unfinished Sympathy'') helped pioneer the genre that's sometimes called trip-hop. Compared with American rap records, Massive Attack productions sound smooth and slightly posh, but in Britain the group's rise felt a bit like an insurgency: proof that hip-hop-inspired music need not sound like an imitation of America. (The group also helped birth a British star: the raspy, slow-motion rapper Tricky.)    Since ''Blue Lines,'' Massive Attack has released three more full-length albums, and the genre known in Britain as ''urban music'' has spawned its own subgenres, like grime; compared with that frenetic style, Massive Attack's mellow tracks seem old fashioned but not unwelcome. And while it's not usually a great sign when a group decides it's time for a victory lap, this one is certainly well earned.

It's a simple and effective premise for the kind of repertory work that the Lincoln Center orchestra does best","excerpt":"performing at the Rose Theater, it will tackle crisp, serious arrangements united by theme rather than style. The evening's Pittsburgh-reared guest stars will be Steve Nelson, a patiently exploratory vibraphonist, and Jeff Watts, known as Tain, a brilliantly locomotive drummer. Some of the Steel City's more famous jazz heroes, like the pianist Earl Hines, nicknamed Fatha, and the composer and pianist Billy Strayhorn, will be represented in the program's repertory. (The absence of living legends like the guitarist George Benson and the pianist Ahmad Jamal is a shortcoming that Mr. Marsalis, in his capacity as M.C., should manage to overcome.) A smaller and more single-minded tribute, in memory of another Pittsburgh native, the tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine (above), who died in 2000, will run simultaneously in the Allen Room. Eric Alexander and Robert Stewart will handle tenor saxophone duties, and the rhythm section will consist of Gene Ludwig on Hammond B3 organ, Dave Stryker on guitar and Grady Tate on drums. Appropriately, the music will recall a time just before the Steelers reigned supreme. (Thursday through Feb. 18 at 8 p.m., Frederick P.

The new attempt to dramatize why it is that some outwardly normal people are subject to irrational impulses comes off as rather ponderous entertainment, but there is no denying that the film contains a fair measure of morbid interest. And, unless the fad for so-called psychological drama has passed its zenith, \\"The Locket\\" should enjoy much the same popularity as its numerous predecessors. For this film has much the same virtues and faults of those others","excerpt":"perhaps even a few more faults, since neither Laraine Day nor Robert Mitchum display any discernible understanding of the characters they play.As the protagonist who is a snare and a delusion for at least three men, it is revealed that Nancy Monks suffered a severe psychological shock as a girl when she was accused of stealing a locket which she had greatly desired to possess. That she didn't actually steal the locket is impressed upon the audience quite early by Sheridan Gibney, the author, as is the idea that if one desires something strong enough that desire will be eventually gratified. This is a presumption, of course. Yet this is the premise the author uses to build a case of progressive insanity in a girl who, by lying and cheating with manifest charm and innocence, causes one man to die for a murder he didn't commit; a second man to commit suicide and drives two others to the depths of despair.A woman, particularly a beautiful one, of such character should be fascinating to behold, but Miss Day never quite manages to get inside of Nancy Monks and project the emotional tumult such a person might be expected to experience. And, in the central role as the one man who fathoms her mental problems, Robert Mitchum gives a completely monotonous and inexpressive performance. There is not the slightest hint about this rigid face of the temperament of an artist, even granting that the fellow he is representing is a boody sort. On the other hand, and luckily for the film, Brian Aherne gives a sensitive portrayal of a psychiatrist whose scientific instincts are blunted by his consummate love for Nancy. Several minor roles are well acted, however, and Sharyn Moffett has a few good moments playing Nancy at the fateful age of 10.Aside from a fundamental weakness in the script—even if the author's premise is sounder than we think, it still is not developed with convincing logic — \\"The Locket\\" suffers from a studied slowness in pace. John Brahm, the director, was forced by the script to resort to extensive flashbacks which give the film an episodic quality. However, despite its numerous weaknesses, \\"The Locket\\" picks up momentum during the last half of the story, and that may be sufficient to satisfy some people.

Perhaps the awkwardness of the drama is due to the changes in the cast","excerpt":"perhaps it is because, with Philip Dorn as a young Dutch surgical assistant with a bent for psychiatry, the series is venturing into new medical adventures. This time the case in hand is not one involving a difficult surgical operation or even an endocrine gland off balance; it is a hardly projected story of a young homicidal maniac.It is at least an interesting step forward in the frequently fascinating cases that come to Dr. Gillespie for ingenious cure. It has flashes of drama when the boy, intent on killing the old doctor for some imagined persecution, stalks his intended victim in the midnight quiet of the hospital's corridors and examination rooms. But the stupidity of his parents in refusing to allow his interment after a sudden killing of a pet dog reveals a symptom of dementia praecox is unconvincingly handled, and so for that matter is the history of his flight from home, his several murders, and his entry into the alarmed hospital as a resident physician who certainly would be recognized.Under the circumstances and because of a script which itself becomes confused in exploring the recesses of a mental ailment, young Philip Brown's performance in madness is only intermittently convincing. But Mr. Dorn, as Dr. Gillespie's new understudy, and Donna Reed as a romantic young lady, are personable and capable newcomers. Mr. Barrymore continues to splutter and fume outrageously, but that is his right. He seems a little confused by this newfangled psychiatry and so, unfortunately, it seems, were the script writers.

DeMille has wrought from Wilson Barrett's famous old stage work, \\"The Sign of the Cross.\\" It was offered last night at the Rialto before a brilliant audience, which revealed no little interest in its variety of handsome scenes, its battling gladiators, its orgies in Nero's court, its chanting Christians, its music and its screams.Throughout this really mammoth production the fine DeMillean hand is noticeable. Where there was a chance to touch up episodes it has been done. It is as though Nero were living in the twentieth century, with some of the lines and the squabbling in the Rome arena for places to see the big bill, which includes many combats between Nero's own subjects and scores of Christians and others marching to their deaths. The hungry lions rush up stone steps, eager to get to their human prey, and, just before that, a dying man is supposed to have his head trampled on by an elephant.The principal rôles are all well played, even though they are more or less in the modern manner. But the outstanding histrionic achievement comes from Charles Laughton, who shoulders the responsibility for Nero. He is a petulent Nero, a man who has no thought for other than himself, and when he is asked to grant the life of Mercia, acted by Elissa Landi, he begs not to be delayed any further or he will be late for the games. He sucks the fruit juice from his fingers as he watches men die, and most casually he puts his thumb down on a request for mercy, Nero looks as if he had adenoids and his voice is unmistakably English of the present day. But what matters that? It is a remarkable performance of the fiddling Emperor as Laughton sees him","excerpt":"perhaps quite a restrained piece of acting, considering what is generally known of this creature.Nero likes his poetry and his lyre. He is always ready to yawn, particularly when bored by demands for the lives of Christian prisoners. He rolls about on his great throne, never showing any vigor, except possibly once, when Marcus Superbus defies him. But that is only for a flash. He is fat and flabby and his royal robes always appear to be in the way. He is the antithesis to the smart Marcus, acted admirably by Fredric March, who, if his diction constantly reminds one of his impersonation of Dr. Jekyll and other rôles, wears his Roman uniform as if to the manner born.No De Mille picture would be complete without some suggestion of a bathtub, and here this director goes himself one better by having a small swimming pool filled with the milk from asses. It is the wont of Nero's wife, Poppaea, to revel in this pool and, as another touch from the master of Hollywood, one beholds first one cat and then another beside the pool lapping up milk. If Wilson Barrett could only have seen it!Another animal touch, which is reminiscent of one in Mr. de Mille's \\"King of Kings,\\" is that of having Poppaea on a lounge, while nearby is a leopard.Here one moment one sees Nero, enjoying his food, then one perceives a gladiator receiving the coup de grace, and subsequently one hears the Christians awaiting death declaiming the Sermon on the Mount or the Twenty-third Psalm. It is a constant mingling of religion, lust and blood. And for Mr. De Mille there must be realism when it comes to deaths in the arena, although he does spare the spectator's feelings toward the end by leaving to their imagination the general attacks of the lions on the singing Christians. Before that, however, there are scenes of one man struggling with a tiger.This picture is staged impressively and finely photographed. There is an abundance of imagination throughout its scenes and the story is well told. One feels, however, that the players must have been relieved when the Production was finished, for all work bard and thoroughly, even to those who merely figure for an instant or so in a death scene in the arena or the more fortunate who are spatting about their seats.Elissa Landi is restrained and graceful as Mercia. Miss Colbert is capital as the seductive Empress who is enamored of the handsome Marcus. Ian Keith is splendid as the snarling Tigellinus, who is jealous of Marcus's favor with Nero. Ferdinand Gottschalk does effective work as Glabrio and Harry Beresford makes the most of the rôle of Flavius. As a facial help in his impersonation of Nero, Mr. Laughton has a specially made-up Roman nose. Cecil B.

This UFA production contains some marvelous scenes in the white open spaces, but it is a pity that those entrusted with the portrayal of the intrepid explorers were not a little more restrained in their efforts to show anxiety, hunger, eagerness, affection for a dog and other emotions.\\"The Lost Expedition\\" is a picture that might have been far better had it been handled by Robert J. Flaherty, for that intelligent and imaginative producer's \\"Nanook of the North\\" is infinitely superior to this current offering. True \\"Nanook of the North\\" was concerned with the life of the Eskimo and not with the explorer. Nevertheless, in this German production one perceives quite a number of scenes that are in a way similar to those depicted by Mr. Flaherty. But they are never as good. There is in \\"The Lost Expedition\\" a constant desire to force matters, to exaggerate, and this spoils the effect of the scenes, especially when one mentally compares them with those in Mr. Flaherty's unforgettable film.Among the compelling scenes are those of the great walls of ice and others where the relatively small craft is seen fighting her way through the frozen waters. The tents in which the Eskimos live, or shelter themselves, are chiefly interesting for the number of persons they hold and also for the small aperture through which men and dogs make their exits and entries.In the would-be thrilling chapters the director has been too keen to make the heart of the spectator leap into his mouth, particularly in those scenes where one of the men is supposed to have fallen with his huskies and is found with his foot wedged in the ice. They have even imitated in a cheap fashion the gallant English officer, Lawrence Oates, who while with Scott in 1913 walked to his death in a blizzard because his feeble condition was a handicap to his comrades.

Like the well-stocked produce markets in Cairo, the rural scene conveys an impression of abundance. But in fact the Egyptian fellaheen, or peasants, produce only a little more than half the food consumed in the country. Egyptians, more than almost any other people in the developing world, are dependent upon foreign countries and food aid for their daily bread.   The Egyptian Government, also to a degree unknown almost anywhere else, subsidizes the prices of that food from abroad, to make it available to the restless and potentially explosive population in the cities. The Government keeps food prices so low that bread is actually fed to sheep and chickens, according to residents here.  This strategy of cheap food is a cornerstone of national policy and a key to political stability in Egypt.

By Danielle Steel. (Delacorte, $16.95.)\\n\\nEven her detractors acknowledge Danielle Steel to be the queen of formula fiction. Her admirers enthusiastically gobble up details about her latest blond, intelligent, sensitive, successful heroine. This spring's version, Faye Thayer, is cut from the same fabric as her forerunners in Miss Steel's prose, down to the marabou feathers edging her peach silk nightgowns. Faye, a movie actress turned director, lives, loves and mothers offspring with mostly gorgeous names, including a Lionel and a Vanessa, who rocket off to various fates - show business, homosexuality, cults, true love, true wealth, death in Vietnam. Faye's husband, Ward Thayer, starts strong - ''tall and proud,'' a recent widower, a lieutenant at Guadalcanal, a millionaire several times over, with a quiet smile. After spending all his money on ermines for Faye, he becomes a foil - he comes and goes, goes and comes, and eventually is persuaded to produce Faye's movies. There are the usual lingering descriptions of Aubusson rugs, Duesenbergs and other essential objects, and enough triple dots in the punctuation to fill a pepper shaker. The plot recapitulates Faye's life","excerpt":"periods of 10 years, when presumably nothing happened, are skipped, and a couple of tragedies occur - one at a narrative lull and one to eliminate an inconvenient character.

Suspecting that an attempt had been made to hide Perkins so that other coaches would not have a chance to speak with him, the N.C.A.A. officers went to Perkins's hotel and, in true detective style, staked out the lobby.

POLITICS","excerpt":"Perot Says the Time Is Here for a New Party"},{"year":"1992","title":"After a debate in which he exposed the vulnerabilities of his two opponents, Ross Perot leveled a vitriolic attack on the press Monday night, making it clear why he prefers to campaign through the unfiltered medium of television advertising.   Mr. Perot's aides said today that they still did not know when and where he might campaign in person. But the independent candidate for President continued to buy large and expensive chunks of television time, and it seems clear that the appeal of his campaign will be measured more by Nielsen ratings than by crowd estimates.    At a news conference after Monday night's debate in East Lansing, Mich., Mr. Perot revived his war of words with reporters by criticizing them for not conveying the enthusiasm of the crowds at his post-debate rallies. He also accused them of bias for not making a larger issue out of his complaint that some of President Bush's campaign aides have served as lobbyists for foreign countries.   During the extended assault Mr. Perot asserted that reporters \\"have less respect in this country than Congress,\\" that they \\"hate the fact that I'm in the race\\" and that he had \\"never met a more thin-skinned crowd in my life.\\" He singled out Time magazine, which he called \\"a joke,\\" and a reporter for The New York Times -- \\"I have to be real careful when you ask a question\\" -- for individual criticism. Anything for a Headline    \\"I think you'll do anything for a 'gotcha' story,\\" Mr. Perot said, referring to the news media in general. \\"That just means anything that'll get you a headline, get you a bonus. You get among your peers and you high five and say: 'O.K., now I'm a big man. I got a story on the front page.' \\"   The news media were not Mr. Perot's only target. He also publicly rebuked Orson G. Swindle 3d, the director of United We Stand, America, Mr. Perot's political organization. Mr. Swindle erred, Mr. Perot said at the news conference, by saying in an interview last weekend that a vote for Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee, would be \\"a disaster,\\" and that Mr. Bush would be a preferred second choice to Mr. Perot.   Saying it was \\"a serious mistake\\" for Mr. Swindle to suggest any preference for a second choice, Mr. Perot added that he had talked to him about the comments and that they would not be repeated. \\"That was just Orson expressing a personal opinion,\\" Mr. Perot said. \\"It does not reflect the feelings of our organization.\\"    The timing of Mr. Perot's attack on the news media was unusual because it came at a juncture when he has generally been receiving positive notices for his performances in the Presidential debates and his paid television presentations.    In Monday night's debate the Texas multibillionaire skillfully turned a question about his abandonment of General Motors to his advantage, using it to issue a poignant warning about the urgency of eliminating the budget deficit. Largely unchallenged by either Mr. Bush or Mr. Clinton, he also gave new emphasis to questions about the Bush Administration's dealings with Iraq, and reinforced the Republican contention that Mr. Clinton's experience as Governor of Arkansas would have little relevance in Washington.   While Mr. Perot had no public appearances today, his associates said they were thrilled about post-debate poll results showing significant improvement in his approval ratings and incremental progress in his potential share of the vote.   \\"Ross Perot won in these debates the right to kibbitz, the right to be a permanent voice in America,\\" said John Jay Hooker, a Nashville political activist and Perot supporter who said he spoke to the candidate this morning. \\"My opinion is that Ross Perot will be a candidate for President of the United States in 1996.\\"   Mr. Perot's son, Ross Perot Jr., said the campaign's mission in the next two weeks would be to convince voters that a vote for his father would not be wasted. \\"Voting for Perot is a vote for his principles,\\" he said. More Programs Planned    Mr. Perot is scheduled to broadcast his next 30-minute program on Thursday night, followed by presentations on both Friday and Saturday nights. The 90 minutes will cost him $812,000.    Mr. Perot, whose net worth has been estimated in various press reports at from $2.4 billion to $3.3 billion, said in Monday night's debate that he would spend up to $60 million of his own money on his campaign.   By the end of the weekend Mr. Perot will have spent about $18 million on television advertising since rejoining the race on Oct. 1, according to figures supplied today by the four networks. Through the end of August Mr. Perot's campaign spent another $17.5 million, most of it his own money, according to Federal financial disclosure reports.
