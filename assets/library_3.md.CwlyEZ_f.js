Reports Warn About Situation in Iraq  A classified cable sent by the Central Intelligence Agency's station chief in Baghdad has warned that the situation in Iraq is deteriorating and may not rebound any time soon, according to government officials. They also said its basic conclusions had been echoed in briefings presented by a senior C.I.A. official.   A1    Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld indicated that he expected American troops to withdraw from Iraq within four years, but he cautioned that any final decision hinged on the progress of Iraq's civilian government and security forces.   A11    A rift has developed among the major Shiite political groups in Iraq, which could lead to fierce competition for votes in national elections and could alter the religious and political alignment of the countrys new national assembly.   A11    Attack on U.S. Consulate  Five attackers thought to be linked to Al Qaeda staged a brazen daytime raid on the American Consulate in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, storming through the sprawling compounds fortified gate and starting a three-hour gun battle that left five local embassy employees and four of the attackers dead.   A1    No Deal Yet in Ukraine  Ukraine's fractious lawmakers reached a tentative agreement on political reforms to end a political stalemate before a new presidential election later this month.

The F.B.I. is investigating.   A18    Interrogation Tactics Faulted  The F.B.I. repeatedly criticized ''aggressive interrogation practices'' that its agents observed being used by the military at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, a series of confidential memorandums show.   A19    Grocery Worker Settlement  Three of California's largest supermarket chains and a group of immigrant janitors said they had reached a tentative $22.4 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by the workers, who said they often earned just $3.50 an hour and were never paid overtime.   A19    Medicare Regions Released  In the first big step to make prescription drug benefits available to the elderly, the Bush administration said it would carve the nation into 34 regions to administer the new Medicare program, which begins in January 2006.   A20    Ohio Vote Becomes Official  The Ohio secretary of state officially certified that President Bush won the state by 119,000 votes, but an array of groups continued to question the results.   A18    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-9    Trade Center Insurers Ordered to Pay Double  A federal jury said the destruction of the World Trade Center constituted two separate attacks, entitling the developer Larry A.

Vicky (Shelley Kastner), the film's central character, is an out-of-work German actress who shares a Lower East Side apartment with a flamboyantly gay roommate, Ben (David Bronstein). When her stuffy Bavarian father, Hans (Alfred Edel), arrives for a visit loaded down with a wurst and a Dustbuster, Vicki, who has written home that she is married, insists that Ben pose as her husband. But the ruse is shattered when daddy catches Vicky in bed with Lisa (Mary Lou Graulau), the lesbian chef in the restaurant where Vicky is a waitress. Lisa is one of two lovers Vicky juggles indecisively. Her boyfriend, Joe (Michael Massee), is a sulkily handsome female-to-male transsexual who handles a cigarette with the intense self-consciousness of James Dean in \\"Rebel Without a Cause.\\" Review/Film","excerpt":"Kinky Sexual Comedy s Twisted and Demure"},{"year":"1948","title":"McKinley, Clare H o.LARE H.

A British protectorate was established in 1892, and the islands were incorporated into the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands in 1915. The nine principal islands that make up the Ellice group escaped Japanese occupation in World War II and were used as Allied bases in the campaign to recapture the Pacific. The Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony was granted self-rule in 1971. In 1975 the Ellice Islands, inhabited mainly by Polynesians, seceded from the other (mainly Micronesian) islands of the colony and became independent as Tuvalu on Oct. 1, 1978. (See also “Kiribati.”) In a 1979 U.S.-Tuvalu friendship treaty, the United States relinquished claims, based on 19th-century guano mining, to the four southernmost islands, in return for access to World War II military airfields and veto power over other nations' use of the islands for military purposes. The economy is based on subsistence farming and fishing. Exports include copra and woven palm-leaf products, and hydroponic agriculture and offshore fisheries are being developed. Tuvalu remains heavily dependent on foreign aid, principally from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In 2000, Tuvalu was admitted to the U.N.

Yet this new Warner Brothers film, which was presented yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall, is not without merit. For the banalities of the script are quite effectively glossed over in the slick pictorial smoothness of Michael Curtiz's direction and the exciting quality of the score. The result is that there is considerable good entertainment in \\"Young Man With a Horn\\" despite the production's lack of balance.Kirk Douglas is a very definite asset as the unhappy young horn player. So also are Doris Day as the sparkling vocalist and Hoagy Carmichael as the piano-thumping jazz man who recounts the tortured life of Rick Martin, nonpareil of the trumpet. But the unseen star of the picture is Harry James, the old maestro himself, who supplies the tingling music which flows wildly, searchingly and forlornly from Rick Martin's beloved horn. This is an instance where the soundtrack is more than a complementary force. It is the very soul of the picture because if it were less provocative and compelling the staleness of the drama could be stultifying.Acting with communicable intensity, Mr. Douglas makes a pathetic and interesting person out of the sensitive genius with a consuming love for his trumpet. Considering the sparse dimension of the character, it is surprising how one almost can \\"hear\\" that elusive, high, clear note that is imprisoned in Rick's brain and which, naturally, no trumpet can ever sound. Mr. Douglas gives solid conviction to Mr. James' off-screen musical evocation of moods.Rick Martin is introduced as a parentless, troubled lad whose inherent musicality is developed by a kindly Negro jazz master. Rick experiences familiar frustrations playing for a living under the direction of stilted, conventional leaders, but eventually wins recognition as the best trumpet man in the land. Fame and money bring him to a fateful meeting with a neurotic rich girl, a tortured marriage and a rough skid into the gutter, whence he is rescued by the bright-eyed, open-faced vocalist played by Miss Day with complete naturalness. Her singing of \\"I Might Be Wrong But I Think You're Wonderful,\\" \\"The Very Thought of You\\" and \\"Marvelous\\" are indeed marvelous.Lauren Bacall has the role of the confused, mentally sick wife. It is a heavy, disagreeable part that would tax the ability of a more accomplished actress, and the fatuous dialogue she has to speak is no help either. Orley Lindgren is very appealing as the young Rick and Juano Hernandez puts a lot of warmth into his role as Rick's musical tutor and admiring friend.Although \\"Young Man With a Horn\\" has more in the way of dramatic faults than is good for it, somehow it all adds up to a rather agreeable movie. That soundtrack is wonderful, after all, and, for which, thank you so much, Mr. Harry James.

Recordings supported this belief, yet when the cold war ended the myth proved fragile. Tour performances in the last year by the Bolshoi Opera and the St. Petersburg National Opera left operagoers to wonder whether tales of Soviet operatic prowess were the creations of some obscure cultural branch of the Pentagon.   Now the St. Petersburg-based Kirov Opera, in town for a two-week run at the Metropolitan Opera House, has inherited the task of saving Russian opera's reputation. Its opening production, Prokofiev's \\"Fiery Angel,\\" a modernist anomaly staged by a Western team, left mixed impressions. But when the curtain came down on the company's opulent production of Tchaikovsky's \\"Queen of Spades\\" on Tuesday evening, it was reassuringly clear that there is a firm basis for all this talk of a living Russian opera tradition, and that the Kirov has the goods.

Although distinctive national vocal and instrumental styles have already largely disappeared in the West (and how might the earlymusickers bring    those    back?), much variety of coloration and accent still survives in the former Soviet bloc. But it probably cannot long endure in an era of heightened interchange with the West, despite the frenzied nationalism of the moment.   Under the circumstances, with so many venerable traditions in danger, it becomes too easy to adopt a skewed esthetic for a company like the Kirov Opera, setting aside relatively bland international standards of excellence and seeking Russian-ness for its own sake (though not mere provincialism of the sort displayed this year in New York by the St. Petersburg National Opera). But of course, the Kirov and other companies are entitled to their international aspirations as well and can only be judged accordingly. So there is little for the traditionalist to do but luxuriate in the remnants of the great national sounds where they can still be heard.

They've been placed in an orphanage after the suicide of their despairing mother. In their crisply pressed Catholic orphanage clothes, they appear before him, recognizing him as their daddy but not quite knowing how to greet him. Mature hangs back awkwardly, too, but when the attending nun suggests that the girls might like to give their father a hug, he sinks to the floor and wraps them in his giant bear paws, a supreme example of an actor using his whole being to capture the essence of a moment.

For Commodore Arthur Phillip, who leads a convoy of semiseaworthy vessels into partly uncharted seas, the venture is a desperate race against the French for territorial expansion. For the prisoners below decks, it is an unexpected alternative to the gallows. The narrative shifts from group to group, bringing into focus varying backgrounds and perspectives through some singular character types: Phillip, a bootstrap tough, a born risk taker","excerpt":"Kitty Brandon, whose credentials include some onstage triumphs and an offstage murder; Joe Cribb, a former soldier turned loose to live by his wits amid the London low life; Levi, a onetime peddler and medical quack in whom Messianic fervor is at war with practical experience. Although he knows that nothing can be had for nothing, he dreams of Australia's Botany Bay as an earthly paradise for the lost tribes of Israel. The Anglican cleric Richard Johnson disdains a land of milk and honey; what he wants is a harvest of Christian souls. By the end of the book part of the fleet has reached Botany Bay, but since this is the first in Mr. Talbot's projected series of novels about the founding of Australia, journey's end is only a beginning. The author (under a pseudonym) of spy novels and thrillers, he knows how to keep readers engrossed in the drama and brutality of naval exploration.
