A1    2 Charged in U.N. Program  The commission investigating the United Nations oil-for-food program in Iraq accused the former director, Benon V. Sevan, of accepting money from kickbacks in Iraqi oil sales and accused another United Nations official of soliciting a bribe from a program contractor.  A1    Terror Suspect in London Court  A 30-year-old Briton accused of trying to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Ore., in 1999 appeared at a heavily guarded London courthouse as a prelude to formal hearings to have him extradited to the United States.  A6    Israeli Pullout Plan Unaffected  Benjamin Netanyahu's resignation as the Israeli finance minister briefly roiled Israel's markets and set the stage for future political battles, but did not disrupt the planned evacuation of the Gaza Strip, set to begin next week.  A8    Japan Dissolves Lower House  Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi went through with a threat to dissolve the lower house of Parliament, setting an early general election for Sept. 11 after members of his own party voted down his goal to privatize Japan's postal service.  A3    Britain Warns of Attacks  The Foreign Office issued renewed warnings that attacks by terrorists might be imminent in Saudi Arabia, echoing a similar warning by the United States that had already prompted it to close its diplomatic missions there.  A6    NATIONAL  A12-16    9/11 Hijackers IdentifiedBeforehand, Officials Say  More than a year before the Sept. 11 attacks, a small, highly classified military intelligence unit identified Mohammed Atta and three other future hijackers as likely members of a cell of Al Qaeda operating in the United States, according to a former Defense Department intelligence official and a Republican member of Congress.  A1    President Signs Energy Bill  President Bush signed into law a bill that encourages increased domestic oil and gas production and the building of new nuclear power plants while creating incentives for alternative energy sources and requiring modernization of the nation's electrical grid.  A12    The new law weakens limits on exports of highly enriched uranium, a change opposed by the top nonproliferation official at the Energy Department. But a Canadian company that makes an isotope used in the United States in cancer diagnosis argued that it needed the change.  A12    New Claims of Detainee Abuse  Lawyers for a Qatari student in Illinois who has been imprisoned for more than two years as an enemy combatant charged that military jailers had subjected him to ''inhumane'' and abusive treatment, including threats against his family and mistreatment of the Koran in his South Carolina cell.  A13    Questions for Court Nominee  In the first hint of how he will steer the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Judge John G. Roberts Jr., Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the Judiciary Committee chairman, said he would press the nominee for his views on specific cases involving the authority of Congress to pass broad social legislation, a power that Democrats fear could be rolled back by a more conservative court.  A16    NEW YORK/REGION  B1-8         Pirro Decides to Challenge Clinton for Senate in '06  Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, announced that she would seek the Republican nomination to challenge Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid for re-election to the United States Senate.  A1    New Ideas for Cab Partitions  New York City's taxi commission is seeking new ways to design and install taxicab partitions, an invention whose primary purpose -- to deter holdups -- is being rethought as crime has dropped and passenger demand for comfort is greater than ever.  B1    SCIENCE TIMES  F1-8      Melanoma Is Epidemic. Or Is It?  The nation is in the grip of what looks like a terrifying melanoma epidemic, but some specialists say that what the numbers represent is not an epidemic of skin cancer but actually an epidemic of skin cancer screening.

A16    BUSINESS DAY  C1-13         G.M.'s China Strategy  General Motors, which has firmly pegged its fortunes in the United States to sales of the gas-guzzling Hummers and Chevrolet Suburbans, seems to have hit on a hot new formula in China -- $5,000 minivans that get 43 miles to the gallon in city driving. That combination has propelled G.M. into the leading spot in China's nascent car market.  A1    Another High for Oil Prices  Crude oil prices began the week by hitting a record $64 a barrel, pushed higher by concerns over Middle East supplies and refinery shutdowns in the United States. Crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at $63.94 a barrel, up $1.63, or 2.6 percent.  C1    Blunt Talk From Delphi Chief  The chief executive of Delphi, the big auto parts supplier, said that it could seek bankruptcy protection if it does not considerably reduce its labor costs, a development that could have severe consequences for the industry and its workers.

Paul Volcker, head of an independent investigative commission, warned that a class action suit that claims the assets of Holocaust victims are languishing in Swiss bank vaults could impede his team's progress and snuff out vital Swiss collaboration.   5    U.S. Sees Bosnian Serb Scheme  Attacks on NATO troops are being orchestrated by some Bosnian Serb leaders, senior officials have concluded. The United States and NATO vowed to be resolute if ''even one more such action'' occurred. An American soldier's car was firebombed in Vlasenica, a village in the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia. No one was injured.   5    Untouchable to Lead India  K.R. Narayanan became India's first ''untouchable'' President. He told Parliament and the nation that his election to the post symbolized the long-awaited arrival of an era when ''the concerns of the common man'' had taken precedence in the nation's affairs.   3    New Use for Cambodian Guns  Heavily armed troops were deployed around Phnom Penh, briefed to prevent high school students from cheating on their final exams. Photocopy shops were also guarded. Teachers in Cambodia are paid around $20 a month and bribery is widespread. The Government's crackdown follows its coup weeks ago.   4    Housing Angers East Jerusalem  The decision by the city government of Jerusalem to allow an American Jewish financier to build Jewish housing in an Arab neighborhood of East Jerusalem caught Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu off guard. He vowed to block the plan, which enraged Palestinians.   2    Albright Attends Asean Talks  Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright arrived in Malaysia for meetings with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on how Hun Sen might be persuaded to hold legitimate elections after the coup in Cambodia. Washington has suspended its aid to Cambodia for 30 days.   4    Strike Talks Resume in Israel  Israel's skies were quiet as flights were stopped and telephone communications were often cut by workers striking against plans to privatize Bezek, the country's telephone monopoly. After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the leaders of the Histadrut labor federation ''Bolshevik dinosaurs'' and they accused him of acting like a ''Bolshevik regime,'' the strike was called off and negotiations resumed.   3    NATIONAL   6-9    Ex-G.O.P. Chairmen Offer Differing Accounts of Loan  One former Republican National chairman contradicted another as Richard Richards told the Senate campaign finance inquiry that Haley Barbour had stressed an urgent need for a $2.1-million foreign loan guarantee to ''free up'' funds for Republican candidates in their 1994 campaign to take control of Congress.   1     Congress Adds Disability Aid  Congressional Republicans bowed to President Clinton's demands and tentatively agreed to restore disability benefits to more than half a million legal immigrants, as budget negotiators broke a week-long impasse. Republicans also agreed to extend Medicaid coverage to tens of thousands of children who will lose their disability benefits under the welfare law that President Clinton signed last August.   1     Caretaker Seeks Reward  The caretaker who stumbled on the hideout of Andrew P. Cunanan has filed a lawsuit in Dade County Circuit Court to claim a total of $65,000 in reward money that had been offered for the apprehension of Mr. Cunanan. Mr. Cunanan, who had been sought in the murder of five men, including the fashion designer, Gianni Versace, fatally shot himself on a houseboat in Miami Beach after the police were called by the caretaker.   6    Notoriety Follows Ex-Suspect  It has been almost a year since Richard A. Jewell was first identified by The Atlanta Journal as the focus of the Federal investigation into the July 27 bombing at Centennial Olympic Park. It has been almost nine months since the Justice Department cleared him of any involvement in the deadly attack. And yet, Mr. Jewell, 34, lives with his unwanted notoriety every day and his bitterness remains strikingly raw.   6    An internal Justice Department investigation into the bombing in Atlanta has concluded that a F.B.I. interview of Mr. Jewell was seriously flawed and resulted from a breakdown of communications within the law enforcement agency, Government officials said.   6    G.M. and Union Reach Accord  General Motors and the United Automobile Workers reached a tentative pact to end a strike at a transmission factory that had forced the company to idle six other plants.   7    Chrysler Seats Scrutinized  The Chrysler Corporation sent instructional videos last week to about 135,000 customers after receiving complaints that child seats built into its mini-vans malfunctioned. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the matter. No injuries or deaths have been attributed to the seats, Chrysler and the Federal safety agency said.   7     Senate Backs Treaty Change  The Senate unanimously urged the Clinton Administration not to pursue a treaty that would limit the industrial world's emissions of greenhouse gases unless the agreement requires developing countries to control their rapidly growing emissions at the same time.   8     NEW YORK/REGION   23-27    Jury Finds Gigante Guilty On Racketeering Charges  Vincent Gigante, the enigmatic figure known for wearing a bathrobe and pajamas in public, was convicted of being a powerful Mafia kingpin who conspired in plots to kill other gangland figures and who ran lucrative rackets in New York. At the same time, though, the jury in Federal District Court in Brooklyn acquitted him of ordering three gangland killings and could not agree on charges that he ordered four other murders.   1     Law enforcement officials said Mr. Gigante's racketeering conviction was unlikely to immediately weaken the Genovese crime family's powerful underworld position, since his active role as boss of the gang was reduced in recent years by intense law-enforcement pressure and a heart ailment.   25     Conviction in Cosby Trial  A Federal jury in Manhattan convicted Autumn Jackson of trying to extort $40 million from Bill Cosby, the man she claimed was her father. When she is sentenced on Oct. 22, she could receive a prison term of up to 12 years for her convictions on extortion and two other charges, conspiracy and traveling across state lines to commit the offenses. Her attorney said he planned to appeal the verdict and that Ms. Jackson is also considering a paternity suit against the actor.   1     Forced Labor Inquiry Expands  Federal agents raided two houses in a small North Carolina city and found more than a dozen illegal Mexican immigrants, most of them deaf, who officials believe were coerced into peddling trinkets at local shopping centers and giving most of the proceeds to ''bosses'' who oversaw the operation. The United States Attorney in Greensboro, N.C., said prosecutors were exploring whether the operation in Sanford was linked to the people charged last week in New York City with holding dozens of deaf Mexican peddlers in virtual slavery.   1    Crime Falls in New Jersey  Overall violent crime dropped 11 percent across New Jersey last year.

Advanced point-of-sale terminals, for example, have made the checkout counters at many stores nerve centers for data banks that catalogue every item sold and automatically analyze sales trends.   Now, the computer is on the verge of making a more direct impact on the way consumers do their shopping.  ''The retailer has always wanted to distinguish himself from the competition,'' said Joseph E. Bentzel, sales manager for American Bell Inc.'s consumer products division.

Some big retailers may change ownership, and many are expected to close some larger stores, open smaller ones and, in general, have a tough time surviving.   Department stores, specialty shops and other retailers are among the largest employers in New York City, with nearly 260,000 workers, down slightly from 1989.    For more than a year, retail sales in New York and its suburbs have barely kept pace with inflation. In part, this trend reflected the layoffs on Wall Street and elsewhere in New York. It is also a reflection of the downturn in the national economy.    Indeed, sales at department stores in the New York metropolitan area declined by 4.1 percent in 1989, in contrast to an annual growth rate of 8.7 percent from 1982 to 1987.  Financial Pressures    Perhaps more than anything else, the financial pressures created by merger-induced bankruptcies at the parent company of Bloomingdale's, at Abraham & Straus and at Stern's, and the debt-laden position of R. H. Macy & Company have raised questions about the future of these famous stores.    B. Altman closed its doors for those reasons in January, joining other failed New York retailers like Gimbels, Ohrbach's, Korvettes, J. W. Mays and S. Klein.    Some industry executives believe the major retailers will survive these difficulties. \\"Bloomie's and Macy's will still be around because of their unique position, while A.& S. and Stern's will continue to occupy the middle ground,\\" said Thomas Rauh, regional director of retail services for the accounting firm of Ernst & Young.   Others have doubts. \\"I cannot say positively that Macy's and Bloomingdale's will survive,\\" said Helen Galland, a marketing consultant and former president of Bonwit Teller. \\"They are too highly leveraged.\\"    Reflecting much of the same consolidation and financial pressures, the garment industry is expected to be whittled down as retailers move more toward large suppliers with out-of-town or overseas manufacturing.   As in retailing, the trend to bigger but fewer companies will create opportunities for small and medium-size fashion designers and garment makers to provide more specialized merchandise. But these companies will have to be highly creative to survive.
