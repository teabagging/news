The academic (Cherry Jones) is embarked on a literary mission to prove her theory that \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and \\"Othello\\" were originally written as comedies, not tragedies, and magically she has found herself within the plays.   This extended comedy sketch by Ann-Marie MacDonald (at the CSC Theater) has its satirically redeeming features, but it also seems like a collegiate prank. It is arch when it should be airy and it has moments of unnecessary vulgarity. Before the heroine arrives in Verona, she has dawdled too long in Cyprus trying to rectify \\"Othello.\\" As a rewriter of Shakespeare, Ms. MacDonald cannot compete with Lee Blessing (in \\"Fortinbras\\"), to say nothing of Tom Stoppard.

But results of the 169 tests on all the medal winners and world record-holders came back negative, FINA, the sport's world governing body, said yesterday in Lausanne, Switzerland.    In administering the tests, FINA said it followed the same guidelines as the International Amateur Athletic Federation and the International Olympic Committee. (AP) GOLF  Lancaster Splashes Into Lead  Neal Lancaster, whose only tour victory came this year in a rain-shortened tournament, shot a second straight five-under 65 yesterday to take the lead in the soggy Hardee's Classic.

In May, Lancaster won the Byron Nelson Classic in a six-way playoff when the tournament was reduced to 36 holes by rain.

J. O'Rourke makes two lexicographical assertions that should not go unchallenged.     First, O'Rourke links Macaulay Culkin's ''I don't think so'' with a 19th-century catchphrase recorded by Eric Partridge. A slang term or phrase is often characterized by an unexpected inflection or emphasis. This is precisely the case with Culkin's ''I don't think so,'' and I would argue that it is not related to prior ripostes.     Second, O'Rourke suggests that ''cool'' as we know it today dates to the 1820's, a suggestion that has been rejected by every lexicographer who has given serious consideration to ''cool'' in all of its variant glory. O'Rourke's 19th-century ''cool'' is not the ''cool'' that arose in the 1930's (superlative) let alone the ''cool'' of the 1940's (stylish). Savan got it right","excerpt":"O'Rourke did not.     Savan does not set out to write a dictionary or etymological reference. She explores the relationship between language and society. I believe that she has made an important contribution and that her analysis of pop speak is qualitatively different from past considerations of catchphrases, including the work of Eric Partridge, whose torch I carry as the senior editor of a forthcoming expansion of Partridge's slang dictionary.

A ballet classic by Michel Fokine, \\"Les Sylphides\\" has been performed too often with a life-killing dutifulness. The Oakland performers successfully blended the airy expansiveness of late-20th-century ballet dancing with the ballet manners of another era to radiant account in a staging of the ballet by Betsy Erickson and Howard Sayette. Cynthia Chin, a young ballerina of special graciousness and elegance, stood out in the fine cast for her big, soft jumps and the way her steps and gestures seemed to evaporate into the imaginary mists of the ballet's 19th-century spirit-inhabited forest. Nikolai Kabanyayev, a guest artist frlm the Kirov Ballet, was a sensitive partner with lyrically curving ports de bras and winning Romantic mannerisms. The lead cast was completed by Joy Gim, who danced the Valse, and Abra Rudisill, who danced the Prelude and in the pas de deux. The corps was a marvel of limpid precision and grave-faced charm.   John Butler has made a handsome spectacle in his dance setting of Carl Orff's overblown \\"Carmina Burana.\\" And the Oakland dancers made the journey through that lumbering score seem a lot quicker, in a performance that emphasized the stylish, formal calligraphics of Mr. Butler's choreography and played down the music's stale medievalisms. Miss Gim was exquisite as the white-robed spirit of innocence and spring, with Miss Rudisill hard-edged and sensuous as the figure of earthly love and death. Joral Schmalle and Ron Thiele brought an effective, understated gutsiness to the dance's inner- and outer-directed heroes.
