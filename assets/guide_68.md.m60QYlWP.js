Though it was just one study, in a field -- schizophrenia research -- that is constantly producing new theories, for some people it was delicious proof that ''men have biological clocks, too.'' Maybe the news would finally puncture what one female reporter termed the ''brazen hubris'' of older dads, who were assumed to be having children mainly to prove to the world that they weren't shooting blanks. Bear in mind that ''older'' in this study meant not just Strom Thurmond or Rupert Murdoch old but also men in their late 40's -- a group we are pretty well accustomed to seeing as first-time fathers, especially given that many of us first-time mothers are kind of long in the tooth ourselves.     Still, feminist commentators like Katha Pollitt and Gloria Steinem seemed to see the study as good news in a way, even if it did mean that more children might be at risk for a devastating disease. At the least, it was payback for the fact that ''the woman,'' as Pollitt said, ''is always blamed for everything.'' To Steinem, it was vindication: she had been trying for years, she said, to call attention to the health menace posed by swaggering dads pushing the frontiers of fertility. And even an author of the study couldn't resist an account of its implications that focused more on male egos than on schizophrenia. ''While scientists have known for years that older fathers are a major source of gene mutations,'' Dr. Dolores Malaspina, a Columbia University researcher, said, ''the public doesn't seem to have absorbed it, which may have something to do with a culture that sees older fathers as triumphantly virile.''

And, in that time, the most the camera shows us in a rambling and random tour of an Indian village is a baffling mosaic of candid and crude domestic scenes.There are shots of a creaky old woman, a harassed mother, her lively little girl and a cheerful husband and father who plainly cannot provide for his small brood. There are scenes, as familiar as next-door neighbors, of the mother trying to get the child to eat, washing clothes, quarreling with the husband or pushing the child toward school.Satyajit Roy, Indian artist, who wrote the screen play and directed this film, provides ample indication that this is his first professional motion picture job. Any picture as loose in structure or as listless in tempo as this one is would barely pass as a \\"rough cut\\" with the editors in Hollywood.But, oddly enough, as it continues—as the bits in the mosaic increase and a couple of basically human and dramatic incidents are dropped in, such as the pitiful death of the old woman and the sickness and death of the little girl—the poignant theme emerges and the whole thing-takes a slim poetic form. By the time it comes to its sad end, it has the substance of a tender threnody.Much of the effect is accomplished by some stunningly composed domestic scenes, well performed—or pictured—by an excellent Indian cast, and exquisitely photographed by Subrata Mitra in tastefully filtered blacks and whites. And a finely conceived and sympathetic original musical score, composed by Ravi Shankar, in which native instruments are employed, sets the whole sad story in the frame of a melancholy mood.Karuna Banerji is touching as the mother who is most distressed by poverty and Uma Das Gupta is lovely and sensitive as the girl. Chunibala Devi is fantastically realistic and effective as the aging crone and Subir Banerji is wistful and beguiling as the small son of the family.As we say, it is quite exotic. The dialogue often sounds like a Gramophone record going at high speed. English subtitles barely make some sense. But there are lovely little threads in the strange fabric. It's a film that takes patience to be enjoyed.

Last week two pathologists who took part in the Kennedy autopsy broke a vow to keep silent about their findings and offered in the Journal of the American Medical Association what appears to be conclusive evidence that the President had adrenal insufficiency, or Addison's disease.   During his Presidency, Kennedy's cheeks periodically became puffy, suggesting he was being treated with cortisone and other hormones that compensate for the role the adrenal glands play in regulating circulation, inflammatory responses and minerals in the body. But Kennedy and his aides, including the White House physician, Dr. Janet Travell, either flatly denied the rumors or used cleverly worded cover stories to mislead the public.

The seemingly endless Santa Fe story illustrates almost everything that can go wrong for a lender, short of a complete failure to pay. Those who lent the money -- or perhaps their great-grandchildren -- are about to get dollars that are each worth less than seven 1881 cents. Along the way, the lenders have suffered through corporate reorganizations, fraudulent accounting and foolish business plans. They have been buffeted by volatile interest rates and by worries over credit quality. And they even lost their protection against inflation when Congress and the Supreme Court teamed up against them in the 1930's.

Now, in the age of AIDS, patients and their advocates say that the law could also be used to force the Government to release manuscripts and research data before they are published in medical journals. The result has been a clash between scientists and patients over who owns the information generated by Government-sponsored studies.   Using the Freedom of Information Act, advocates for people infected with the AIDS virus are trying to get unpublished data from Federal studies that they say include the cases of 300 women, by far the largest number ever participating in clinical trials involving the disease.

NEWS OF THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Patric Knowles Gets Lead With Olivia de Havilland in 'To Each His Own'--7 Film Arrivals This Week"},{"year":"1946","title":"Out of the welter of fact and fancy that has followed the mystic and obscure activities of the Office of Strategic Services, Paramount has fashioned the first of the cloak-and-dagger films in \\"O.S.S.,\\" which arrived at the Gotham on Saturday. In beating Hollywood to the nation's screens the studio has manufactured a superior spy story but one, which with all due respect to its obvious craftsmanship, merely suggests the myriad exploits of that brave and largely unsung corps of daring young men and women who did so much to sap the enemy's strength and prepare him for the final kill. Despite the inference of the title, \\"O.S.S.\\" is not all-inclusive but is a generally thrilling, albeit incidental, chapter of the modern derring-do, which, by all accounts, has made the intrigues of Dumas and Oppenheim as startling as a bedtime yarn.With the blessing of General Donovan, whose foreword explains that the picture, while fictional, is a \\"composite\\" of actual events, and a staff of O.S.S. consultants, Richard Maibaum, who wrote and produced it, and Irving Pichel, who directed, have made this offering tense, tightly written and swiftly paced. Its brief, opening sequences, depicting the speed with which the O.S.S. had to train an espionage service to combat and top the enemy's smoothly functioning spy system, has the factual credibility of a documentary.Suspensefully the camera follows the training period of a quartet of operatives, cryptically called \\"Applejack,\\" to their base in London. Thereafter the story, although simplicity itself, is replete with action. The group, parachuted into occupied France with the main objective of blowing up a vitally strategic railway tunnel in Normandy, loses its leader. Alan Ladd takes command and, with the aid of Geraldine Fitzgerald and of the Maquis, whom they already have contacted, accomplish their mission. And, though the third member of their contingent is killed, Ladd and Miss Fitzgerald continue secretly to direct Allied air bombardments and finally to aid our troops in the ultimate push across the Rhine.While Alan Ladd and Miss Fitzgerald are romantically as well as patriotically teamed, Ladd shows an uncommon apathy and distrust (at first) for his pretty partner. To the credit of the O.S.S. and Paramount, it must be noted that while this affair is permitted to bud, Ladd's escapades are mainly military and rarely amorous. As a man who has taken enough beatings (in the movies) to satisfy even a Marquis de Sade, Ladd comes through this adventure unscathed, except for one. Throughout the rest of the melodrama he makes a convincing, intelligent and hard undercover agent, whose histrionics are simple and acceptable.Miss Fitzgerald, with whom he falls in love and, who, when the other members of the band are caught and killed by the Nazis, makes her secret agent an intense, restrained and lovely person. John Hoyt (known locally to night-club circles and playgoers as John Hoysradt), who plays a hard-bitten and esthetic Nazi colonel","excerpt":"Patric Knowles, as a naval commander in charge of O.S.S. operations in France and Harold Vermilyea, a local actor who is making his screen debut as a wily Gestapo agent, lend solid support to the principals. \\"O.S.S.\\" is far from being the definitive pictorial record and its plausibility is questionable, but it does make an engrossing thriller.

When it was published in 1939, the novel was criticized as being full of lies, corruption and Communistic themes. It sold out in a flash. This special looks at seven stories that dared to challenge the fiction of the American dream: works from Theodore Dreiser’s “Sister Carrie” and Edith Wharton’s “House of Mirth” to F.

A full transcript: nytimes.com/supremecourt.    Abortion    SENATOR SPECTER -- Starting with the woman's right to choose, Judge Alito, do you accept the legal principles articulated in Griswold v. Connecticut that the liberty clause in the Constitution carries with it the right to privacy?    JUDGE ALITO -- Senator, I do agree that the Constitution protects a right to privacy. And it protects the right to privacy in a number of ways. The Fourth Amendment certainly speaks to the right of privacy. People have a right to privacy in their homes and in their papers and in their persons. And the standard for whether something is a search is whether there's an invasion of a right to privacy, a legitimate expectation of privacy.    SENATOR SPECTER -- Well, Griswold dealt with the right to privacy on contraception for married women. You agree with that?    JUDGE ALITO -- I agree that Griswold is now, I think, understood by the Supreme Court as based on the liberty clauses of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment.    SENATOR SPECTER -- Would you agree, also, with Eisenstadt, which carried forward Griswold to single people?    JUDGE ALITO -- I do agree with the result in Eisenstadt.    SENATOR SPECTER -- Let me move now directly into Casey v. Planned Parenthood and picking up the gravamen of Casey as it has applied Roe on the woman's right to choose, originating from the privacy clause with Griswold being its antecedent. And I want to take you through some of the specific language of Casey to see what your views are and what weight you would ascribe to this rationale as you would view the woman's right to choose.     In Casey, the joint opinion said, quote, People have ordered their thinking and lives around Roe. To eliminate the issue of reliance would be detrimental. For two decades of economic and social development, people have organized intimate relationships and reliance on the availability of abortion in the event contraception should fail -- pretty earthy language but that's the Supreme Court's language. And the court went on to say, quote, The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the nation has become facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.     Now that states in specific terms the principle of reliance, which is one of the mainstays, if not the mainstay, on stare decisis precedent to follow tradition. How would you weight that consideration on the woman's right to choose?    JUDGE ALITO -- Well, I think the doctrine of stare decisis is a very important doctrine. It's a fundamental part of our legal system. And it's the principle that courts in general should follow their past precedents. And it's important for a variety of reasons. It's important because it limits the power of the judiciary. It's important because it protects reliance interests. And it's important because it reflects the view that courts should respect the judgments and the wisdom that are embodied in prior judicial decisions. It's not an inexorable command, but it is a general presumption that courts are going to follow prior precedents. And, as you mentioned --    SENATOR SPECTER -- Well, how do you come to grips with the specifics where the court, the joint opinion, spoke of reliance on the availability of abortion in the event contraception should fail? On that specific concept of reliance.    JUDGE ALITO -- Well, reliance is, as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, one of the important foundations of the doctrine of stare decisis. It is intended to protect reliance interests. And people can rely on judicial decisions in a variety of ways. There can be concrete economic reliance, government institutions can be built up in reliance on prior decisions, practices of agencies and government officials can be molded based on reliance. People can rely on decisions in a variety of ways. And my view --    SENATOR SPECTER -- Let me move on to another important quotation out of Casey. Quote, A terrible price would be paid for overruling Casey, for overruling Roe. It would seriously weaken the court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and to overrule Roe under fire would subvert the court's legitimacy. Do you see the legitimacy of the court being involved in the precedent of Casey?    JUDGE ALITO -- Well, I think that the court, and all the courts -- the Supreme Court, my court -- all the federal courts should be insulated from public opinion. They should do what the law requires in all instances. That's why the members of the judiciary are not elected. We have a basically democratic form of government, but the judiciary is not elected, and that's the reason, so that they don't do anything under fire. They do what the law requires.    SENATOR SPECTER -- But do you think there is as fundamental a concern as legitimacy of the court would be involved if Roe were to be overturned?    JUDGE ALITO -- Well, Mr. Chairman, I think that the legitimacy of the court would be undermined in any case if the court made a decision based on its perception of public opinion. It should make its decisions based on the Constitution and the law. It should not sway in the wind of public opinion at any time.    SENATOR SPECTER -- There's just the final quotation that I intend to raise from Casey and it is, quote, After nearly 20 years of litigation in Roe's wake, we are satisfied that the immediate question is not the soundness of Roe's resolution of the issue, but the precedential force that must be accorded to its holding. That separates out the original soundness of Roe, which has been criticized, and then lays emphasis on the precedential value. How would you weigh that consideration, were this issue to come before you, if confirmed?    JUDGE ALITO -- Well, I agree that in every case in which there is a prior precedent, the first issue is the issue of stare decisis and the presumption is that the court will follow its prior precedents. There needs to be a special justification for overruling a prior precedent.    SENATOR SPECTER -- Judge Alito, the commentators have characterized Casey as a superprecedent. Judge Luttig, in the case of Richmond Medical Center, called the Casey decision super stare decisis. And in quoting from Casey, Judge Luttig pointed out the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed. And then, in support of Judge Luttig's conclusion that Casey was super stare decisis, he refers to Stenberg v. Carhart and quotes the Supreme Court saying, We shall not revisit these legal principles.     Now, that's a pretty strong statement for the court to make, that we shall not revisit the principles upon which Roe was founded. And the concept of a super stare decisis or superprecedent arises, as the commentators have characterized it, by a number of different justices appointed over a considerable period of time. Do you agree that Casey is a superprecedent or a super stare decisis, as Judge Luttig said?    JUDGE ALITO -- Well, I personally would not get into categorizing precedents as superprecedents or super-duper precedents or anything --    SENATOR SPECTER -- You say super-duper?    JUDGE ALITO -- Right.    SENATOR SPECTER -- Good.    JUDGE ALITO -- Any sort of categorization like that sort of reminds me of the size of laundry detergent in the supermarket.     I agree with the underlying thought that when a precedent is reaffirmed, that strengthens the precedent. And when the Supreme Court says that we are not going to --    SENATOR SPECTER -- How about being reaffirmed 38 times?    JUDGE ALITO -- Well, I think that when a precedent is reaffirmed, each time it's reaffirmed that is a factor that should be taken into account in making the judgment about stare decisis. And when a precedent is reaffirmed on the ground that stare decisis precludes or counsels against re-examination of the merits of the precedent, then I agree that that is a precedent on precedent.     Now, I don't want to leave the impression that stare decisis is an inexorable command, because the Supreme Court has said that it is not. But it is a judgment that has to be based, taking into account all of the factors that are relevant and that are set out in the Supreme Court's cases.    SENATOR SPECTER -- Judge Alito, during the confirmation hearing of Chief Justice Roberts, I displayed a chart. I don't ordinarily like charts, but this one I think has a lot of weight because it lists all 38 cases which have been decided since Roe, where the Supreme Court of the United States had the opportunity to -- Senator Hatch is in the picture.    SENATOR LEAHY -- Just balance it on Orrin's head.    SENATOR SPECTER -- It's a good photo-op for Senator Hatch. Senator Leahy's complaining.    SENATOR LEAHY -- Balance it on Orrin's head.    SENATOR HATCH -- He wants that over by Leahy.    SENATOR SPECTER -- He wants it on his side.     Well, I think the point of it is that there have been so many cases, so many cases -- 15 after your statement in 1985 that I'm about to come to and 8 after Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which is why it has a special significance. And I'm not going to press the point about superprecedent. I'm glad I didn't have to mention super-duper, that you did. Thank you very much.     Let me come now to the statement you made in 1985 that the Constitution does not provide a basis for a woman's right to an abortion. Do you agree with that statement today, Judge Alito?    JUDGE ALITO -- Well, that was a correct statement of what I thought in 1985 from my vantage point in 1985, and that was as a line attorney in the Department of Justice in the Reagan administration.     Today, if the issue were to come before me, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed and the issue were to come before me, the first question would be the question that we've been discussing and that's the issue of stare decisis. And if the analysis were to get beyond that point, then I would have to approach the question with an open mind and I would listen to the arguments that were made.    SENATOR SPECTER -- So you would approach it with an open mind notwithstanding your 1985 statement?    JUDGE ALITO -- Absolutely, senator. That was a statement that I made at a prior period of time when I was performing a different role.      And as I said yesterday, when someone becomes a judge, you really have to put aside the things that you did as a lawyer at prior points in your legal career and think about legal issues the way a judge thinks about legal issues.    Search and Seizure    SENATOR LEAHY -- Let's go into a couple of search cases. And I think we've indicated to you that we'd bring these up. Doe v. Groody, Baker v. Monroe Township, those are unauthorized searches.     In Doe, the police officers had a warrant for a man at a certain address. When they arrived, they found his wife and 10-year-old daughter. They were not in the warrant. They posed no threat. But the officers detained them and strip-searched them, wife and the 10-year-old, the 10-year-old girl.     Baker, her mother and her three teenage children were detained and searched when they arrived at the home of the mother's adult son. They didn't live there. They weren't in the home. They were outside. They didn't pose a threat to the police but they were ordered at gunpoint to lie on the ground. They were handcuffed. They were taken into the house, and they were searched.      Doe, the strip-search case of the 10-year-old girl, the officers didn't ask for permission to search anybody beyond the man they were looking for. In fact the magistrate didn't give a search warrant for anybody else.      But you went beyond that, and you said that they were justified in strip-searching this 10-year-old and the mother. You went beyond the four corners of the search warrant the magistrate gave.      And one of your members of the Third Circuit, Judge Chertoff, who's now the head of homeland security, and a former prosecutor, criticized your reasoning. He said that it would allow it to come dangerously close to displacing the critical role of the independent magistrate.      Do you continue to hold the position you took in your opinion? Or do you now agree with the majority -- they're right and you're wrong?    JUDGE ALITO -- Well, senator, I haven't had occasion to think that what I said in that case was correct. But let me just explain what was going on there. The issue there was whether -- the first issue was whether the warrant authorized the search of people who were on the premises. And that was the disagreement between me and the majority. And it was a rather technical issue about whether the affidavit that was submitted by the police officers was properly incorporated into the warrant for the purposes of saying who could be searched. And I thought that it was, and I thought that it was quite clear that the magistrate had authorized a search for people who were on the premises.      That was the point of disagreement.      I was not pleased that a young girl was searched in that case, and I said so in my opinion. That was an undesirable thing. But the issue wasn't whether there should be some sort of rule or Fourth Amendment law that a minor can never be searched. And I think if we were to --    SENATOR LEAHY -- But we'd both agree on that, judge. The only reason I bring up these two cases -- it seems in both of them you went beyond the four corners of the search warrant and you settled all issues in a light most favorable -- the majority in the opinion didn't, but you did -- in the light most favorable to law enforcement.      In fact, in Baker the majority said that. And I worry about this because I always worry that the courts must be there to protect individuals against an overreaching government. In this case, your position in the minority was that you protected what the majority felt was an overreaching government.      Am I putting too strong an analysis on that?    JUDGE ALITO -- I do think you are, Senator.    SENATOR LEAHY -- O.K.    JUDGE ALITO -- I think you need to take into account what was going on here. The police officers prepared an affidavit, and they said, We have probable cause to believe that this drug dealer hides drugs on people who are on the premises, and therefore when we search, we want authorization, not just to search him, but to search everybody who's found on the premises because we think he hides -- we have reason to believe he hides drugs there.      And the magistrate who issued the warrant said that the affidavit was incorporated into the warrant for the purpose of establishing probable cause.      Now, we're supposed to read warrants in a common-sense fashion because they're prepared by police officers, for the most part, not by lawyers and they're often prepared under a lot of time pressure.      And it seemed to me that reading this in a common-sense fashion, what the magistrate intended to do was to say, yes, you have authorization to do what you ask us to do.      But even beyond that, the issue there was whether these police officers could be sued for damages. And they couldn't be sued for damages if a reasonable officer could have believed that that's what the magistrate intended to authorize. And I thought that surely a reasonable officer could view it that way.     Now, Judge Chertoff looked at it differently. And there are cases where reasonable people disagree.    SENATOR LEAHY Let me --    JUDGE ALITO -- And that's all that was going on.    SENATOR LEAHY -- I know. Looking at reasonable -- I spent eight years in law enforcement. I don't know where any reasonable officer under those circumstances would feel they could strip-search a 10-year-old girl.    Law Enforcement Immunity    SENATOR KENNEDY -- Mellott v. Heemer, where the U.S. Marshal Service forcibly evicted a family of dairy farmers from their home and their farm. These farmers had no criminal record and were suspected of no crime. But after they fell on very hard times, the property was sold at a public auction. U.S. marshals were sent to evict them.     Remember, the marshals were sent to carry out a civil action. Not a criminal action, a civil action. These farmers had committed no crime.      Now, I respect the U.S. marshals. They have a tough job, and they do it with great professionalism. But in this case the marshals entered the house with loaded guns. The family was unarmed, did not resist. But still the marshals pointed loaded guns at their heads, chests and backs. One marshal chambered a cartridge in his gun. Twice they pushed the wife into her chair.      The trial judge held there was enough evidence in this case to have a jury review the facts, hear the testimony and decide whether the marshals used too much force to evict these farmers.      But that didn't sit well with you, Judge Alito. You grabbed the case away from the jury. You wouldn't let them hear the testimony or make up their own mind about whether the marshals had gone too far. No, you simply substituted your judgment for the jury's and decided that the marshals' conduct was, as a matter of law, objectively reasonable. Judgment for the marshals, no jury of their peers for the farmers.      Why, Judge Alito?      Your colleague on the Third Circuit, Judge Rendell, called the marshals' conduct Gestapo-like. Gestapo-like. She said that seven marshals detained, terrorized a family and friends, ransacked a home while carrying out an unresisted civil eviction.      The trial judge thought the decision should be made by the jury. Why didn't you let the jury exercise an independent check on the marshals' actions?    JUDGE ALITO -- There was some additional information regarding these people that was important. And that was that they had threatened other people, as I recall. And there was evidence about the possession of weapons and evidence that they would be dangerous. And that was the basis on which the marshals acted the way they did.      This was a case in which the marshals were sued for civil damages. And they asserted what's called the qualified immunity defense. And that means that if a reasonable person could have thought there was a basis for doing what they did, then they are entitled not to be tried.      And that's the law. I didn't make up that law.    SENATOR KENNEDY -- No, they -- that's right.    SENATOR SPECTER -- Let him finish, Senator Kennedy.    JUDGE ALITO -- That's not a legal standard that I made up. And that was the way I saw the case. And that's the way the other judge, who was in the majority, saw the case. Now these cases involve difficult line-drawing arguments at times, and I respect Judge Rendell's view of this very much. But reasonable people will view these things differently.    SENATOR KENNEDY -- Well, the issue then was the actions of the marshals: whether it was reasonable, whether it was reasonable. And here you have a judge, Judge Rendell, saying it was Gestapo-like, to talk about terrorizing a family and friends, ransacking a home while carrying out an unresisted civil eviction.      Aren't juries there to make a judgment and determination whether it was reasonable or not reasonable? And didn't your action take that away because you ruled, as a matter of law, that their conduct was reasonable?    JUDGE ALITO -- The Supreme Court has told us how we have to handle this issue. And it is for the judiciary to decide in the first place whether a reasonable officer could have thought that what the officer was doing was consistent with the Fourth Amendment. And we have to make that decision.      Now, if we decide that there's an issue of fact, if there's a dispute in the testimony about the evidence that the marshals had or about what these individuals were doing at the time when the search is taking place or what the marshals did, then certainly those factual issues have to be resolved by the jury.    Executive Power    SENATOR GRAHAM -- Do you believe that any president, because we're at war, could say the statute on torture gets in the way of my ability to defend the United States, therefore, I don't have to comply with it?    JUDGE ALITO -- The president has to comply with the Constitution and the laws of the United States that are enacted consistent with the Constitution. That's the principle. The president is not above the Constitution and the laws. Now, there are issues about the interpretation of the laws and the interpretation of the Constitution but --    SENATOR GRAHAM -- Are you a strict constructionist?    JUDGE ALITO -- I think it depends on what you mean by that phrase and if you --    SENATOR GRAHAM -- Well, let's forget that. We'll never get the end of that. Have you heard the term used?    JUDGE ALITO -- I have heard the term used.    SENATOR GRAHAM -- Is it fair to say that when it's used by politicians, people like me, that we're trying to tell the public we want a judge who looks at things very narrowly, that doesn't make a bunch of stuff up? Is that a fair understanding of what a strict constructionist may be in the political world?    JUDGE ALITO -- Well, if a strict constructionist is a judge who doesn't make things up, then I'm a strict constructionist.    SENATOR GRAHAM -- There you go.    JUDGE ALITO -- I agree with that, Senator.    SENATOR GRAHAM -- Now, if there's a force resolution that Congress passes to allow any president to engage in military activity against someone trying to do us harm, and the force resolution says the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, or just make it generic, if someone argued that that declaration from Congress was a blanket exemption to the warrant requirement under FISA, would that be a product of strict constructionist legal reasoning?    JUDGE ALITO -- I think that a strict constructionist, as you understand it, would engage in a certain process in evaluating that question. And a strict constructionist, a person who interprets the law -- and that's how I would put it -- a person who interprets the law would look at the language of the authorization for the use of military force and legislative history that was informative, maybe past practices where there are prior enactments that are analogous to that, what was the understanding of those, and a host of other considerations that might go into the interpretive process.

Experts or visionaries trying to explain what it portends find themselves resorting to metaphors -- superhighway, global public space -- that are far from crystal clear. Maybe it's just the newness of the thing or its still-unformed nature or the immensity and untidiness of the prospect of all that stuff being spewed endlessly, from everywhere to everywhere without any traffic director.         Whatever the difficulties, they prove too much for tomorrow night's \\"Firing Line\\" debate. Despite the large title -- \\"Resolved: The Government Has the Right to Regulate the Internet\\" -- the argument narrows to provisions of the Communications Decency Act, passed this year, that would crack down on \\"indecent\\" material that might be seen by children. Since not all the panelists  claim to know exactly what the law says, and those who do know disagree vehemently on important details, viewers are likely to emerge from these two noisy hours perplexed about whether the new law will protect children or repress adults.
