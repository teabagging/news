On ABC, Ms. Walters presents \\"The Ten Most Fascinating People of 1995,\\" including a good boy, John F.

Mr. Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, assumes the manner of a kindly uncle and easily sidesteps Ms. Soren's single reference to his group's terrorist acts. Mr. Shakur presents himself as a tough guy who has learned his lesson, though he sounds a lot like a prisoner telling the parole board what it wants to hear. Meanwhile, Ms. Love, notorious for her drug use and dangerous leaps from the stage into the audience, is almost a model of mainstream decorum.

It is difficult to feel polite, knowing they were more concerned about how this looked for them, for their party, their procedures and their political prospects than in discovering what really happened.   The gender divide has opened and swallowed politeness like a great hungry whale. Why? Why? Why? they asked. Why did Anita F. Hill, now a tenured law professor at the University of Oklahoma, not bring charges against Clarence Thomas when, she contends, he sexually harassed her a decade ago?

Developed by Marcor Inc., the device can be mounted onto cars to receive signals transmitted every second by satellites in the Government's Global Positioning System. According to Willie Armstrong, Marcor's senior vice president, the new device can receive signals from as many as eight satellites at once and then relay them through the vehicle's two-way radio to a computer processor at the dispatcher's office. The computer processor then plots the vehicle's location within about 20 yards by comparing the different signals. Although other satellite positioning devices are already available, most are designed for more sophisticated users and cost $2,000 and up.  The new device, to be available in September, will cost between $700 to $1,000.

Claudio Monteverdi devoted himself to giving human passion an unambiguous musical vocabulary. In the bargain, he contributed mightily to the birth of opera and its establishment as a durable form. 'Orfeo'          His first opera, \\"Orfeo\\" (1607), may lack the sophistication and dramatic flexibility of \\"Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria\\" (1640) and \\"L'Incoronazione di Poppea\\" (1642), but it has a freshness and beauty that has kept it on the stage, and there is a distinct charm in its careful balance of tragic characterization  and formal dance music that reminds us of early opera's idealized, mannered conception of Greek antiquity.

By saying that a stereo component is musical I mean that the sound closely resembles that of musical instruments and voices. Or, putting it another way, musicality in sound equipment means that the components do not draw attention to themselves and leave the listener unaware of their role in bringing home the music.   Regrettably, musicality so defined is not as common in stereo systems - and particularly in loudspeakers - as one might hope, and some of the reasons for this surfaced in a conversation I recently had with a loudspeaker designer.

He borrows the title of his production, \\"Women in Beckett,\\" from Linda Ben-Zvi's valuable anthology of essays and interviews on that subject. To emphasize Mr. Kaufman's point, most of the eight actresses in his cast at Theater of the New City are over the age of 65. Drably costumed, they look like inhabitants of a Beckettian environment. The plays are eloquent emanations, but in each case the directorial approach studiously undermines the author's intention.   Mr. Kaufman makes characters visible when Beckett wanted to remain unseen. Mood is sacrificed, along with intensity. By increasing the size of the cast, the director takes the focus away from the central figure. In \\"Footfalls,\\" May paces her nine steps back and forth on a narrow path, while her mother, who should exist only in her daughter's memory, stands onstage and watches. As a result, one is distracted from the ritual of the pacing, so important to May's painful interior journey.

Consultants who specialize in organizing clients' lives say that gathering such information can help with everything from keeping your pets happier to stunning your loved ones with presents theu would like.

A record of boxes you keep under your beds, noting each container's contents and location (you might opt to keep this information in night stands near the beds).   2. A drawing of your fuse box that notes which switches connect to which parts of your home, so that you don't just stare at the box helplessly when your power goes awry.    3. Things you have forgotten when you have traveled in the past.    4. For pet sitters, the kind and amount of food your pet likes or should have and the number of ventures outside it prefers, along with a way to reach you while you are gone and the phone number of your veterinarian.    5. The combinations of all the locks your family uses.   6. Any possible gifts you have ever seen or heard friends or relatives lusting after, so you can thrill them at holidays and birthdays.   7. Everything you normally need when you travel (you might even want to keep some of these items in the suitcases you usually use).    8. Frivolous things you strongly desire. Note both great pleasures you want to work toward slowly, like faraway vacations, and little treats, like massages or visits to new museums, that you can use to reward yourself for accomplishments (like finishing a stack of lists).

Mr. Halim came from Indonesia in 1980 to study at the Juilliard School and made his New York debut in 1987 at Alice Tully Hall. On Tuesday he had solid basic ideas about his program, but in the first half especially, they were undercut by a persistent stiffness of articulation and roughness of polish. Compared with the steady procession of top-level international virtuosos who routinely grace New York's concert stages, Mr. Halim simply did not match up.    The program consisted of two Bach-Busoni chorale preludes","excerpt":"Liszt's \\"Sonetto 123 del Petrarca,\\" \\"Au Bord d'une Source\\" and B-minor Sonata, and the Chopin Op. 25 Etudes.
