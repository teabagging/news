J.

It is an explosive story about police corruption. It is also a drama about what happens when members of stereotyped groups step out of their preappointed slots and smash into a brick wall. J. J. (Michael Boatman) and a Jewish female rookie called Fields (Lori Petty) discover that it's not so easy to be part of the old boys' club, and that maybe they don't want to belong anyway.

Free performances are scheduled at 10:30 and 11:30 A.M. and 12:30 P.M. Tuesday through Friday, and 12:30, 1:30 and 2:30 P.M. on Saturday and Sunday.    The three-foot marionettes are manipulated by David Syrotiak Jr., his brother Peter and other members of the family troupe, to music from \\"La Boutique Fantasque,\\" a Ballet Russe work first performed in 1919. The Syriotaks work in view of the audience on a 12- by 8-foot platform, obscured by black clothing and a black background.    \\"The show is choreographed like a ballet,\\" said David Syriotak. \\"There is no dialogue.\\"     Each year, the puppeteers build about 20 marionettes for new productions, adding to their stock of 400 characters and logging 40,000 miles touring the country. The company is headquartered in the Colt building in Hartford, where artists' studios have replaced the firearms manufacturing.    In 1976, the National Marionette Theater was the first American company to receive an award for excellence from the Union de la Marionnette, a European association formed in the 1950's.     The Old State House, at 800 Main Street in downtown Hartford, also has another attraction on display through Jan. 6: a collection of antique toy trains and dolls as well as handmade contemporary dolls.
