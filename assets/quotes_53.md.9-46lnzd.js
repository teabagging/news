Although the food can be astonishingly good, recent dining experiences have proved less consistently excellent than in the past.   The long, rectangular dining room is decorated in a rather jarring interpretation of high style with padded maroon wet-look vinyl covering the walls halfway up, topped by an uncoordinated array of bright paintings, some too large for the spaces assigned them.

Run by a group of young, first-generation Italians, Sistina serves dishes with an inventive spark, a cut above the pack, even when reinterpreting some of the old standards.

Comparative area: about 1.7 times size of Washington, D.C. Land use: 3% arable land; 7% permanent crops; 90% other. Major cities: (1995) Malé (capital) 62,973.

Independence: July 26, 1965 (from U.K.). Constitution: Adopted Jan. 1998. National holiday: Independence Day, July 26. Head of Government: Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, president (since Nov. 1978). Structure: executive; unicameral legislature; judiciary. ECONOMY Monetary unit: rufiyaa. Budget: (2002 est.) income: $224 mil.; expend.: $282 mil. GDP: $1.25 bil., $3,900 per capita (2002 est.). Chief crops: coconut, corn, sweet potatoes; fishing. Natural resources: fish. Major industries: fishing, tourism, shipbuilding, some coconut processing. Labor force: about 88,000 (2000 est.); 22% fishing industry and agriculture, 18% services, 60% industry. Exports: $110 mil. (f.o.b., 2001 est.); fish, clothing. Imports: $395 mil.

The small sultanate of the Maldive Islands, with an Islamic population of Sinhalese descent, was made a British protectorate in 1887. The islands' tiny area and poor soil limited development; fishing and fish processing are the main industries, and copra (dried coconut meat for coconut oil) is the only significant crop. The Maldives became an independent nation on July 26, 1965. In 1968 the sultanate was abolished and replaced by a republic. Since independence, tourism has become economically important and now accounts for 18 percent of the GDP. Protests over the concentration of development on the island of Malé in recent years have led to political unrest in the other islands, while attempts to address the basic needs of those islands have strained the nation's tiny economic base. The current president, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, was elected to office in 1978 and subsequently reelected twice. The elections of September 1988 were marked by considerable unrest and demonstrations. An attempted coup against the Gayoom government on Nov. 4, 1988, was put down with the intervention of Indian troops. Maldives"},{"year":"1948","title":"ST.

For this graphic and grueling representation of a Norwegian \\"freedom fighter's\\" struggles to escape across the frozen land of northern Norway in 1943 is a well-nigh incredible illustration of man vs. snow, ice and cold. After looking at it for ninety minutes, one should feel our brand of winter sissy stuff.Based on the actual experience of one Jan Baalsrud, as described in David Howarth's faithful account of his adventure, \\"We Die Alone,\\" this picture derives its smashing impact from the bare simplicity of the story line, coupled with some tremendous re-enactments of Baalsrud's ordeal, photographed along the actual route he took.From the moment early in the picture when the hero escapes alone, with the Nazis shooting at him, from an unsuccessful job of sabotage, it is one terrible thing after another that he pushes himself into and goes through, sometimes with the help of others and more often entirely on his own.He drags himself, painfully wounded in the foot, through deep and clinging snow. Sheltered and fed by a kind farmer, he then swims an ice-clogged fjord. On skis, furnished by a loyal fellow, he skims through a Nazi-held town and whizzes across the country with the enemy in full-cry.Exhausted and snow-blinded, after lying for a couple of days under a rock, while a blizzard rages, he feels his way (still on skis) to the home of another young farmer, who takes over the job of getting him from there to the Swedish border, aided by a couple of daring friends.It is this final stretch of the terrible journey, over a 3,000-foot mountain pass, with the hero strapped to a litter that is dragged over snow and rocks, that the painfulness of the ordeal becomes most pressing and acute. It is hard to believe that a human, or his rescuers, could take so much, particularly an exposure of some fifteen days in the open snow. But it is honestly and convincingly demonstrated, to the damage of one's nerves, in this film.A final rush into Sweden, aboard a sled furnished by some Lapps, driving a great herd of reindeer, with the Nazis chasing, is the one stagey touch.Arne Skouen, the director, deserves the utmost praise for the realism and intensity accumulated in this film. He has made the struggle nightmarish amid the beauties of a winter wonderland, all of it photographed exquisitely in appropriate black-and-white.Jack Fjeldstad, a big, rugged fellow, acts the hero magnificently, conveying a sense of vast courage in the midst of stinging agony. Alf Malland is fine and simple as the fellow who organizes the final push, and a lithe and rangy young woman named Henny Moan is solid as his wife. Several other fellows do well in ruddy outdoor roles. Louis de Rochemont imported this picture and has fixed it up with a few English narrative flourishes reminiscent of the old March of Time. Otherwise, the spare Norwegian dialogue is well translated through English subtitles.Also on the bill at the theatre is a whimsical and amusing three-reel film, entitled \\"The Boy Who Saw Through,\\" about a lad who can see through walls. The ability is implied to be symbolic of a child's tendency toward candor and truth. It is based on a story by John Pudney and produced by Mary Ellen Bute. This little item and a travel picture of Florence. Italy, are sweet relief from the grueling feature film.

At Weill Recital Hall, Mr. Kayser stayed close to his origins, offering Grieg's \\"Holberg\\" Suite and G-minor Ballade and \\"Listen\\" by Arne Nordheim. His other music was the Beethoven \\"Tempest\\" Sonata.    Mr. Kayser's musicality and technique function at what dieticians might call a subsistence level. His technical abilities, in other words, allowed these pieces to survive Wednesday's concert in reasonable health without a great deal of nourishment to spare.      Inner detail was obscure, piano tone was thick and blunt, and sharp rhythmic edges dulled. The minor memory lapses and slips in the last two movements of the Beethoven were not troubling in themselves but seemed to signal Mr. Kayser's general limitations. Musically, most of what he does operates according to honest sentiment and good sense, although some of the rubato in the \\"Holberg\\" served more to twist Grieg's rhythmic patterns than explain them.    \\"Listen\\" is interesting for its loyalty to a single treble figure. Subtle alterations do not so much change it as offer new views of the same thing. As the rest of the keyboard comes into play, the figure is compressed into a persistent trill. Mr. Nordheim trusts his material, slight though it may be, and it rewards his confidence.

The performances will be enthusiastically greeted, as all Ashkenazy records are. This kind of limpid, intelligent, elegant playing is Mr. Ashkenazy's trademark. It represents the best of the modern style, which means that the pianist offers no more and no less than what the notes say. Many pianists these days approach the music much the same way, but hardly any of them have Mr. Ashkenazy's fluency and, especially, beauty of sound. He and Mr. Mehta adjust to each other very well, though their styles are basically dissimilar. The conductor is a big-sound man, while the pianist is more delicate in his musical approach. It may be that Mr. Mehta reduced the Vienna strings for these performances -many conductors do in the first four Beethoven concertos - but an even greater cut would have been welcome.

The anxiety was set off by the near-collapse of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company. And it fed on worries over the danger of defaults by debt-ridden developing countries, especially in Latin America, questions about the liquidity or solvency of Western financial institutions, worries about the big American budget and trade deficits and fears of a serious threat to the stability of the world financial system and the recovery.

Its audience apparently was in decline, with teen-agers and small children making up a disproportionate number of viewers, and hope of an afterlife was slim.
