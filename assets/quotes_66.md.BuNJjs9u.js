Greenblatt says it's the ragged reality of the past that is most instructive. This is from \\"Learning to Curse: Essays in Early Modern Culture\\" (Routledge).     I am fascinated by the signs of alteration, tampering, even destructiveness which many museums try simply to efface: first and most obviously, the act of displacement that is essential for the collection of virtually all older artifacts and most modern ones -- pulled out of chapels, peeled off church walls, removed from decaying houses. . . . Then too there are the marks on the artifacts themselves: the attempt to scratch out or deface the image of the devil in numerous late-medieval and Renaissance paintings, the concealing of the genitals in sculptured and painted figures, the iconoclastic smashing of human or divine representations, the evidence of cutting or reshaping to fit a new frame or purpose, the cracks or scorch marks or broken-off noses that indifferently record the grand disasters of history and the random accidents of trivial incompetence. Riding the Dragon      Charles Dickens could take something as unremarkable as a train ride and transform it, with exhilarating precision, into an exotic adventure. This is drawn from his \\"American Notes\\" of 1842, excerpted in \\"We Took the Train,\\" edited by H. Roger Grant (Northern Illinois University).     On it whirls headlong, dives through the woods again, emerges in the light, clatters over frail arches, rumbles upon the heavy ground, shoots beneath a wooden bridge which intercepts the light for a second like a wink, suddenly awakens all the slumbering echoes in the main street of a large town, and dashes on haphazard, pellmell, neck-or-nothing, down the middle of the road. There -- with mechanics working at their trades, and people leaning from their doors and windows, and boys flying kites and playing marbles, and men smoking, and women talking, and children crawling, and pigs burrowing, and unaccustomed horses plunging and rearing, close to the very rails -- there -- on, on, on -- tears the mad dragon of an engine with its train of cars","excerpt":"scattering in all directions a shower of burning sparks from its wood fire; screeching, hissing, yelling, panting; until at last the thirsty monster stops beneath a covered way to drink, the people cluster around, and you have time to breathe again. Science's High Stakes      The history of science is filled with good scientists, such as the 19th-century geologist Louis Agassiz, discredited by their stubborn attachment to failed theories. This is from \\"Ice Time: Climate, Science, and Life on Earth\\" by Thomas Levenson (Harper Perennial, paper).      When Louis Agassiz (with some assistance, certainly) \\"discovered\\" the ice age, that astounding revelation propelled him into the first rank of science's heroes. But then he lingered on. . . . If science really were the bloodless pursuit of truth, achieved by piling one discovery atop the next, then it would be immune to tragedy. But ideas have life spans of their own, and they can, when the time comes, leave the scene grudgingly, carrying with them into irrelevance all those people who cannot bear to give them up. Agassiz's ultimate fall into a peculiarly precise brand of creationism overlaid with a nasty streak of racism has the air of tragedy to me. . . . He does leave behind, though, an object lesson about the stakes for which science and scientists play. The stories scientists tell are not simply bedtime tales. They place us in the world, and they can force us to alter the way we think and what we do. Buying the Sun      John Rothchild offers a wry description of a typical new inhabitant of Florida -- and the state such migrants have created. This is from \\"Up for Grabs: A Trip Through Time and Space in the Sunshine State\\" (Penguin, paper).     He did not move to Florida to bargain with discomfort. He has already paid nature's price in years and years of anti-freeze and fiberglass, and now the payoff is the sunshine state, where the entire function of climate and weather is revised. Instead of a chastening and ennobling taskmaster to which mankind is a slave, the Florida climate is regarded as a service industry, and is expected to gratify mankind. . . . Up North, the flora and fauna are more beloved than the weather; in Florida, it is the opposite. Most Floridians have no affection for cypress bogs or mangrove trees, and in the postcard racks, the alligator is a buffoon, biting the behinds of unwary tourists. In our map of the territory, there is the glorious sun above us and the wonderful beaches in front of us, and the swamps behind us. The Art of Catastrophe      Julian Barnes adroitly reveals the manner in which art helps us to draw meaning from disastrous events. This is from \\"A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters\\" (Vintage International, paper).     How do you turn catastrophe into art? Nowadays the process is automatic. A nuclear plant explodes? We'll have a play on the London stage within a year. A President is assassinated? You can have the book or the film or the filmed book or the booked film. War? Send in the novelists. A series of gruesome murders? Listen for the tramp of the poets. We have to understand it, of course, this catastrophe; to understand it, we have to imagine it, so we need the imaginative arts. But we also need to justify and forgive it, this catastrophe, however minimally. Why did it happen, this mad act of Nature, this crazed human moment? Well, at least it produced art. Perhaps, in the end, that's what catastrophe is    for.

St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95.    In his first novel, a former member of Monty Python's Flying Circus tells the story of a sweet-tempered postal worker with a Papa obsession who is driven batty when his small-town post office is privatized. Last year our reviewer, Bruce Weber, praised the book's ''dry, deftly understated wit,'' ''hearty, well-formed sentences'' and ''clever, on-the-money dialogue.''    Pack of Two: The Intricate Bond Between People and Dogs  By Caroline Knapp. Delta, $12.95.    This affectionate account of the author's two-year relationship with Lucille, a 45-pound shepherd mix she rescued from an animal shelter, is both an unabashed love letter and a commentary on the power of dogs to open the human heart. It's also full of canine lore, childhood memories and testimonials from many other dog owners. ''Knapp's dogs come bounding to life on the page,'' Susan Cheever wrote in the Book Review in 1998. ''They bark and paw at the covers. They watch us with bemusement and acceptance. . . . She's written a funny, instructive and completely enjoyable book.''    Roxanna Slade  By Reynolds Price. Scribner, $13.    The narrator of this graceful, old-fashioned novel is a strong-willed Southerner in her 90's who looks back on her life's gains and losses, as well as those of our century. Last year our reviewer, Janet Burroway, called the author ''a chronicler of decency, pluck and joy'' who has ''given us the weight and worth of the ordinary.''    Saratoga: Turning Point of America's Revolutionary War  By Richard M. Ketchum. John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $15.95.    Drawing on a wide range of sources, including the diaries of officers and soldiers, the author explains why the colorful British general John Burgoyne failed in his 1777 invasion of the Colonies from Canada, and why his surrender was so critical to the war's outcome. ''The strength of 'Saratoga' lies in his vivid descriptions of the rugged landscape and in his many arresting portraits of participants,'' Pauline Maier wrote here in 1997. The same publisher has reissued Decisive Day: The Battle for Bunker Hill ($12.95), in which Ketchum reconstructs the 1775 campaign to control the Charlestown peninsula, a bloody affair marked by confusion and wrongheadedness in both the British and American camps. ''It was a furious action and a chilling spectacle,'' which Ketchum describes ''in handsome style,'' Bruce Bliven Jr. wrote in these pages in 1962.    A Blessing on the Moon  By Joseph Skibell. Berkley, $12.    In this first novel, the spirit of a Jewish man killed in wartime Poland ascends from a mass grave to roam the countryside, guided by his murdered rabbi, who has turned into a crow. His journey ''illuminates the horror of history through the energy and wisdom of fantasy and myth","excerpt":"scene after scene is rich with emotion, humor and invention,'' Patrick Giles wrote here in 1997.    Caging the Genies: A Workable Solution for Nuclear,  Chemical, and Biological Weapons  By Stansfield Turner. Westview, $14.    A former Director of Central Intelligence offers a detailed plan for reducing the global stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. His slender book, which has been updated, ''is more than an arms-control proposal,'' one critic wrote in 1997. ''It is a readable primer on nuclear weapons and strategy.''    The Great Hill Stations of Asia  By Barbara Crossette. Basic Books, $15.    The United Nations bureau chief for The New York Times tours the mountaintop villages of southern Asia that were built by American and European colonialists seeking refuge from the scorching malarial summers. ''The region's history, politics, religion and economics are brilliantly summarized,'' Alexander Frater said here last year. ''Yet she also maintains a lively social curiosity.'' The Idea of India, by Sunil Khilnani (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $13), is a scholarly analysis focusing on the growth of the modern Indian state and the evolution of one of the world's most intensely political societies. ''Khilnani writes with illuminating dexterity, wit and compassion,'' Judith M. Brown wrote here in 1998.    The Ebony Tower  By John Fowles. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.    This collection of four stories and a translation of a medieval French fable is steeped in the author's continuing fascination with the power of art to redefine the terms of human freedom. ''If you haven't been reading Fowles,'' you'll find these tales ''magical enough,'' Theodore Solotaroff wrote here in 1974. ''If you have . . . you'll have the pleasure of making connections.''    The Notebooks of Don Rigoberto  By Mario Vargas Llosa. Penguin, $12.95.    This wickedly promiscuous novel is about the sexual escapades of a wealthy Peruvian couple and their son -- or is it the fantasy of a bored insurance executive? ''Vargas Llosa's complex, gorgeous prose . . . sweeps the reader into a rich confusion of art and fact, fiction and reality,'' Walter Kendrick wrote here last year.

Small boys and dude ranchers should love it","excerpt":"scenery worshipers should find it colorful.For Elmo Williams, who produced and directed it for Lippert Pictures, Inc., has crowded it with scenes of cowboys working on Western ranges—and on Eastman color stock. There is more than a gratifying abundance of shots of cowpokes rounding up the herds, cutting out calves, breaking mustangs, branding the critters, rolling along on cattle drives and generally doing all the quaint things that cowboys are supposed to do.Indeed, there is so much of everything—so much, over and over again—that, unless one is crazy for cowboys, it is likely to seem much too much. There is also a bit of an excess of cowboy drawling by various narrators, including Tex Ritter, Bill Conrad, John Dehner and Larry Dobkin.The general intention of the picture is to show how the cowboy's life has changed from one of lonely trail-riding over the great, unlimited range to one of cattle-tending on mile-square, wire-fenced plots, while the cowboy himself has changed little in his behavior and temperament. And this is conveyed with much expression of affection for the cowboys and the cows. As one of the narrators puts it, \\"Cowboyin' ain't an easy way of life but it's a mighty satisfyin' one.\\"This may be open to some question by that element of the audience which is not, as we say, in the juvenile age range or devoted to the joys of the dude ranch. There are many things done by the cowboys pictured in this film that do not look entirely \\"satisfyin'\\" to one whose roughest riding is done in a station wagon.But that is a matter of preference. The picture is handsomely photographed and the action is genuine and lively. It's like listening to the hot-air artists and singing campfire songs.Also on the bill at the Baronet is a forty-minute Canadian National Film Board job, entitled. \\"The Stratford Adventure,\\" which tells in re-enacted scenes how a Shakespearean Drama Festival was conceived and brought to being at Stratford, Ont.The performances by the local zealots show an awareness of the cameras being there, and the hot enthusiasm in the commentary rather knocks the casual customer off his chair. Best are the scenes of the performance of \\"All's Well That Ends Well\\" and \\"Richard III,'\\" the latter played by Alec Guinness, at last year's festival.

Just this month, the National Ballet of Canada has presented a version in Toronto by Peter Schaufuss, the first full-length production of this 1842 ballet by a North American company.   Sensing correctly that the traditional Bournonville coziness will not carry onto large-scale North American stages, Mr. Schaufuss has conceived his production in bolder strokes. His concern has been always to fill the stage and to make the mime visible - and he has done so by having the crowds react visibly to a mime soloist so that the soloist's gestures are reflected in the reactions.   The plot remains generally the same. Gennaro, the Neapolitan fisherman, loves Teresina. In their jealousy, two peddler rivals slander Gennaro by saying he is in league with the devil, a claim given credence when he returns from a boat trip where Teresina appears to have drowned. Venturing into the Blue Grotto, he brings her back to life with the aid of a religious medal and the couple is betrothed at a festival.

Greenberg, left, who was forced out as chairman and chief executive of A.I.G. last March after the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, began an investigation into accounting practices at the insurer. American International, which is based in New York, said that it ''terminated the agency relationship'' with Starr Tech. There was no immediate comment from Starr Tech. (AP)    Merrill Agrees to Settle Internet Research Suits  Merrill Lynch & Company will pay $164 million to settle 23 class-action lawsuits related to its analysts' activities and research coverage of Internet companies during the dot-com era, the company said yesterday in a regulatory filing. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company, which is based in New York, said terms and conditions were subject to further negotiations and required court approval. The settlements leave only two class-action suits remaining against Merrill Lynch, and the company said it planned to defend itself against those suits. Merrill Lynch will amend its fourth-quarter results to include a $170 million charge for the cost of the settlements, which will reduce fourth-quarter earnings by 10 cents a share and full-year 2005 earnings by 11 cents a share. (AP)    Campbell Soup Posts 8% Increase in Profit  Campbell Soup, the world's biggest soup maker, reported that second-quarter earnings were up 8 percent over the period a year earlier because of stronger sales and lower taxes. For the second consecutive year, Campbell announced price increases. This year, soup, sauce and beverage prices will be up by an average of 2.3 percent, the company said. Earnings increased to $254 million, or 61 cents a share, for the quarter ended Jan. 29, up from $235 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 3 percent, to $2.28 billion, from $2.22 billion. (AP)    Gillette and Schick Settle Most of Their Razor Dispute  Gillette and Schick Wilkinson-Sword have settled most of a trade dispute over their competing razors, the companies said yesterday. The companies have been waging a legal battle since Schick introduced its Quattro four-blade razor in August 2003, with one more blade than Gillette's three-bladed Mach3 razor. Gillette filed a suit in Boston, claiming any razor with three or more blades violated its patent. Schick later filed a suit in Connecticut challenging Gillette's advertising claims. Details of the agreement reached last week were not disclosed. Gillette was acquired last year by Procter & Gamble of Cincinnati","excerpt":"Schick is a unit of Energizer Holdings of St. Louis. (AP)    PG&E's Profit Falls but Tops Analysts' Forecast  PG&E, owner of California's largest utility, said fourth-quarter profit fell 79 percent from a year ago, when the company had a gain related to a bankrupt unit. Net income fell to $180 million, or 49 cents a share, from $871 million, or $2.04 a share, a year earlier, the company said. Revenue climbed to $3.73 billion, from $2.99 billion. Excluding one-time items, profit rose to 49 cents a share, from 44 cents a year ago and topped the 43 cents expected by analysts. PG&E, based in San Francisco, owns Pacific Gas & Electric. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)    Modest Rise in Wholesale Prices Last Month  Prices at the wholesale level rose moderately in January as a big drop in gasoline costs helped to offset price increases in other areas, a government report said yesterday. The Labor Department reported that wholesale inflation rose by 0.3 percent in January, just half of the 0.6 percent surge in December, reflecting a calming of energy prices. But core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, rose by 0.4 percent in January, the biggest one-month rise in a year. The 0.4 percent rise in core prices was the biggest increase since a 0.6 percent increase last January and followed 0.1 percent increases in November and December. (AP)    French Media Group Expands in Pay TV  The French defense and media conglomerate Lagardère said it reached a deal to acquire a 20 percent stake in Vivendi Universal's pay-TV arm, Canal Plus, with an option to increase its holding to 34 percent in three years. Lagardère will use its share of CanalSatellite, its joint venture with Canal Plus, and make a cash payment of 525 million euros ($624 million) to buy the 20 percent stake in a newly created company, Canal Plus France.
