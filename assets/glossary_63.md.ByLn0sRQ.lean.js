Director was dropped.  6  CLINTON ISSUES ETHICS GUIDELINES    For six months after the inauguration, members of the President-elect's transition team will be barred from lobbying Federal agencies with which they have dealt. In addition, they must have no involvement in transition decisions that could affect their financial interests.  1  The ethics rules drew praise, and then some criticism.  8  Clinton and the military remain at odds on gay rights.  9  THE REMAKING OF THE CLINTONS    A confidential Democratic campaign memo written in April launched one of the most ambitious efforts at political rehabilitation ever undertaken: casting Bill and Hillary Clinton, whom many voters did not care for, as an honest, plain-folks idealist and his warm and loving wife.  1  PRISON OF TERRORS    In one of the most severe cases of sexual abuse in the history of women's prisons in America, 14 former employees of a Georgia corrections center were indicted on rape and other charges.

Albright told the ethnic Albanian delegation to the Kosovo peace talks that unless the Albanians commit to a deal, NATO will not bomb the Serbs. The ethnic Albanians have long argued that air strikes were the best way to end the repression by the Serbs in Kosovo and to force them to a peace deal.   A1    New Mood in India and Pakistan  The Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan pledged to take immediate steps to reduce the risk of nuclear war and seek solutions to a half century of raging disputes, including their most volatile discord, the conflict in Kashmir.   A1    South Africa Faces Next Vote  As South Africa approaches its second post-apartheid election in May, the feeling of triumph that dominated the elections in 1994 is all but history. These days, South Africans are acutely aware of the hard realities they face in remaking a society that systematically kept a majority of the population uneducated and poor.   A1    Study Critical of Arms Effort  A study by the Government's auditors is highly critical of of a key part of the Clinton Administration's effort to stop the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons by helping to employ scientists from the former Soviet Union. The study concludes that the Administration's efforts may have instead supported scientists still working in Russia on projects related to weapons of mass destruction.   A8    The United States has urged Russia to set up a joint missile-warning center before the end of the year to reduce the risk that the Year 2000 computer problem might touch off a false nuclear alert.   A8    South Korea to Free Prisoners  South Korea said today that it would release the last long-term political prisoners held in its jails to commemorate the first anniversary of the inauguration of President Kim Dae Jung, himself a former political prisoner.   A11    Policy on Kurds Could Change  Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that Turkey could consider changing its policies toward the Kurdish minority if the Kurdish guerrilla movement were to lay down its arms. Kurdish leaders have for years been asking the authorities to grant Kurds broader cultural and political rights.   A11    NATIONAL   A12-15    Agency Battling Job Bias Cuts Its Backlog in Half  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an agency that has long been considered one of the most troubled and ineffective in the Federal Government, has undergone a striking change. The agency has more than halved its backlog of pending cases in the last four years, Congress has increased its 1999 budget by $37 million, and even some critics among civil rights groups and plaintiffs' lawyers are again recommending that people who believed they were victims of bias on the job file complaints with the agency.   A1    Everglades Plan Criticized  An ambitious $8 billion plan to restore the Florida Everglades to ecological health is coming under fire from experts who say that as it is now conceived the proposal will actually do little in the way of restoration. Critics say the Federal-state plan does not go far enough in re-establishing the natural flow of shallow water that once moved down the South Florida peninsula, creating habitat for one of the largest assemblages of marsh wildlife in the world.   A1    Governors Call for Cooperation  Governors of both parties meeting in Washington told President Clinton and Congress to abandon the poisonous partisanship of the impeachment proceedings and get back to work on education and other issues of immediate concern to voters. Republican governors were just as forceful as Democrats in deploring Congress's single-minded focus on the impeachment issue.   A1    Choosing Gingrich's Successor  Voters in Georgia's Sixth Congressional District will choose an heir to former Speaker Newt Gingrich on Tuesday, and the only suspense seems to be whether Mr. Gingrich's hand-picked successor, Johnny Isakson, a prominent businessman, will win without a runoff in a nonpartisan race against five opponents.   A12    Independence for the District  The District of Columbia is a step closer to returning to self-government, as Congress displays a greater degree of confidence in Mayor Anthony A. Williams than it ever showed for his predecessor, Marion S. Barry Jr.   A13    Support for Anti-Gun Lawsuits  The N.A.A.C.P., concerned about the impact of gun-related crimes on black Americans, is considering joining cities in lawsuits against gun makers, the association's president, Kweisi Mfume, said.   A14    All Roads Lead to Denver  Denver is at the geographic center of Indian America, the nation's fastest-growing racial group, and its accessibility and neutrality in tribal affairs have helped to make it the informal capital of Indian Country. With the nation's largest concentration of national Indian groups, Denver is host to many gatherings, including an art festival.   A12    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-7    Giuliani Uses TV Interviews To Criticize Mrs. Clinton  Mayor Giuliani, sounding very much like a candidate for the Senate in 2000, used interviews on local and national television news programs to criticize Hillary Rodham Clinton and to tout his own potential as New York's next junior Senator. Mr. Giuliani said he would relish running as an underdog against the First Lady and said he would be more likely to declare his candidacy if she declares hers first.   B1    Officer Won't Testify  The lawyer for one of the four New York City police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo said that it would be pointless for his client to testify before a Bronx grand jury because he had ''no doubt'' that the officers would be indicted on criminal charges.   B3    Protecting the Water Source  Two of Mayor Giuliani's top advisers on environmental and security issues have recommended that he significantly increase the budget and staffing for the tiny independent police force that guards New York City's upstate reservoirs against pollution and sabotage.

But what now looms as among the largest European corporate takeovers ever took final shape on a weekend ricochet between board rooms and lawyers' offices.

owner's application for reduction in assessor's valuation asserted that bldg was 'still in the course of construction' and that while small part of space was rented, it was 'not occupied'; check showed that bldg had at least 2 major tenants occupying 5 1/2 floors and paying well over $50,000 a mo rent at time; reduction represented tax loss to city of $268,650; real estate atty who prepared application, A M Lindenbaum of Lindenbaum & Young, says no income and expense data was supplied because bldg was incomplete; Levy declines to state reasons for having granted reduction; property tax records also show that in other cases financial data considered irrelevant and misleading by NYS Comm of Investigation were submitted by property owners in support of applications for reduced assessments that resulted in $2.2-million in lowered valuations; these were items such as mortgage amortization, interest, depreciation and ground rent, which state panel says should not be considered expenses because property is considered to be free and clear of all debts and encumbrances; in case of bldg at 475 Park Ave South, which won $500,000 reduction in valuation to $9-million from Levy in '72, financial statement by partner Sherman Cohen listed under expenses $891,889 for interest, $350,000 for depreciation and $75,833 for rent; listing those expenses put property into red by nearly $2-million; Lindenbaum, who also prepared application for Cohen, says that it is tax comr's job to disregard items that are improper; similarly, statement for bldg at 127 John St, which won reduction from Levy in '72 of $1.4-million to $12.6-million, listed $312,499 figure for rent that put property into red by $154,536;
