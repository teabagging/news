But perhaps the most striking aspect of Japan's behavior is the growing perception that the Japanese see little at stake for themselves in the war's outcome, despite their dependence on Middle East oil.   On the surface, as usual, the arguments in Japan revolve around the constraints arising from Tokyo's postwar pacifist tradition and its constitutional renunciation of the use of force.

Today, a growing number of American educators believe that the world is too small, too competititve and too dangerous to tolerate the sort of ignorant chauvinism that so provoked James. The cure, they say, is not small, easy or cheap: American higher education needs to go global.    That does not mean lightheartedly dispatching students to sample cultural bonbons in exotic lands. To serious-minded American educators, globalization means such things as the presence of large numbers of foreign students and professors on campuses in the United States, so that this fall at New York University's Washington Square campus, for example, more than 30 different languages are being spoken.    It means tens, ultimately hundrends of thousands of American students resident in foreign countries, mastering the local language and culture and -- as with present-day University of California students -- taking a full load of rigorous, faculty-screened courses taught in the native tongue at one of 100 institutions in 32 different countries.    It means internationalizing the curriculum, as in a course in accounting at the University of Michigan School of Business that now includes the study of Japanese regulations permitting the depreciation of assets at many times the rate allowed in the United States.    It means using the latest technology so that sudents at Ramapo College, a small, publicly supported institution in Mahwah, N.J., join in discussions with other students, scholars, artists and officials around the world in 120 teleconferences every year.    \\"International education is not a new idea, but the times have now conjoined to make it dominant,\\" said L. Jay Oliva, the president of New York University, who has taken a leading role in the movement.    \\"What's happening here,\\" he continued, \\"is comparable to what happened in the 19th century when Johns Hopkins University adopted the philosophy of the great German research universities and set the pattern for Harvard, Yale and the others.\\"    The number of American student studying abroad has grown steadily over the last five years and is now at a record high of 72,000, according to the Institute of International Education, the nation's leading educational exchange organization. This figure is small in comparison with the number of foreign students studying in the United States (438,000, or six times as many), but -- significantly -- the profile of these itinerant American students has changed.    \\"Typically, they used to be affluent women in their junior year at one of the elite Seven Sisters colleges and they would be studying architecture and French language in Paris,\\" said Richard M. Krasno, president of the institute. \\"But today more of them tend to be male, they are less likely to be affluent, they may be interested in business or industry and there's a slight shift away from Europe as their destination.\\"    One conspicuous sign of the growth of international studies is the number of study-abroad programs now being offered. Ranging from a business and economics course at the university of Hungary in Pecs to another concentrating on language and culture at the leading university in Hanoi, Vietnam, these programs have virtually doubled over the last decade, from 1,857 to 3,701.    Students are eagerly responding. At an elite institution like Harvard University, 51 percent of the undergraduates participate in at least one work or study program abroad. At Kalamazoo College, a small, selective liberal arts school in Kalamazoo, Mich., 85 percent of the students study overseas thanks to a private gift of more than $5 million that subsidizes travel and on-site living expenses.    A few American colleges and universities have not been satisfied with merely offering study-abroad programs but have adopted globalism as a fundamental objective for the entire institution. Speaking for N.Y.U., Mr. Oliva recently declared: \\"We plan to enter the next century as the quintessential global university. We will extend to every undergraduate the opportunity to study abroad as part of his or her N.Y.U. education, and we will become a center for global faculty inquiry and a center for worldwide conferences of university leaders.\\"    Robert A. Scott, president of Ramapo College in New Jersey, said his institution aspired to be \\"a global college\\" for more practical reasons. \\"We believe,\\" he said, \\"that our graduates likely will either supervise or be supervised by someone of another race, ethnicity or nationality, and that their careers and lives as citizens will be affected by international and intercultural life.\\"    Several American colleges and universities have established campuses in foreign countries so that students may spend extended periods abroad and earn credits readily accepted by employers and graduate schools in the United States. Webster University in St. Louis operates wholly owned branches in Geneva, London, Vienna and the Dutch city of Leiden.    Emerson College, a small liberal arts school in Boston, has established a branch in Maastricht, the Netherlands, where students study subjects such as global marketing, communications and advertising.    Some of these branches fare better than others","excerpt":"Japan, for example, has proved especially tricky for American institutions to penetrate. Of the more than 20 American branches established in Japan in recent years, at least 9 have failed, most recently a Texas A & M branch in Koriyama. All are said to have been victims of the economic recession in Japan and the unexpected difficulty of recruiting Japanese students.    But if it has not always been easy to attract foreign students to American compuses overseas, foreign students have for years flocked to attend colleges and universities in the United States. In fact, according to the Department of Commerce, the 438,000 foreign students currently resident in the United States, while only a small fraction of the total enrollment of 14.5 million, have fed a major and all-but-hidden export industry bringing some $6 billion annual to the American economy.    The cohort of foreign students has kept growing steadily at the rate of about 4.5 percent a year for the past two decades. Quite often, these students become leaders in their societies at home. Chang-Lin Tien, chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley, said he recently attended a state reception in Seoul, South Korea, at which no fewer than seven Cabinet ministers introduced themselves to him as Berkeley graduates.    \\"That's typical,\\" Chancellor Tien remarked. \\"I get the same greetings in Indonesia and Singapore.\\"    The reasons for all of this activity are many. The first and most important is the rise of the global economy. Alert, job-oriented students have come to realize that as the world shrinks, many of the best jobs are going to go to college graduates who possess international skills. For example, after graduating from Wellesley College in 1987, Cynthia Jeffers taught English for two years in Japan under a program run by the Ministry of Education. She then returned to the United States, entered the Harvard Business School and upon her graduation last June landed a job as an associate in the corporate finance department of Goldman, Sachs & Company, one of the major brokerage firms on Wall Street. Her experience in Japan, she said, greatly increased her prospects in the job market.   Another stimulus for globalization is that most financial aid for students has recently become \\"portable,\\" as college officials like to say. In the past, vaguely worded Federal statutes authorizing financial aid for college students -- Pell grants, Stafford loans and the like -- made many student advisers hesitant to recommend the use of these grants overseas.   Stephen Cooper, the director of academic programs abroad at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, said that he and a group of associates successfully lobbied Congress to make every form of Federal aid for students applicable for study overseas. The new explicit language appears in the Higher Education Act of 1992.   \\"Judging from the number of inquiries I've received from around the country, this is having a big impact,\\" said Professor Cooper.   Still another spur is the development and prevalence of new communications technology that allows educators to leap oceans and cross borders with impunity. B. Joseph White, dean of the University of Michigan Business School and a pioneer in the field educators now call \\"distance learning,\\" has taken the new technology a step further. Last year Dean White set up a program sponsored by Cathay Pacific, the national airline of Hong Kong, that employs interactive television to link M.B.A. candidates in Hong Kong with professors at Ann Arbor.   \\"It's actually a complex teaching system because we don't believe we can provide the quality we want with interactive TV alone,\\" said Dean White. \\"Consequently, we send our faculty to Hong Kong and bring their students here for face-to-face meetings.\\"   \\"It's the future,\\" he continued. \\"Our pilot project for Cathay Pacific carries with it a vast productivity potential.\\"   Another reason for the growth of interest in globalization is that travel abroad, like hit shows on Broadway, has good word of mouth. \\"It's a cliche, but over and over you hear students saying 'It changed my life!' \\" said Dr. Krasno.   It is a point confirmed by Corbin Smith, the director of Stanford University's Overseas Study Office. \\"When we surveyed the senior class here over the last few years,\\" Mr. Smith said, \\"asking what was the most meaningful experience during their undergraduate years, more than 87 percent of those who participated in a Stanford study-abroad program gave that the highest rating.\\"   Not everyone is so enthusiastic. Roger Kimball, the neoconservative author of \\"Tenured Radicals,\\" which takes a skeptical look at academia, observes that colleges are \\"making out like bandits\\" by collecting full tuition from students and \\"placing them at a fraction of that cost at overseas institutions.\\"   It is true that the ranks of foreign students in the United States have been swollen not only by the quality of colleges here but also by sharp-eyed admissions officials who have successfully recruited well-heeled foreign students when they were unable to fill their campuses with enough American students able to pay the ever-rising tuition costs.   In fact, unregulated overseas recruitment proved so easy -- and profitable -- that a few years ago unscrupulous hucksters began to recruit foreign students for small community colleges in the United States with misleading promises that after a year or two the student could transfer into Harvard or M.I.T. Today, some professional organizations have adopted generally effective guidelines and codes of ethics to substantially reduce such misrepresentations.   And some critics, like Mr. Kimball, say there is a great   Continued on Page 31  Continued from Page 26  deal of wishful thinking in the notion that \\"a semester abroad is going to make one into an internationalist.\\"   Holly M. Carter, dean of the office of educational opportunity programs at Northeastern University, argues that the belief that today's college students are more culturally aware than their predecessors is a comforting myth that ignores \\"the increase in hate crimes, blatant bigotry and racism on the campuses.\\"   But educational leaders like Mr. Oliva of N.Y.U. argue that a global perspective is vital to the international community. \\"There are at least three factors driving the globalization of education today,\\" he said. \\"The first is purely serendipitous: We're on the cusp of a new wave of immigration.\\" (About a million immigrants have come to New York over the past decade, many of whom have attended N.Y.U.)   \\"Second,\\" he continued, \\"people realize that the more different environments you move into, the more you learn. Conversely, the more you study with people just like yourself, the less you learn.    \\"I realize in my own life that I never learned more than when I was overseas for a year and a half. Everything became very vivid. There was no moment when I could let my mind relax. And gradually, I discovered that I could master change.\\"   \\"And third,\\" Mr. Oliva said, \\"the demise of the Soviet Union has made Americans more international than ever. It made us realize that the Soviet Union had been a major force in policing ethnic rivalries. The world got capped under big cloaks. We used to think of the division between Northern and Southern Ireland, and what's happening in Yemen, as anomalies. Now we see them as the rule.    \\"In the future,\\" he continued, \\"we probably face 30 to 40 years of instability and border wars like the 19th century, but with one frightening difference -- small nations possessing immensely destructive weapons.

Although the prime rate in the United States has declined to 15 percent, American interest rates are still approximately double those in Japan. This country's higher rates, in combination with higher United States inflation, have overvalued the dollar and undervalued the yen, making Japanese exports abnormally competitive and American exports abnormally uncompetitive.

The villain of this complicated tale is Kuheiji, an oil merchant and supposed friend of Tokubei who swindles him and then destroys his reputation with false charges of forgery and extortion. His betrayal drives the lovers to suicide.

At least, it has feats less Impressive than \\"Rashomon\\" or \\"Gate of Hell.\\" This fact was revealed by \\"The Impostor,\\" a Japanese film that opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse. For all its exotic exterior it is merely a melodrama of political intrigue in old Japan.That exterior, it must be said, is fascinating—and for anyone who hasn't seen a Japanese film, it should afford abundant stimulation simply in its presentation of manners and costumes. The characters in this Japanese fable, which is classified as a \\"chambara\\" or sword-play film, behave according to the patterns of Japanese ritual. The men are superior beings. The women are subservient to them. And the architecture and customs have a strangeness that should be interesting to American eyes.But essentially they tell a heavy story of the way in which a captain of the shogun's imperial guard circumvents a bold endeavor by an impostor to set himself up as the shogun's heir and instead arranges that the rightful successor be put in line to inherit the shogunate. The difficulty involves some technicalities about the progeny of the shogun's concubines—an elaborate business we need not go into—and also some rather wearying clichés.It is evident from \\"The Impostor\\" that the Japanese have been seeing Hollywood films. The Kabuki, which is a style of Japanese theatre, did not inspire some of the plotting put forth here. The artful spy set in the house of the impostor, the noble lady who vainly pines for the hero's love, the vengeful trick of kidnapping the hero's sister—these could be borrowed from American gangster films.Likewise, the melodramatic business of having the impostor eventually exposed through the performance of a play that closely sketches his own criminal intrigues bears a striking resemblance to a detail in a famous Shakespearean play. And the self-denial of a lady's love by the hero at the fadeout is reminiscent of the standard procedure of William S. Hart.In playing this fustian business, the actors-also give forth in a style that calls up recollections of performers in old silent films. Utaemon Ichikawa as the hero is elaborately vainglorious, and Keiko Kishi as his sister—the one who is kidnapped—is the Standard damsel in distress. Other nice-looking performers, whose names, to an American ear, are just so much Japanese, behave themselves so as to create more pictorial than characterful sense.However, as is usual in such dramas, the visual elements are consistently refined. Even in black-and-white, there is a prettiness and dignity to it that make this picture something to see.

It is a beautiful color picture, superbly composed and photographed, which conveys a romantic modern drama that fairly drips with sentiment.It would seem, from this palpable \\"tear-jerker,\\" that its makers had been inspired by the example of Hollywood's more lachrymal dramas of the \\"Souls in Bondage\\" school if it were not that its derivation is specifically and proudly proclaimed. It is from a Japanese novel by Ozaki Koyo that has been popular since the century's turn and has evidently given the Japanese people countless happy and tearful hours.Briefly, it tells the story of a modern Japanese girl—modern, that is, by comparison with classical cultures of the past—who abandons a poor student sweetheart to marry a son of the nouveau riche and thereby open herself to torment of the most soulful and agonizing sort. Her husband treats her cruelly, flaunting his mistresses and generally humiliating her in front of her family and friends.But, most painful, the sweetheart waxes bitter and takes to a vile career of money-lending, wherein he brutally squeezes the heart's blood out of the poor. However, a fire that destroys the money-lender's home and an attempted suicide by the young lady that very nearly succeeds finally brings them together for a deliciously soggy end.In the sequence of Japanese culture, this tale is reputed to have had a profound and significant meaning for the new middle-class society. It was a solemn representation of the consequence of letting money be the ideal of personal achievement. That is the \\"golden demon\\" of the tale.The theme has its social validity, but in putting it on the screen, Koji Shima, who wrote the screen play and directed, has expressed it in emotionally stilted terms. The separation of the sweethearts is, for instance, a florid and fulsome affair in which the man makes great gestures of denunciation and the girl clutches desperately at his knees. Or the ultimate reunion of the lovers—that is a studiously prolonged affair of the man sadly clutching the sodden body of the girl, who appears to be dead until her eyelids flutter and then open for the fade.In short, the sentimental story is artificially contrived through a series of dramatic situations that are conventional and overplayed. Fujiko Yamamoto is a beautiful and delicate girl in the leading role, with a voice like a reedy musical instrument, but her behavior is oddly stylized, and Jun Negami is ponderous and pompous as the embittered sweetheart. The same is true of Eiji Funakoshi as the rich man the poor girl weds, and Kenji Sugawara is highly bravura as a friend. The most effective performance is that of Mitsuko Mito as an older woman, a money-lender, who tries to win the sweetheart's love.But, like most Japanese pictures, this one is beautifully made by the standards of pictorial composition and color photography. The designs of costumes and scenery have an exquisiteness and harmony that proceed from one shot to another with extraordinary grace and ease. If for no other reason, this interesting picture should be seen simply to give stimulation and satisfaction to the eye.

Kitano Arms Inc., the owner, has bought two adjacent town houses on Park Avenue (Nos. 60 and 62) and another at 40 East 38th Street. The three parcels form an L shape around the 16-story hotel, which was built in 1926. Kitano plans to strip the existing hotel to its steel frame and join it to a new 16-story structure that would replace the Park Avenue houses. The front 15 feet of the 38th Street house would be preserved for use by the hotel's restaurant, with guest rooms upstairs.   Altogether, the number of rooms in the hotel would go from 97 to 163 and floor space would increase to 100,000 square feet from the current 51,000. The architects are Feldman Misthopoulos Associates of Brooklyn.   The hotel would have to close down for a year or two while the project was under way. Because the neighborhood is zoned residentially, Kitano must obtain a variance from the city's Board of Standards and Appeals. A lawyer for the hotel, Raymond H. Levin of Brown & Wood, said the project has been redesigned to meet objections from neighbors, who sought a structure that was more residential in scale and appearance.

But they have kept their account fairly uncluttered and free of the corrupt jockey, gangsters and fixed race clichés. Their yarn, which is more pastoral than melodramatic in quality, deals with Jiro, a completely captivating tad who witnesses the foaling of the colt on his father's small ranch in northern Hokkaido, names him Takeru, adoringly watches him grow, bitterly opposes his being sold to a large stable and then rejoices when he wins the big stakes in Tokyo.Romance is fleetingly glimpsed as his sister and a young veterinary fondly eye each other. Standard procedure is followed as the youngster's older brother, an apprentice jockey, is brought in at the climax to ride Takeru, and a note of sadness is injected as the sleek chestnut dies after his thrilling victory.The plot, as has been indicated, is not particularly unusual. However, the photography of Michio Takahashi and the color work are nearly as Impressive as those evident in such superb Nipponese imports as \\"Gate of Hell.\\"Winter scenes shot on location in Hokkaido's highlands as well as soft seascapes bordering the ranch are vivid and authentically picturesque vignettes of a Japan rarely seen here. And sequences made at Tokyo's racetrack during the actual running of a Tokyo Derby are thunderingly effective.The producers have turned up a thoroughly convincing performer in Yukohiko Iwatare as the endearing youngster whose life revolves around Takeru. He is as natural as Tom Sawyer as he gaily wins the colt's friendship, helps wean and train him and heart-breakingly sobs his grief at his passing. And most of the unbilled farm kids who are his pals genuinely look and act their roles.Ayako Wakao and Yoshiro Kitahara make a handsome couple, as his understanding sister and her boy friend, and Akihiko Yusa and Bontaro Miyake are competent as his brother and father. The characterizations of the grownups, however, are not stressed. That is as it should be. The children, Takeru and their lovely environment are favored. This is an odds-on entry and well worth a wager.

Almost like a frieze in its arrangement of figures roughly in a line across the foreground, \\"The Taiko Hideyoshi and His Five Wives,\\" of 1804, is a formal and sedate image, remarkable on first glance mostly for the subtle interplay of the patterned robes in which the artist, Utamaro, clothes his characters.   For this work, and for a trio of prints on related themes, Utamaro spent 3 days in jail and 50 more in handcuffs under house arrest. One of the supreme practitioners of the ukiyo-e woodblock print, Utamaro never recovered from the punishment and died a year later at the age of 53.
