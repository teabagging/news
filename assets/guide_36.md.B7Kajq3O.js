There is more activity these days on the I.R.A. front than ever before, because 1982 was the first year that such tax-deferred plans became available to all wage earners. They can contribute up to $2,000 annually - $2,250 for employees with nonworking spouses - and deduct that amount on their tax returns.

Like Escoffier's basic béchamel sauce, this could be used in perfume classrooms as a model, a sort of scented phylogenetic common amber ancestor.

The capacity audience - which included the author's nephew Edward Beckett and American friends - shared the celebratory mood. To emphasize the words, excerpts from plays and prose were shorn of all environmental and design elements, except for those glimpses of past performances on film.   This meant that Hamm in \\"Endgame\\" was neither blind nor confined to a wheelchair, that Barry McGovern's Molloy wore no greatcoat and that Billie Whitelaw performed \\"Rockaby\\" without the benefit of a rocking chair. With Mr. McGovern and Miss Whitelaw, nothing more was needed. The author's eloquent lines spoke for themselves.   There were other moments that were fraught with acting at the expense of language and the alternation of film and live performance did not flow smoothly. It would be more rewarding to have three or four of Beckett's finest interpreters gather onstage in a joint reading, as has been done for writers like Shakespeare and Shaw.   The principle is an intriguing one. It is not every playwright or novelist who can transcend a loss of context or who can communicate onstage without theatrical accouterments. From the evidence here and in other related events, Beckett falls in that category.   Last season, after Beckett's death, the Irish Repertory Theater presented an evening of Beckett extracts at the Public Theater. The company's boldest stroke was a live theatrical performance of the radio play \\"All That Fall,\\" presented with sound effects as if the audience might be watching it in a broadcasting studio. This summer in London, in a tribute to Beckett's \\"Words and Music\\" at the Almeida Theater, Irene Worth gave a luminous reading of the television play \\"Eh Joe\\" to a throbbing background score by Earl Kim, the two halves of the performance combining into a symbiotic whole. Miss Worth seemed to be singing Beckett.   As Gregory Mosher correctly observed in his introductory remarks at Lincoln Center, Monday's tribute was only one of countless possible anthologies of Beckett's words. There was no pretense of being definitive. But at its best, the evening was a testament to the rich theatricality of the author as evidenced in his prose as well as in his plays.   That theatricality is suffused with the blackest of humor, as represented by the passage from the novel \\"Watt,\\" read by John Calder, Beckett's friend and London publisher.   \\"I regret nothing,\\" Mr. Calder read, and with Beckettian pessimism he began the hilarious litany of woe, \\"the Friday howls, the Saturday snores, the Sunday yawns,\\" broadening the scope to include all things climactic and familial and leading to the realization, \\"and then the whole bloody business starting all over again.\\"   At all points, the Irishness of Beckett was self-evident, especially so in a kind of trilogy of monologues, the first two on film from Patrick Magee and Jack MacGowran, the third onstage by Barry McGovern. During a scene from \\"Krapp's Last Tape,\\" Mr. Magee's tragic mask of a face, looking like Jean Genet in extremis, was a soulful counterpoint to Krapp's distantly remembered youth. Mr. MacGowran's cry of the last lines of \\"The Unnamable,\\" \\"I can't go on","excerpt":"I'll go on,\\" echoed through the entire evening.   Mr. McGovern's appearance as Molloy telling us about his sucking stones was a virtuosic performance of a set piece that reverberated beyond its fictional context, as it did when Mr. MacGowran also performed it in his one-man show. Those 16 small stones are moved, \\"turn and turn about,\\" from one pocket to another to prolong what seems to be a pleasurable experience. By extension, the story is about man's attempt to experience and to prolong all of life's pleasures.   The tragicomic conclusion, so movingly conveyed by Mr. McGovern, is that Molloy doesn't give \\"a tinker's curse, for it was all the same to me whether I sucked a different stone each time or always the same stone until the end of time.\\"   Before the evening concluded with a poetic coda, there was Miss Whitelaw's penultimate delivery of \\"Rockaby.\\" Wearing slacks and looking quite like herself - and not at all like Beckett's aging character - she stood at a microphone and spoke her lines. Ineluctably, she was drawn into the keening rhythms of this sorrowful portrait of a woman rocking herself into death. Even without that chair, seemingly so essential to any performance of the play, \\"Rockaby\\" retained its primal force.   Beckett's words endure as a living legacy, and adventurous theater artists increasingly will plumb his fiction in addition to his plays. The most talented will be able to perform Beckett unadorned. Though the focus in this program was on the art not the artist, one cannot forget the man behind the words, and to remind the audience of his presence, onstage at the Beaumont there were two enlarged photographs of the author by Richard Avedon. In one, Beckett faces the camera straight on, with a look of critical impatience, as if to scrutinize the photographer and all who would subsequently look at his portrait. In the second photograph, the author's head is lowered in contemplation, or is it stoicism? In both, Beckett's hands are in his pockets, perhaps like Molloy trying to weigh the dramatic and comic possibilities of circulating the stones of experience.

In horror movies, even the most innocent-sounding noises -- a flapping shutter or, worse, the tinkle of a music box in the nursery -- usually mean that heads are about to roll. But what about sounds that don't terrify but soothe and cajole? I don't mean the whir of a fan or the thwang of a screen door. These old-fashioned sounds are almost extinct. No, today's houses are plugged into a different soundtrack.   In my apartment, for instance, there is a chorus line of spontaneous noisemakers. The stove clock is the most grating, and I have no idea why or when it's going to sound off. The clock doesn't tell time and the built-in timer defies use. And still it keeps on ticking, loudly, sometimes for minutes, sometimes for weeks. By comparison, the regulated hum of the refrigerator is balm to my ear. I know it's working, even when I am not and turn to it to find edible solace. Steam coming up through the radiator has always calmed me, too. In college, I was convinced that that clanking cacophony was the purest expression of pent-up sexual rage. Now, it just means old-fashioned relief from the cold. Fortunately, I've never been bothered by the irritating sound of high heels overhead or hard rock next door. My ear whites them out, tuning instead into the zzz-sound of a slightly defective fluorescent light in the bathroom. Unaccountably, it makes me think I'm in a cheesy, romantic hotel overlooking the Mediterranean. The matriarch of house sounds, however, is the dishwasher. It says: \\"You go to bed, dear.

A thriving afterlife as a brand name.    While it is no longer unusual for celebrities to be commercialized after their deaths, the rapid development of Diana into a powerful merchandising phenomenon has been exceptional. Dianabilia ranges from inexpensive trinkets like postcards and T-shirts to moderately priced coins and stamps to expensive dolls and plates.    Those who possess, or profess to possess, more refined tastes may scratch their heads in bewilderment. But the instant blanket coverage of breaking news events now offered by global media helped turn millions who never met Diana into souvenir hunters eager to get something to remember her by.    The scope of that media attention is being demonstrated again as TV networks, magazines and newspapers mark tomorrow's anniversary of her death.    Will the cottage industry that has grown up around Diana last? Experts in building brands, licensing and merchandising believe it could, particularly if her image is tended properly.    It took some time after the death of Elvis Presley for big demand to develop for products paying tribute to him. But the shrewd management of his estate has meant that more than two decades after his death, he may be a more regal king than he ever was in life.

The memory will include scenes like those at The Spectrum Thursday night, in the playoff game between the Rangers and the Flyers, when the buzzer to end each period merely provided an opportunity for everyone to push and shove and grab and fight without being thrown out of the game, and when the officials condoned the type of game Hedberg has long despised.   When Hedberg's Ranger teammate Barry Beck reached around a pile of bodies to punch Rick Tocchet, the linesman Will Norris fell to the ice and writhed in pain. When the pile was dispersed and the linesman was still lying on the ice, Hedberg was the one to go back and check on his condition.   When the game was over, the Rangers were one game away from the end of their season - Hedberg's last season - and the Spectrum organist was playing the theme from \\"Mission Impossible.\\" Hedberg went around the dressing room, giving little pats of encouragement to his teammates.    And when the time came to discuss what had just happened, Hedberg looked each questioner right in the eye and swore that his career had more than one game to go. \\"I'm not going to play my last game Saturday","excerpt":"I'll tell you right now,\\" he said. \\"We're going to be back here next Tuesday. That's it.\\"   His testimony bore no resemblance to the customary empty-sounding words that come from a mediocre team this close to the end of its season. For two nights the Rangers had been far from mediocre. The difference between the best team in the league and the team with the most losses ever to make the Stanley Cup playoffs had been minimal. \\"Nothing,\\" Hedberg said.   He does not wear a captain's \\"C\\" on his shoulder, but his actions seemed a quiet attempt to squeeze every effort out of his final Ranger team. After 11 consecutive losses to the Flyers, including two in this three-of-five series, Hedberg knows that his insistence on making his 11th professional season his last means that yesterday's practice could be the last of his career, and the game tonight could be the end.   But after a loss in overtime, and another in a game that was tied 1-1 in the third period, there is too much work ahead to allow for sentiment. Hedberg seemed offended at the thought that the end could be on his mind. \\"I'm not thinking about that,\\" he said. \\"Why should I? Not at all. I think forward. I'm not thinking backwards.\\"     There are athletes who become   misty-eyed near the end, realizing that an important part of their life will soon be over. As Hedberg's final season drew to a close, Ranger management suggested a ceremony and a presentation at a Garden game; he wanted no part of it. The same person who has stood so firmly against the game's fighting preferred to carry out his own fight quietly.    A comeback victory over the Flyers, Hedberg said, would mean \\"nothing other than we would go on to the next series. That's it. I don't think it would mean any more to me than to a guy who has 10 years to go in this league. I just refuse to believe we're not going to go on to the next series.\\"   His lasting satisfaction can come from his importance as a leader of the European influence into the North American game. In four seasons in the World Hockey Association, and especially when they became Rangers in 1978, Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson were curiosities who were often treated as if they had come from Mars rather than Sweden. Seen as hockey pacifists, they became targets in a sport that often considered thuggery a necessary ploy.   Hedberg eventually saw the game take a more positive shape. At least now, the confrontations, the posturing, and the illegal and ignored stick violence in this series is an exception, not the norm.    \\"I accept it, obviously,\\" Hedberg said. \\"Otherwise I wouldn't play. Support it? Absolutely not. But hockey has changed tremendously towards a direction where you have a lot less dirty play. And that doesn't mean it's less physical.\\"   The beatings he took in the W.H.A., Hedberg said, were no worse than those in his early days as a Ranger. \\"But times have changed,\\" he said, \\"and teams have changed. Personnel has changed. Thoughts have changed.\\"   For now, though, he remains unwilling to accept any consolation prize. His entire effort now is aimed at postponing that final, playoff-ending handshake. \\"Our breaks might come any day,\\" Hedberg said, and smiled a thin smile. \\"Unfortunately, we can't wait that much longer.\\"   - PLAYERS   Hedberg's 'Fight' Against Violence"},{"year":"1977","title":"David Pearson, a Spartanburg, S.C., stock car driver, after he was rebuked for being critical of New York City: &#8220","excerpt":"I'll tell you the truth about which place is better.

(Page 98), may have proved fruitless, but he did get to catch a few hours with his family. This was crucial, since Carlson lives in New York during the week while his wife and four children reside in Washington, D.C. He usually fishes at his weekend retreat in Maine, where the lake is teeming with pickerel. ''It's a completely prehistoric-looking fish that looks like it should be snatched out of the water by a pterodactyl,'' Carlson says. Though he spent five years as a ''Crossfire'' commentator on CNN and is preparing to be the host of an evening news program on MSNBC, Carlson's roots are in writing. He has worked for The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, The Weekly Standard and Talk magazine. His book, ''Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News,'' came out in 2003. Carlson finds print safer than television: ''If I'm on a live TV show, and I say something outrageous, that's it. There's no filter.''    Janine Di Giovanni    The war reporter Janine di Giovanni has two Amnesty International Media Awards and a National Magazine Award, and was the Granada Television Foreign Correspondent of the Year in 2000. It wasn't planned. ''I didn't start out to be a war correspondent","excerpt":"I'm a big chicken,'' says di Giovanni, who graduated from the Iowa Writers' Workshop with hopes of being a novelist. After traveling to Gaza and the West Bank during the first Palestinian intifada, in 1989, for the now-defunct Sunday Correspondent in London, she focused on human-rights abuses. She is the author of three nonfiction books; her latest is ''Madness Visible: A Memoir of a War.'' As a reporter for The Times of London and a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, she has also witnessed the conflicts in Sierra Leone, Chechnya, Afghanistan (far left) and Iraq. Her account of visiting her ''second mother,'' the journalist Dessa Trevisan, in Montenegro is on Page 120.    Massimo Vitali  The shot of the Piazza San Marco in Venice on Page 90 was one of two pictures that the Italian photographer Massimo Vitali took there. ''I didn't do 5 or 10. I did 2. Because, you know, when it's good, there's no point in taking more pictures,'' explains the Lucca-based lensman. Vitali's books, ''Beach & Disco'' and ''Landscape With Figures,'' explore the interaction between people and space. ''I try to give a lot of material to the viewer of my pictures,'' he says. Vitali has worked as a photojournalist, movie cameraman and producer. Of his stint in cinema, he adds, ''It took very little to understand it wasn't my cup of tea: I didn't like the directors; the scriptwriters were fighting all the time.''    Harf Zimmermann  When landscapes are your subject, flexibility is key. If the weather turns bad, Harf Zimmermann, the Berlin-based photographer, thinks of the outdoors as a giant studio. ''The big dude is moving the lamps,'' he says. The weather proved a bit iffy for his beach-shack shoot in Whitstable, England (Page 110), with fog in the morning and a light that shifted all day. He works with large-format cameras and is a specialist at panoramic photography. ''It has to be an interesting picture, not just a long picture.'' A contributor to The New Yorker and House & Garden, he prefers shooting the inanimate, and is documenting preserved butterflies at the Museum of Natural History in Berlin. ''There I am the big dude, and I am moving the lamps.''    Francine Prose  The first time the writer Francine Prose went to Tucson was for a teaching job. She drove cross-country from New York to Arizona when her younger son was 2 weeks old. ''It was really nerve-rattling,'' she recalls. Her husband was at the wheel. ''I can drive in the country; I just can't drive when there are other cars around.'' The family arrived in the heat of August. ''We were just running from place to place with this newborn,'' Prose says. ''I was sure he was going to dehydrate.'' She has since received many grants and awards, including Guggenheim and Fulbright fellowships, and has written 13 novels. One of them, ''Blue Angel,'' was a National Book Award finalist. The author revisited Tucson for the first time in 20 years while on a reading engagement for her latest novel, ''A Changed Man,'' and writes about her trip on Page 108: ''You're always worried the place has been totally ruined.

Thompson, the cynical, drug-infused, strange, gonzo guru and expert on self-medication, actually sounded giddy, like a pee-wee football player whose team had won its first game.   \\"You    can    beat City Hall,\\" he said in a telephone interview from his home in Woody Creek, Colo., where he is still obviously high (emotionally) over Bill Clinton's defeat of George Bush in the Presidential election.   \\"It was fun, real fun,\\" he said of the campaign and the victory, about which he is writing in his next book, \\"Better Than Sex: Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail 1992,\\" due in the spring from Random House. \\"When I covered the campaign trail in '72, that was fun. I did it again in '76 with Jimmy Carter, but that was not fun. I tried to stay out of it this time, avoid it. Stay away. Made a conscious decision not to get involved. But it crept into my life like kudzu vine. Just took over.\\" Original 'Fear' Still Popular    Mr. Thompson (who prefers the honorific Dr., although no one is sure what he is doctor of) gave a wild and generational spin to the traditional campaign book with his classic \\"Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72\\" (Warner Books, 1974), his psychedelic and psychotropic record of George S. McGovern's failed run against Richard M. Nixon for the Presidency.   That book continues to be very popular, and since 1985, when Random House Inc. began keeping computerized records, it has sold more than 700,000 copies in its Ballantine paperback edition, said David Rosenthal, Mr. Thompson's editor at the Random House adult trade division. The book has sold more than 1.5 million copies overall in paperback and hard cover.   Random House has scheduled a 100,000-copy first printing for the new book (for which the company paid in the mid-six figures, people involved in the negotiations said).   His new book will not be so much a chronicle as the original, Mr. Thompson said. He admits having become intensely involved with the Clinton staff. \\"I was down there for election night, day week, taking care of business,\\" he said, his voice a raspy trail. \\"I'm a junkie -- for campaigns. Even as I tried to stay away to write my novel -- it's about sex","excerpt":"I'm halfway through it -- I knew it would happen.\\" There's Always Paraguay    He describes the book as a collection of documents, memos, communications, and notes between himself and members of the Clinton staff. And he is completely open about the book's partisan nature.   He said he was planning to move to Paraguay if Mr. Bush had been re-elected. \\"It's a weird little place,\\" said Mr. Thompson, who is 54 years old. \\"It's about as far away from anything as you can imagine. Old Nazis go there. It's 50, maybe 100 years behind everything.\\"   Four more years of a Bush Administration, he said, \\"would have pretty much closed down this generation, my generation, in politics.\\"   He said he felt \\"vaguely responsible\\" for Mr. Clinton's victory. \\"I made a very strong statement urging people to aggressively vote for him, and then I got deeply involved with him and his staff people,\\" Mr.  Thompson said. \\"It would have been humiliating to lose against that creature again.\\" 3 on Thompson    Mr. Thompson has apparently become an official totem of his generation: three biographies of him are planned for early next year. And in case there was any doubt what kind of impression Mr. Thompson has left on the American psyche, one need only observe the subtitles of the three impending books.   \\"Fear and Loathing: The Strange and Terrible Saga of Hunter S. Thompson,\\" by Paul Perry, is to be published by Thunder's Mouth Press in January. A month later, E. P. Dutton is to release \\"Hunter: The Strange and Savage Life of Hunter S. Thompson,\\" by E. Jean Carroll. For April, Hyperion has planned \\"When the Going Gets Weird: The Twisted Life and Times of Hunter S. Thompson,\\" by Peter Whitmer.   When Mr. Thompson learned that three biographies about him were in the works, he responded, \\"Man, even Faulkner didn't have that many books written about him before he died.\\" Ready for Expansion    Poets and Writers Inc., the only national nonprofit literary organization that both acts as a clearinghouse for information and offers financial support for fiction writers and poets, has a lot to celebrate at its annual fund-raising dinner-dance, tomorrow night at the University Club in Manhattan.   The group, founded in 1970, recently announced that it received a $1 million grant from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund to expand its readings and workshops program to nine Midwestern states beginning next year.   The program, which has been active in New York State for 22 years and in California since 1989, supports poets, fiction writers and literary performance artists by matching the usually modest fees they receive for readings and workshops sponsored by a variety of organizations. The grant will allow Poets and Writers to finance similar programs in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin, in addition to maintaining its activities in New York and California.   Among the writers helped by Poets and Writers in the early days of their careers are Erica Jong, Terry McMillan and Tama Janowitz.   Poets and Writers sponsors other programs to help fledgling fiction writers and poets. They include the publications program, which publishes \\"A Directory of American Poets and Fiction Writers,\\" \\"Literary Agents: A Writer's Guide\\" and a bimonthly magazine, Poets & Writers; the information center, which answers queries by telephone and letter from authors about literary and financial subjects, and the writers' exchange, which brings four promising poets and fiction writers to New York each year to introduce them to publishers, editors, agents and new audiences.

In our tightly-knit fraternity, a pallid complexion connoted all things dull and insular. It was the signifier of what we called \\"the civilian,\\" meaning all those unfortunates trapped in office jobs.   Well, my delivery days were a long time ago","excerpt":"I've been languishing under fluorescent lights for the better part of the last decade and my skin has the greenish cast to prove it. But somehow I can't shake the stigma of the pale. I'll admit to systematic forays to Frederick Fekkai in attempt to recapture the sun-streaked hair of my youth. I'll even admit to a recent experiment with what is known in cosmetics-land as \\"self-tanning.\\"   Anyway, I started logically in this arena, which is to say in the privacy of my own home, in deep winter -- when the climate necessitates lots of clothing (if my experiment bombed, you see, I could cover the damage), and with a medley of different brands -- applied judiciously on various body parts (to gauge the merits of each one side-by-side). Very scientific, or so I thought. I even prepared a mnemonic device in the form of a crudely-drawn sketch of the human body, neatly divided into nine test areas with different products assigned to each bit as follows: 1. left leg below-the-knee (Estee Lauder); 2. right leg below-the-knee (Clinique); 3. left thigh (Lancome); 4. right thigh (Borghese); 5. belly (Clarins); 6. chest (Chanel); 7. left arm (Biotherm); 8. right arm (Bain de Soleil) and, 9., face (Prescriptives). The bumper crop of products suggests that the nineties are nothing if not boom times for the health-conscious, tanning-obsessed.   In my initial applications, I was put off slightly by the olfactory natures of many of the products. I yearned for that archetypal sun smell that is Coppertone, the memory-cue of the beaches and boats and summers of years-gone-by. (I like to swallow my fantasies whole.) But most of this stuff had the scent of \\"ladies moisturizers,\\" which is okay, I guess, but somehow not coherent with the intent of the product. Lauder, Clinique, Biotherm and Chanel were the most benign; Lancome, Borghese, Chanel and Prescriptives had a mild, perfume-y (thought not unpleasant) scent; and Bain de Soleil smelled most disastrously of curry once applied (it smelled fine in the bottle).   The results were inconclusive. Even though certain areas -- namely No. 4, midriff and back/Clarins, and No. 6, left arm/Biotherm -- eventually appeared darker than others, I think this was a result of application finesse (or lack thereof), as a closer look at each label revealed that all these products contain dihydroxyacetone (aka DHA), a substance billed not as a dye -- my first thought -- but as a \\"natural ingredient that works with the proteins in your skin to produce a natural, healthy-looking tanned appearance in two to three hours,\\" according to the press material that accompanies Bain de Soleil's product. Right, but what does it really do?     \\"I can't tell you everything about DHA,\\" says Dr. Frank Akin, senior director of clinical research at Schering-Plough, Inc, the company that produces Coppertone's QT Suntan Lotion, the original self-tanning product, \\"because we're doing some confidential work in this area. But, he added, it \\"reacts with the amino acids\\" -- meaning the protein -- \\"on the dead cell layer of the skin.\\" Right, but what does it really do?     \\"Well, if you put water on your skin, it also 'reacts' with the proteins in your skin,\\" says Dr. Paul Lazar, professor of dermatology at Northwestern University. \\"So the language here is something of a sleight of hand. But I'd go ahead and call DHA a stain of sorts. And it doesn't really matter how it works, the point is is that it does, and that it's safe.\\" I called the Food and Drug Administration and John Wenninger, associate director for cosmetics, tried to help. \\"DHA is itself a colorless liquid,\\" he told me. \\"It somehow goes through a chemical reaction and, as with many other chemical reactions, it forms this brown color.\\" Right, but what does it...oh, never mind.   What really disturbed me was that after the requisite tamount of time -- from two to three hours -- was up, I had no tan to speak of, but a distinctly unpleasant odor all over my body -- it was sickly-sweet.   In fact, I didn't notice much until almost 12 hours had passed. My back was the biggest problem; it's not easy to get an even coat on one's back all by one's self (I had white hand prints on my shoulder blades). The other odd notes were struck by the pallor of my hands (to avoid orange palms, one is instructed to wash the hands with soap and water, which means that the arms are brown and the hands are little white gloves) and the smeared brown of my inner-arms (an area that, even on boat deliverers, never gets sun). Check under the forearms of the winter-tanned; they're a dead give-away.   All in all, I was pretty splotchy from the experiment; an effect I ascribe to the piecemeal nature of my applications. So, the next morning, I opted for another go-round and smeared the Clarins (the best smelling of all the products) everywhere. By 7 p.m. I was nicely golden from head to toe. And I'd say that at that point, the color was pretty true to life: no sickly orange or yellow cast; no pooling in the hair follicles in the manner of the original QT (According to Dr. Akin, the company has improved the lotion part so that it doesn't streak anymore. Also, it should be noted that QT has always contained DHA, but in higher concentrations that the new crop of subtler products.) Theoretically, the color is supposed to last a week, or until the top layer of your skin sloughs off, but I'd give it no more than a day or two. After that, you start to look like the victim of some mad finger painter.     Five days after my initial immersion, I did attempt a revisionist foray into a Coppertone product -- not Q.T., which I couldn't find in the stores, but something called Sunless Tanning Lotion. The results: same irritating smell as the rest of the lot; same blotchy visuals.   I can't say which product I liked the best; in terms of net result, they were all pretty much equal. I've admitted to a preference for the scent of Clarins, which, at $16.50 for 4.4 ounces, logged in pricewise about average for the genre (Chanel hitting the highest mark at $23.50 for 3.5 ounces; Bain de Soleil and Coppertone Sunless Tan came in at rock bottom for $7.99 for 3.1 and 3.5 ounces respectively. Ah, the price of beauty.)    Still, I might even venture into this realm again. Maybe not in such a wholesale manner (the inner-arm problem is, after all, something only a graphic artist could solve), but in carefully chosed areas far away from my nose: I see neatly tanned legs in my sunless, summer future.

For example, I have never really understood (the diplomatic term for “liked”) a single Strange Invisible Perfume scent despite great effort on my part and the sincerity and hard work of its founder. Most organic lines offer various versions of woody mushroom. In fact, I would have told you that a good all-organic was impossible, but I would have been wrong. Recently, Red Flower somehow managed it. Now Patyka proves me wrong again.  Founded by Philippe Gounel, its creative director, and devised by Patyka’s in-house perfumer, Jenny Corless, the organic skin-care and fragrance brand was introduced in the United States in 2005. Patyka’s philosophy makes an immense deal out of being organic and natural, its raison d’être and its political cause. As for its aesthetic approach, Patyka’s is, interestingly, a collection of scent paradigms. All six of its perfumes (originally there were also a floral and a fougère-fern, which have, sadly, been discontinued","excerpt":"I’d be very interested to smell them) bear the names of basic perfumery classifications: Hepéridé (citrus perfumes), Chypre, Boisé (woody) and Ambré (amber; ambers are all built on vanilla and patchouli). In one sense, this is a weakness. Take Ambré, for example. Corless and Gounel have created an absolutely classic amber. Like Escoffier’s basic béchamel sauce, this could be used in perfume classrooms as a model, a sort of scented phylogenetic common amber ancestor. Creativity, innovation, zero — but Ambré is very, very nice, creamy as malted milk and smoothed with vanilla. Before getting to the other perfumes, let’s do the (huge) caveats. First, fundamentalism is reprehensible no matter what form it takes, including PETA and the all-organic fanatics, and there is no scientific reason whatsoever to spit on synthetics, which in his suave French way Gounel unfortunately does. Why do it? It might be good marketing. It might (to be much more charitable) come from an honest desire to care for the planet. But it’s not rational. For one, perfume is not a food; it’s art, and scent raw materials don’t need to be natural any more than do paints. For another, to get geraniol (a gorgeous molecule, green/lemon/rose/fresh) you can grow, then destroy, tons of geranium plants, or you can simply build geraniol in a lab; the molecules are identical, but the synthetic is pure and takes less out of the earth. Then there’s this question of what is natural. Due to newish E.U. regulations, all perfumes must list known allergens (perfumers have to limit the amounts of these they use in formulas). Patyka packaging lists limonene (found in lemon), citronellol (geranium) and linalol, all of which is fine, except: a) all can be synthesized without taking a toll on the soil, and b) natural linalol is mostly extracted from rosewood, which is going extinct; by not using synthetic linalol, Patyka is contributing to this. (Of course, every time you peel an orange you get more limonene on your hands than in an entire bottle of perfume; some of Europe’s rules are absurd as well.) Benzyle benzoate is found in ylang ylang; because the perfumes contain ylang, they include this molecule, which is an allergen; because Patyka doesn’t believe in the technology that would purify the ylang of this allergen, the allergen goes into the Patyka perfume. Oh, and the box lists “parfum.” Huh? What does that mean? Everything is “parfum,” an umbrella to hide any number of possible sins. But all this said, these are four extremely nice perfumes. I dare say wonderfully so. Hespéridé is an absolutely delightful, pure sunlit lemon high on a hill in Sicily. It is a perfectly balanced citrus, which is hard to do, a feeling of both crisp clean and relaxed bliss. I would bet this stuff is more effective than Paxil. The Lauders and LVMHs should take note of Chypre, which masterfully transports the genre’s progenitor, the 1917 Chypre de Coty, into the 21st century, a satin scarf of oak moss and eugenol (gentle spice) and dusky, clear bergamot and bitter orange. (I never comment on packaging, but the packaging here is just too perfectly done not to.) Perhaps the best is Boisé, a terrific, accessible, stylish wood. No cedar pencil shavings of Gucci Homme, no smoke, no fussiness of Feminité du Bois nor the contemporary cool of He Wood, Boisé is a friendly, warm feather bed of a wood fragrance. It is also the only one that lasts on skin. This is the other problem. Because there are no synthetics, which are technologically much higher performing, you’re paying a hundred bucks for perfumes that vanish in five minutes (Hespéridé) or 20 (Ambré) or 40 (Chypré). Which is why those are two-star perfumes. A scent simply must last to be truly great. Yes, reapplication is an option, but Patyka will make it constant, and you will need more than a little patience. These perfumes are as evanescent as happiness. But, boy, in the brief time that they last, they are just wonderful, and you are so happy.

In the movie - and in real life -the 80-year-old Alice, who at 10 was Lewis Carroll's inspiration, comes to America for the 100th anniversary of Carroll's birth.

Dodgson was a much more complex and heroic man than we think. I'm utterly convinced he never made any questionable physical contact with Alice, but he had what in these post-Freudian days would be called a sexual longing.''

The playing was marked by a delightful springiness of rhythm, the music propelled along elastically. There was ample subtlety of expression, but a vigorous, bright boldness defined the treatment of fast movements. In terms of timbre, the four players sounded more complementary than heterogeneous.

Hence in the last chapter of this fantastic story one sees the dazzling Cecile Brunne (Miss Murray) limp haltingly into the arms of the hero. Thereafter one perceives Cecile unusually quiet, which, of course, is strange when one thinks of Miss Murray.For the most part of this picture, however, Miss Murray has things her own way, as in this exquisitely staged production Cecile is introduced as a dazzling vision in white, bejeweled from forehead to ankle. In her ecstatic delight she cares little about her shimmering gowns, as in one of the giddy sequences in which she is the only woman in a Long Island mansion she makes fools of the men who are captivated by her beauty by plunging into an artificial lake and insisting that they follow her. These puppets, as she calls them, attired in dress suits, obey the fascinating flirt by splashing awkwardly through the water.Miss Murray gives an exhibition of dancing, while a negro jazz orchestra delights in the blare and quick movements of the graceful dancer. Miss Murray's lips are made up in a futuristic shape and her eyebrows are diagonal. Altogether, she is exotic, graceful, dainty and lithe.James Kirkwood impersonates Dr. Van Martyn, the hero. He is a guest at one of the wild parties, but soon tires of the company and the dizzy amusement, leaving without thanking his hostess. Cecile is patterned after Circe, the goddess who beguiled Ulysses and his warriors. The young Long Island hostess finds that the quiet Dr. Van Martyn has caused her heart to throb, and in her desire to forget him she becomes more reckless than ever. You see her throwing dice, first for $1,000 and then for her home and its contents. She loses everything, and after referring to happiness as a bubble that soon bursts, she crushes the glass in her hand and is cut so badly that Dr. Van Martyn is called to attend her.In the last chapter Cecile is seen as a demure little convent teacher in gray. One of her pupils runs out of the gate, and in saving the child from being run over Cecile is seriously injured.Those with whom Miss Murray's gyrations and charming personality find favor will enjoy this lavish picture, in spite of its impossible contrasts and happenings.

This is far too hyperbolic a statement. Ms. Doerr does have a  sure and elegant hand when it comes to describing flora and fauna and the houses in California and Mexico where she has lived. But with her keen attention to detail in matters of character and emotion, she demonstrates a compassionate spirit that is anything but evil. Using an episodic structure similar to those in her novels, \\"Stones From Ibarra\\" and \\"Consider This, Senora,\\" this new book allows Ms. Doerr to contemplate certain events from the nearly nine decades of her life, even as she returns us to the locales made familiar in her fiction. Writing with admirable simplicity, she recalls spending sublime childhood summers at the beach, knitting a muffler for an American soldier in France (who  sent her a much-cherished thank-you note) and going off to Smith College in 1927. There are also memories of being widowed at 65 after 42 years of marriage  and then going back to college, and of helplessly standing by as her son began to succumb to cancer. Several of the short stories, set in Ibarra, reacquaint readers with Sara and Richard Everton, who were introduced in Ms. Doerr's first  book. Others explore different parts of rural Mexico. Like the matilija poppies  of Ms. Doerr's youth, \\"whose crushed tissue-paper petals unfolded every June into white flowers as big as a child's face,\\" these previously uncollected short works are strikingly pure and radiant.

The main conflict, for example, in \\"When We Dead Awaken,\\" Ibsen's final play, which is being revived at the Cocteau Repertory Company, takes place within the mind of Arnold Rubek, a famous sculptor who has returned to his native Norway to rediscover the source of his earlier inspiration.

This summer that landscape will be informed by the hand of man. The annual Reykjavik Arts Festival is paying homage to the work of the German-born Swiss artist Dieter Roth (1930-98), who lived in Iceland. Roth was concerned with matters of time and decay and often worked with organic materials: chocolate, sausage, cheese and rabbit droppings. His paintings, graphic works, installations and art books can be seen in the exhibition ''Train,'' curated by his son Bjorn and housed in the Reykjavik Art Museum, the National Gallery of Iceland and other locations. In conjunction, another show, ''Material Time/Work Time/Life Time,'' in venues throughout the country, reflects Roth's interest in the relationship between working and living (a piece by Roth, above, shows him with the artist Arnulf Rainer, at right). The curator Jessica Morgan, of the Tate Modern in London, commissioned artists from the United States, Europe and Latin America -- including Matthew Barney and Bojan Sarcevic -- to muse on this subject. Exhibits will be on view from mid-May through mid-August. Iceland's summer climate is conducive to viewing outdoor installations (or geysers), and the sun never really sets.

Miss Donegan, who is sharing the bill with another jazz legend, Page Cavanaugh, as part of ''Piano Playoffs'' - the two play together briefly on twin pianos - has been performing professionally for more than 40 years. From the outset, she has been recognized as one of the most technically accomplished pianists in the world, mastering styles from a thunderous, two-fisted boogie-woogie to a flamboyant romanticism that parodies Scriabin and Rachmaninoff.   It is not Miss Donegan's technique, but what she does with it - crossing over freely between jazz and classical music - that is still a source of some controversy in jazz circles. Depending on the club and the audience, Miss Donegan can turn into a vaudevillian cutup, jumping about and stomping one minute, doing broad impersonations of Billie Holiday, Lena Horne, Della Reese and Eartha Kitt the next. But in a club like Michael's Pub, the musician in Miss Donegan takes precedence over the entertainer, and she demonstrates a lightning virtuosity that sometimes sounds like four hands playing instead of two.

WOODBLOCK PRINTS     Posters are the staple of George Goodstadt's Antique Poster Collection in Ridgefield, but beginning Saturday through Feb. 10 he is also exhibiting a selection of woodblock prints from China. Made from paintings created by people in the villages of Huhsien, the subjects reflect their daily lives in bold, brightly colored style. When 80 of the gouaches were sent to the Paris Biennial in 1974 they were celebrated for their break with official Chinese painting styles.    Otherwise, the gallery, in Girolmetti Court at 17 Danbury Road, is a warren of posters from every period and country imaginable, and priced from the low hundreds to five figures. Among them are 200 drawings, etchings and lithographs by Al Hirschfeld. Hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Call 438-1836 for more information. BLESSING OF CREATURES     It has been a New Year's sight worth seeing for the past 11 years, when people of all ages and their animals, , ranging from salamanders to draft horses, line up for the Annual Blessing of the Animals at Cannon Crossing in Wilton. June Havoc restored the pre-Civil War farming village as a popular boutique-shopping and tourist attraction just off Route 7, where the tradition will be re-enacted today from 1 to 3 P.M.    Cows, oppossums, rabbits, birds, gerbils, cats, dogs and numerous other creatures will be blessed by the Rev. Dawson Teague. Miss Havoc will read the Cannon Crossing Blessing, which was written by Tana Sibilio, and local choirs will lead a community sing of Christmas carols. (Song sheets will be distributed to everyone.)    Admission is free. Pets must be leashed or in suitable containers for their own safety. For more information call 762-2233. AMERICAN ARTISTS     A wide range of 19th- and early 20th-century American artists are represented in the exhibition and sale at Francis Bealey's gallery at 3 South Main Street in Essex, on view through Jan. 26.    Ernest Lawson, Walter Griffin, Adolph Borie and Robert W. Grafton are among the Impressionists; Post-Impressionists include Charles Hawthorne, who founded the Provincetown Art Colony and School, Rutherford Boyd and Edward L. Weeks. The realist tradition of the 19th century is seen in the works of Edmund Darch Lewis and William Hart. Six women artists in the show are Jane Peterson, Dorothea Litzinger, Gertrude Fiske, Agnes Richmond, May Wilson Preston and Elizabeth Fisher-Clay.    Subject matter veers from self-portraits to Maine seasides to Hudson River landscapes, and encompasses the atmosphere of places like Boston, New York and Philadelphia as well as Indiana and Cape Cod. Gallery hours are 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily except Sunday, and the phone number is 767-0220. THE GLOBAL VILLAGE     The 125 cast members of Up With People, performing next weekend in Darien, range in age from 18 to 26 and come from more than 25 countries around the world. Musical training is less a prerequisite for acceptance into the group than maturity and enthusiasm for the organization's ideal of a global village.    Each year 650 young people pay a fee to travel as a group, not only giving concerts but also setting up the stage, loading and unloading equipment, visiting hospitals, schools and homes for the elderly, touring factories, meeting with business leaders, and a variety of other activities designed to make communications among different peoples smoother and more accessible.    In the 25 years since its founding by J. Blanton Belk as a means of channeling the idealism of the '60's, more than 11,000 young people from 60 countries have performed for 35 million residents of 3,100 cities in 49 countries. Their repertoire includes everything from Russian folk dances to Los Angeles rap, performed in appropriate costume.    A new production called \\"Face to Face\\" will be presented in the Darien High School auditorium at 8 P.M. Saturday and 3 P.M. next Sunday. Tickets are $15, $10 for students and the elderly. Preferred seating costs $25, $15 for students and the elderly. Call 655-2535 for reservations.

From fallacious inferences he drew from the behavior of children at Nazi concentration camps, which in some respects resembled the behavior of autistic children, he concluded that lack of love caused autism. Hence the parents were guilty of causing autism!    The idea of \\"parental refrigeration\\" had long been rejected by Dr. Leo Kanner, who coined the phrase. When an autistic child was entered at the Orthogenic School, the parents were not allowed to visit for at least six months. Legions of parents were made to feel guilty and miserable.   Many autistic children have fixations on such subjects as dates, numbers, the weather. Nevertheless Bettelheim did not realize that he was achieving a reductio ad absurdum when he analyzed a girl's weather fixation as due to fear of parents because \\"weather\\" could be read \\"we at(e) her,\\" and that she thought her parents would do that to her! This tortured nonsense was even published in Scientific American as an example of the achievements of modern psychology, so great was Bettelheim's prestige.    This same prestige promulgated a widespread belief that autism was the effect of psychological causes, and it helped to hold back more meaningful research into the cause of autism.
