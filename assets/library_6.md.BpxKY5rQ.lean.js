There may not be much one can do about redeeming or reshooting many of these pictures, but the photographer who takes the time to learn from his or her mistakes on such a roll can still derive much benefit from them.\\n\\nBad composition and poor arrangement of subjects in a camera's viewfinder are common flaws. This often happens with point-and-shoot cameras where the viewfinder is off to one side so that you are not looking ''through the lens'' as you would be with a single-lens-reflex (SLR) camera. Most of these rangefinder models have a line inside the viewfinder which shows the area the camera is recording, but some of these are difficult to see in low light situations. One thing that helps is to step back and frame your subjects in the center of the viewfinder to insure that everything will be included.

Salgado is a freelance writer and photographer.  Camera enthusiasts who get involved in tabletop photography can create miniature worlds of their own on almost any flat surface of moderate size. The environments created can be entirely artificial, or they can include pieces of nature, such as small plants or insects that gain pictorial impact being by pictured as larger-than-life in size. And, like model makers, tabletop photographers can also bring such unwieldy pieces of reality as trains and ships into a basement workshop or family room to be included in their miniature settings.   Imagination and patience are needed for tabletop photography, along with a tripod and a camera that is capable of taking close-ups. A 35mm single-lens-reflex camera with a close-focusing zoom lens is ideal.   The size of the tabletop arrangement that is set up will generally determine how close to the scene the camera must be, with the most common camera-to-subject distances varying from three feet down to as close as one foot. At these close focusing distances there are two photographic problems that may be have to be considered: viewfinder error (parallax) and shallow depth of field (where only part of the subject is in focus).

When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, she was a 16-year-old Jewish girl living in Sosnowiec, a town close to the German border. She volunteered to take the place of her older sister, Raizel, who had been ordered to report to a Nazi forced labor camp for six weeks. But the six weeks stretched into almost five years of servitude for Sala, in seven different camps, with a pittance for wages or none at all, filthy quarters and an abundance of typhus-carrying lice. Her luck was that her labor-worthiness as a seamstress saved her from Auschwitz, a main extermination center, where her parents and other family members died. The story of Sala (she is alive and well at 82 and has grandchildren with her husband of 60 years, Sidney Kirschner) is told in a stirring new exhibition at the New York Public Library, which draws on more than 300 cherished letters from family and friends","excerpt":"photographs (above, Sala, from 1945); and a diary that she managed to squirrel away during her years of servitude (for a while the Nazis let forced laborers send and receive mail, provided it was written in German). Crucial elements of her saga -- which she kept under wraps for more than 50 years -- include the protective support of an older campmate, Ala Gertner, later hanged at Auschwitz for her part in an uprising there; the kindness of a local German family to whose home she was sent under guard to use its sewing machine; her close comradeship with female workers at the various camps; her introduction to her husband, then a G.I., at a Rosh Hashana service after the camps were liberated; her postwar discovery of her two surviving sisters; and her emigration as a war bride to the United States in 1946.

IN THE ARTS: CRITIC'S CHOICES","excerpt":"PHOTOGRAPHY"},{"year":"1983","title":"''The Way We Live Now: Beyond Social Documentary'' at P.S. 1, curated by the critic Abigail Solomon-Godeau, is a group show in which 10 photographers use words and pictures to deal with issues, from nuclear power to abortion, from the point of view of the radical left. The most effective presentation is Lisa Lewenz's 1884 calendar entitled ''A View From Three Mile Island,'' which is illustrated with photographs of tacky but lovable American bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens. IN THE ARTS: CRITICS' CHOICES","excerpt":"PHOTOGRAPHY"},{"year":"1984","title":"Joel Sternfeld is one of a number of young American photographers whose romantic view of their native land is admirably expressed in a hymn written by a 19th-century Bishop of Calcutta: ''Where every prospect pleases and only man is vile.'' Whether Sternfeld photographs Alaska, Atlanta, California or the industrial Northeast, the beauty of nature is inevitably marred by a dump site, a trailer park, a factory or people.

On the whole, they do not make the subject look very appealing, but then that was probably not their intention. CRITICS' CHOICES","excerpt":"Photography"},{"year":"1985","title":"There is something rich and darkly glamorous about the urban world of Ralph Gibson's photographs. It is, on the whole, a world of things rather than people - statues, moldings, automobiles, doorways, signs - sometimes viewed close-up, sometimes seen from a distance, as if by accident, between other things. CRITICS' CHOICES","excerpt":"PHOTOGRAPHY"},{"year":"1985","title":"For its second exhibition, through June 15, the Burden Gallery, 20 East 23d Street, switches from Western landscape to candid camera street and party photography, concentrating in depth on the work of two photographers, Larry Fink and Anthony Hernandez.\\n\\nMr. Hernandez is represented by large color street photographs taken in a wealthy Beverly Hills shopping area called Rodeo Drive.

The Brooklyn Bridge stretches halfway across the picture, strung with cool blue lights. CRITICS' CHOICES","excerpt":"Photography"},{"year":"1986","title":"The pinhole camera has no lens and no shutter and it is too slow to stop the motion of a leaping athlete or a humming bird poised in midair at the feeder. But when the subject stands still - a landscape, a still life, even perhaps a sleeping model - this box with a tiny aperture at one end can help the photographer achieve a truly poetic beauty.\\n\\nCertainly this occurs when Marianne Ingeberg turns her pinhole camera on the landscape of Greenland (at the Bertha Urdang Gallery, 23 East 74th Street, through March 1). The Greenland that interests her is a nearly vacant country of ice, rocks, bold head lands and calm waters. The architecture, what little there is of it, with its log walls and its oriental turnups at the corners of the roofs, has a fairy tale look, and the soft light of a far northern summer holds everything suspended in a timeless embrace. CRITICS' CHOICES","excerpt":"Photography"},{"year":"1986","title":"In painting, a masterpiece is unique. In photography, however, a masterpiece may be shadowed by a whole series of slightly different versions known only to specialists in the field. The aim of the exhibition ''Variants,'' organized by John Szarkowski at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, through March 11, is to teach the rest of us something about the nature of photography by showing a number of well-known photographs by acknowledged masters along with little-known variants by the same masters. If in the process the idea of what constitutes a photographic masterpiece gets slightly smudged, so much the worse for it. CRITICS' CHOICES","excerpt":"Photography"},{"year":"1986","title":"The career of the French photographer Jacques Henri Lartigue, who was born 90 years ago, runs backwards towards his youth.

Each seems to compete with the next for a heavier weigh-in and a correspondingly more frothy interior. Even books with the most sobering of subtitles (\\"The Success and Failure of Federal Land Management,\\" \\"An American Visionary,\\" \\"Typologies\\") seem to invite nothing more than a moment's browsing on the coffee table, as one awaits the host or the cocktails.\\n\\nStill, photography has always courted the ephemeral and the evanescent and given permanence and solidity to the most fleeting things (bars of light across the face of a building or a woman, the winning horse in a photo finish).
