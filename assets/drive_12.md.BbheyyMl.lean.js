If you're more interested in taking a peek at newer works, there will be two performances each of the resident choreographer Christopher Wheeldon's ''Scènes de Ballet,'' first performed in 1999, and last year's rapturously received ''After the Rain.''

Mr. Polan pushed to get the city's recycling effort restored after it was scheduled to be cut from the budget. Yet much to the annoyance of environmentalists who love recycling but hate incinerators, he also pointed out that recycling is no panacea. Supported by First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, he succeeded in persuading Mayor David Dinkins to endorse unpopular but critically needed incinerators.

Months before its debut on ABC tonight at 10, \\"N.Y.P.D. Blue\\" became the new season's most talked-about new series. As it happens, it's also the best, by far.    In fact, \\"N.Y.P.D.

And there is some tough street language, usually in the form of slang for various body parts and functions, a device that has become a Bochco signature. We are, after all, dealing with New York police officers here. Station houses across the city are not likely to be shocked. What matters is that \\"N.Y.P.D.
