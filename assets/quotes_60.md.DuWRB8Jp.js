Surprisingly, the man, his wife and others in his professional entourage make appropriately natural actors. If Procuna ever needs another job, he should be able to find one in Hollywood.And it isn't just that the drama is played (or re-enacted) naturally. It is done—especially in the news shots—so that it has the hot throb of stark reality. Not once but many times Procuna is dumped and banged about by the bull, gored and carried off to the infirmary, bleeding unquestionably. And close-ups of him in action, on the sidelines and even in his home have the grim and fear-framed expressions that no actor could possibly fake.The picture begins with Procuna preparing for that occasion in 1953 when he returned to the bullring in Mexico City after a controversial retirement from \\"facing the bulls.\\" He dresses in his home, says his devotions, kisses his wife good-by and then drives to the great Plaza Mexico, where he will meet the supreme test of fear.En route, he recalls his boyhood, his early training to fight the bulls and his first humiliation and later triumphs in achieving great popularity in Mexico. These sequences are re-enacted but developed and played so well, in actual settings and bullrings, that they have the clear, sharp stamp of truth. He recalls, too, the great Manolete, famous bullfighter of Spain, whose visit to Mexico and death by goring are shown in actual news films.Thus the theme is developed—the three fears the bullfighter has: fear of the bull, fear of the crowd (which is depicted in vivid candid shots) and fear of himself. The last is his greatest obstacle. And it is this which Procuna overcomes on that day in 1953, here imaged, when he returns to the ring.We wouldn't know how precisely the events of that day are recalled—whether Procuna actually flubbed his first encounter, so that he was booed and shamed out of the ring, only to demand another bull and a chance to acquit himself gloriously. But the visualization of it is better than anything of its sort ever done before. It's all here—the crowds, the sweat, the terror, the bull, the ferocious bravery and the blood.The narration is in English. That is all the words it needs.This film, which won a special citation at the Venice Film Festival last fall, is in black-and-white. It is not for the squeamish or those who shudder at the brutality of bullfighting. But the aficionados should not miss it. It's no bull!

The General Accounting Office report is based on data that are 18 to 24 months old. That snapshot of the Apache is no longer accurate. The Army and the McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company have been working aggressively for more than a year to resolve concerns reported from the field.   Consider the repeated misinformation that has been spread by the news media about Apache rotor blades. The rotor blades of the Apache are not replaced every 164 hours, as you report. And if that were indeed the case, the Army would have discarded about 1,700 blades to date.    But the Army has retired only 367 blades, and 160 of those were due to storm damage. Early problems with the blades have been resolved, and improved Apache blades have logged more than 1,200 flight hours without removal for repair. The entire Apache fleet, which now exceeds 600 aircraft in service, has flown more than 280,000 flight hours.   Today's Apache is a reliable and maintainable aircraft that is meeting its commitments. It is our country's most advanced multirole combat helicopter and gives us an important edge over our adversaries.   Recent news media reports confirm that the Apache is performing extremely well during Operation Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf confrontation. Aviation Week and Space Technology reported Oct. 15 that \\"In Saudi Arabia, the Apache units have achieved a 90 percent operational readiness rate.\\" That's good news for the Apache and for the country.

At 21, she made news again, establishing a foundation, Midori and Friends, to help take classical music to children in public schools and in hospitals.\\n\\nEarly this month, Midori resumed performing with a recital tour of Europe.

This setback in the life of one of America's most beloved young artists rekindles questions about how prodigies are marketed and managed, and whether it is in their best interest to perform with leading orchestras at a tender age.

George Armstrong Custer, die with his boots on at the Little Big Horn, along with all those extras playing the 262 other United States cavalrymen who fell with him on June 25, 1876. That has been enough time for Americans to be made aware of a point of view other than the settlers-against-savages version long promoted by Hollywood, the popular press, traveling shows and some histories. In recent decades, it has been the Indians' turn to be romanticized.   \\"Last Stand at Little Big Horn,\\" written by the producer Paul Stekler and the Blackfoot novelist James Welch, is in accord with the revised consensus without getting sappy. For the Plains Indians, says the narrator, N. Scott Momaday, the encounter with Custer was \\"one of many battles to prevent the theft of their land.\\" Their hour of success was just a passing episode in a profound defeat.   The accounts of the white side come largely from the usual historical sources, embellished by photographs. The Indian version is told in stories and songs handed down through generations and is accompanied by drawings. That alone suggests the nature of the differences between the Lakota and Cheyenne peoples, who made their homes in the Montana Territory, and the pioneers and gold-seekers from the East. Yet the irreconcilable points of view have been fitted together in a coherent hour that goes beyond the brief battle at the Little Big Horn to what America's westward expansion meant for those who were simply in the way.   The program has no criticism of the cavalrymen, described as impoverished young immigrants and farm boys, who did not ride or shoot nearly so well as western movies would have it and who endured miseries in unwelcoming territory. The program makes the case that they were serving the political and economic interests of grander classes and the imperatives of an expanding nation.   As for Custer, whose image his widow, Elizabeth, dedicated herself with considerable success to polishing for more than 50 years after his death, tonight's program contributes to his debunking as a swaggering, egotistical self-promoter who rashly led his men to their deaths. Yet at the time, he was portrayed as a martyr, and the massacre of his outnumbered troopers became a pretext for wiping out the Plains Indians. A son of the Lakota leader Crazy Horse, speaking for his people, says, \\"Wherever we went they came to kill us.\\"   Much of the nation seems to understand now that no just compensation is possible for what was done to America's Indians, but it is possible, at least, to tell their story in a way that treats them as human beings. Narrowly avoiding a popular tendency to demonize whites and glorify Indians, the latest offering from \\"The American Experience\\" makes an intelligent and moving contribution to that cause.

A tape of the latter can be seen on HBO tonight at 11:45.    Now in his mid-50's and, with modest ponytail, looking like a well-groomed hippie, Mr. Carlin has had an unusually public career since starting out around 1960, with Jack Burns as his comedy partner. By 1962 he was going solo, doing nicely with standard mother-in-law jokes.

Behind Mr. Mason is a battery of television monitors on which are projected images of politicians, astronauts and - a bulletin from Israel - Charlton Heston parting the Red Sea. The stand-up comedian is now standing in for a television anchor. He is also doing his own commercials, as in his confident aside to the audience, \\"It's a wonderful thing to see me in person.\\"   Mr. Mason's audience, which is an integral part of his act, returns the compliment. With this comedian, there is no sense of indecisiveness. He is sharp, pungent and self-assured. Yet his humor is not without its moments of subtlety. He does not batter an audience into submission, but informally amuses them with shticks of recognition.   \\"Brand New\\" is an exact meeting of performer and material. He is wound up and ready for action, with the same targets but with a different arsenal of jokes. He never moves very far from what he regards as eternal differences betweens Jews and Gentiles, differences that are social, marital and, perhaps above all, culinary.   There is a high caloric content in his comedy. In his view, you eat what you are. This leads him to a withering discussion of health-food stores, whose patrons have sickly looks on their faces from eating too much alfalfa, a word he pronounces with disdain. As a confirmed hot-pastrami fancier, he offers a shrewd comment on changing nutritional patterns: no food is considered good to eat for two weeks in a row.   For him, there is something especially suspect about sushi, the food served by restaurateurs who have no room in their establishments for a kitchen. Chauvinistically, he questions the elevation of everything Japanese while reserving surprisingly virulent remarks for the French. He prefers seltzer to Perrier and, as a tip to bottlers, suggests that sparkling-water sales would soar if the beverage were pronounced seltzier.   The comic style - a spritz followed by a topper - derives from the Catskills via Las Vegas, but in his heart, Mr. Mason has the retaliatory instincts of a political commentator. Despite the controversy he aroused during last year's mayoral campaign, he still makes jokes about Mayor David N. Dinkins's wardrobe (photo of the natty Mayor on the television screen). He surmises that if the Brooklyn Korean market had sold jackets instead of vegetables, the Mayor would have immediately broken up the boycott. Not one to play favorites, he also spoofs former Mayor Edward I. Koch and Mr. Mason's own defeated mayoral candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani (\\"He's a brilliant crime fighter. He puts people in jail whether they're guilty or not\\").   In the equivalent of an extended opening monologue on the Johnny Carson show, he needles George Bush, Ronald Reagan and Mayor Marion S.Barry Jr. of Washington who \\"said he would get drugs off the street and did.\\" The assault is ecumenical, as he imitates a gallery of Israeli leaders as well as William F. Buckley Jr. When he mimics someone he does not ape a voice but rather a manner - and mannerisms - that reveal his own diabolical gift as a caricaturist.   This time there is perhaps excessive interaction with the audience, which only reminds one that the show would be equally at home in a nightclub. Those seated in front rows should be prepared to become the object of Mr. Mason's mockery. On the other hand, he seems more concerned than in his previous Broadway show about giving the audience its money's worth. During the intermission, theatergoers can remain in their seats and watch Daffy Duck and Porky Pig cartoons on those monitors. This bizarre touch may be an attempt to broaden his already wide audience.   Despite his apparent parochialism, there is a universality in his comic assault. He cuts everyone down to size, including himself, as in his comment, \\"At the stage of life when most people are passing away, I became a star.\\" Admirers will laugh and skeptics will smile. Mr. Mason is one of a kind, a stand-up comic who has found a hospitable home on Broadway.
