A favorite way to enjoy the sight is to take a jug of warm sake (rice wine) and go to the Aoyama Cemetery, which is full of cherry trees, and sit under the blossoms in the moonlight drinking sake. Other places for splendid viewing are Ueno Park, where there will be a festival April 6 and 7; Shinjuku Gyoen Garden, where the blossoms are double and in mid&#8208;April the Prime Minister holds bis annual cherry blossom &#8208;viewing party; Yasukuni Shrine to Japan's war dead, which will hold a festival April 1&#8211;15; and, in the center of the city, the East Garden of the Imperial Palace and the grounds around the palace moat.

The countries represented here betrayed not the slightest intention of giving any ground to Iraq and its conditional offer to withdraw from Kuwait. They reaffirmed indirectly, but forcefully, that those countries who stood with Iraq in the Arab world, as well as the Palestine Liberation Organization, would be punished by being deprived of financial aid.   In a communique, the eight countries -- Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and the exiled Kuwaiti Government -- expressed their \\"extreme sadness for what is happening to the two innocent peoples of Kuwait and Iraq because of the continuing occupation of Kuwait by Iraq.\\" But they left little doubt they favor a continuation of the Persian Gulf war until the total defeat of President Saddam Hussein. 'No Comfort' for Hussein     \\"Saddam Hussein can take absolutely no comfort from what transpired here,\\" said Abdallah Yaacoub Bishara, the secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which groups all the Arab oil producers at war with Iraq.   Several ministers and other senior officials also showed a deliberately cold attitude towards the P.L.O. and its leader, Yasir Arafat, when they underlined that their commitment to the Palestinians is limited to their cause, not the organization's leadership.    \\"There is no change in regards to safeguarding the rights of the Palestinian people but that cannot be attached to this Palestinian leader or that Palestinian leader,\\" said Syria's Foreign Minister. Farouk Al Shara.   Mr. Shara, speaking at a news conference after the meeting, said that the United States and the European Community had given \\"repeated assurances\\" to Syria that they will turn their attention after the gulf war toward resolving the 40-year-long Arab-Israeli conflict. Arab Peacekeepers Not Discussed     The Arab ministers, however, said little about future mutual security plans to insure the region against further upheavals. They declined to discuss whether an Arab peacekeeping force would be stationed permanently in the gulf or what amounts of money would be set aside to further the economic development of the poorer Arab countries, like Egypt and Syria, who are members of the anti-Iraqi coaltion.   Arab Gulf officials indicated they resisted \\"being pinned down on a number\\" on financial aid, said one such official who asked not to be identified. \\"We wanted to preserve the flexibility of tying our aid directly to our national interest,\\" the official added.    Instead, the coalition said that \\"cooperation and coordination\\" will be open to \\"all Arab countries\\" provided they choose to \\"adhere with the principles and goals\\" that prevail among the coalition members.   In other words, senior officials from the Arab coaliltion explained, countries like Jordan, Algeria, Tunisia, and Yemen, as well as the P.L.O., which are aligned with Iraq and hostile to the coalition, stand little chance of benefitting from Arab generosity once the gulf war is over. Goals and Principles Outlined     The rough outlines of the principles and goals of the coalition in the future were described in the final statement of the meeting.   The countries said they would like a new Arab order to be based on principles that include the Arab League's \\"mutual defense treaty,\\" which prevents the use of force by any member against the other and the resolution of disputes by \\"peaceful negotiations.\\"   It also said the \\"concept of collective Arab security will be part and parcel of international security and peace,\\" suggesting that the United Nations will remain the final arbitrer of disputes.    The communique asserted the necessity of \\"respecting the sovereignty of each Arab country over its own natural resources,\\" thus dismissing any notion that Arab oil wealth must be shared by all Arabs.    The eight countries said they will meet again in Damascus on March 5.

Failed romance shoves him back to Beirut, where he caroms between scenes of death in an unhappiness of global scale. Remarkably, this unpromising plot takes on life in the hands of James Buchan, a former Middle East correspondent for The Financial Times. It is a pale kind of life, though, peopled by Chelsea trendies and their parents, none sketched with more than two or three lines","excerpt":"Arab fighters, drivers and hoteliers who sound too much alike in their flowery speech; old British spook types who leave so much to the imagination that we aren't sure, two pages thence, whether we really met them at all.

The problem is that we are unbound, too, from almost everyone who scurries through these chapters. We have only hints of past pain in the life of his lover, his ''dream tart,'' Mary Mark; we are not even quite clear what she looks like; he wants her but we are not sure why; she comes to grief, but do we care?

This action seems to me, as an American of Japanese ancestry, similar to developments that led to the tragedy of the Japanese-American internment in 1942. It is all the more ominous in light of a draft paper by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, leaked a couple of years ago, that proposed rounding up and interning Arab-Americans in the event of a national emergency.   The F.B.I. is casting unwarranted suspicion on Arab-American business and community leaders who have nothing to do with terrorism. Law enforcement officials around the country have not found any evidence linking any Arab-American to terrorist activity.   Arab-American organizations have reported a growing number of threats and violent acts against Arab-Americans since Iraq's Aug. 3 invasion of Kuwait. Instead of targeting Arab-Americans, the F.B.I. should be investigating those who have been victims in the many unprovoked attacks against Arab-Americans around the country. A few years ago, Alex Odeh was killed when a bomb exploded in the Los Angeles office of the Arab-American organization of which he was an officer, yet the terrorists behind that crime have never been brought to justice.   F.B.I. and Justice Department officials are sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution and the laws of the land, including civil rights laws. They should not use the threat of terrorism or war as a justification to single out a group based on ancestry, and then violate or threaten to violate their fundamental rights.
