Somerset Maugham play and the Columbia picture from which this yarn is derived—was a tag which would be too blatant a tip-off. It is no breach of etiquette, however, to reveal that \\"Three for the Show\\" is built on the major premise that the confusion of a curvaceous Broadway musical comedy star on finding herself confronted by two husbands would be continuously hilarious.Unfortunately it is a situation that is less than uproarious. There also is the minor premise that there is no business like show business. What one sees of show business here is spirited stuff but it is not aided by the stickiness of the major premise.The rather transparent plot presents our heroine as the wife of her dancing partner, taking bows on stage at the conclusion of a long-run musical. At this point, husband number one, a flier who had been reported dead by the Air Force, turns up to confound the lady. She is distraught, the script says, because she loves both lads and can't make up her mind. Strangely enough, who gets whom is not an intriguing matter despite a few whacky situations and some earnest and energetic portrayals.However, \\"Three for the Show\\" does serve to bring Betty Grable back to the screen. Luminously blonde and shapely enough to give the megrims to most of the readers of fan magazines, Miss Grable proves she can fill a musical, assignment as neatly as she does her pleasantly revealing wardrobe. She acquits herself in polished style in a dream sequence involving a male harem","excerpt":"in a torrid, Caribbean-type fandango to the sensuous rhythms of \\"How Come You Do Me Like You Do,\\" and to the strains of George and Ira Gershwin's \\"I've Got a Crush on You.\\"As her husbands, Jack Lemmon, the Air Force lieutenant, and Gower Champion, the hoofer, manfully charge through some mildly humorous capers. Mr. Lemmon, a comic who is not uneasy with a quip, does not have too many bright ones tossed his way. Mr. Champion does have the opportunity to do justice to several dance numbers with Marge Champion, who plays a pert dancer wistfully waiting to catch either gent on the rebound.It should be noted also that they team gracefully in an imaginative number—a colorful waltz ballet done to some classic music and the Gershwins' \\"Someone to Watch Over Me.\\" Myron McCormick, as the wily producer of the show, contributes a smooth performance in what is basically a small role.The plot with which they're all concerned is not impressive either.

Their cuts would profoundly reshape government operations, effectively repudiating the activist role pursued by Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, and Thomas Kean, his Repubican predecessor.   And by keeping their proposal secret until the last minute, they have regrettably foreclosed any serious public debate. Under the State Constitution, a balanced budget must be passed and signed by July 1. The prospective deficit in the $15.7 billion budget for the new year is $1.4 billion -- more than half of it because the Republicans have already cut a penny off the sales tax. With veto-proof majorities in both houses, they have the muscle to enact a spending plan, as they did the tax cut, over a veto.   The Republicans took control of the legislature last November when voters rebelled against big tax increases Mr. Florio put through the year before. It's no secret that the Republican aim to dismantle much of what Mr. Florio has achieved","excerpt":"in addition to budget and tax cuts, for instance, they want to repeal his gun control legislation and dilute state aid to needy schools.   Their budget proposals are a mixed bag. They deserve credit for tackling the sensitive issue of property tax rebates, in which the state mails yearly checks -- just before Election Day -- to homeowners and renters as a partial offset to local property taxes. Without admitting it, the Republicans would raise property taxes by reducing rebates. For the average resident, the increase would exceed any benefits from the sales tax cut.   There is also room for some of the proposed cutbacks in middle management -- although officials say the cuts would be much more severe than the Republicans advertise. More ominous, the cuts wouild threaten services for the poor. The Department of Human Services would take a $190 million hit and the Office of Public Advocate, which represents consumer interests, would be virtually eliminated.   The Republican's failure to cut extra state aid to the populous northern counties is blatantly self-serving. They criticized this aid when those counties were represented largely by Democrats. With Republicans in more of those seats now, the program escapes their ax.   The Republicans worsened this year's problems by trimming the sales tax, and then cheated the public by delay in disclosing their Draconian spending cuts.

Judges decide how well a skier tackles the moguls (50 percent of his score) and the air of the jump (25 percent) and then his total time (another 25 percent).

From moment to moment, as it follows Johnny and Sarah Sullivan (Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton, both quietly terrific) through their daily struggles, the story feels small, almost anecdotal. But just as its tactful realism is adorned with a dusting of magic, its unassuming clarity hides an unexpected grandeur. It is the kind of movie that keeps growing in your mind long after you ve seen it, and its characters are so radiantly particular that they come, after a while, to seem like people you know. — A. O.

Sexual tension, waste, bigotry and violence underlie their luxurious-looking surfaces, along with a gnawing estrangement from nature: in this case, mostly the desert landscape around Las Vegas, where Ms. Taylor grew up. Couples and small groups of people embody fractured, ambiguous relationships in her carefully constructed marquetry ''paintings.'' The technique, inspired by Florentine marble inlay work, was developed for luxury cabinet-making in Antwerp, Belgium, in the early 17th century. Ms. Taylor does all the inlay herself. Amid a charmingly abstracted desert landscape a couple sit apart in silence, drinking beer as the sun sets","excerpt":"in another work two boys hunt deer with rifles on the fringe of a subdivision from the ease of their sport utility vehicle. Beige, umber and brownish wood veneer -- some of it exotically colored and all extra-grainy -- is skillfully combined in another painting (above) to pick out the contours of the human body, as two women and a boy frolic in swimsuits beside an empty swimming pool in the midst of an affluent desert exurb. Who are these people, and what is their relationship to one another? The work, once again, hides an inner world of tension and unspoken desires.

In these taut, powerful short stories, children operate in a secret world of their own, parents seem well meaning but ineffectual, and violence erupts without warning. In one story, ''The Isabel Fish,'' a car accident kills a spirited teenager","excerpt":"in another, ''Stations of the Cross,'' a child binds and beats her cousin in an enactment of the Crucifixion. Orringer (at right) handles adolescent grief and alienation with subtlety. ''The harsh landscape in which Orringer's characters dwell corresponds to the fierce beauty of her writing,'' Lisa Dierbeck wrote in the Book Review. In the 11 thematically linked stories in Hannah Tinti's ANIMAL CRACKERS (Delta, $12), animals are the unwitting repositories of human desires and fears (in the title story a zoo employee commits suicide with the help of an elephant).    CHIANG KAI-SHEK: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost, by Jonathan Fenby. (Carroll & Graf, $17.95.) Fenby, a former editor of the South China Morning Post, gives a comprehensive and accessible summary of Chiang's life (1887-1975): his emergence in the 1920's as one of the Nationalist Party's leading generals; his drive to exterminate Communist organizations while resisting Japanese imperial expansion; and his eventual defeat at the hands of Mao Zedong's Red Army.    KINGS OF INFINITE SPACE, by James Hynes. (Picador, $14.) Hynes's previous novels have satirized academia; here he skewers the office. His hero, a fallen English professor, is reduced to temping for the Texas Department of General Services, thrust into peculiar territory that includes spectral office workers and an eerie corpse in the next cubicle.    BUSHWORLD: Enter at Your Own Risk, by Maureen Dowd. (Berkley, $15.) Through the lenses of pop culture and pop psychology, Dowd, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The New York Times, dissects the Bushes with a combination of personal affection and professional contempt. In these columns, written mostly during George W. Bush's first term, Dowd casts the 2000 presidential election as an Oedipal drama, describes a visit to the lingerie section of a department store in Riyadh and compares the Kennedy and Bush clans. BOY GENIUS: Karl Rove, the Architect of George W. Bush's Remarkable Political Triumphs (PublicAffairs, $16.95), by Carl M. Cannon, Lou Dubose and Jan Reid, examines the tactics of President Bush's policy adviser, a political operative as gifted in devising policies as in selling them.    THE MAN IN MY BASEMENT, by Walter Mosley. (Back Bay/ Little, Brown, $13.95.) Mosley, author of the Easy Rawlins mysteries, conjures an unsettling novel about the gamesmanship between a black man living in his family's old house and the strange white man occupying a nine-by-nine-foot iron cage in his basement.    CELESTIAL HARMONIES, by Peter Esterhazy. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $16.95.) The scion of an ancient line of Hungarian nobles, Esterhazy chronicles his family's rise and fall in this unconventional narrative. The book's opening section comprises 371 passages linked loosely by association in the author's memory. The second half of the book focuses on the Esterhazys in the 20th century. Our reviewer, Neil Bermel, said there are ''acutely observed moments from the author's childhood that neatly interweave the surrealism of life under Communism with the development of his own creative urge.''    GETTING PERSONAL: Selected Writings, by Phillip Lopate. (Basic Books, $15.) Described by the author as ''the informal version of the autobiography'' he never got around to writing, this engaging miscellany spans Lopate's career as an essayist, novelist and poet, and captures scenes from his discordant Jewish home in Brooklyn in the 1950's. Charlie LeDuff's WORK AND OTHER SINS: Life in New York City and Thereabouts (Penguin, $15) is a blunt and touching assortment of articles, written for The Times, that portray a city of faltering dreams, sadness and wit, often expressed in the crowded bars of Brooklyn and Manhattan.    WHY WE LOVE: The Nature and Chemistry of Romantic Love, by Helen Fisher. (Owl/Holt, $15.) An anthropologist presents findings, drawn from six years of research into human and animal behavior, that suggest romantic passion is chemically hard-wired into our brains.

One photograph, of cell-lined hallways radiating from a central area, is based on the design of the Eastern State Penitentiary, a famed prison in Philadelphia that was closed in the 1960's. Mr. Casebere's re-creation of it is exact, down to the whitewashed chunks of debris strewn across the floor.   In recent years, Mr. Casebere seems to have been pointing toward a kind of absolute zero of architecture. From models of suburban town houses, he has moved to generic structures, whether a Spanish courtyard or a ranch-house kitchen, all presented as collections of utterly featureless white shapes.   In the cells he has found a subject whose form in the world has the same reduced structure that he imposed on the scenes in his earlier work. They suggest Platonic ideas of rooms, rather than actual places; they are spaces created by and for the mind, not the body. As such, they are both transcendent and chilling.

Art in Review"},{"year":"1990","title":"Despite hundreds of illuminating exhibitions, books and magazine articles, postwar European art still harbors many artists who deserve wider recognition in this country. One of them is the Italian Alighiero e Boetti, currently the subject of an exhibition at the Salvatore Ala Gallery in SoHo. Mr. Boetti is not entirely unknown in this country. His work has been included in one group exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art and another at P.S. 1 in Queens, and he has had four one-man gallery shows in New York City since 1975. But the Ala Gallery's charming if somewhat piecemeal exhibition, which includes 18 works dating from 1965 to 1989, is his largest and most impressive showing yet. It conveys much of the freshness of a new discovery.   Mr. Boetti has adopted the Italian word for \\"and\\" as his middle name, presenting himself as a one-man artist team (as in Gilbert and George), while also implying a pair of all-encompassing opposites (as in heaven and hell). Both suggestions have a bearing on his art, which involves frequent collaborators and has a global reach, as well as a playfulness that can be childlike, provocative and delighfully eccentric.    These qualities are perhaps best summed up in the lush-surfaced tapestries of embroidered silk that, beginning in the early 1970's, he has had woven by craftsmen in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Some of them are colorful maps of the world in which the shape of each country is occupied, as nearly as possible, by the motif of its national flag. This strategy translates the national differences that alternately enliven and plague the planet into the purely decorative terms of tapestry -- where they look extremely arbitrary and somewhat frivolous.  One map is aptly titled \\"Life's Nonsensical Course.\\"   Another embroidered work, \\"Order/Disorder,\\" consists of 99 tiny tapestries, each spelling out the phrase \\"order and disorder\\" in bright toy-like blocks of woven color that change position from panel to panel as if illustrating the work's very title.   Although associated with the Italian Arte Povera artists in the late 60's and early 70's, Mr. Boetti's own art lacks their robust contrasts of unusual, frequently organic materials. His materials are far from usual but, as the stitches on his embroideries suggest, he seems to want his artworks to be composed of units that are as tiny and delicate as possible.  The result is an art of surprising tenderness. (Characterisically, \\"Zig-Zag,\\" a small sculpture that is the earliest work in the show, builds on the hard-headed tenets of Minimalism by way of colored ribbons.)    Some other tiny units that Mr. Boetti has drafted into service include the Afghan postage stamps on 720 airmail envelopes that the artist sent to a friend in Turin in 1973 and 74, paper doilies that he piled into four tall columns in 1968 and, perhaps most impressively, the humble marks of a ballpoint pen that he built into fields of blue deep as the night sky in \\"Bringing the World Into the World\\" in the late 70's. In all these works, artistic time and space are measured in a series of deceptively simple tasks that repeat and repeat until something quite extraordinary results.    The peripatetic nature of Mr. Boetti's art, which moves from one material to the next without yielding a traditionally coherent body of work, may make his achievement difficult to appreciate, accounting for his lack of recognition in this country. But in many ways, his best efforts seem ahead of their time, presaging the current fascination with craft, multi-culturality and unusual methods of fabrication. His art attempts to span several spheres -- East and West, art and craft, the poetic and the mundane -- by offering ample proof that these opposites are but two sides of the same coin.    Alighiero e Boetti's work remains at the Salvatore Ala Gallery, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, through Dec. 15.  Rebecca Horn  Marian Goodman Gallery 24 West 57th Street Through Dec. 8     Rebecca Horn's latest installation work, \\"Amerika,\\" is, as usual, an amalgam of suggestive images on the move, of poetry literally in motion. Its several parts include a ticking metronome, a flying suitcase, an umbrella tapping out rhythms on the floor, and a pair of black shoes rotating atop a small pile of coal, first pointing toward a wall labeled \\"New York\\" and then toward its opposite, labeled \\"Vienna.\\" The shoes turn beneath a pair of binoculars suspended from the ceiling, and above these, the snake-like copper rods that figure into many of Ms. Horn's works hiss regularly with sparks of electricity, like a mind thinking exciting thoughts.    In the spaces between these props there hovers the tale of a refugee fleeing Europe, which is, of course, one of the main themes of Franz Kafka's \\"Amerika.\\" It helps that the gallery's windows have been roughly painted white, creating a timeless, placeless space -- a train depot, an insane asylum, a factory. High on the Vienna wall, a violin seems about to strike up a waltz, but its mechanical apparatus shrugs its shoulders ceaselessly in defeat. This and the tapping umbrella are the most affecting gestures in this forlorn and affecting work.    When Ms. Horn's efforts do not involve mechanized movement, as in a series of wall pieces exhibited in a second gallery at Goodman, powerful effect changes to mere affectation. Isolating endearing discarded objects like old spools of thread or binocular cases in (and on) handsome glass and steel cases, these pieces succumb to the sentimentality that plagues most assemblage. Unfortunately, they also somewhat dampen one's enthusiasm for \\"Amerika.\\"  'New Photography 6'  The Museum of Modern Art 11 West 53d Street Through Jan. 8    The notion of the new at work in the sixth \\"New Photography\\" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art is cautious and restrictive, defined primarily in terms of the old. The three artists introduced in this show have been selected by John Szarkowski, the photography department's director. While their work is competent and sincere, it fills familiar esthethic slots in depressingly unadventurous ways.    Paul D'Amato's particular version of street photography takes him to the byways and back alleys of working-class America, where he concentrates on color images of children and adolescents. One photograph shows a little girl sitting in a shopping cart in a trash dump, her mouth open in a silent scream","excerpt":"in another, a little boy with stone-cold eyes fingers a popgun. The truth of the harsh life that Mr. D'Amato captures is undeniable, and he approaches it from many angles. But the style with which he depicts it vacillates too neatly between Diane Arbus's sense of freakishness and Helen Leavitt's sense of spontaneity, ritual and human dignity.    JoAnn Verburg's color photographs are sensitive meditations on domestic quiet. Their main subject is a man who appears to be the artist's lover or husband. Their colors are carefully cued to one another, as when the man is shown wearing a pink T-shirt and reclining on a bed with pink floral-print sheets. The same man, naked and sweaty, is photographed from the waist up in one color image, lying on a different bed in another, and up close in a work that consists of three nearly identical black-and-white portraits. Ms. Verburg's concentration on a passive male subject could be said to reverse the traditional formula of male photographer-female subject, but aside from that, her work offers little in the way of individuality.    Carl Pope's large gelatin-silver prints have the familiar, hands-on immediacy of much physically manipulated photography, from Barbara Ess to the Starn Twins. His images are large and unframed. In the patronizing \\"Best Picture of My Career\\" they are pasted together and include the sprockets at the film's edges, with a scrawled message at one edge relating the story of the work's genesis.   Most images show the faces of men, women and children in shadowy, distorted close-ups that lack distinguishing characteristics and emotions. The label announces they are from the artist's \\"Homeless Series,\\" thus giving Mr. Pope's self-indulgent formal devices a semblance of social purpose. The best image, titled \\"Stairwell,\\" simply depicts a naked lightbulb at the top and an exit sign at the bottom, implying a vertiginous plunge down unseen stairs.    According to the show's press release, Mr. Szarkowski initiated the \\"New Photography\\" series to present artists whose work \\"seems to represent the most interesting achievements of recent photography.\\" The artists in this exhibition have a long way to go before the work meets that standard.

Pelevin ''belongs to one strand of the great Russian tradition . . . in which metaphysical intuitions about the mystery of existence clash with the grotesque banalities of life,'' Richard Lourie said here in 1999.    GIPSY MOTH CIRCLES THE WORLD, by Francis Chichester. (International Marine/McGraw-Hill, $12.95.)

Eight months later his boat was recovered with no one on board, but the writings found in his cabin revealed that he never left the Atlantic and his entire voyage was a fraud. This 1970 account by two British journalists is ''a virtuoso demonstration of the soul's anatomy,'' Edward B. Garside said here.

Weaving together a profile of a self-made woodsman, hunter and visionary utopian named Eustace Conway and a study of the American preoccupation with frontier-style manliness, the author conjures a hugely competent hero who is crippled by his inability to relate to a world of different voices. Last year in these pages, James Gorman found this a ''wickedly well-written and finally pain-filled biography'' about a flawed man whose ''accomplishments . . . joy and vigor seem almost miraculous.''

Now comes the Japanese version, Cop Festival -- an ever-growing collection of films by a rotating cast of directors who, like the Dogmatists, want to get back to basics. Unlike the Dogmatists, though, they want to have fun in the process. The basic rules for a Cop Festival film: it must be about a cop, it must not exceed 10 minutes and it must have a gag every 60 seconds. ''This is not low-budget film, but no-budget film,'' the director Makoto Shinozaki, who originated the project, said by e-mail from Tokyo. Two Cop Festival anthologies are to be shown this week in the New York Video Festival at Lincoln Center.    Cop Festival began after Mr. Shinozaki was asked to show one of his feature films at a Tokyo theater in 2002. He couldn't obtain a print and offered to make a short to be screened instead. Friends like the director Kiyoshi Kurosawa joined in, and one short became a collection of 10, by 10 different directors. They chose cops as a theme, Mr. Shinozaki said, ''because it is easier to set the films in various situations, it doesn't cost much for costumes and policemen are easily recognized as symbols.'' There are now eight Cop Festival collections, with a total of 67 short films. In addition to the three general rules, each omnibus has its own regulations: in one, the cops had to be played by the same actor","excerpt":"in another, they had to be female. In the films being shown at Lincoln Center, viewers will see a female cop chase a robber while shooting at him with increasingly large pieces of ordnance that she pulls out of her stylish black raincoat; a cop killing criminals in a postcoital frenzy; and a toy elephant cop who interrogates suspects while sitting in the palms of their hands.    Financed entirely by the directors -- who have also included recognizable names like Shinji Aoyama and Hirokazu Koreeda -- the movies can be by turns stylish and sophomoric, stupid and charming. ''Some are shot very seriously and some are very loose,'' said Mr. Shinozki, who said his own favorite cop film was ''The New Centurions'' with George C. Scott, from 1972. ''I cannot really talk about the general level of them,'' he added, ''but I can say one thing: high-budget and high-quality films are not necessarily good films.''

The peril was underscored by the disappearance last week of the CBS correspondent Bob Simon and three members of his television crew near the Kuwaiti border. And the ungrateful reception was reflected in White House displeasure with reports from Baghdad by Peter Arnett of CNN, the only correspondent for a U.S. news organization still in that city.   However limited and one-sided Mr. Arnett's accounts from Iraq must necessarily be, the White House ignores the value in such independent reports of what its adversary wants the world to believe. Mr. Arnett won a Pulitzer Prize in Vietnam. He knows the chaos of war, and how to cope with propaganda. His coverage is subject to censorship, as he repeatedly reminds CNN viewers. But his accounts of what he is and isn't shown are valuable supplements to the allied version of the war.    Despite heavy bombing, civilian casualties have not been extensive, or so it would appear from the limited damage that Mr. Arnett has reported. A week ago he was taken on a tour of a devastated \\"baby formula\\" factory that the White House contends is a biological weapons plant. If so, then allied targeters should welcome evidence of their accuracy","excerpt":"in any case, his viewers were amply warned not to take Baghdad's version at face value.    It takes more than average courage to remain in a hostile capital, risking death from friendly fire or arrest by an obsessively suspicious host.

His title, ''Flaws in the Glass,'' is a declaration at the outset that the mirror by means of which the self-portrait is drawn is at best a faulty device. In one of the many houses where the Whites lived during the author's childhood, there was a ''Long Room'' with at one end a ''great gilded mirror, all blotches and dimples and ripples.''

Having managed it, however, he took his opposition role seriously, and board proceedings were often acrimonious in consequence.

It was not positively disreputable to be a Democrat before 1960, but in the prevailingly conservative northern suburbs it was unusual. The county, after all, had always been governed by the Republican Party; for that matter, there was no sharp break in political philosophy between the officials of the early 20th century and the Tories who were a sizable majority in the late 18th century. Waves of migration after both world wars brought Democrats in strength to Westchester, but many changed their affiliation when they got here.

Now the commission is re-examining those estimates, and Suffolk, in an unusually conciliatory gesture, has said that if the figures for the anticipated radiation release are cut, the county would have to ''re-examine'' its belief that a 20-mile emergency planning zone is warranted. The commission requires a 10-mile zone, but speculation in the industry is that this radius could be cut after the new estimates are released, an often delayed event now scheduled for the spring of 1985. The re-estimate is given high priority by the agency, which budgeted $35 million for the job in the last fiscal year.   The possibility of a change in the county's position makes the new estimate a key issue for Shoreham. It appears, in addition, that the county has become much more receptive to a change in the estimate","excerpt":"in April, Frank Jones, then the deputy county executive with responsibility for the matter, derided the suggestion by saying: ''It sounds like molasses and marshmallows are going to come out of that plant.

Now he has come back with his own company from Moscow, the Russian Ballet, in which he has assembled some new and outstanding young Soviet dancers.   There are only a few days, through Sunday, to catch the troupe in Atlantic City, where it has been performing since mid-September at the Copa Room theater in the Sands Hotel.    There is more than curiosity value here, although viewers who saw the American film about the Kirov Ballet school entitled \\"The Children of Theater Street\\" (1978) will be pleased to learn that its real-life little heroine, Anzhelina Armeyskaya, has lost none of the charm she had as a child. As obvious from her performance on Sunday afternoon with Mr. Gordeyev's group in an excerpt from \\"La Sylphide,\\" she has grown up into a happily exquisite dancer.   Mr. Gordeyev has also taken in two recent prize winners: Yelena Knyazkova, who won the top award at the International Ballet Competition this year in Varna, Bulgaria, and Yana Kazantseva, who won first prize and another award, the Vaganova Prize, at a Soviet competition in 1988, the Leningrad Young Dancers Competition. Her partner and husband, the 22-year-old Andrei Ryabov, is a real find: very tall, very blond, a true danseur noble but with a new contemporary boldness that avoids the old-fashioned mien still found among some Soviet male dancers.    The idea of performing excerpts from the usual chestnuts in 19th-century ballet next to a casino setting is not as bizarre as it could be. The waitresses in scanty outfits show no more leg than is apparent onstage, and the audiences at the tables were highly appreciative.   The Russian Ballet is the successor troupe to the Moscow Ballet, which was founded in 1979 and which Mr. Gordeyev headed as artistic director when it toured the United States in 1987. At that time, the troupe was heavy on guest artists from other Soviet companies and although individual performers made an excellent impression, it had the look of a pickup touring company.   Although Mr. Gordeyev has kept a few of the same dancers, the Russian Ballet is, for all intents and purposes, a new troupe and more cohesive in style.    Mr. Gordeyev, Miss Knyazkova and her partner, Oleg Kozlov, did not dance at the Sunday matinee (performances tomorrow through Saturday are at 8 P.M. and at 4 and 8 P.M. on Sunday). But those who did made a fine showing, although some of the traditional divertissements, including the Grand Pas from \\"Paquita,\\" were shown in abbreviated form.   Yuri Zastrozhnev partnered the statuesque Natalya Trokai, properly confident in her elongated line here while the corps had both unity and energy. Miss Armeyskaya and Nikolai Smirnov then did surprisingly well in excerpts from a Danish ballet well outside the Russian tradition. They danced the pas de deux and solos from Act II of August Bournonville's \\"Sylphide\\" with the special attention to the arm positions of the Bournonville style. Mr. Smirnov's leg beats in his entrechats were amazingly high and open. Miss Armeyskaya recalled Carla Fracci's famous ethereality in the title role, and it was not surprising to hear afterward that she had in fact studied Miss Fracci's interpretation on tape.    Miss Trokai returned for a particularly dramatic rendering as the tormented gypsy in the excerpt from \\"Esmeralda\\" made familiar in in recent years by Altynai Assylmuratova of the Kirov. Miss Trokai is not as moving, but her tambourine pas de deux with Yevgeny Amosov, a stocky dancer who is surprisingly light in his leaps, was well danced.    Mr. Ryabov, partnering a solidly dancing Marina Bogdanova, was miscast in the \\"Corsaire\\" pas de deux, but the performance he and Miss Kazantseva offered in Vassily Vainonen's version of the adagio from \\"The Nutcracker\\" was breathtaking in its elegance. Both dancers are perfect in their body placement and they mix refinement and verve.   Mr. Gordeyev's version of the Gounod \\"Walpurgis Night\\" offered a somewhat tame orgy led by Sergei Ankudinov as a bravura Pan, and his contemporary duet to Argentine folk music, \\"Melody of Love,\\" banked mainly on acrobatics. It was a crowd pleaser nonetheless, saved by Irina Luzganova's performance, stunning in her long-limbed beauty and ably maneuvered into every lift by Mr. Zastrozhnev.    Miss Kazantseva and Vitaly Akhundov offered the \\"Don Quixote\\" pas de deux shortly before a medley of dancer in costumes from what looked like \\"Great Hits of the 19th Century\\" invaded the stage for an exuberant finale.

This new stance has lent an ironic coloring to the battle over the construction of two Seawolf nuclear submarines, which each cost nearly $2 billion. The Pentagon says there is no need to build the ships, which were designed to track the Soviet submarine fleet, because a hostile Soviet Navy no longer exists. But Connecticut's Senator Christopher J. Dodd and Representative Sam Gejdenson, both passionate liberals who spent much of the 1980's opposing the Reagan defense buildup, have coalesced a bloc of Democrats and New England Republicans to guarantee the Seawolf program.

Add to that a random sample of old magazine covers, and your list is almost complete.   It may not sound like much, but it's roughly comparable to the Egyptian material with which Edward Brovarski, assistant curator in the museum's Egyptian department, had to deal when preparing the Boston exhibition.

Travel"},{"year":"2006","title":"Antonio Carlos Jobim       Antonio Carlos Jobim grew famous through the first half of his life's work -- three-minute masterpieces he turned out by the dozen, into his 40's -- but it can be hard to get the full measure of him within them. Pop music is a mess of competing commercial interests, and the gifts of a great composer working in pop can be obscured. For some listeners, Jobim as composer has been overshadowed by the interpretations of João Gilberto, who originated voice-and-guitar bossa nova, remains the king of it and performs Jobim's songs so authoritatively that it can seem as if he wrote them. Many others know Jobim's work through Stan Getz's records in the early 60's, but those are Stan Getz records. Two of Jobim's most famous albums were collaborations with Frank Sinatra (1967) and Elis Regina (1974)","excerpt":"in both cases, the other person was the superior singer and took the reins. But Jobim as composer, singer and musician comes through in a new three-disc reissue, ''The Prime of Antonio Carlos Jobim'' (DBK Works/Runt), incorporating three records he made for the American market between 1965 and 1967. Two of them, ''The Wonderful World of Antonio Carlos Jobim'' and ''A Certain Mr. Jobim,'' deserve new attention. Jobim composed songs fully, with a lot of harmony; the arrangers of these records, Nelson Riddle and Claus Ogerman respectively, don't intrude much on his vision. In both cases, the rhythm section is Brazilian, so it swings in the right way. Jobim sings shakily and in English, but this just humanizes his genius. And though he worried about being typecast as a South American bumpkin by playing guitar instead of piano on the records, he nailed that, too.    Gianluca Petrella       One of the challenges in current jazz is making studio records that break the mold of basic, what-you-hear-is-what-you-get, documentary-style affairs. (Perhaps it's better to say that it's a potential challenge, largely ignored.) European musicians are more up to this than Americans, and Gianluca Petrella, a young, adept Italian trombonist, has just raised the bar a bit. ''Indigo 4'' (Blue Note), his second album and his first American release, is a real jazz record, historically versed in Monk, Ellington and Sun Ra. There's swing, as well as individual identities in the quartet, and deft humor. But here and there, Mr. Petrella exercises subtle post-editing maneuvers: loops and sound effects and soft, glitchy, digital sounds. He keeps it simple, but it's an impressive move.    Das Oath       A great new self-titled EP by Das Oath, a band from New York and the Netherlands, sounds like hard-core punk as it was in the early 80's, but as only a few bands could muster it: it's musically confident but scraped down to basics, overdriven to the point of electrocution, the howled singing like a meditative drone. (I'm thinking Void, early Hüsker Dü, early Die Kreuzen.) It blasts through nine songs in 20 minutes, and that's all you need. (On Dim Mak Records, dimmak.com.)    Omer Avital       So we weren't crazy: finally, here's proof that Omer Avital's sextet, which played at Smalls to a small but deep following in the late 90's, really was good. ''Asking No Permission'' (Smalls Records), recorded there in 1996, is the first album to be released by that group. With Mr. Avital on bass, Ali Jackson on drums and four excellent tenor saxophonists (Mark Turner, Greg Tardy, Myron Walden and Charles Owens), the young band worked a lot and developed fast, dealing in a range of sounds from the World Saxophone Quartet to Warne Marsh to Ornette Coleman to early-60's Coltrane. For a little while, it was as good as any jazz group in New York, and Mr. Avital, in his mid-20's, wrote stronger tunes than those of many bandleaders with twice his experience. (Available from smallsrecords.com.)    Duke Ellington       Part of the pleasure of watching Duke Ellington on film is seeing how much he enjoyed working. In ''Ralph J. Gleason Celebrates Duke Ellington'' (Eagle Vision), a DVD combining two documentaries made in 1965 by Gleason, the San Francisco jazz critic, Ellington was 66 and still hyperproductive: writing loads of new music, working with his 15-piece band in clubs, making records with efficiency. The second documentary is a film of his first Sacred Concert; the first, ''Love You Madly,'' just tries to capture Ellington's ambient energy. In it he talks about deadlines as if they are his elixir; it's all a running boast, but his rap is beguiling. He wrote ''Black and Tan Fantasy,'' he claims, in a taxicab riding south through Central Park; ''Solitude'' was written ''in 20 minutes in Chicago standing up against a glass office enclosure waiting for another band to finish recording.'' But ''Sophisticated Lady,'' he admits, ''is one of the things I struggled with for a month.''    Prefuse 73       Guillermo Scott Herren, a producer, uses the name Prefuse 73 when he wants to make surreal hip-hop. ''Security Screenings'' (Warp) sounds as if it was made with a series of quick and deep strokes: it's a game of dream juxtapositions, but all the parts are well connected. Guitar, twinkling synth arpeggios, background tapes of talking and laughter, jazz-record samples, James Brown beats: Mr. Herren slices them all up mercilessly, making a different background for every single beat. What comes out is reconstituted, crazily hybrid, but still manages to flow; he doesn't abandon funk.

Bette Davis was the honored artist at the late evening show, at which was screened \\"Of Human Bondage,\\" in which she played with Leslie Howard in 1934, along with excerpts from three of her old pictures which she was said to have chosen as her \\"favorite moments in films.\\"Unfortunately, neither Miss Davis nor Mr. Keaton was able to attend. The capacity audiences at both screenings seemedd regretful but philosophical.It was too bad that Mr. Keaton could not have been there to hear the applause for the first of his new shorts and the howls of laughter at his old silent film. The experience would have been balm in Gilead for the too-long-neglected comedy star.The initial short shown on the program is a 22-minute item called \\"The Railroaders\\" and is nothing more than a film to promote railroad travel in Canada, produced by the National Film Board. By a neat and witty whimsey, it dumps Mr. Keaton aboard a railroad handcar sitting on a siding by the Atlantic Ocean, and starts out with him on a sightseeing tour (via the gasoline-driven handcar) to the Pacific Coast.But in following this unconventional journey along the clicking and singing tracks","excerpt":"in casually scanning the landscapes of cities, farmlands and mountains as they whiz by (beautifully photographed in color); and especially in describing Mr. K.'s ingenious and nonchalant devices for taking care of himself, this film comes as close to capturing the style and spirit of the Buster of bygone days, especially in his classic film, \\"The General,\\" as anything he has done in 35 years.Again he is the self-sufficient stoic, making the best of what fate or accident or just plain coincidence tosses in his way. Older, darker and more granitic than, for instance, the trim, smooth-faced young chap who races through \\"Seven Chances\\" with the agility of an acrobat, Mr. Keaton is here a happy reminder of the sad and silent loners he used to play. It is good to see him in this witty, charming picture, which has a particularly bright musical score.It is certainly better to see him in this one than in the 24-minute item, titled \\"Film,\\" which Alan Schneider has directed and for which Samuel Beckett, the absurdist, wrote the script. This is a miserable and morbid exercise, done entirely in pantomine, in which Mr. Keaton, still wearing his familiar flat hat and rumpled clothes, plays a gloomy, grotesque, eye-patched fellow who is alienated from society and from all God's creatures and even rejects himself.Most of the action is located in a barren and poorly lightly room in which this chimerical fellow, whose face we never see until the end, goes about tearing down pictures, banishinbg pet animals and putting covers over the parrot and the goldfish so they cannot look at him. It is a cruel bit of obvious symbolism in which to involve an old star who has given a lot of pleasure to millions of people, and who has since admitted that he didn't know what \\"Film\\" was all about.\\"Seven Chances,\\" the silent picture, made in 1925, is a typical jape in which Buster is a dudish but dolorous chap who has to get married by 7 o'clock this evening in order to receive a large inheritance. The whole last half (which is the better) is a wild and peril-fraught chase in which Buster is pursued by a pack of ferocious women who have answered an advertisement for someone to marry him. It shows more the athletic performer than the famous serio-comic character.\\"Of Human Bondage,\\" in which Miss Davis plays the cheap, treacherous waitress, drawn out of Somerset Maugham's popular novel, to the clubfooted medical student of Mr. Howard, looked distressingly prosy and dated to this nostalgic reviewer at the press screening yesterday. It is full of banal situations and what are now terrible cornball cliches. Certainly it does not pack the wallop it had 31 years ago.Better were brief scenes from \\"Dark Victory,\\" \\"All About Eve\\" and \\"Jezebel,\\" which were shown after \\"Of Human Bondage\\" and were pleasantly introduced by Geraldine Fitzgerald.

Tackling the highly sensitive and complicated issue of child custody, the film is powerfully acted, but its script, by Peter Nelson and Judd Kinberg, seems less interested in being coherent than in not offending anybody, specifically birth parents or their close relatives or foster parents.    Once again, viewers are assured that what they are about to see is based on a true story, in this instance a legal battle in Iowa during the late 1980's. But then there is an opening credit saying that the film is based on a story by Mr. Nelson. Is Mr. Nelson's \\"story\\" true? How far removed from the original story is the script?

He went on to Project No. 2 in his series career of spreading sunshine which has been recorded for all the world to see. That project consists in bringing affluence to a failing parochial school which is run by a sister superior who is nobler than she is worldly wise","excerpt":"in comforting this sister in illness and setting matters straight in several tattered lives. And it is imaged with humor and sentiment in \\"The Bells of St. Mary's,\\" at the Music Hall.In planning this project, however, Leo McCarey, who also planned \\"Going My Way,\\" yielded too much to the temptation of trying to copy a success. He followed too closely the pattern of his previous delightful film, with the basic exception of including a character of genuine scope. Father O'Malley is generally consistent (and played by Bing Crosby, what else could he be?) but Sister Benedict has not the veracity of her counterpart character which was played by Barry Fitzgerald. She is much too precisely sugar-coated, too eagerly contrived, and she goes in for certain gymnastics which are just on the edge of being cheap. As a consequence, \\"The Bells of St. Mary's,\\" although a plenteous and sometimes winning show, lacks the charm of its predecessor—and that comparison cannot be escaped.When Father Chuck is settling at St. Mary's to assume the vacant pastorate, there is humor and promise in his gentle and sly tiffs with Sister Benedict. There is sympathy in his patient guidance of a small girl who is put in the school by a suspiciously wayward mother, and there is warmth in his singing of some songs. (\\"Adeste Fidelis,\\" once over lightly, is the best and most seasonal of the lot.) There is likewise a cunning little episode—and the whole film is episodic, by the way—in which the children of Grade 1 put on their own Nativity play.But a sequence in which Sister Benedict teaches a turn-the-other-cheek lad to box is purely contrived theatrics, uncomfortably close to burlesque—as, indeed, are all the obvious sight-gags which fetch their laughs from the incongruity of an athletic nun. And the whole story-line developed toward the wheedling of a building for the school, with Henry Travers as the landlord who is wheedled, is unconvincing and vaguely immoral. The way that poor landlord is \\"pressured\\" into giving up his building is some stunt!In the role of Sister Benedict, Ingrid Bergman is exquisitely serene, radiantly beautiful and soft-spoken—the perfect picture of an idealized nun. And there are moments (NOT the close-up shot of her praying) in which she glows with a tenderness and warmth. But—more the script's fault than Miss Bergman's—her holiness smacks of Hollywood, and certainly she seems much too youthful to be the head of a parochial school.As Father Chuck, Mr. Crosby is—well, you know—the same easy, confident Bing, tossing off slangy jokes and soft-soap with the sincerity of a practiced hand. His penchant for gags in this picture—snappy sayings—is a little more pronounced. Maybe his truck with Tin Pan Alley, after writing that hit song, is to blame. It is noticeable that he hovers in the background a little more than he did in \\"Going My Way.\\" Mr. Travers is not well provided with a true role, and thus is under par, while Joan Carroll, Martha Sleeper and Ruth Donnelly are adequate in other parts.Considering the film's sectarian nature, the most amusing and critically pertinent remark is passed by Father O'Malley when a student named Luther is introduced to him. \\"Luther?\\" remarks the startled father, \\"How did he get in here?\\" Somehow that innocent question struck us as being quite acute.

The end of this long engagement with the excellent piano accompaniment of Wes McAfee, comes at a time when Miss Lea is putting a fine polish on an observant and probing singing career that has been developing, sometimes hesitantly, for 30 years. She has become one of the most knowledgeable interpreters and collectors of popular songs and her voice has grown to accommodate the increasingly demanding directions in which she has moved. Last Friday evening, which is her performing night through Jan. 24, her program included Lea interpretations of familiar songs, a little known Rodgers and Hart song (''Baby's Awake Now''), contemporary songs (''Twilight World,'' a moody, misty joint effort by Marion McPartland and Johnny Mercer), a song from Kurt Weill's unfinished musical version of ''Huckleberry Finn,'' as well as observations on the idiosyncrasies of singers, such as adding ''yuh'' to a line, as in ''I Loves You, Porgy -Yuh!'' Miss Lea resists stereotypes - she builds a sunny and surprisingly suitable sense of calm in the usually senuous ''Begin the Beguine'' and manages to create a real song out of the seemingly phony fluff of ''Limehouse Blues.'' Her voice, which has worn and husky overtones, opens up cleanly and fully when the occasion calls for it","excerpt":"in controlled, shaded fashion on ''I Never Has Seen Snow'' or rising to whooping exuberance in ''Applejack,'' a song of seduction by Weill and Maxwell Anderson.

A clash of cultures is explored in an episodic, meditative text written by David Henry Hwang and spoken by B. D. Wong, who plays the narrator and both the American man and the Japanese woman whose story is told here. Reviews/Television","excerpt":"In Dance, Enclosure Needn't Be a Limiting Factor"},{"year":"1968","title":"IF one had to film Thomas Mann's \\"Tonio Kröger\\" and be quite faithful to the text, then \\"Tonio Kröger\\" (screenplay by Mann's daughter, Erika), directed by Rolf Thiele (of \\"Rosemarie\\") and starring Jean-Claude Brialy of \\"The Cousins\\") would probably be the way to do it. But the project seems somehow worthy and unrewarding — like a film of \\"If,\\" or \\"Indian Love Call,\\" or the \\"Symposium.\\" Not every written thing aspires to be a movie.The problem is that hardly anything actually happens in \\"Tonio Kröger.\\" The young poet Kröger, son of a German merchant and what Mann describes as an \\"exotic\\" mother, travels to Italy, Germany and Denmark, where certain changes are brought about in him by the climate and by philosophical discussions with his Slavic mistress. The changes are all interior, psychological. What this amounts to on film is a series of close-ups within a travelogue.The plot, such as it is, is dreamily episodic. Kröger, who has been since childhood somewhat different from the blond, blue-eyed, ordinary children whom he at once loves and holds in contempt, is shown walking home from class","excerpt":"in dancing school; in bed with an Italian lady of the street; in conversation with his mistress in Munich; at home in Lübeck; en route to Denmark, and at sea with an inarticulate bourgeois who longs to express his thoughts about the infinity of stars and the littleness of man. By the end, Kröger has reconciled his middle-class and exotic origins in himself as a poet. This is hardly \\"The Guns of Navarone.\\"The shots of Munich, Lübeck spires, Italian courts, and Danish mists—all stills, essentially—are very handsome and stylized. The text by Thomas Mann, a good part of which is read by a narrator, is beautiful. (\\"After all, I am not a gypsy in a green wagon\\" is a lovely line, even in subtitles; so are many others.) Jean-Claude Brialy's face, in a Comédie-Française beard, registers suitable expressions of sensitivity, irony, and alienation (although the fact that he, speaking French, must be dubbed into German is rather distracting). Gert Frobe has a good, huffing walk-on as the police inspector who suspects Kröger is a thief who is also rumored to be on his way to Denmark.There is a nice shot of a train pulling out of a station, but the happy affinity of movies for trains has been quite throughly explored in other contexts, and this one seems almost a cinema postcard. There are some boys (like young Kröger and his schoolmates), who, presumably to avoid the miseries of child-overacting, say all their lines as though they had memorized them for class. And there are some awful improvements on the original. When Kröger goes downstairs to retrieve a poem that has drifted from his room into a courtyard (and comes upstairs again with a woman he has met), it is tolerable; but when, in a later scene, his poems blow out the window and turn into sea gulls, it is a bit much. There are several other misbegotten lyric touches.In the end, the movie, which opened yesterday at the 55th Street Playhouse, becomes something quite peculiar, a mere photo accompaniment to its own soundtrack. For people who do not understand German, reading the subtitles must be comparable, in effect, to reading Classic Comics; for those who can follow by ear, the effect is like that of so many illustrated lectures and readings aloud, a depressing. Sunday afternoon kind of boredom.

A year ago it was \\"Irene\\" which they were fetching out of moth balls","excerpt":"in December they jauntily brought forth a vague reflection of \\"No, No Nanette.\\" And now it is that charming old remembrance, the late Marilyn Miller's \\"Sunny,\\" which they are offering with considerable alteration at the Radio City Music Hall.Mr. Wilcox and Miss Neagle seem to have little respect for originals. All they are interested in is the music—and the titles, of course. And so they have twisted \\"Sunny\\" into a routine Cinderella tale about a beautiful circus performer who falls in love with a New Orleans aristocrat, runs into the usual frigid family but marries the gay blade in the end. It is a thoroughly conventional story without a single surprise.That, we regret to conclude, is the sort of thing we must expect from these two when they are wooing the musical comedy muse. Every single one of their revivals has been conventional, sweet and humorless. Miss Neagle is a very pretty person and a pleasant dancer when she chooses to shake a leg. But she can't sing worth a nickel, her charm always seems slightly forced and her old-fashioned musical comedy mannerisms tend to monotony. However, she fills the bill for family entertainment, which is what \\"Sunny\\" is.And then, of course, there is the music—those delightful Jerome Kern tunes such as \\"Sunny,\\" \\"Do You Love Me?\\" and the unforgettable \\"Who?\\"—which are played with decided affection and much variety. There are Ray Bolger dancing like a livewire, and the Hartmans, Grace and Paul, cutting up. There is also much elaborate décor which definitely fills the eye, for the picture is not simply set in New Orleans—oh, no! It is set in \\"New Orleans, the Crescent City of the Old South, where Rex, the king of mischief, reigns over Mardi Gras for one mad week.\\" You see, it talks a lot of gayety, anyhow.\\"Sunny\\" is as bright as a new penny and pretty nearly as flat.

While much of the world's concern about AIDS has focused on Africa, Asia and the United States, the rising number of infections in Latin America is prompting growing alarm about this region as well.

Some of the Orthodox Jewish press these days reads like Al Ahram in the 1950's, with weekly diatribes against Israel's leaders. What is encouraging is that a mainstream Jewish leader like Mr. Foxman has stepped forward to challenge this view. Polls show that two-thirds of American Jews support Mr. Rabin, but you would never know it listening to the tepid support he gets from some weak-kneed mainstream groups, like the Conference of Presidents.

In a latter-day variation of \\"The Corn Is Green,\\" with intimations of \\"Imitation of Life,\\" the playwright Enid Rudd appears to be embracing the transforming power of education and exploring the roots of prejudice. And she even gets around to acknowledging \\"the miracle of love.\\"   However, her writing is nowhere deft enough to support the weight or lighten the load of such noble concerns.   Rose Alcott, an 82-year-old Jewish woman who was a schoolteacher for 35 years, is dying of cancer and relives a life that she concedes \\"lacks a certain excitement.\\" However, it had gallantry to spare - and an ostensible search for honesty.   As the wife of a gentile fellow schoolteacher and the mentor of a black student, Rose never quite comes to terms with what her husband calls her \\"stiff, stern prejudice and morality.\\"   Near the end of her life, when the play could more aptly be called \\"The Other Side of Prejudice,\\" Rose is unable to accept the results and the rewards of the love - and the life - she has made possible for Dinah, her former student.   \\"You didn't have to end up by yourself,\\" Dinah, who is now her nurse, tells Rose.   What Ms. Rudd, who lives in West Orange, has come up with here is rather an old-style tear-jerker that doesn't quite work at that level, what with effects that derail the story and dilute its impact.   Repeated and finally pointless references to the changing face of Newark, from a picturesque town to a \\"boarded up, defaced by graffiti\\" slum, are more self-conscious than pertinent.   Acknowledging her repressions, her insularity and her bigotry (\\"I'm not at ease with Negro children,\\" she says) and perhaps just learning to live beyond her own cliches, Rose may have her most revelatory moment when she exclaims:   \\"I'd like someone to applaud!\\"   Here may be the line for the playwright to pursue - the unacknowledged rather than the overexamined life.   As Rose, Mary Martello puts on the air of the very proper stereotype of a schoolteacher, and the actress seems delighted by all chances for change.   Todd Michael Lewis offers stalwart support as Rose's husband, Alan. Julie Ellen Prusinowski's otherwise efficient direction cannot quite handle scene endings where dead spots are mistaken for dramatic ones. NEW BRUNSWICK IMAGINE the Saviour's Second Coming - to South Africa - by jet from Jerusalem. Such is the conceit of \\"Woza Albert!\\" which in 1980 evolved from improvisations by two black actors (Percy Mtwa and Mbongeni Ngema) and the added collaboration of the white director of the Johannesburg experimental Market Theater (Barney Simon).   The two-man piece, originally performed by Mr. Mtwa and Mr. Ngema in South Africa, Europe and the United States - including a 10-week Off Broadway run in 1984 - is in its New Jersey premiere engagement at the Crossroads Theatre Company here through next Sunday.   In what appears to be a revue within a play, two South African actors (in this production, Fana Kekana and Tsepo Mokone) depict laborers waiting for their passbooks and work permits. They pass the time by assuming different guises - sometimes sporting red rubber noses - and acting in more than 20 vignettes to portray the indignities of apartheid and the resilience of the human spirit.   Included in their gallery of characters are a white boss (\\"Push that truck!\\"), a television announcer (an especially sardonic turn by Mr. Mokone) and even Fidel Castro.   And all the while, the two men are waiting for Morena. Unlike Godot, Morena (which means Lord) does come to summon the spirits of the civil-rights crusaders Albert Luthuli (the Albert of the title, the \\"father of our nation\\" and the winner of the 1960 Nobel Peace Prize), Steve Biko (\\"the hero of our children\\") and Lillian Ngoyi (\\"She taught our mothers about freedom\\").   \\"People will sing and dance,\\" the actors proclaim, and this Mr. Kekana and Mr. Mokone do with extraordinary grace and glee, while satirically delivering such lines as \\"Enjoy the fruits of apartheid\\" and \\"Religion is no place to hide.\\"   As a piece of satire, though, \\"Woza Albert!\\" - woza means \\"rise\\" -fails. In structure, it is too rambling, overextended","excerpt":"in development, muddled.   The urgency and the impact of protest theater is missing. A fantastical wish-fullfilling premise is somehow too whimsical and contrived in its attempt at poignancy, and only the literal atrocities referred to really hit hard.   The real force of the piece is in the fervor of its performances, and here there is no faulting Mr. Kekana and Mr. Mokone.   In addition to the quicksilver changes of character, they create the sounds of trains, planes and a whole jazz band, and they move as nimbly as accomplished dancers, as joyously as the free spirits of their fantasies.   The actors convey the irony of how creative expression and performing energy can flower under the most confining adversity.   Mr. Ngema has since written and directed the theater collage \\"Asinamali!\\" and the musical \\"Sarafina!\\" now playing at Lincoln Center's Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater. Both are far more effective and cohesive theater works depicting the horrors of apartheid.

After election day, winners, in particular, prefer to put the sordid business of campaigning behind them and get on with the sordid business of governing. The election of 1990, however, brought out so many odd notions, weird statements and inglorious actions that it seems a shame to just stow them away.    There is more to campaigning than victory and defeat","excerpt":"in every election, there are winning moments, failures of nerve, losses of memory and appalling lapses of taste. There ought to be awards to commemorate those things that politicians prefer to forget and voters can't help but remember.  Apple Pie and Motherhood Award To Gov. James J. Blanchard of Michigan, who quietly pressured his 78-year- old Lieutenant Gover nor, Martha Griffiths, to get off the ticket. He said he was afraid she wouldn't be able to succeed him as Governor should the need arise. She, taking refuge in the eternal verities of politics, concluded: \\"You help some S.O.B. get what he wants and then he throws you out of the train.\\" Of Mr. Blanchard, she added, \\"He has a right to do what he wants to do. And after the election we'll see what he should have done.\\" Mr. Blanchard lost.  Most Money Raised in Nickels and Dimes Everyone laughed when Lawton Chiles said he would run on the cheap, accepting no more than $100 from each campaign donor. After all, the incumbent, Bob Martinez, was going after the big bucks and eventually raised 10 million of them. But all those little envelopes addressed \\"Lawton Chiles\\" added up. He amassed $7.5 million in this petty cash -- and he won. Most Machiavellian Moment Cynical Democrats in New York often say that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo likes having the Republican-controlled State Senate to blame for the state's failings. When he campaigned for Democratic State Senate candidates, they wondered, was his heart in it? Ask Cynthia F. Johnson. When the Governor showed up to campaign for her in Westchester, he wound up spending most of the time reciting the virtues of the incumbent -- Mary B. Goodhue, Republican. Biggest Opportunity Missed Democrats dithered while Representative Newt Gingrich's opponent, David Worley, begged for money. They begrudgingly came up with a measly $5,000. Why waste money on a candidate who couldn't possibly win against the House minority whip?  Candidate With the Most Audacity A tough call in a campaign where President Bush, stumping for the Republican candidate for Governor in Honolulu, renewed his pledge of no new taxes, saying he was \\"absolutely going to hold the line\\" -- a few weeks after agreeing to raise taxes during the budget summit. However, the winner is Marion S. Barry Jr., the former mayor of Washington,  D.C., an admitted addict who was convicted of drug possession. Campaigning for the City Council, he joined an anti-drug patrol for a night and donned a bright orange baseball cap emblazoned with the words, \\"dope fighter.\\" State Representative Ellis Levin of Illinois deserved an honorable mention: Mr. Levin ran ads saying that his reputation had \\"earned him special recognition by Chicago Magazine.\\" He had indeed -- for being one of the ten worst legislators.  Most Money Spent to Least Effect The prize goes to Clayton Williams, who spent $8 million dollars of his own money -- or $4.40 a vote -- in his $18 mil lion effort to become governor of Texas, which may explain why, as he conceded the race to the Democrat Ann Richards, his wife wept.  Wheel of Fortune Pierre A. Rinfret, the Republican candidate for Governor in New York, was nominated after 19 other potential candidates turned down the offer. Mr. Rinfret had his rendezvous with destiny when a friend of State Senator Roy M. Goodman came across his name -- in a Rolodex. America's Funniest Home Video Paul Wellstone, a college professor who was Minnesota's Democratic candidate for the Senate, could have got an Emmy for his witty TV commercials. In one, he pulled a \\"Roger and Me\\" against his opponent, the incumbent  Rudy Boschwitz, a Republican, by trooping with a camera to Boschwitz campaign headquarters, and St. Paul office, filming real-life secretaries and aides giving contradictory information about the Senator's whereabouts. He didn't receive any television awards; he merely unseated Mr. Boschwitz.  Biggest War Chest Representative Mel Levine, a California Democrat, had only token opposition. But that didn't keep him from raising money. The result? He ended the race with the most leftover cash of any member of Congress: $1.7 million. Look for him to use it in a bid to succeed Pete Wilson as Senator. Mr. Smith Leaves Washington Number of Smiths in the 101st Congress: 9. In the next Congress: 5. Cleanest Campaign The day before the vote, Senator David L. Boren, a Democrat who is a stickler for neatness, offered Oklahoma citizens 10 cents for every Boren for Senate campaign sign that they picked up and returned to his campaign offices. Those who returned bigger (3 by 4 feet) signs were awarded a dollar.  Oldest Candidate in the Campaign for U.S. Senate Strom Thurmond, 87. When he ends the term in 1997, he will be the oldest Senator in American history. Most Embarrassing Moment Dianne Feinstein was so nervous before her one gubernatorial debate with the Republican, Senator Pete Wilson, that she scribbled some answers in ballpoint on her hand. When her opponent mockingly accused her of \\"cribbing,\\" she explained that she hadn't secreted away \\"Archimedes's Principles.\\" She merely wanted to remember her campaign slogans: \\"education, growth and choice.\\" Best Soap Opera Di vorced spouses who air their grievances at in convenient times are hardly new in politics, but in Michigan, BOTH candidates for Gover nor were plagued with ex-wives who wrote kick-and-tell autobiographies. Paula Blanchard, the ex-wife of the Democratic incumbent James J. Blanchard, sold excerpts of her memoir to The Detroit News. Colleen Engler, wife of the Republican challenger, John Engler, showed more restraint, promising not to submit her manuscript until after the election. Her decision may have been more shrewd than generous. Now that her husband has won re-election, isn't the book worth much more?

Barrie's old play, \\"Quality Street,\\" in which Marion Davies as Phoebe Throssel gives the most conscientious performance of her film career. This picture was presented last night at the Embassy Theatre, and while its Old-World atmosphere and whimsicalities are the antithesis of the present age, it is a production with no little charm, even though the Barriesque phrases have not always been understood. It was adapted by Albert Lewin and Hans Kraely, two able scenarists, who have done remarkably well by turning a hint into a chapter, but their work does not always reflect Barrie. However, that which is missing will only be sensed by those who know the play well. There are quite a number of lines from the original stage effort which might have been incorporated in this film to its advantage. One wonders why no mention was made of the \\"sprigged poplin gown\\" and why Phoebe's favorite word \\"dashing\\" was not permitted tot decorate the screen once or twice.There are times when the players' movements are a little jerky and quick for the ancient modes","excerpt":"in fact it would have been preferable to reflect the subject at even a slower pace. Sidney Franklin, the director is nevertheless to be congratulated on this reproduction of a sort of English Pomander Walk romance of the Napoleonic days.The quaint street in the little English town is nicely staged and the up-to-date camera effects enhance the interest in this narrative of yore. There is Dr. Valentine Brown (Conrad Nagel), who realizes, according to Barrie, that he is a wit only in the blue and white room of the Throssels in Quality Street. Mr. Nagel is excellent in this rôle and he carries himself, whether in civilian clothes or in his uniform, without the slightest awkwardness. When bent on a mission he is wont to hasten his footsteps until he reaches 56 Quality Street, where, be it known, his reasons for calling are not always understood. When he is highly elated at having enlisted to fight the \\"Corsican Ogre.\\" Phoebe and her sister, Susan, take it for granted that he has come to ask for Phoebe's hand, for, not so long before, Phoebe was not quite sure whether he had kissed her.There are some amusing chapters of the school. Miss Davies here covers her ringlets with a white cap and on her nose are spectacles. This is supposed to make her plain, to show that she has lost her looks. After a lapse of something like a decade Captain Brown returns from the battlefields, and when he has let it be known that he thinks that Phoebe has aged, she turns the tables on him, while posing as her own niece, and makes fun of his few gray hairs. In the play the gallant warrior lost an arm, but in this picture he is permitted only to sustain a slash on his face.Miss Davies, after having thrown aside her cap and goggles, effects a change that is most impressive and one does not wonder that the saucy minx can make Captain Brown feel most ill at ease until he subsequently learns that Phoebe, for once in an imaginative mood, is having a lark at his expense.The brave Captain stalks down Quality Street, very much as if he had been one of Daisy Ashford's characters in \\"The Young Visitors.\\" He gives a rat-tat-tat with the knocker on the door of 56, and then he has his way of showing that he has discovered Phoebe's deception.It is a pity that the producers did not see their way clear to put in an incident or two about the recruiting sergeant—that is, in the way Barrie tells it in the story. It might also have been preferable to cling closer to the play in the schoolroom scenes, for Barrie's humor is much brighter than the comedy invented by the scenarists.But there are no fires, floods or any other kind of mad scenes in this film. It is an agreeable change, and one that was all the more appreciated after passing from the glare of the sun arcs on Broadway which the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer officials thought necessary to call attention to the portals of the theatre that harbored \\"Quality Street.\\" It was like going from a circus side-show into an old-fashioned parlor where they had antimacassars on the chairs.Helen Jerome Eddy is capital as Susan Throssel and Flora Finch does well as Mary Willoughby.

This picture was made abroad and, sad to relate, all the trouble taken in engaging players and a director from Hollywood, in constructing handsome settings and in photographing a lengthy sequence on the French Riviera does not prevent this picture from being quite tedious. The story is drawn out, the dialogue is frequently childish and Miss Swanson is by no means at her best","excerpt":"in fact there are moments when she speaks her lines very indistinctly, apparently for effect.Michael Farmer, Miss Swanson's husband, is entrusted with a minor rôle, and it cannot be said that he reveals any marked promise as an actor. John Halliday, usually one of the most reliable players, is called upon to speak with a foreign accent, which does not help his characterization. The best portrayal is that by Sir Nigel Playfair, who appears as an English nobleman. Nora Swinburne, a London actress, gives an adequate interpretation of a flirtatious wife whose audacity is startling. Laurence Olivier gives a sterling performance in a none too fortunate rôle.Cyril Gardner, the director, who has to his credit among other productions \\"The Royal Family of Broadway\\" and \\"Grumpy,\\" and who had a hand in the fashioning of \\"The Doomed Battalion,\\" acquits himself favorably in sections of the production, but some interludes are too prolonged, and in others the attempt at comedy falls rather flat.Miss Swanson impersonates Judy, who marries Nicholas Randall (Mr. Olivier). It is Judy's idea that jealousy is senseless and that any couple who really love each other can always reach a perfect understanding. In course of time she decides that this is a fallacy, for Nicholas falls a victim to the wiles of an old flame while his wife is away, and when he tells Judy about it, she is as jealous as any other wife might be. Also she is disappointed in her young husband. Judy, feeling that what's sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose, visits her friend, Ivan Ronnson, a foreign explorer, and although she dines at his home, she does not carry out her intentions of evening up odds with Nicholas.The story rambles along in a lethargic fashion without a semblance of suspense. Nicholas, forgetting his own wild oat, refuses to believe his wife when she says that she has not been unfaithful to him. Moreover, he slaps her face. The inevitable question of motherhood is brought in at what is deemed to be the psychological moment, but it does not have the expected effect upon Nicholas. This calls for more scenes, but everybody knows that all the bickering which began with Nicholas's escapade in the South of France will in the end be settled amicably.In the episode on the Côte d'Azur there is featured a race in which the contestants are handicapped by the number of cocktails they imbibe before starting. They drink one or two cocktails, as the case may be, leap into the water, start their outboard motor boats and are off. Then they speed to Juan les Pins, where they have to take time to drink another cocktail and return to the starting point. This section of the film is moderately diverting until one of the contestants who has over-handicapped himself with the stimulating concoctions crashes into a boat run by another man. However, nobody is hurt and the picture goes on with love affairs by the gay, blue waters of the Mediterranean and subsequently changes its locale to London, where one is gratified to see good old Lord Portleigh, acted by Sir Nigeo.In one of the closing sequences one of the characters vouchsafes that when husband and wife have both broken their marriage vows they are not in a position to seek a divorce. Apparently it is the idea that they ought both to be punished by continuing living together.Miss Swanson is undeniably good-looking, but she does not show any particular talent for acting in this film. She speaks her lines in a nervous manner, and this often destroys what value there might be to the episode.

Consequently, osmotic pressure tends to dehydrate a saltwater fish by pushing water out through the semipermeable membranes of its gills.  To stay wet inside, saltwater fishes have to drink seawater, then remove the salt in specialized kidneys and gill cells and excrete it (seagulls also do this, but humans can't). Freshwater fish are much saltier than the surrounding water, and osmotic pressure therefore tends to force water into the fish, making them swell. Freshwater fishes therefore do not drink, and their kidneys are organized to conserve salt and excrete copious quantities of water.

GOING OUT Guide"},{"year":"1923","title":"Captain Svenson in \\"Homeward Bound,\\" the film feature this week at the Rialto, is a deceitful old salt, sober as a bootlegger when ashore, but always quenching a rum thirst when afloat. His appearance is also deceptive, for he doesn't look a bit like a sailor","excerpt":"in fact, any one would take him for a moving-picture actor or a minor poet. However, there he is on the screen, taking his rum when he finds it, and steering his good ship right bang for the rocks. Thus he gives Thomas Meighan another chance to become a hero. Meighan, as the mate, swings on the drunken skipper and then takes charge of the steering wheel. In picture studies it is the law of their seas that Captains always steer their own vessels, instead of leaving that part of the work to a seaman. Incidentally, when Meighan calls attention to the fact—and we are told it's a fact—that the inebriated master is making straight for the rocks and this popular actor never changes the course at all.This is a story of storms, valor and love—about equal parts of each. Interspersed with these three is the skipper's love of liquor. The first storm is a washout, for Captain Marryat would call it a cap-full of wind. The second storm, however??? shows that all the hose possible has been commandeered by the studio forces. The seas break over the old schooner with such vim that they remain aboard, and the crew is not only tossed around but forced to wade up to their knees in water. The music helps quite a good deal to make one think of the pseudo danger.The heroine, who has stowed away aboard, is bowled over by the water and saved by Meighan, the erstwhile mate, who has put up another stripe on his sleeve. Just as he is sympathizing with the girl, Mary Brent, played by Lila Lee, Meighan's Man Friday informs him that distress signals have been seen on the starboard bow. Jim Bedford (Meighan), owing to the pathetic condition of the girl, is willing to ignore the signals, when Mary says: \\"Jim, you cannot turn away from a ship in distress.\\"Thereupon the schooner makes for the yacht, aboard which is the girl's irate father. The sea has become nice and calm, and Jim decides that they must get within speaking distance. He tells the yacht to send a boat. They have no more, all having been smashed or washed overboard. Hence a line is fired aboard and finally Mary is sent over to the more comfortable quarters afforded by the yacht, which has a broken rudder. When Jim tells the girl's parent that he has married her the father quizzically asks them what they are going to live on, whereupon the businesslike Jim hands him a bill for $100,000 for towing the yacht to safety. This at first infuriates the father, but he eventually forgives the couple.There is an effort to keep to the lingo of the ships in this film, so when father gives Mary a yacht he says: \\"How would you like to try your sea-legs on it?\\"Svenson, after Meighan has sent him ashore from the yacht, is described as \\"an artist in preparing an alibi, like most men who have fallen down on their jobs.\\"Meighan performs in his usual attractive way. Miss Lee adorns herself with the very latest creations, and must be one of the best-dressed girls in the little seaport. Charles Abbe is quite satisfactory as the father and ship owner. This production is a moderate entertainment for the great open spaces.\\"Broadway Gold\\" is the box-office title of the new film being presented this week at the Cameo. It is a production in which there is plenty of action, good photography and an adequate cast. Elaine Hammerstein is the pretty, ingenuous chorus girl who has a night of excitement which no budding actress would be likely to forget. The usual flamboyant party with a swimming pool has not been forgotten. In this instance the big affair is given for a Pekingese and other dogs, a slightly exaggerated idea, as are other incidents throughout this photo extravaganza.During the party, in which some of the musicians and attendants flop into the water, the prize Pekingese is shown with a royal crown on his head; and at the conclusion of the evening or night, the host and other canines are pictured devouring their meal from plates on the banquet table.Sunny Duane—Elaine Hammerstein—goes to the party, and, unfortunately for her, happens to be in the room when Cornelius Fellowes is shot and killed. Before he dies he urges her to get away, and she escapes down the frse-escape, leaving her telltale borrowed cloak behind. She gets into a taxicab and, as luck will have it, there is a crash and Eugene Durant is hurt when his car turns over on the pavement. In the hospital Durant suggests that he would like Sunny Duane to be married to him. She finally consents, as Durant tells her that he won't live long. Two days afterward he aplologizes for having lived so long.Jean Valjean, played by Kathlyn Williams, declares that she will insist that she was present at the shooting of Fellowes. She tells Sunny that she has been in far worse troubles than the one she intends taking over. Meanwhile the newspapers are broadcasting the news that the police know the name of the woman, and scenes are shown at Police Headquarters and in the District Attorney's office.Miss Hammerstein is dashing and charming in the leading rôle, and Kathlyn Williams's la-da-da idea is quite well carried out. She is blasé when it comes to accidents and murders. One can see this picture and be amused.This is followed by a very good dog picture, called \\"The Thoroughbred,\\" in which a wire-haired terrier describes his life in the country. This dog, to the producer's credit, just appears without doing any tricks. He is merely on the scene, running after goats and chickens and having a jolly old dog time. It is a picture which all dog lovers will relish.

After a period of decline, wordless novels have recently enjoyed a small revival as an offshoot of so-called graphic novels, which are themselves offshoots of comic books. Since the wordless novel relies so strongly on visual shorthand, it is often a difficult genre in which to express complex ideas and emotions. THE SILENT CITY (Kitchen Sink Press, paper, $24.95), Erez Yakin's story of the plight of individuals in an industrial totalitarian state, is by no means graphically simplistic","excerpt":"in fact, as Yevgeny Yevtushenko writes in his introduction, \\"Erez Yakin screams with the silence of his drawings.\\" It is indeed remarkable that such powerfully and exquisitely rendered pictures -- reminiscent of George Grosz and Otto Dix's post-World War I antiwar prints -- were made in 1988, when the artist was just 18 years old. But it is no surprise  that each image is more effective individually than as an element of a complete  story. Mr. Yakin finds it difficult to keep his theme of totalitarian oppression from being a shrill echo of George Orwell's \\"Nineteen Eighty-four,\\" replete with the common visual clichs of fascist brutality. Nevertheless, \\"The Silent City\\" is remarkable for its horrific portrayals of unbridled, demonic power, as well as for the difficult, oppressive darkness of its pictures, which makes them at times barely reproducible. \\"The Silent City\\" may not have pushed the limits of the wordless novel beyond what was accomplished in the 1930's, but it proves that Erez Yakin is a virtuoso image maker, a gifted artist at the beginning of what might well be a brilliant career.

ONE MAN'S TREASURES"},{"year":"1937","title":"FILM audiences here are greeting \\"The Goalkeeper,\\" one of the earliest 1937 releases of Lenfilm, as an augury of a richer harvest of movie entertainment this year than last. They do so not without reason, both as regards the picture itself—a rollicking if by no mean first-rate production strongly reminiscent of American college comedies—and as regards conditions within the industry itself.The \\"Goalkeeper,\\" which was directed by Timoshenko, is the first Soviet film about football. The game commonly known here as football is actually soccer, which in real life as well as in the first picture about it packs beautiful new stadiums with cheering fans on the \\"rest day.\\" \\"The Goalkeeper\\" is interesting for its care-free comedy, highly personal theme, love emphasis, rapid tempo throughout, and exciting situations verging more than once on the highly improbable.The principal character is a handsome peasant lad encountered one Summer's day by a soccer team of young workers on a boat trip. They invite the young rustic, who catches watermelons so well, to the big city to join them at work and play. The country boy more than makes the grade","excerpt":"in fact, becomes the sensational goalkeeper of the day, and is well on the way to winning the heart of the most ravishing blonde in the sports society.One of the most exciting moments of the picture occurs when the players arrive late at the stadium in a plane, bail out one after another, and descend to the field under fluttering white parachutes. There is a suggestion of Hollywood's more elaborate manner in the sports club setting and other details which keep the picture from representing a realistic portrayal of Soviet youth, but for what it indicates of current entertainment trends in film-making here, it is worthy of comment.Also worthy of comment is the criticism which the film industry recently received from Pravda, Communist Party paper, and other important sources. The central administration of the industry was raked over the coals for backwardness and dilatory methods. Following this airing of shortcomings in the press, a number of the country's directors, leading technicians and actors met to thresh out difficulties. The meeting cleared the air, and has quickened the tempo of studio work, so that, while there are many matters still to be ironed out, on the whole the new year brought an aura of hopefulness with it. Its program calls for more activity, too. After turning out fifty-two feature pictures in 1936, the studios are now scheduled to release a total of 100 this year.Some of the new films will directly mirror daily life, especially of factory workers; there will even be a feature on the Stakhanoff movement. Political in theme will be a film tentatively titled \\"The Great Citizen\\"; its director is Friedrich Ermler of Lenfilm, who was responsible for \\"Peasants.\\" Vladimir Pudovkin will make a picture on aviation heroes. The current schedules call for a feature-length picture about the life of S. M. Kirov, member of the Politbureau and Leningrad Communist party leader who was assassinated about two years ago. Historical films to be released this year include Petroff's on Peter the First, based on Alexei Tolstoi's novel; Roshal's film on the Paris Commune, and Dovzhenko's picture about Shchors, a civil war hero of the Ukraine sometimes called the \\"Ukrainian Chapayev.\\"A Kiev production of Twain's \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" Victor Hugo's \\"Gavrouche,\\" and \\"The Dowerless,\\" by the Russian writer Ostrovsky, are among the films based on foreign and Russian classics which will be produced in the U. S. S. R. this year. The interest in classical films is far from satisfied by domestic productions, but few are imported because the majority are considered politically inaccurate or tend to overemphasize romantic elements at the expense of social background. \\"Anna Karenina\\" was not shown here for that reason. There is a possibility that Soyuzintorgkino, film importing and exporting organization, may buy \\"Mill on the Floss,\\" \\"Jane Eyre,\\" \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and the \\"Pickwick Papers.\\" Previews of \\"Mary of Scotland,\\" \\"Pasteur,\\" \\"Danton\\" and other biographical films made abroad are awaited, by the way.Soviet studios are scheduled to release a number of lighter features, some already well into production. One such picture is now being made by Alexandroff, who was responsible for \\"Moscow Laughs.\\" Dancing, both the ballroom and Russian folk varieties, will play a prominent part in some of these films. The new, lighter films call for plenty of music and mirth, will as a rule portray purely individual situations, and, while reflecting the spirit of life here, will be pratically apolitical.Does the growing emphasis on humor and personal life signify a thumbs down on the so-called \\"propaganda\\" film? That depends upon what is meant by that very elastic word. If \\"propaganda\\" is taken in its more popular usage to signify the insistently political theme and mass action of the first Russian films after the revolution, then, certainly, it is obvious that the studios are turning out few films of this nature, although E. L. Dzigan, director, and V. V. Vishnevsky, who wrote the scenario or the last film of this nature—\\"We of Kronstadt\\"—have just received the Order of Lenin for the production.Using the term \\"propaganda\\" in its broader and more philosophical significance, films that may be so designated continue to direct the thinking of millions of movie patrons along the lines mapped out by the political and educational readers of the new Russia. Every picture released, however personal its subject matter, bears the stamp of Soviet ideology, faint as that stamp may be in such films as \\"The Goalkeeper.\\" THE SCREEN IN MOSCOW"},{"year":"2000","title":"Most remembered photograph of fall of Saigon was thought to show desperate Americans crowding on roof of United States Embassy to board helicopter","excerpt":"in fact, building was apartment complex and people feeing were Vietnamese; photograph is metaphor for all the misunderstanding that plagued Vietnam war; photo; map (M) The World; Getting It Wrong in a Photo"},{"year":"1926","title":"After ruling unbrokenly for the last three weeks, Stock Exchange call money finally yielded to 4 1/4 per cent. from 4 1/2, which had prevailed since Oct. 19.

IGOT SUCHANITCH   \\"Ankle-biting cur!\\" Pushkin shoved him out for ingratitude. Even kindly Chekhov finally tired of his yapping and passed him on to Dostoyevsky, who was driven to such despair by the ensuing domestic disruptions that he threw himself into writing \\"Crime and Punishment\\" \\"just to escape into a happier realm,\\" he later confessed. In the light of modern science, Suchanitch's didoes become understandable; he was almost certainly being driven half-mad by fleas. Not that the German-bred mischief-maker was without charm: that rakishly unkempt silvery-gray mane, those big, sparkling brown eyes, a restless bounding energy -- amid the pride of solemn literary lions of 19th-century St. Petersburg, he was a gay dog indeed. Alas, his literary output amounted to one brilliant, anguished fusillade against cats, \\"Nyatski!\\" (\\"Hiss!\\"), before he was drawn to science and became involved in psychological experiments -- to his everlasting regret -- with one Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, M.D. FIONA PURINA   Irish by descent, but adopted at a mere 8 weeks by a noble Italian family and raised in Rome, Fiona Purina was a creature of fierce territorial instincts who quickly made Roman society her jealous domain. But no pampered lap dog, she. Fiona was an agitator by the age of 6 and soon an outspoken essayist and pamphleteer against any and all abridgments of freedom for her and her kind. Yet the haughty household princess spurned the advances of what she called \\"mongrels and strays\\" and became the mistress of Garibaldi's pet, Pepe, who was sleek as a greyhound. But he was unable or unwilling to be monogamous; soon the fur flew, and the relationship ended in a veritable dogfight. Purina failed to mellow with age. Having impetuously wet King Umberto's pants leg, she was banished in disgrace to the countryside near Reggio Calabria. There she whiled away her remaining years, dozing in the sun in the dooryard, dreaming of the glory that had been Rome. SIR WAGSTAFF BARKER   Late-19th-century English letters owe Sir Wagstaff Barker much; it was he who once rescued the infant Chesterton from drowning in the Solent during a family picnic. Sir Wagstaff never spoke of his mother -- by all accounts a classic bitch, for all her impeccable breeding -- and never knew his father. Perhaps this explains a life of ceaseless wandering and almost suicidal athleticism. Certainly, a robust physicality (\\"Muscular Canininity,\\" Kipling called it) informed Barker's days and works. Up and out into the nearby woodlands before sunrise to splash through marsh and fen until exhausted, Barker lived and breathed and ate and celebrated nature with animal gusto to the end of his days. Indeed, his longtime companion, John Buchan, in whose household he was to become a permanent guest, thought he detected something obsessive in the big fellow's tireless pursuits. \\"Birds and squirrels, squirrels and birds,\\" he fulminated in his diary. \\"He can think, he can dream, of nothing else.\\" AMELIA UPLAND   \\"Her long, wet nose quivers so,\\" wrote Queen Victoria to a daughter after an audience with the shy and reclusive Amelia Upland, \\"and her hair feels like a rug; yet even Rosebery  [ that is, the Earl of Rosebery, Prime Minister 1894-95 ]  is compelled to pat her on her head!\\" The severe bombazine dress in this undated portrait symbolizes Miss Amelia Upland's austere spinsterhood, for an operation at an early age had made all hopes of a family impossible. Her long life was one ceaseless quest for affection, expressed in poems -- \\"Bath Day,\\" \\"Comes the Cook,\\" \\"A Rumor of Mange\\" -- that returned, again and again and yet again, to her beloved themes of family life in the Lake Country of her youth. Miss Upland seldom left her cozy corner under the stairs in the house where she was born, except to go swimming, and yet seldom has one so retiring been so widely loved. \\"About life she had an acute sensitivity,\\" eulogized England's poet laureate upon her passing, \\"and her sense of smell was nothing to sneeze at, either.\\" HECTOR LE CHIEN   Runt of a brawling Billancourt litter and cast out early to seek his own fate, Hector Le Chien soon made Montmartre his neighborhood and its fin de siecle boites and cafes his home. \\"Mascot of the Demimonde,\\" Zola called the pint-sized hobbledehoy. Le Chien was a beggar and a thief, notorious for his raffish demeanor (he was never known to bathe), his bad breath and a habit of furiously scratching himself until the furniture rattled. Small wonder that he was always in somebody's doghouse. Yet among Montmartre's innumerable poets and troubadours, his was a unique voice: keening his agonies and needs in impromptu recitals in one smoky cafe or another, he could still a room. Then, as the sympathy and praise engulfed him, Hector would invariably roll over onto his back, legs in the air, his mouth twisted into an otherworldly rictus of a grin. The stale croissant, the heel of a baguette that inevitably followed, were sustenance. For body and soul. BONAR KENNELWORTH KERR   \\"Man has no better friend,\\" warbled Thoreau. \\"He gobbles his food,\\" hissed Emily Dickinson. \\"He spoke a language even I don't understand,\\" harrumphed Edmund Wilson, whose massive critical surveys of American letters fail to so much as throw a bone to Bonar Kennelworth Kerr. True, his poems today may scan like doggerel, but in the New England of more than a hundred years ago, literary luminaries from Boston to Concord would instantly lay their papers down whenever Kennelworth Kerr came calling. His visits were memorable. \\"That damnable animal Kennelworth comes by,\\" huffed Longfellow, \\"jumping up on the maid at the mere sight of some mutton scraps, bolting his meal, then licking her hands and face in a disgusting excess of what some call affection but I call servility.\\" His biographer, Kibble, speculates that it was Mark Twain who taught him to smoke cigars as a parlor trick. Alas, it banished him thereafter from the salons and parlors of fastidious literary Boston, and his twilight years were spent snuffling for butts in the alleyways of Roxbury.

Reginald Denny, with longish hair and a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, is excellent as Rufus Billups Jr., the young hypochondriac. He seizes his chance in quiescent and active moods to portray the amusing incidents and situations in fine fashion, and he accomplishes that most difficult of histrionic feats—appearing natural. In the more hilarious sections of this story he restrains himself just sufficiently, and makes the added chapter to this production just as laughable and as stirring as parts of Harold Lloyd's \\"Safety Last.\\"The casting of this picture has been done with care. It is most important to the story, for it would never do to have an uninteresting if capable actress in the part of Dolores Hicks. This rôle calls for a pretty, as well as an efficient, player, and nobody could have filled it better than does Mary Astor, who has never looked as charming as she does in a nurse's costume in this comedy. In the witty subtitles she is known as \\"The lovely view,\\" and there is no doubt but that she lives up to this description in Rufus's mind when one bright morning he slowly opens his eyes to see her appealing beauty when he had expected to observe the severe countenance of \\"Death Watch Mary.\\"The sight of such a nurse is one which is apt to make any patient forget his ailment and pains. Billups, as may be remembered, is a young man who will inherit $750,000 if he lives three years. He was born in an incubator and is firm in the belief that he is a doomed man and cannot last out a year. Three old gentlemen with an eye to making a few dollars, after a detailed examination of Billups's health, agree to lend him $100,000 if he will sign over to them the balance of his fortune. They are stricken with fear when his condition, while under the care of \\"Death Watch Mary,\\" grows seriously worse. But what a difference the appearance of a good-looking nurse makes to this self-pitying patient! Life's cheers bloom anew. The sun is permitted to stream into the sick chamber. He begins to want food","excerpt":"in fact, he wants anything that will bring Miss Hicks's cheering countenance before his once lethargic gaze.One of the amusing sequences in this photoplay is where the three aged and grasping old men are introduced. Each has a pet idiosyncrasy; one rubs the back of his neck with his crooked cane, the other tears paper into strips and the third walks in a triangle. During a disappointing stage in the patient's sickness one sees this trio very busy in their respective peculiarities. The players in this stretch are William V. Mong, Otis Harlan and Tom Ricketts.Miss Hicks is apparently not interested in her patient. She does not like a gloomy room, so lets in the sunlight, and then goes out on the veranda and reads about brave men. This nurse is oblivious of her charming appearance, and one can imagine in the last chapter the rousing laughter which greets the spectacle of the patient endeavoring to prove his lack of fear by insisting on climbing up a flagstaff on top of a skyscraper to paint the gold sphere. This section is remarkably well photographed, for almost any one outside of a steeplejack is bound to experience a thrill as one looks down more than 300 feet below, and then sees the masterful Billups clinging to the rope on the flagstaff while the wondrous creature who has caused him to forget his supposed ailing condition stands on the roof quite interested in his efforts. Added to this you have the fun of watching the three greedy old men who fear that their patient may meet with an accidental death any moment.This is a well-knit comedy, cleverly staged and efficiently acted. There are close-ups of Miss Astor which are never tedious. But even here the director, Harry A. Pollard has been careful not to interfere with the unfolding of the story.

Stanley R. Arthur -- who until recently was indeed the nominee for the job.    And in seeking an example of how far Pentagon leadership has fallen, and how the issue of sexual harassment has descended into ugly McCarthyism, one could hardly find a more telling case than Admiral Arthur's sudden dispatch to early retirement.    Admiral Arthur is a hero of two wars -- a pilot who earned an extraordinary 11 Distinguished Flying Crosses while flying more than 500 combat missions in Vietnam, then commanded the allied naval armada in the Persian Gulf. His Pentagon experience is exemplary, too, including high-level budget planning, nearly three years as chief of the Navy's worldwide logistics system and two years as Vice Chief of Naval Operations.    After Admiral Arthur was nominated for the Pacific command, Senator David Durenberger of Minnesota indicated that he would raise questions about the treatment of a constituent, a female officer who claimed the Navy treated her unfairly when she failed flight training after accusing an instructor of sexual harassment. Admiral Arthur's only role in the case was that of final reviewing officer. He approved earlier findings that although the woman, Lieut. (j.g.) Rebecca Hansen, had been harassed (the Navy had already disciplined an instructor), she failed to quality as a pilot because of a poor flight record, both before and after the incident.    The inspectors general of the Navy and the Defense Department agreed with this finding. Navy Secretary John H. Dalton approved a recommendation that the Navy prepare to discharge her. Key senators told the Pentagon that Admiral Arthur would be approved for his new command but that because of Mr. Durenberger's \\"hold\\" his confirmation might be delayed until fall.    Then on June 24, the Navy said in a terse statement that Admiral Arthur \\"agrees with Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Boorda\\" that his nomination should be withdrawn because an \\"anticipated delay in Senate confirmation\\" would not permit \\"a prompt relief\\" for Adm. Charles R. Larson, the current commander in the Pacific, who is scheduled to become Superintendent of the Naval Academy. Admiral Arthur is to be retired as soon as his job is filled.   The Navy's explanation was disingenuous at best. Admiral Larson's new assignment is not time-sensitive","excerpt":"in fact, it also awaits Senate action. It has been widely reported that Admiral Boorda is less concerned about a delay in Admiral Arthur's confirmation than about becoming ensnared in another sexual harassment scandal. Even Senator Durenberger's key staff assistant said he was \\"flabbergasted\\" by the decision to end Admiral Arthur's 37-year career in such a manner.   More important, this episode raises serious questions about Admiral Boorda's fitness to be Chief of Naval Operations and demonstrates the Clinton Administration's lack of regard for military leaders.    Admiral Boorda has gained a reputation for political expediency. In 1992, when he was Chief of Personnel, he summarily relieved one of the Navy's brightest young admirals, Jack Snyder, after the initial revelations about the Tailhook scandal. Admiral Snyder, who had gone well beyond what was required in his efforts to assist the key female witness and urge an investigation, was not even allowed to defend his actions. This abandonment of a deserving officer in the face of political attack did not hurt Admiral Boorda's chances for advancement -- which may well have encouraged his shoddy treatment of Admiral Arthur.    After quashing Admiral Arthur's career, Admiral Boorda disregarded Secretary Dalton's recommendation to discharge Lieutenant Hansen and went to Great Lakes, Ill., to meet with her. She presented him with 10 demands, including that the Navy rewrite her fitness reports using words of her choosing, that they send her to law school at the Navy's expense and then assign her to work as a lawyer handling women's issues, and that the Secretary officially apologize to her. According to The New York Times, Admiral Boorda responded by offering her a job on his personal staff. (She did not accept it.)    Under any standard of leadership, Admiral Boorda's conduct is seriously deficient on several grounds: disloyalty to deserving subordinates, faulty judgment and usurping the authority of the Secretary of the Navy.    Which leads us to the Clinton Administration's handling of this event. Once his nomination went forward, Admiral Arthur was the President's candidate, and it was not within Admiral Boorda's jurisdiction to withdraw. In fact, since the Pacific command is \\"purple\\" -- that is, commanding military units from all the services -- Admiral Arthur was technically never Admiral Boorda's candidate from the beginning. And yet after the withdrawal we heard no word from either the Secretary of the Navy or the President, and Defense Secretary William J. Perry merely said he had decided not to intervene.    On July 1 the Administration announced that Vice Adm. Richard Macke, a capable but far less experienced officer who had been slated to replace Admiral Arthur as Vice Chief of Naval Operations, would be nominated instead to the Pacific command. Thus a three-star officer is to be placed in the Navy's most senior and prestigious four-star billet, partly because his paperwork was already in the White House.    The casual way in which the Administration has dealt with command replacement for a theater where war could be imminent indicates either naivete or arrogance when it comes to the importance of strong military leadership. And it is a grim omen for the future of the U.S. military when competent warriors are sent home by political admirals.

William S. Dietrich, the president of Dietrich Industries, a Pittsburgh building-products manufacturer, does more than point. In his book IN THE SHADOW OF THE RISING SUN: The Political Roots of American Economic Decline (Pennsylvania State University, $24.50), he examines the Japanese institutions that foster such cooperation and deplores the absence of American counterparts. He studies the comprehensive industrial policy that the relationship between Japanese business and government allows, and compares it with the often haphazard, every-firm-for-itself structure that exists in the United States. And he traces the histories of the two countries to show where such differences originated. His conclusion is a gloomy one. What is needed, he writes, is an American equivalent of the Japanese system: \\"a capitalistic free-market system . . . tempered by strategic considerations arrived at through consultation and bargaining between government and business.\\" In other words, the only way the United States can compete is to recast its business-government relationship thoroughly along Japanese lines. Such a shift would mean abandoning a fondly held distrust of government that has permeated our society for more than 200 years, and it would necessarily involve huge changes in countless other aspects of American life. Such a shift is unlikely, to say the least, and even the author holds out little hope for it. Instead he offers a shock treatment, a look at the economic state of the world circa 2015. In this new world order, which Mr. Dietrich calls Pax Nipponica, Japan has gained \\"uncontested dominance in every leading-edge industry\\" -- including computers, nuclear power and defense. Japan's gross national product is twice that of the United States, which, along with the European Community, now ranks as a \\"third-tier nation\\" whose role is to produce middle-technology products and provide a market for high-tech goods from Asia. Japan owns 40 percent of American manufacturing assets and holds 50 percent of American bank assets. Interest rates, debt levels and currency-exchange rates are all set in Tokyo. There is lots more, and it isn't so farfetched","excerpt":"in fact, it is a far more likely scenario than the radical changes Mr. Dietrich prescribes. Let us hope that he is wrong.

Norris's novel \\"Seed,\\" which is now at the Rivoli, a mother's devotion to her five children is contrasted with a father's exasperating selfishness. It is undoubtedly an interesting theme, but in the film it merely results in being an adult idea offered in adolescent form.Moreover, John Boles, who has hitherto relied in his screen work on his ability to sing rather than on his histrionic talent, impersonates the father. His performance is no better than it was in other portrayals, and here he does not have the opportunity of lifting his voice in melody. Not only is his interpretation of the father, Bart Carter, too placid to be convincing, but Mr. Stahl's unimaginative direction causes Mr. Boles to be rather gauche during several of the interludes.On the other hand, Lois Wilson, as the mother, Peggy, reveals a certain spontaneity in her acting. But even she makes light of the passage of ten years, for her appearance when the decade is supposed to have passed is just as youthful, in spite of her household anxieties, as it was in her preceding scenes.The children are occasionally amusing in the course of their boisterous activities, but when they grow older even this quality of humor is lost.Bart Carter is supposed to be a man who can write. At the opening of the story he is working as a clerk in a publisher's office. Mildred, who is the Paris manager of the concern and an old flame of Bart's, calls on the Carters. The five youngsters are very noisy, but finally when they have been sent off to bed, Bart chances to tell Mildred about the novel on which he has been working. He goes up to his top-floor den to get the manuscript and discovers that the youngsters have cut up several pages. Nevertheless, he brings the greater part of the manuscript downstairs and proceeds to read it to Mildred and is vexed when he observes that Peggy has fallen asleep. As a matter of fact the passages that are read are not particularly lively","excerpt":"in fact, it is no wonder that Peggy becomes bored. Mildred, however, is strangely enthusiastic and as her word carries weight with Bliss, the head of the publishing concern, she arranges for Bart to continue his writing and still draw his salary. Mildred's admiration for Bart is soon reciprocated by him and in his ambition to be a writer he neglects his family, preferring to do his writing in her apartment, an idea which is not discouraged by Mildred.Then comes the check for $2,000 advance royalties and subsequently the discovery that the author wishes to be divorced by his wife so that he can marry Mildred. In the decade that follows, Bart is presumed to have stooped rather low in some of his books, but when Peggy and her brood hear that the famous Bart Carter is coming to his home town they are ready to kill the fatted calf for him. It is not long afterward that Mildred realizes that Bart loves his children more than he does her and the inference is that Mildred's life from that time on is not going to be plain sailing.Mr. Stahl sets forth odd ideas in this film. He is much too zealous to show Mildred as a young woman in affluent circumstances. There is her glistening car, with the well-mannered chauffeur, who waits at the automobile door, apparently even when his employer is inside a house. In one sequence Peggy, Mildred and Bart appear to have dinner without any food being set on the table.It is a lethargic and often dull production, in spite of the good acting by both Genevieve Tobin as Mildred and Miss Wilson as Peggy, Zazu Pitts as a servant and passable performances by some of the other players. THE SCREEN; A Mother's Devotion."},{"year":"1932","title":"Murder is but a mere incident in \\"Under-Cover Man,\\" the current film at the Paramount, in which George Raft is the principal performer. In an early episode of this synthetic melodrama a gang leader himself kills a bank messenger and subsequently two other individuals meet an untimely end. It seems to be all in the day's work and only relatives of two of the slain persons are bothered about the crimes.So far as this lurid tale is concerned, the under-cover man is virtually a stool-pigeon","excerpt":"in fact, it is not easy to draw a distinction between the two. Apparently the under-cover expert does not choose to apprehend his man or lead him to a place where he will be arrested until the psychological moment. If an under-cover man is in a car and a murder is committed in the vehicle by the owner, it is not the sleuth's business. Such things will happen, and he just goes on his way, trusting that he will not get a bullet through him before the red-letter day comes when the crooks he is watching are brought to justice.The nefarious crew here succeed in making uncanny deductions. They put Sherlock Holmes to shame, but they do not trouble to tell the audience how they accomplish these wonders. They do not look so clever, but nothing is beyond them. They appear to see through the heads of other men who are miles away from them. To offset this shrewdness they are sometimes extremely stupid; for they are so quick on the trigger when it is a question of vengeance, but when it means their capture they dawdle about with hands in their pockets, apparently holding pistols in readiness. One rather thinks that they are bluffing-sticking out their thumbs to intimidate men they have \\"frisked.\\"With all its mechanical trickery, this picture has the benefit of good acting. Mr. Raft as Nick Darrow, who is posing as Ollie Snell, agrees to become an under-cover man for Inspector Conklin because he wishes to find the murderer of his father. He is assisted by Lora Madigan, impersonated by Nancy Carroll, who is eager to have the slayer of her brother, a bank messenger, put behind the bars. Lew Cody portrays Kenneth Mason, a crook leader who can laugh over a little thing like a murder so long as he makes a big haul in gilt-edged securities. Like several of the others Mason has moments when he is a positive genius for uncovering the doings of others, but why he should be so idiotic as to kill a boy himself is not quite clear.David Landau as Inspector Conklin is the most rational person in the picture, but even he does not impress one as being especially brainy. Inspector Conklin at least confines himself to the necessary mood, but virtually all the other characters seem to have strange lapses of memory, which one might attribute to the direction.Gregory Ratoff is capital as one of Mason's henchmen. Miss Carroll is pleasing as Lora. Mr. Raft helps his part as much as it is within his power. Noel Francis, Mr. Landau, Paul Porcasi, Roscoe Karns are among others who do valiant work for this picture.There is a capital Mack Sennett comedy on the surrounding program.\\"Broadway Merry-Go-Round.\\"Aside from the amusement afforded by Fannie Brice and George Jessel in the Paramount's footlights entertainment, there is a troupe of agile and graceful dancers.Others who help this diversion, which is known as \\"Broadway Merry-Go-Round,\\" are Donald Novis, the singer; Mills, Kirk and Martin and the David Bines Boys and Girls.

STATE"},{"year":"1923","title":"THE two pictures that Adolph Zukor presented last week in the Rialto and Rivoli were by no means helpful to the industry. One of them, \\"The Silent Partner,\\" was an extremely wishy-washy affair, with absolutely no reason for its having been put in a Broadway theatre, and the other was far too tiresome for most people to sit through. The last was called \\"The Midnight Alarm,\\" and for antequated ideas and sloppy titles it took, as the English cockney says, \\"the undivided bun.\\" No matter how charitable one would want to be with this Vitagraph production, there was not a single instance of worth in any scene or sequence in this so-called photoplay. Usually in a class to which such as this belongs—and fortunately there are but few shown on Broadway—there is some scene, some bit of acting, an idea or a little \\"business\\" on which one can expatiate. In \\"The Midnight Alarm\\" there is nothing to recommend it. The who'e story, the entire production, was absolutely unworthy of the Rialto screen, and the musicians must have felt insulted at the presentation of such an effort, which, in addition to its many dramatic absurdities, bore titles which were really offensive to the intelligence of any person able to read them.Exasperating Sub-titles.\\"You're as welcome as the seven years itch,\\" read one title, and there were many others just as bad. These sub-titles have been scoffed by many persons. The picture was so bad that it lost all merit of being funny even in its serious spots.While this so-called picture was holding forth in the Rialto the Paramount firm sends out a circular to the effect that it is \\"leaving the old road.\\" It might have taken a turning before it decided this week and left the \\"Midnight Alarm\\" to care for itself wherever it might be able to do so. Paramount announces a new season. One line in this circular sets forth that the time has gone by in the industry when there can be any compromise between the good and the bad picture. The whole idea of this circular is that Mr. Zukor intends to cease block-booking with exhibitors and sets forth that there will be an opportunity in different key centres for the public to see and deliver their opinion of a picture-play. All very well, but that does not answer the reason why Broadway, above all places, should have had to suffer the indignity of having \\"The Midnight Alarm\\" thrust upon it.If by any chance Mr. Zukor wants to say that he did permit a Vitagraph picture to be presented at one of his theatres, he at any rate can determine the quality of the picture to be put on there, and nobody would blame him for turning down such a film as \\"The Midnight Alarm.\\" In fact it would have been a strong argument in his favor. This sad, stupid, boring, sleep-provoking effort, granting some did stay through it because of the music and the comedy, must have wasted a lot of New York's time.\\"Drifting\\" had many redeeming features in the photography, spots of the direction, and the atmosphere, which was very interesting. The story itself was muddled, and it seemed to end just about time when the director was tired of it, or when he thought that he had taken all the necessary footage for the film. However, this film was by no means unentertaining","excerpt":"in fact, it was quite exciting at times, and the acting of Priscilla Dean and Wallace Beery was splendid.\\"The White Rose,\\" with Mae Marsh and Ivor Novello, has sent thousands away from the Strand with tear-stained cheeks.

Moreover this production was directed by George Fitzmaurice.Then there is Zane Grey's \\"To the Last Man,\\" with Lois Wilson and Richard Dix. The story deals with the feud between cattlemen and sheep herders in the late eighties.Warner Brothers's production, \\"Where the North Begins,\\" will be presented at the Capitol. In this picture is Rin-Tin-Tin, a wonderful police dog, who is said to have seen battles on the firing line in France.The Strand has found that Mr. Griffith's \\"The White Rose\\" has been such a good drawing card that it is going to continue it for a second week.\\"The Eleventh Hour,\\" is the feature film selected for the Cameo.

''LIGHTING OUT FOR THE TERRITORY'' is a motif that has long been held to be central to the tradition of American fiction. When informed by it, a novel is about what happens when a single, usually male loner - call him Ishmael, or Huckleberry, or transpose him into a 20th-century mode, as in F. Scott Fitzgerald, E.L. Doctorow, Raymond Chandler and many more - breaks away from his matrix and has adventures. But elevate, say, Louisa May Alcott's ''Little Women'' to a more important position in the line of ancestral descent, and the perspective shifts.

ROMANTIC IDEALISM, BARNYARD REALISM"},{"year":"1980","title":"CAN this be love? Here is Ali MacGraw, beating Alan King to a pulp right in the middle of Bergdorf Goodman, kicking and flailing and breaking perfume bottles over his head. Audiences cheer this section of \\"Just Tell Me What You Want\\" more enthusiastically than they applaud any other part of the film. This is the high point of the story, the movie's only moment of real conviction. It might have made for an interesting ending, but it occurs midway through the tale, even though it's the kind of battle that, if this were a western, would leave one of the principals lying dead in the dust. It's a big scene thrown away. \\"Just Tell Me What You Want\\" isn't a movie with big scenes to spare.The rest of the film, after considerable meandering, reunites the two sluggers for a happy ending, as if Miss MacGraw's trying to fracture Mr. King's skull were a new variation on the art of playful romance. The audience, having enjoyed the battle scene, can't make a fast enough about-face to accept the couple's reconciliation, but this is the least of the audience's problems. Are the film's high-priced, venal, calculating wheeler-dealers to be admired? Is their acquisitiveness being ridiculed? Is a large art collection a sign of good character, or of any character at all? Sidney Lumet, the director of \\"Network,\\" and Jay Presson Allen, who wrote the screenplay, go through some potentially interesting motions, but they never take a stand.\\"Just Tell Me What You Want,\\" which opens today at the Cinema II and other theaters, gets off to a fine, funny start and then falls to pieces. This is the second movie to open here in as many weeks — \\"American Gigolo\\" is the other — that approaches rich, decadent, hard-boiled characters with an attitude of star-struck ambivalence. Here, as in \\"American Gigolo,\\" we meet a glamorous social climber whose services are for hire. Miss MacGraw plays the favorite mistress of an extremely rich and powerful businessman, and Mr. Lumet's camera — like Paul Schrader's, in the other film — roams admiringly through her lair. In one scene, Miss MacGraw tosses her jewel collection onto the bed, to impress a new young suitor, just as lovingly as Richard Gere, in \\"American Gigolo,\\" admires the contents of his closet.Both of these characters sleep in large, airy, expensively decorated bedrooms that ought to suggest something about how these people feel or behave when they're alone, but instead say nothing at all. When Mr. Gere tells Lauren Hutton to stay out of his apartment because he doesn't let women visit this inner sanctum, and the place is as impersonally overdecorated as every other set in the movie, it's a terrible joke. Miss MacGraw's character, called Bones Burton, winds up with the same problem in \\"Just Tell Me What You Want.\\" When she leaves Max Herschel, Mr. King's bullying tycoon, in favor of a younger, artier lover, played by Peter Weller, it's time for the real Bones to show. She never materializes — and without a suggestion of where Bones came from, or what she wants or cares about, or even why she's sold herself, the movie has nowhere to go.There's never any suggestion of what she might do outside the film's particularly unglamorous high-roller atmosphere — her most daring and independent act, during the course of the story, is to hock the jewels to finance her own little movie deal. This kind of finagling has none of the \\"Network\\" gloss, although that's the tone to which it apparently aspires. There's none of the overwrought passion that might balance out the characters' icy ambition. The dialogue, notably foulmouthed, merely reminds the viewer that these people's real sexuality is as absent from the film as any other sign of life.Because \\"Just Tell Me What You Want\\" begins so crisply, and because it features fine supporting performances from Keenan Wynn, Dina Merrill and especially Myrna Loy, it is by no means an uninteresting movie","excerpt":"in fact, it's a fascinating mess. Skittishness is no virtue. But the film is furiously confused, and its inconsistencies lie so close to the surface that they rivet the attention even when the story itself does not.

Powell in the last few weeks has demonstrated just how vulnerable the two major parties are.    With no announcement of his intentions and only the barest disclosure of his views, the retired four-star general has been registering at or near the top of most Presidential polls. That he has never registered with a party appears to be no liability","excerpt":"in fact, it's probably an asset.  A Fat Underbelly    Like Ross Perot before him, Mr. Powell is frequently hailed as a standard-bearer for the disaffected middle, voters who are frustrated with the increasing polarization of the two party system and looking for what they see as common sense answers in the center. Also like Mr. Perot, Mr. Powell is often viewed as a potential third-party candidate. But the descriptions of these two men are only half accurate.   By some accounts, Mr. Perot and Mr. Powell may both be centrists, and the two men may give voice to the opinions of many Americans in the fat underbelly of the bell curve. But Mr. Perot was not a third-party candidate in 1992; he was an independent in the fullest sense of the word. If Mr. Powell runs for President in 1996 as neither a Republican nor a Democrat, he would be an independent, too.   There may be room at the center for a third party. It seems Republicans and Democrats have more to fear from candidates who have no party at all.    \\"I think parties are useful institutions,\\" said William Mayer, a professor of political science at Northeastern University who has studied third parties. \\"Nevertheless, the future is with independents.\\"   The time has never seemed more propitious for a third party to form than now. Party identification with the two major parties is declining, and party loyalty has practically disappeared. Increasingly, Americans complain that the Democrats and the Republicans have been hijacked by factions and cater to the ideological extremes.   But politicians and analysts say there are deep reasons why the wrath of the so-called \\"radical middle\\" has not and probably will not translate into a new party.   One reason is that the center is inhabited by, well, centrists. Almost by definition they lack a galvanizing issue -- like abortion for the Right-to-Life Party -- that would unite them and spur them to build a party. It is precisely because voters at the center tend to be less committed that the parties have drifted away from them. Activists on both the left and the right are more likely to participate in party caucuses and primaries, thereby dominating the process.    \\"When have you ever seen a passionate centrist?\\" asked Charles Cook, publisher and chief analyst of the Cook Political Report, a Washington newsletter. \\"There's very little passion or energy in the middle.\\"   New parties, regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum, are notoriously difficult to establish. State election laws have historically favored the Democrats and Republicans against potential challengers, and now Federal campaign financing laws do the same. \\"A new party is a historical anomaly,\\" said Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat, who recently announced he would not seek re-election but left open the possibility of an independent Presidential bid.   Those third parties that have maintained a consistent presence on the ballot in recent years, like the Libertarian Party, tend to have clearly focused ideologies, which points to another difficulty of forming a new party in the middle. The center tends to be occupied by people of many different, even diverging views.    \\"There's enormous support for a third party,\\" said Kevin Phillips, the Republican political analyst. \\"But it always includes people who want all flavors -- pro-grape, pro-lemon, pro-lime.\\"   Mr. Mayer points out that independent candidates who call themselves centrists often end up with a platform that is highly idiosyncratic, well-suited to themselves, perhaps, but ill-suited to a broader movement.  Blue Sky v. Reality    Although Mr. Perot favors abortion rights and a balanced budget and vehemently opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, it's hard to discern a set of underlying principles. \\"It's not the kind of thing that can easily be translated into a stable organization,\\" Mr. Mayer said.    And Mr. Perot's organization, United We Stand, shows what happens when one man's quirky views meet up with the realities of party-building. Since its inception, United We Stand has been in an almost constant state of turmoil and has fielded virtually no candidates outside of its founder. While the organization is a collection of Perot followers, Mr. Mayer said, \\"they are not in any real sense an autonomous third party.\\" Can a New Third Party Emerge From the Center?"},{"year":"1951","title":"Hayden Planetarium expert on beginning of summer SUMMER DUE TOMORROW","excerpt":"In Fact, It's Scheduled at 1:25 A.M., Astronomer Says"},{"year":"2005","title":"Hospitality still thrives here, along with the mold.

A modern reader new to his work, picking up, say, some close-printed one-volume edition and flicking through the pages, is apt to notice first that with very rare exceptions his poetry is composed in 10-syllable couplets and then to conclude hastily that it is all basically similar, as if one poem in couplets must be like another. In fact, Pope's gamut goes all the way from the prettiness of the early ''Pastorals,'' through the delicate fantasy of ''The Rape of the Lock'' and the surreal and savage burlesque of ''The Dunciad,'' to the calm and luminous irony of the ''Imitations of Horace,'' which discuss life and relationships very directly in a language stripped of ornament and staying very close to prose - though, thanks to the fineness of the poet's ear for rhythm and cadence, never becoming merely prosy. Pope had inherited from Renaissance literary culture the doctrine that literature naturally groups itself in genres, or ''kinds,'' and that there is an appropriate set of conventions and an appropriate linguistic level for each kind, so that training oneself for a fresh attempt on one is like learning a new language. He succeeded in so many kinds that his achievement is complex and not at all easy to assess beyond the simple remark that it is brilliant.

It is a charming spectacle of Vienna in 1814, filled with tuneful melodies that one likes to remember and blessed with pleasing light comedy. It is rather like a group of Dresden china figures that have come to life and are beguiling one with a dream—like a happy little love story. It frolics along at a leisurely pace, skipping from one scene to another in nonchalant fashion, revealing the discomfort of some persons and the gayety of others.In this enjoyable picture an English lass who has lived most of her life in Berlin plays the leading feminine rôle. She is Lilian Harvey, a dainty little creature, thoroughly suited to the quality of the fable. Sometimes her speech is quite English, but occasionally she speaks with the suggestion of a foreign accent. Whether she sings a song allotted to her is of small consequence, for she capers about so vivaciously that one really does not care. Miss Harvey impersonates a glove sales girl named Christel Weinzinger, who, to call attention to the shop in which she works, tosses bouquets of flowers into the carriage of every important personage who visits Vienna.When the Czar comes to Vienna for the congress of five powers to discuss the question of the exile of Napoleon, who at the beginning of the story is in Elba, Christel, thinking more of selling her gloves than of the momentous business of the statesmen and rulers, throws a bunch of flowers at the Czar's carriage. Prince Metternich, played by Conrad Veidt, is not amused at her conduct, for it is immediately thought that somebody has thrown a bomb, and out comes the Fire Department. But soon it is discovered that the missile is what it looks like—a bunch of flowers.Metternich is the evil genius of this tale. He has a habit of breakfasting late and listening over a special series of speaking tubes to the conversations of diplomats, ladies-in-waiting and various other groups assembled in the palace, including the lowly domestics. He thinks to outwit the Czar by having pretty women keep him away from the Congress meetings. But the Czar knows a thing or two, and he keeps the illustrious Metternich guessing by having a double, who may be called upon one moment to officiate as Prince Charming to one girl and told not to kiss her, and the next to play a Casanova rôle to a knowledgeful Countess. Not even Christel knows after a while whether she has been talking to the Czar or his double","excerpt":"in fact, she does not know that he has a double.It is distinctly amusing when the double, known as Uralsky, is suddenly informed by the Czar's aide, while peacefully working on tapestry as he chants \\"The Volga Boatman,\\" that he must go to the opera and be sure not to yawn. His life is emphatically an unhappy one, for he has all the boredom and none of the pleasures of being Czar. If there is a long line of women to kiss, Uralsky is called upon, while the Czar is saying sweet nothings to Christel in a café and being entertained by a singer.The Czar sends word to Christel to come to \\"her villa\\" at a moment when all the other glove sales girls are expressing doubt about Christel's story of having met the ruler of Russia. Here there is a joyous series of scenes wherein Christel bows and bows and bows to everybody as she rides in the satin-covered open coach. When she reaches her lovely villa she skips and leaps around, so frightfully glad to have a Czar for a sweetheart—and such a handsome Czar, who incidentally is impersonated by Henri Garat. And, of course, M. Garat, a native of France, also acts Uralsky, who is supposed to cover up a bald spot on his pate with a wig.There is a potpourri of tongues in this film, what with Miss Harvey's English, M. Garat's French accent, Herr Veidt's deep German enunciation; likewise Lil Dagover's agreeable manner of speaking English, and several British players. The photography might be better in many scenes, for some of them are often too gray and occasionally out of focus. The direction of Eric Charell, however, is most capable, and in many of the episodes there are hosts of people, all in costume.Herr Charell has a good sense of humor, which is never better shown than when he reveals the Congress seats all deserted. The dance music starts things by causing the eminent statesmen and monarchs to rock back and forth in perfect rhythm on their chairs, and then they all leave the serious subject of Napoleon's exile for the waxed floor. Only Metternich is left, with empty chairs swaying to the music before him.Mr. Veidt is quite effective in his part. Fräulein Davoger is excellent as a Viennese countess. Henri Garat does splendid work in the dual characterization, but his English is not always understandable. Others who serve this film laudably are Gibb McLaughlin, Eugen Rex, Reginald Purdell and Tarquini d'Or.

Please explain the differences between sleet, hail, freezing rain and snow.   A. Sleet is a word generally applied to rain that has frozen, or partly frozen, as it falls. It is most likely to occur when temperatures at ground level are below freezing but, because of a temperature inversion, the rain itself is falling from a slightly warmer region overhead. Hail, by contrast, is formed in storm clouds as ice. A thunderhead, can be 30,000 feet high or more, and temperatures at the top can be very cold. A small grain of ice can make many trips up and down, carried by currents in the cloud, adding a layer of ice at each trip until it becomes so heavy the currents can no longer keep it from falling. Unlike sleet, hail can fall on a hot day","excerpt":"in fact, since thunderstorm clouds are more frequent in winter, hail is more probable on a hot day than a cold one. Freezing rain overlaps considerably with sleet and also involves a temperature inversion; it happens when rain, usually very cold but not quite freezing, falls on solid objects that are below the freezing point, encasing them in a layer of clear ice.

There were times when the vocal renditions came with marvelous precision from the images on the screen and then there were moments when the tonal quality was burdened with the resonance of the reproducing horns. The stronger and more vibrant voices came forth with better effect than the weaker ones. But the synchronization was in all cases a triumph for the producers.Marion Talley's renditions are as a matter of fact far better than that in which she was heard some months ago at Warner's Theatre. The quartet from \\"Rigoletto,\\" with Beniamino Gigli, Marion Talley, Giuseppe de Luca and Jeanne Gordon, was effectively presented on the screen and beautifully rendered with a minimum of grating in the tranquil periods.Charles Hackett's singing of \\"La Donna e Mobile,\\" from \\"Rigoletto,\\" was exceptionally fine","excerpt":"in fact, something comparable with Martinelli's Vitaphone rendering of an operatic air at the initial Vitaphone offering. Mr. Hackett's voice is true and clear, and whatever there was in the way of a soft purr during certain interludes, it did not in any way detract from the beauty of the aria as a whole.It seemed rather a mistake, after having presented the operatic airs, for Warner brothers to stoop to selections such as \\"She Knows Her Onions,\\" which, although it possessed an element of humor, was rather a sharp contrast from the classical music.As in the case of \\"Don Juan\\" and \\"The Better 'Ole,\\" the feature picture of the occasion, \\"When a Man Loves,\\" was accompanied with a Vitaphone reproduction of an orchestra directed by Henry Hadley. This orchestra effect was so good that there were many in the audience who forgot until the last moment that there were no musicians in the pit. They were reminded of the absence of the orchestra when the body of musicians was depicted on the screen, and then the spectators were moved to applaud.\\"When a Man Loves\\" is a good entertainment, with Mr. Barrymore in a gallant rôle. He not only proves his prowess with the sword, but stirs the poor devils in the \\"hell hold\\" of a French prison ship to break loose from their shackles and wreak vengeance on the officers and crew of the vessel. Meanwhile, Mr. Barrymore, as the indomitable but frequently disappointed Fabien des Grieux, escapes from the murderous craft with Manon Lescaut, and one perceives them plunging forward toward the American coast with a tiny sail on their small boat.Throughout this production one has ample opportunity to study Mr. Barrymore's perfect profile. It is rare, in fact, that he presents his full face to the screen.In the strong scene aboard the prison vessel Mr. Barrymore goes about his actions with admirable vigor, but he is perhaps more pleasing and more interesting in the gambling sequence with Louis XV. This chapter shows Des Grieux being picked out by the King to take a hand at ecarté, and one learns that the King is not above carrying a few aces up his capacious, richly laced sleeves. Des Grieux is no fool and, King or no King, he is not going to gamble for Manon against the King's dominions without making a desperate attempt to outwit the regal player.It is, however, decidedly awkward for Des Grieux when he shows the King an ace of diamonds as the last card, and the King also holds an ace of the same suit. This Louis XV can assuredly do no wrong, and therefore Des Grieux has to indulge in a battle of swords, a mere matter of a dozen to one, but when there are more men waiting on the other side of the door Des Grieux realizes that he must capitulate.Dolores Costello is extraordinarily beautiful and frequently very weepy as Manon. Nobody can blame her for shedding tears, considering the heart-thrusts she undergoes in her adventurous career.The story is far more coherently told than a recent version of \\"Manon Lescaut\\" presented at the Cameo Theatre. It leaps at times over misfortunes, for one leaves the struggling Manon and the hearstick Des Grieux in one scene to find them in the next affluent and gorgeously clad.Money is evidently no object to this Des Grieux, for he hurls thousands of francs at the lovelorn Manon in one scene, and during his card duel with the King he leaves a pile of thousand-franc notes to be stolen by André Lescaut.Warner Oland, who has officiated in the rôles of many villains, is excellent as Manon's scheming brother. Stuart Holmes, another portrayer of screen scoundrels, lends his talent this time to officiating as Louis XV.

I have traveled all around Switzerland and this description is only half right. The Lake District does have alpine mountains, storybook villages set on azure lakes, thrilling skiing, expensive hotels and many citizens of European descent. But unlike the Swiss, the Chileans haven't realized that some  visitors like to balance their natural wonders with good shopping. In Chile, it's genuinely difficult to find postcards","excerpt":"in fact, the amiable people seem a little surprised that a foreigner would vacation in their country.         Temuco, 422 miles south of Santiago, is the gateway to the Lake District. It  was founded in 1881, after a treaty with the fiercely tenacious Mapuche, who had managed to fend off first the Incas and then the Spanish conquistadors. Most tourists fly to Temuco from Santiago, the Chilean capital, rent a car, and take  off for the nearby water-sports and ski resorts, but the city has considerable charm and the best Mapuche crafts in southern Chile. In many ways, it's like stepping into an old Western town.

Despite Mr. Denny's marvelous energy in this film, which was adapted from a novel by Elmer Davis, the humorous twists in the story proved excellent hot weather entertainment. It has a rapidity of action which barely gives Mr. Denny an opportunity to take a good, Ions, deep breath, and although it is a diversion with few plausible moments, there are situations which defy almost anybody to keep a straight face.Mr. Denny plays the part of an impecunious young professor, who to collect a few shekels decides to write a book during his vacation. It is a dry, Darwinian theme, and perhaps this is one of the reasons that he finds it difficult to concentrate on his work. Other reasons crop up with amazing frequency, and Professor Alexander Deupree is eventually placed in the position of having to officiate as an escort to three different parties at dinner in the \\"Hanging Gardens.\\"He had had enough orange juice, diluted with synthetic gin, to make him merry long before the evening repast, and it occurs to his muddled mind that the only way in which he can officiate as host at three different tables in the same restaurant unknown to his guests, is to be called every five minutes to the telephone. You therefore see him having soup at one table with two charming girls, and then the boy cries out his name, and Deupree forthwith dashes to the second table, where a friend's wife is awaiting him. There he has soup again. Up in a sort of balcony a wealthy and plethoric lady is looking forward to dining tête á tête with the flattering professor. Deupree is called again by the faithful bellboy and he presents himself to Miss Agnes Clavenger, who that afternoon had submitted to beauty doctors. She has never imbibed champagne, but longs to do go. Deupree, having gathered his wits together, finds that the headwaiter has some extra dry ginger ale with a champagne flavor. The label is covered and Miss Clavenger is none the wiser","excerpt":"in fact, the beverage makes her quite kittenish.Many a vexed expression is turned on Professor Deupree when he indulges in a boisterous dance, and gradually the other women he is, entertaining turn up their noses at him. Added to this dilemma he remembers that another young woman is in his apartment, having taken refuge there from her furious husband, Frank Pemberton, who tips the scale at an eighth of a ton, and is quite active withal. Mrs. Pemberton happens to have been an old flame of the professor before she web Pemberton.Big Pemberton suspects the professor, and there ensues one of those long chases from room to room, in and out of an elevator, and through narrow passage ways.It is quite obvious to anybody that the motion-picture edition of this story is only a slapstick version of Mr. Davis's yarn. There are familiar touches which one does not usually find in books, but which are resorted to by film producers, who distribute their laughs as showmen. You have a scene that is likely, and then something removed from the bounds of probability. A waiter slips on a piece of ice, and the women and men in the theatre laughed at his fall. The professor goes forth to buy real orange juice, and an automobile passes and splashes him with a regular coating of mud. The audience roared. It happened again and merriment was rife.Mr. Denny has an appealing personality, and this picture may create much joy, but the producers would do well to give Mr. Denny a vehicle which is more plausible, without the bladder and balloon fun. Harold Lloyd can do this sort of thing better, and Mr. Lloyd's screen efforts are much more original than this version of \\"I'll Show You the Town.\\"Lilyan Tashman, Marion Nixon, Margaret Livingston and Hayden Stevenson render able support to Mr. Denny.

Most of the anthology was to comprise original productions, but these were to be supplemented with licensed recordings, where pertinent or historically desirable.
