These men were never treated for the disease, even after penicillin became available, nor were they even told that their conditions were treatable.   Although I regard the idea that H.I.V. was engineered as implausible and unlikely, I no longer consider it to be ludicrous and impossible. I read about the Tuskegee study in a book.

Deciding that a patient is in a persistent vegetative state represents a medical judgment, whereas the judgment that a patient in a persistent vegetative state should be allowed to die is a moral judgment and should not be recast as a medical judgment based on a misguided appeal to a futility argument.   This is not to say that physicians should not be allowed to make both types of judgments, but the right to make moral judgments for incompetent patients diminishes as the evidence of the patient's previously expressed wishes becomes clearer. Hence, although the family's authority to make decisions for patients should not be absolute, when the family is making a \\"substituted\\" judgment for the patient, as Oliver Wanglie is doing for his wife, constraints should not be placed on familial autonomy.

But how much, and how to do it? This guide to the problems and the main proposals before Congress was prepared by Diane Rowland and Peter Long of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a national health care philanthropy. PROBLEMS The Uninsured: 37 Million   Millions of Americans become uninsured each year, most of them because they do not get insurance on the job and cannot afford to buy it. In 1992, 37 million Americans -- 15 percent of the non-elderly population -- were uninsured on any given day. Because the elderly have Medicare coverage and the very poor and disabled generally have Medicaid, the overwhelming majority of the uninsured (84 percent) are full- or part-time workers and their families.   The high cost of insurance limits coverage. Seven in 10 uninsured Americans make less than $30,000 a year. Although the uninsured do get care, they get less, get it later and end up sicker than people with insurance. The Vulnerable   While most Americans have insurance, changing jobs can often mean losing coverage: two-thirds of companies with fewer than 25 employees do not offer coverage. In the course of a year, one in five Americans -- more than 50 million people -- will be uninsured at least temporarily and one-third will be without insurance for at least a year. Only 7 percent of uninsured adults say they are uninsured by choice. Six in 10 say they cannot afford coverage and 22 percent cite loss of a job or lack of on-the-job insurance. Three percent can't get coverage because of health problems. The Cost of Care   The U.S. is the only major industrial nation that does not provide universal health coverage, yet it spends far more than any other country on health -- more than $800 billion a year, 14 percent of the gross domestic product. And the portion is growing: without cost-containment measures, it is expected to top 18 percent by the year 2000. From 1988 to 1993, the average family premium for employer-based group health insurance doubled, from $2,500 to $5,200. Families wanting to buy health insurance directly from an insurer can spend as much as $10,000 a year. CHOICES Single-Payer   The single-payer plan would create a universal public system of health insurance coverage with comprehensive benefits financed by income and payroll taxes instead of premiums. All Americans would be covered, in much the same way the elderly are now covered by Medicare. Employerbased coverage, private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid would be replaced by a single plan. Costs would be controlled through administrative simplification and by a national budget with Government-regulated payment rates for doctors and hospitals. (Example: McDermott-/Wellstone bill.) Employer Mandate   Employer-based approaches build on the already extensive system that provides private insurance to two-thirds of the non-elderly population. To achieve universal coverage, all employers would have to offer insurance to employees and help pay the premiums. The Government would provide coverage or help pay for private insurance for nonworkers","excerpt":"Medicare would be kept for the elderly.   To contain costs, some plans would regulate prices and set spending limits; others would expand use of managed care, and promote increased competition among health insurance plans. Some plans call for regional alliances, which would spool the purchasing power of small business and promote price competition among plans. (Examples: Clinton plan, House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee bill.) Individual Mandate   This approach places the responsibility for obtaining coverage on individuals and families, rather than employers or the Government. To achieve universal coverage, people would be required to obtain insurance either through their employers or by buying it on the private market. The Government would subsidize premium costs for low-income individuals and families. Employers could cover some of the premium costs, but would not be required to.   Costs would be controlled by promoting increased consumer consciousness, greater use of managed care and greater competition among health plans. (Examples: Thomas-Chafee bill, Stearns-Nickles bill). No Mandate   Voluntary plans build on the existing system by providing incentives to expand coverage and control costs, but do not mandate coverage. Expanded coverage would be encouraged through reforms in the private health insurance market (Like eliminating ineligibility for those with pre-existing conditions), subsidies for low-income people and alliances to help small companies and individuals buy insurance.   This approach would control costs and make coverage more affordable by increasing competition among proivate insurance plans and cost consciousness among consumers. (Examples: Cooper-Breaux bill, Michel-Lott bill.) ASSESSING THE PLANS Single-Payer   All Americans would have comprehensive health benefits through a single system, regardless of income or employment. This approach would reduce much of the complexity of the present system, but it would shift most of the financing from employers and the private sector to the tax system. It would virtually eliminate a role for private insurance and would concentrate control of the health care system under the Federal Government. It would greatly expand the role of the Government in health, but also provide Government with greater purchasing power to control costs. Employer Mandate   Employer-based approaches expand insurance coverage with the least disruption to current arrangements and would minimize change for most Americans. They rely on employers to cover workers and on the Government to provide coverage for nonworkers. Employers and their employees, rather than the Government, pay most of the cost for insuring all workers and their families.   Employer mandates would mean higher health insurance costs for some businesses, especially small companies that do not offer insurance today. Government assistance to businesses could help avoid wage cuts, job losses and other potential effects.   The mobility of the work force makes this approach administratively complex and requires explicit mechanisms to assure continuous coverage. Cost control based on greater use of managed care and competition among health plans would require much restructuring of the market, without assured effectiveness. Individual Mandate   Making individuals responsible for insurance would break the link between employment and insurance coverage -- easing the mobility of the labor force, but also potentially removing business as a source of financing and a force in controlling costs.   Government subsidies could be directed to low-wage workers and low-income families rather than more broadly applied to businesses, but the loss of employer contributions would mean substantial tax increases for Federal subsidies to make insurance affordable, without adequate subsidies, coverage could remain beyond the reach of many Americans.   An individual-based program would substantially alter current insurance arrangements, and would be complicated to administer and hard to enforce. Increasing consumer awareness could help restain costs, but unless they join alliances, consumers would lack the purchasing power that big employers have now. No Mandate   Voluntary approaches provide incentives for cost control and for reaching the uninsured and the vulnerable, but no assurances that these problems will be fully addressed. Market reforms and expanded coverage for low-income people would reduce the number of uninsured but not assure universal coverage.   Expanded coverage of low-income people would require additional Federal revenue. Cost containment would depend largely on the success of free-market competition in restraining premium increases.

Was it respect for human life, or was it Medicare money?    My late wife, who suffered from a severe dementia and metastacized cancer, was admitted to a community hospital in December 1988. She was comatose. The admitting physician said she would last only a few days and that they would keep her comfortable. After four days, her doctor asked my permission to insert a feeding tube through her nostril. I refused. The doctor said: \\"If we can't treat her, Medicare won't pay for her.\\"   The hospital authorities told me that Medicare will not pay for custodial care. She would have to be moved to a nursing home. No bed could be found for her in a nursing home. She was in the hospital nine days. The bill to Medicare, which was paid, was in the neighborhood of $10,700.   Meanwhile, the admitting physician called in two friends: an oncologist and a urologist. Neither I nor any family member, who were constantly at my wife's bedside -- she was never alone -- ever met these two men. Yet both submitted identical bills to Medicare for a comprehensive examination and four visits.   Why did they stop at four visits when she was in the hospital for nine days? Obviously, they knew that Medicare would not pay for more than four visits unless they could show treatment.

Known to Phoenicians and Greeks from the beginning of the first millenium B.C., the history of the port of Monaco is coextensive with that of southeastern France for much of its history. A western colony of the great trading city-state of Genoa in the 13th century, Monaco in 1368 became an independent principality under the rule of the Matignon-Grimaldi family. At various times a protectorate of Spain, France, and Sardinia, it was restored to independence in 1861 by the Franco-Monegasque treaty. In 1911 Monaco became a constitutional monarchy under the Matignon-Grimaldi dynasty. In 1918 France required the principality to conform to its national interests in all respects; by an agreement of 1919, should the dynasty fail to produce a male heir, Monaco would be absorbed into France. However, the family is allowed to adopt an heir if they so choose. The marriage of Prince Ranier III to the U.S film star Grace Kelly produced an heir apparent for this generation. The constitutional monarchy under its “Most Serene Prince” is essentially a one-party state in which the National and Democratic Union won all 18 seats in the National Council in 1968, 1978, 1983, and 1988, though in competition with the Socialist party. In 1993 Monaco became the smallest member nation of the U.N.. Despite the fame of the Monte Carlo casino, gambling accounts for only 4 percent of the principality's revenues. The principal industry is tourism, followed by light manufacturing. Monaco also supports a prominent institute of oceanography. Land reclamation projects, impelled by a real estate boom, have added about 20 percent to the nation's territory since World War II.

The day starts at about 5:30 A.M., when a guide meets visitors at their hotel and escorts them to snack shops, where they join Shanghai workers for a breakfast of bean soup, noodles and cakes. A short walk leads to Ninghai East Road Market, where the guide helps guests buy a basket of vegetables and then takes them, by bus or by foot, to the host's home.   The program's organizer, the Huang Pu District Administration, chooses households in which three generations live together. Visitors may join the older members of the family for morning exercises or just wander the neighborhood. Later, the guest returns \\"home\\" to help prepare lunch.    The afternoon can include a stroll along the Huangpu River, a visit to a Taoist temple or a stop at a neighborhood school. Then it is dinner at home with the family.    Reservations should be made at least a day in advance through Shanghai Great World International Travel Service, 25 Tibet Road, Shanghai (phone 372-5926). The fee, about $50 a person, includes transportation and meals and is divided between the company, the district and the family.
