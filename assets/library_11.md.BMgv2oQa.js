His achievements during the last quarter of a century have been so varied that the retrospective at P.S. 1 Museum, \\"Dennis Oppenheim: And the Mind Grew Fingers,\\" can seem like the work of several artists. It is fun, sort of in the way a roller-coaster ride can be fun, with wild ups and downs and occasional stomach-churning surprises.

Towering like an icon, this is a Trojan horse-like assemblage designed by Jun Maeda from twigs and branches. Would that Mr. van Itallie's play had lived up to Mr. Maeda's design. \\"Ancient Boys\\" is itself like a Trojan horse, promising one thing (a probing study of the effects of AIDS) and delivering another (a sentimentalized dramatization of a death in a family).   Although the play may derive from deep personal feelings, the central character, a scenic designer and sculptor named Ruben, is seen at a distance through a purple haze of idealization. Frequently the audience is informed that Ruben is greatly admired, that he is in fact a genius. Neither the playwright's conception nor Michael Ornstein's performance approximates that genius.

It is a voice well suited to interpreting the lyrics of Dorothy Fields, whose work Ms. Mayes is performing at Eighty-Eight's, 228 West 10th Street, Manhattan, Friday evenings at 11 P.M. through Dec. 27. She also recently completed an album of Fields's songs, which DRG Records is to release in two weeks.   The most important female lyricist from the golden age of the Broadway musical, Fields expressed a playful feminine assertiveness in her songs while shying away from outright defiance of the masculine romantic standards laid down by Ira Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Lorenz Hart and other eminent songwriters in the theater. Ms. Mayes does not dwell on the nuances of Fields's lyrics, but her bright, mostly vibratoless singing has a self-assured swagger, and she is not afraid of taking interpretive risks.

Their patron was an expatriate Swedish Queen, and the organization -- founded in Rome in 1690 and consisting of musicians, poets, artists and thinkers -- called itself the Arcadian Academy.

They are, after all, operating within the constraints of a Reagan-Bush legacy that has dismantled important levers of government, especially in the domestic agencies. They are also working with a President who had wasted political capital for four years by scorning the idea that he needed to communicate, or even develop, a coherent theme and long-range strategy for his Presidency.
