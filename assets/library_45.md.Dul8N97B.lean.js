Imagine the Grace Kelly of &quot","excerpt":"Rear Window&quot; or the Kim Novak of &quot;Vertigo&quot; sprawled seductively on an analyst's couch, smoking cigarettes and confiding her sexual frustration to a repressed, wide-eyed shrink who is obsessed with her. The movie establishes a mood of playful erotic suspense in the first 10 minutes and sustains its cat-and-mouse game between therapist and patient through variations that are by turns amusing, titillating and mildly scary. The running joke is its revelation at the outset that the shrink (Fabrice Luchini) is not really a therapist but a repressed, lonely tax accountant.  Ms. Bonnaire's troubled character has accidentally strayed into the wrong office, located  on the same floor where the psychoanalyst she intended to consult practices a few doors  away.  The movie takes place less in the real world than in the realm of voyeuristic fantasy, in other words, in the realm of film itself. In the spirit of the best Hitchcock, it is seriously light.

In setting up his ontological argument for the existence of God, Anselm makes a distinction between ''existing in the understanding'' and ''existing in reality.'' Applying this distinction, if there is a strange, undiscovered species of ant deep in the Amazon rain forest, then this species:  a. Exists in reality and exists in the understanding.  b. Exists in reality but does not exist in the understanding.  c. Does not exist in reality but exists in the understanding.  d. Does not exist in reality and does not exist in the understanding.  e. May or may not exist in the understanding.    2. ''European peoples in medieval times knew that the earth was flat.'' The most important reason for disagreeing with this claim is that:  a. Medieval peoples did not have conclusive proof that the earth was flat.  b. There is a Flat Earth Society that continues to have active members today.  c. European peoples in medieval times had no direct evidence for thinking that the earth was flat.  d. Some members of medieval society believed that the earth was round.  e. The earth isn't flat.    3. According to Descartes, ''customs and habits'' do not provide a firm ground for knowledge. His main argument for this claim is that:  a. Different customs and habits in different cultures lead to beliefs that conflict with those of other cultures.  b. People tend to be less critical of beliefs that are deeply ingrained by customs and habits.  c. Customs do not promote ''good sense,'' which is the ability to distinguish true from false.  d. The passing down of received opinion from generation to generation distorts the original knowledge and leads to false beliefs.  e. Most people in Descartes's time were never exposed to the customs and habits of other regions of the world.    4. Based on what Descartes writes in the first two parts of the ''Discourse on Method,'' the three faculties of mind -- listed in order from the most reliable for acquiring knowledge to the least reliable for acquiring knowledge -- are:  a. Imagination","excerpt":"reason; senses.  b. Imagination; senses; reason.  c. Reason; imagination; senses.  d. Reason; senses; imagination.  e. Senses; reason; imagination.    ''Introduction to Philosophy''  Prof. Gary Varner, Texas A&M    1. In his famous statement ''I think, therefore I am,'' Descartes was arguing that:  a. Humans are superior to animals because we think but they do not.  b. Because minds have phenomenal consciousness while bodies do not, minds have greater perfection or substance than bodies.  c. Even if he was completely mistaken or deceived about all of his thoughts, he could still say with certainty that he exists as a thinking thing, because in order to be mistaken or deceived, he must exist as a mind.    2. Which of the following is the conception of philosophy that is implicit in the abbreviation Ph.D.?  a. Being philosophical means reflecting on events intellectually rather than reacting to them emotionally.  b. A philosophy is a summary statement of one's general approach to a task or one's opinion on an issue.  c. Philosophy is all rational, systematic knowledge.  d. Philosophy is, or at least should be, the systematic study of certain non-empirical but enduring questions emphasizing clearly stated arguments and analysis of key terms.    3. Which of the following could a valid argument have?  a. False premises and a true conclusion.  b. True premises and a true conclusion.  c. False premises and a false conclusion.  d. Any of the above.  e. Either a. or c. but not b.    ''Historical Introduction to Western Philosophy''  Prof. Harvey Cormier,  SUNY, Stony Brook    1. Kant thinks that the one highest good, the one thing good in itself, is:  a. A good will.  b. Happiness.  c. Reason.  d. Love.    2. Identify among the following choices what William James would call a ''living'' option.  a. The choice between living in America or living in Europe.  b. The choice between being a Republican or being a Democrat.  c. The choice between getting married or staying single.  d. The question doesn't make sense because what is a living option for one person may not be living for another; ''living-ness'' is subjective.    ''Moral Choices''  Prof. Bonnie Steinbock,  SUNY, Albany    1. Most people would prefer life in prison to being executed. This does not show that death is a superior deterrent to life in prison because:  a. Those who would be deterred from committing a crime by the threat of execution might also be deterred by the lesser punishment of life in prison; while those who were not deterred by the threat of life in prison might not have been deterred by the threat of execution.  b. There are some classes of people (e.g., those willing to commit murder for hire) for whom the death penalty would undoubtedly be a significant deterrent.  c. Death effectively incapacitates the offender.    2. In Furman v. Georgia, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the death penalty is:  a. Permissible in the case of brutal rape.  b. Inherently unconstitutional.  c. Unconstitutional if arbitrarily and capriciously imposed.    3. If Roe v. Wade were overturned:  a. Abortion would become illegal throughout the country.  b. Legality of abortion would be a matter of state law.  c. The fetus's right to life would be recognized.    4. One difference between the abortion debate and the embryonic stem cell research debate is that:  a. Abortion raises the question of the moral status of the embryo while embryonic stem cell research does not.  b. There is religious opposition to abortion but not to embryonic stem cell research.  c. Abortion raises the issue of bodily self-determination while embryonic stem cell research does not.

Parts of Manhattan go in and out of favor, just as fashions do.

They stand for some shift in the city's mood, its view of the present or its desire to escape into some fantasy of change.         This year, the city wants to pose with Chelsea. It wants to stride along the  Avenue of the Americas, where an influx of superstores have brought to life the  decaying old department-store buildings north of 17th Street. It wants to firm up its torso at the David Barton Gym, and drape itself in a sheet of Egyptian cotton from Bed, Bath and Beyond. It longs to don a pair of designer eye frames  from Alain Mikli, assume a studious expression and pluck some Kierkegaard from the shelves at Barnes & Noble. Later, as the sun sinks into the Hudson River, the city will bask in the glowing fluorescent rainbow of Dan Flavin's light sculptures at the Dia Center for the Arts on West 22d Street, try Rollerblading  at the Chelsea Piers sports complex on the Hudson, and rush the stage for a curtain call at the Joyce Theater.

They live in Mediterranean Revival style homes that range from mansions to cottages. There is little residential turnover, and houses currently on the market are priced from $65,000 to $95,000. There are also some 200 businesses, among them gift and antiques shops and service stores. \\n\\nSettled by a handful of fruit farmers in the early 1890's, Delray Beach grew steadily after the Florida East Coast Railroad reached it from the North in 1896. By the 1920's, it was widely known as a winter resort.\\n\\nAlthough its population is mainly full time, it still grows in the winter by about 8,000 -- part-time residents and tourists for whom hotels and restaurants have sprung up.\\n\\nA few years ago, concerned about creeping downtown blight, the hair stylist, Norman Radin, who owns a salon in the area, founded the Pineapple Grove Support Group. It began lobbying the city for money and for recognition of the area's potential.\\n\\nThe group got the City Commission to approve the name change, to provide trash receptacles bearing a pineapple logo and to rename the neighborhood's main thoroughfare Pineapple Grove Way. \\n\\nLast year the city committed the $3 million in bond money to Pineapple Grove projects, including a $2.6 million conversion of two historic school houses into a complex of art galleries, studios, shops and an auditorium, and $500,000 in such public improvements as new street lights.\\n\\nThe state awarded the city a $24,000 matching grant to prepare a historic renovation plan for a five-acre portion of Pineapple Grove known as Banker's Row. An artists' colony in the 1920's, it later fell victim to neglect. Today, several of 16 historic structures have been or are being privately restored. \\n\\nThe city's Community Redevelopment Agency is working out an incentive package in which owners or buyers of Banker's Row property would get low-interest loans to rehabilitate their properties.

Two sites were combined and conveyed about four years ago to the Federal Government, which is constructing a 969,000-square-foot building that will house the Northeast Regional Headquarters of the Social Security Administration, with its 4,000 employees.
