But what might that dour operagoer have been hearing? For Beethoven countered this sober drama with an irrepressible score, perhaps the most luminous and ennobling that has ever graced an operatic stage. On this topic, Mr. Miller's discussion fell back on seemingly inevitable terms like lift-off, launching and flying.

West Bank settlers formally broke relations with Mr. Netanyahu and announced that they were seeking a new candidate, while the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, also faced protests at home.   A1    The Wye agreement between Israel and the Palestinians has been met with reticence among Arab leaders, who have signaled a common mistrust of the intentions of Mr. Netanyahu and doubt about American motives.   A8    European Union Protects Data  The European Union put into effect a law prohibiting American-style buying and selling of personal data, a move that could interrupt electronic commerce with the United States if the two sides fail to resolve differences over protecting privacy.   A1    Europe Leans to Open Markets  Leaders of the 15-member European Union agreed at the close of a weekend summit meeting in Austria to pursue less restrictive economic and monetary policies to guard against a world recession. Germany and countries that have followed its lead in cutting deficits now seem set to press the independent European central bank to let up and allow them to use the new European currency to stimulate economic growth.   A6    I.R.A. Maintains Its Arsenal  The Irish Republican Army continues to maintain a huge secret arsenal, despite this year's peace accord and efforts by Protestant and Catholic leaders to persuade it to disarm, according to Irish and British officials and other experts. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland said that because of controversy over disarmament, the Oct. 31 deadline for the creation of a new North-South Council would be missed.

A15    Gender Just One Factor in Race  For just the third time in the nation's history, two women are running against each other for the United States Senate. In some ways, this race in Washington State illustrates the increasing political prominence of women. But with two very different candidates, it also shows that just having more women elected does not guarantee that any particular policies will be favored in Congress.   A18    In Georgia, 2 Sides of a Coin  The race for Georgia governor has centered on the question of whether the state's glass is half full or half empty. Roy E. Barnes, a Democratic legislator, presents himself as a steward of the state's recent progress. Guy W. Millner offers himself as an agent of change who will protect the most successful Democratic programs.

Slepian, the gynecologist who was killed by a sniper who fired into his home in Buffalo, continued to perform abortions in the face of threats not because he was a narrow, pro-abortion zealot, his friends said, but because he was a well-rounded doctor who believed in a woman's right to choose and wanted to practice the full range of medicine he had been taught.   A1    MOMA Gives Up 4 Works  The Museum of Modern Art, bound by a clause in a benefactor's will, has quietly given to other museums four works valued at more than $40 million. At her death in 1948, the benefactor, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, left to the museum she helped found two drawings by van Gogh and two by Seurat. She stipulated that 50 years after her death, when, she estimated, the works would no longer be modern, they be given up.   A1    Senate Candidates Debate  Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and Representative Charles E. Schumer laid out sharply different views on tax cuts, gun control and abortion rights in a free-flowing debate marked by sarcastic retorts and efforts by each man to try to discredit the other's credentials. Unlike their first debate, this one did cover the issues.   B1    Hospital Faulted in Death  The state Department of Health has officially faulted New York Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn for its role in the malnutrition death of an infant who was turned aside for care at a clinic when her mother, Tatiana Cheeks, had neither money nor a Medicaid card. On Friday, the department accepted the hospital's plan of correction, a 60-day program of staff re-education.

What Professor Lauren teaches is not just how to tie the proper Windsor knot or where to place the oars in the Adirondack Room, but also the business itself -- the Polo Paradigm, if you will. First, work with what sells. Second, details count, so do your homework. Third, never underestimate how badlypeople want to show that they have taste.   David Colman    Thomas O'Brien  In 1987, Thomas O'Brien joined Polo's fabled creative-services department, whose ranks are responsible for designing the interiors for all the stores and showrooms. ''It was an incredible opportunity,'' says O'Brien, who now owns Aero, the chic home-furnishings store and design firm in SoHo. O'Brien cites one key lesson: don't leave things to chance. ''Ralph is the hardest-working person I know,'' he says. ''Being innovative seems simple to a lot of people, but it takes a lot of vision.''    Ellen O'Neill  As a vice president of design for four hotel brands -- the St. Regis, the Luxury Collection, Sheraton and Four Points -- Ellen O'Neill is currently overseeing the Sheraton chain's face-lift. As an executive at Ralph Lauren Home, she learned to obsess over details like the difference between six varieties of blue-and-white stripes. ''Ralph taught you to focus on the quintessential, iconic item in American culture, and how to perfect it,'' she says.    Mark Cunningham  Hired to oversee the development of the Los Angeles Polo store, Mark Cunningham was soon transferred to New York, where he rolled out boutiques throughout the United States. In 2003, he and a colleague, Margaret Hamilton, who worked in advertising, opened the home-furnishings store March in San Francisco. At Polo, he learned how to adapt to different styles yet remain consistent. ''You could be doing modern, Santa Fe, Maine or even a combination,'' he says, ''but there's always a stress on keeping it fresh.''    Thomas Beeton  Thomas Beeton, a decorator in Los Angeles, spent two years in the early 1990's as an in-house interior designer at the Polo store in Beverly Hills, Calif. (then operated as a franchise). For Beeton, who had run a design business before he went to Polo, the experience was a valuable one. ''No one else ever teaches you anything about running a business,'' he says. ''I really came away with a polished way of selling, presenting and packaging.''    Katharine Hable Sweeney  Katharine Hable Sweeney, one of the two sisters behind Hable Construction, the cheery, hand-printed-fabric-and-home-furnishings line, started at the Polo store in Memphis after college. Three years later, she graduated to the New York Ralph Lauren store, where she managed footwear. ''You become wrapped up in the whole excitement of all these creative people,'' she says. ''It's kind of like a really interesting cult.''    Ward Denton  In the early 90's, Ward Denton, a creative director at the Madison Avenue Polo store, met Christopher Gardner, who worked in the company's sales and management department. The two became a couple and later started the design firm Denton & Gardner, opening shops in SoHo and Bridgehampton, N.Y., where they offer 19th- and 20th-century antiques and oil paintings. Denton died last year, but Gardner still oversees the business.      Bill Sofield  As the architect for the construction company that built the Madison Avenue flagship in the mid-80's, Bill Sofield paid meticulous attention to the store's rich materials, which quickly made him a de facto member of the Polo team. He would go on to design the company's headquarters. After founding Aero with Thomas O'Brien, Sofield went on to solo fame as Tom Ford's architect du choix for the decadently modern Gucci stores. His latest project is the new Bottega Veneta Fifth Avenue boutique.

In such an instance, the company's management gives the bankruptcy judge a full plan that needs only the court's approval.

Rather than repeat the same rules, Mrs. Dietz provides her own and even mentions a few short cuts. Is the lilac choked with its own growth? It can be pruned. Are soil mixes too expensive?

White House statement says Nixon's attys, led by Prof Wright, are considering appealing Sirica's decision, and hints they might find some other method of sustaining Pres's legal position; special Watergate prosecutor A Cox, if faced with refusal by Nixon to accept ct's ruling or to challenge it by appeal, might initiate contempt proceedings or begin appeal of his own, based on ct's refusal to give him tapes directly; decision marks only 2d time in US history that a ct has required a Pres, against his will, to produce his personal records as evidence; 1st case involved Pres Jefferson; Sirica says he is 'simply unable' to decide whether Pres's refusal to release tapes and related documents is valid without inspecting recordings himself; upholds authority of ct to take such action; says that if he finds evidence relating to criminal activity in tapes, and it can be successfully separated from privileged statements dealing with Nixon's official duties, he will excise privilege portions and pass unprivileged portion along to Watergate grand jury; says if privilege and unprivileged evidence are so inextricably connected that separation becomes impossible, then 'whole must be privileged and no disclosure made to grand jury'; relies heavily, in decision, on decision by Chief Justice J Marshall that required Pres Jefferson to furnish lr for treason trial of A Burr; bases his decision to considerable extent on need for all citizens, regardless of their soc or pol position, to cooperate with grand jury investigation; calls it immaterial' whether ct has physical power' to enforce an order against Pres, because ct 'has a duty to issue appropriate orders' under any circumstances; says he disagrees with Pres 'that it is the exec that finally determines whether its privilege is properly invoked'; says that giving Pres special immunity from ct rulings 'tends to set White House apart as a 4th branch of govt'; says in his decision he found it necessary to answer only 2 questions: whether ct has jurisdiction to decide issue of privilege and whether ct has authority to enforce subpoena by way of an order requiring production for inspection in camera;
