It is a sequel that carries on with the same principal players and was likewise produced and directed by Satyajit Ray.And, as with \\"Pather Panchali,\\" the format and content of this film are remote from and very much in contrast to what we generally get from Hollywood. Like its exotic predecessor, it is a compound of documentary views of life in pre-liberation India, with some personal experiences and moods of its few principal characters conveyed at a pace that would try the patience of Job.Still, it is done with such rare feeling and skill at pictorial imagery, and with such sympathetic understanding of Indian character on the part of Mr. Ray, that it develops a sort of hypnotism for the serene and tolerant viewer who is willing to sit still for an hour and forty-eight minutes and let some stunning black-and-white pictures pass before his eyes.Actually, there is very little story or drama, in the usual sense, this being more in the nature of a chronicle of a woman's affection for her husband and her son. This is the woman who, in \\"Pather Panchali,\\" saw her little family disintegrate through her husband's going off to a distant city from their poor village and the death of her entrancing little daughter.Now, the mother, husband and son are together in the holy city of Benares, when this picture begins, and once more the family goes through a cycle of life, death and life going on. This persistence of life in the midst of difficulties probably accounts for the title, which, we are told, means \\"The Unvanquished\\" in our language. And persistence is in the tempo of the film.Slowly in episodic sequence, we see the husband take ill and die, the mother and small son leave Benares and go to a distant village to live, the son start his education in a local school and win a scholarship to a college in Calcutta, whither he goes.Now the son is an older fellow, not the lively youngster played by Subir Banerji in the early picture and by Pinaki Sen Gupta in the early part of this one. He is a tall, skinny, solemn adolescent, portrayed convincingly by Smaran Ghosal, and he acts in the undemonstrative manner that is no doubt authentic to his class.It is while he is away at college that the mother, lonesome for him, becomes ill and, in a series of scenes, conveys the essence of her deep but stoical love. Beautifully portrayed again by Karuna Banerji, the mother eventually dies and the son returns to college rather than remain in the village as a priest.Despite the meagerness of action, there are clear undertones in this film. Social customs and religious superstitions are subtly exposed and criticized. The fatal illness of the ineffectual father, again played touchingly by Kanu Banerji, is suggested as the consequence of bathing in the Ganges with the swarms of pilgrims who visit the Benares shrines. The old suspicion of education is interestingly implied, as is a comment on its English character in the pre-liberation schools.And Mr. Ray's remarkable camera catches beauty in so many things, from the softness of a mother's sad expression to the silhouette of a distant train, that innuendos take up the slack of drama. Hindu music and expressive natural sounds complete the stimulation of the senses in this strange, sad, evocative film.There are English subtitles.Also on the bill at the theatre is a thoroughly delightful little color cartoon, titled \\"Moonbird,\\" which sketches the experience of two youngsters who sneak out at night to try to catch a bird. It was designed and directed by John Hubley, and his two children provide the voices of the tots, who are just about the cutest animations in the modern style that we have ever seen.

The 3 to 2 decision, one N.R.C. commissioner complained, made ''a mockery of our emergency-planning regulations.'' That was echoed by Ellyn R. Weiss, general counsel of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which asked the N.R.C. to close the complex in 1979. ''There will never be a more clear-cut case for enforcing the rules,'' she said.  ''None of the commissioners even argued that there is preparedness today or will be in the future.'' But Nunzio J. Palladino, the chairman, said he voted with the majority because ''the necessary commitments have been made.'' Mr. Palladino added that he hoped a drill to test emergency preparations at the plants, which are 35 miles north of midtown Manhattan, would be held as soon as possible.

No reserved seats are sold for qualification days, and admission is $10 a person to the track, which is at West 16th Street and Georgetown Road.
