''He may be syndicated this fall,'' says Howell Wynne, the colt's principal owner, ''but I would still retain control and I would like to bring him back. If we think he might go farther, we'd like to try that, too.''   Phone Trick, a son of Clever Trick and the obscure Finnegan mare Over the Phone, was purchased as a 2-year-old for $85,000 by Wynne, who subsequently sold a 40 percent interest to Larry De Angelis, a Chicago investor, and 20 percent to Richard Mandella, the colt's trainer. The colt has yet to travel beyond seven furlongs but has been untouchable in sprints. Last Sunday, he won the True North Handicap at Belmont by just three-quarters of a length over Love That Mac, but was hand-ridden the last 50 yards and was carrying 10 pounds more than Love That Mac, who is the second-best sprinter in the country.
