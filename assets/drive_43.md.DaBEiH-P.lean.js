Now you need a little help. Here are some tips on how to get your dog immunized and how often, what sort of food it should be eating, where it can get a Swedish massage, and more. FOOD \\"One of the major nutritional issues with dogs in New York City is comparable to that of people,\\" Dr. Brodsky said. \\"They eat too well and exercise too little. People tend to manifest their love and bond with their dogs by feeding them too much.\\"   He recommends feeding a plump dog smaller servings of standard nutritional food and giving an under-exercised dog a higher-fiber variety. Most food companies now make \\"less active\\" or \\"light diet\\" selections.   Eating garbage off the streets is unhealthy and should be discouraged. If your dog does not respond to scolding, you may want to take it to the vet to make sure it isn't scavenging because of a nutritional deficiency. LICENSING  Licenses -- and the tags that come with them -- are required for all dogs in New York City, though the A.S.P.C.A. says that only about 140,000 of the city's two million to three million dogs are actually licensed.    The license costs $8.50, as does its yearly renewal, which the owner can get by calling the City Health Department, (212) 566-2456, and asking for an application. The fine for failing to license is $1,000","excerpt":"Sanitation Department workers are authorized to give summonses, although, truth told, they rarely do. LEASHNG  New York City law dictates that all dogs must be leashed when outdoors and that owners must clean up after their dogs, in the name of street cleanliness. There is a $250 fine for violating either the leash law or the poop-scooper law, and any Sanitation, Health Department, Parks and Recreation employee or city police officer is authorized to give a $250 summons for a violation.    But the laws are rarely enforced; about 250 poop-scooper summonses are issued each year. If you see someone failing to pick up after his or her dog, shame is the best revenge. SPAYING AND NEUTERING  The A.S.P.C.A. recommends spaying and neutering to keep the number of strays down. The A.S.P.C.A. will neuter male dogs for $55 and spay females for $65; the fee increases, proportionally, for dogs over 50 pounds. OBEDIENCE  If an owner expects to keep his shoulders intact, his or her dog must be taught quickly to walk properly, to obey the \\"heel!\\" command and to sit at corners, says Bob DeFranco, director of the Canines of America School of Dog Training in Rego Park, Queens.   Mr. DeFranco also receives a lot of calls from owners whose dogs pick fights with other dogs in the park. This too should be dealt with quickly in obedience training, at an early age.   \\"All a dog hears when its owner talks is 'blah, blah, blah,' \\" he said. \\"We have to teach people early on to communicate with their dog so he understands that he is not leader of the pack.\\" SHOTS  Rabies shots are mandatory in New York State; they cost $10 at the A.S.P.C.A. and about $45 at a veterinarian. Do it two years in a row and you are home free for the next three years. In addition, puppies should get distemper, hepatitis and parainfluenza shots every four weeks until they are 22 weeks old; older dogs should get yearly boosters. Kennel cough shots are recommended for dogs that spend a lot of time in kennels.   Dr. Stuart Brodsky, a veterinarian at the West Side Veterinary Center on West 83d Street, recommends that dog owners who spend weekends in the country consider Lyme disease vaccines. BARKING  \\"Dogs bark because of separation anxiety,\\" Mr. DeFranco said. \\"The dog says: 'Oh my God, my owners are gone, I need to chew something, I need to bark.' \\" To break your dog of this habit before your neighbor down the hall breaks its neck, Mr. DeFranco suggests rewards when it follows commands. This helps to build the dog's self-confidence and makes it less anxious when you are away.   Another trick: \\"Bye-bye bones,\\" a rawhide variety that is hollowed out and filled with food treats that take the dog a long time to dig out. Or try toys stuffed with socks that smell like the owner.   For chronic barkers that do not benefit from positive reinforcement or treats, there are collars that give off high-frequency sounds that encourage them to stop and collars that give mild electronic shocks.  HOUSEBREAKING  Mr. DeFranco believes that city dogs need to be trained to urinate or defecate on command -- using a code word (like \\"park\\") that is repeated each time the dog goes until it learns the word and does its business on command. This takes about four to six weeks. A dog should be walked at least twice a day.  STRAYS  Largely because of the danger of rabies, you should not approach a stray at all. If you must, keep your hands at your side, do not look it in the eyes, and do not make any sudden movements that will make it feel challenged.   The New York City Emergency Animal Pickup Service, (718) 649-8600, will pick up strays Monday through Friday from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. After those hours, call the local police precinct if you believe that a dog may be a health hazard. PAMPERING  The city offers a number of dog day-care centers, a resource introduced five years ago when Joseph Sporn began Yuppie Puppy on West 86th Street. For $20 a day, a dog gets to romp with a half-dozen other dogs, watch cartoons and splash in a wading pool.   Or, people like Leda Hanson, a pet nanny, will take your dog to the groomer or the vet ($38 per half-hour) or even drive it to a country house for the weekend ($95 round trip).    And then there is the Pet Department Store, where, among other things, your dog can get a Swedish massage.   Why would a dog need a massage? \\"Why do people need a massage?\\" said Leigh Applebrook, the owner of the store, on West 54th Street. \\"If the dog has had trauma or an injury, or if it is suffering from tension, maybe fear, the massage really helps.\\" A 30-minute session of Swedish, shiatsu or Tellington touch is $30. (Mrs. Applebrook recommends a series of three sessions.)   For $50, you can leave the dog for a day of fun and beauty. The dog will have a nanny at its side all day who will play with it, feed it \\"nutritious food\\" and bottled water, exercise it on a treadmill, walk it outside every two hours and assist it in \\"interrelationship socializing.\\" An example of socializing? \\"Meeting a kitten for the very first time, under supervision,\\" Mrs. Applebrook said. ADOPTION  The A.S.P.C.A. is the major dog-adoption agency in the city. About 90 percent of all applicants are approved, but the society does interview potential dog-owners on their ability to care for a dog. The society also tries to make good matches (couch potatoes are paired with Great Danes, for instance; joggers are offered collies or some other strong, active dog; very busy people are steered away from puppies).   The adoption fee is $55, which includes spaying or neutering, vaccinations and one follow-up exam.   Another popular adoption agency is the North Shore Animal League, Port Washington, L.I., (516) 883-7575. SUMMER . . .  Like their owners, dogs left alone in apartments need air-conditioning, particularly pug-nosed types, which have difficulty breathing in hot weather. Of course, dogs should have plenty of water at all times in extreme heat; leave several bowls around if you plan to be out all day. . . . AND WINTER  If rock salt irritates your dog's paws, wipe them with a moist cloth after each walk. Boots help, too, but putting them on four times a day can be tedious. Ditto for sweaters. ABUSE  It is a misdemeanor offense to kill, maim, injure, torture, abandon or fail to provide food for a dog. Violators can be sent to prison for a year and fined $1,000. Having dogfights for profit or amusement is a felony, punishable with four years in jail and a $25,000 fine. Anyone who sees such abuses should call the A.S.P.C.A. -- in New York, (212) 876-7700. TOYS  As a rule, big toys for big dogs, small ones for puppies. Mrs. Applebrook of the Pet Department Store recommends, for city dogs, balls that light up when they are dropped, making them easily found in dark parks; an indoor frisbee that won't \\"ruin your crystal,\\" and feathered toys with a turkey odor that fit over doorknobs (endlessly amusing). DEATH  If your dog dies at home, call your vet, who can help you decide whether to have it cremated or buried in a pet cemetery. It's a good idea to check with the Better Business Bureau or ask around for recommendations.   A pet's death can be as painful as that of a family member. Therapy sessions are available to help children and adults deal with grief. Call the A.S.P.C.A. or write to Hospice, 58 Pearl Street, Kingston, N.Y. 12401.

I have searched without success for several Southeast Asian herbs: lemon grass, curry leaf and kaffir lime (sometimes called Ichang lime). Any information would be greatly appreciated. -- Douglas E. Nartker, Davenport, Iowa.     A. Lemon grass (Cymbopogon cipratus), also known as citronella or camel grass, is an aromatic member of the grass family, Gramineae, from tropical Asia. It is used in both Asian and South American cooking. The curry leaf tree (Murraya koenigii), an evergreen, is a member of the rue family related to the orange. It too is found in warm parts of Asia, and the leaves are used in curries. Kaffir lime or kaffir limeleaf (Citris hystria) is used in Thai cooking and imparts a lime flavor.   These and other fascinating Asian herbs are not easily found outside a few shops in cities with large Asian communities. But seeds of lemon grass plants and Chinese herbs and vegetables are available from the Oriental Seed Catalogue, Sunrise Enterprises, P.O. Box 330058, West Hartford, Conn. 06133. (The catalogue is $2, refunded on first order).   Cyrus Hyde, a collector of rare herbs and an owner of Well-Sweep Herb Farm, a New Jersey mail-order supplier, said he has lemon grass plants in stock. He said he expects to have curry leaf and kaffir limeleaf plants by spring. The address is 317 Mount Bethel Road, Port Murray, N.J. 07865. The catalogue is $2. Christmas Cactus Care     Q. My windowsill receives maybe two or three hours of sunlight daily. Can I grow a Christmas cactus there, and how do I care for it? -- Jeremy Levinson, Riverdale, Bronx.     A. Christmas cactuses (Schlumbergera truncata), now available in bloom at many florists and dime stores, are epiphytic, or tree-perching, members of the cactus family. They have no prickly spines, and since they grow wild in the jungle, your two or three hours of windowsill sun should make them quite happy.   This group of succulents, also known as orchid or crab cactuses, usually bear their bright-colored winter blooms on leafless, flat, segmented stems that cascade gracefully over the sides of their pots.   If you avoid overwatering it, a Christmas cactus is easily grown indoors. If you buy it in flower, keep it on the coolest windowsill you have so its blooms will last longer. Keep the soil barely moist until it has finished flowering, which may be any time between Thanksgiving and New Year's. Then reduce the frequency of watering and keep the plant on the dry side, just short of the point where the foliage begins to wither.   Late in spring, when its growing season begins, water more often and feed it every few weeks with a diluted solution of any fertilizer used for flowering house plants.   If possible, give your Christmas cactus a summer vacation outside in a shady spot. The flower buds form as the days shorten and the nights grow cool, so it will be fine outdoors until just before the first frost.   Recent new hybrids include plants that bear flowers on upright stems, including one called Bridgeport, which has pure white blooms","excerpt":"Santa Cruz, with large peach-and-white flowers, and Windsor, whose large flowers are lavender and white. Saving Soil     Q. We grow many annuals outdoors in window boxes in large pots. Can the soil be saved for next year? -- Rosa DeVita, West Orange, N.J.     A. By all means save the soil. You will have to increase its fertility and improve its friability before using it again, but you can do this in late winter or very early spring. Stir in an additional one-third volume of equal parts of perlite, peat moss and either compost or cow manure. Just before adding new plants, mix in a handful of any 5-10-5 granular fertilizer.

The singer was just a vestige of Mr. Santana's career as a pop performer.      It's still easy to hear the promise of the 60's in Mr. Santana's music. Mixing funk, jazz, blues, rock and Latin music, his conception argues for an open-mindedness and cultural inquisitiveness that seems foreign, almost radical, compared to the parochialism of current popular music.

Article 15 ‐‐ No Title"},{"year":"1946","title":"Let is be noted at the outset that Ernst Lubitsch has come up with a delectable and sprightly lampoon in \\"Cluny Brown,\\" which on Saturday, began a pleasant visit at the Rivoli. And, let is be known also, that from this vantage point, the offering is among the year's most delightful film comedies. For, from this adaptation of Margery Sharp's best-selling novel, Mr. Lubitsch has produced and directed his most gayly irreverent escapade since \\"Ninotchka\\" of fond memory. As presnted here, Cluny Brown's partial biography is no starkly factual file but is a tongue-in-cheek, double-entendre tale of an ebullient lass whose affections are divided equally between plumbing crises and affairs of the heart. And Cluny, as well as the fans she is likely to have, can be grateful to Mr. Lubitsch and Twentieth Century-Fox for having put the crises and the affairs together so charmingly.Samuel Hoffenstein and Elizabeth Reinhardt have fashioned a screen play which does not hew to the letter of the book but cleaves to its spirit. And, while the laughter which is distilled is not abdominal, it is continuous. Miss Sharp provided a panel of extraordinary and amiable people, and the director and the scenarists have not let her down. In dialogue and situations they are still the same lighthearted crew but with some whimsical variations. Cluny, for instance, is still the same, flighty, day-dreaming neice of a London plumber who admittedly doesn't know her place. And it is on this quiet Sunday in 1939 while surreptitiously substituting for her guardian, that Cluny meets Adam Belinski, the improvident and charming Czech refugee author and patriot. And, caught as she is in what appears to be a compromising position, what can her uncle do but ship her off to service on the estate of Sir Henry Carmel?The landed gentry have little effect, however, on either Cluny or Belinski, who, it appears, is the guest of the heir of the house, and, who, like Cluny, is an individualist. Together they neatly disrupt the serenity of the household. Cluny drops the roast and falls in love with the village pharmacist. Belinski, deeply enamored of Cluny, serves as a philosopher and cupid to his young host and his fiancee, the beautiful and haughty Betty Cream. And, when they depart, happily on their way toward marriage, Cluny and Adam are still un-reconstructed, but everyone from Sir Henry on down to Syrett, the butler, have been genially impressed.Bare plot lines, however, are meager and unrewarding. Dialogue and direction transform Jennifer Jones into the renegade Cluny, who can't resist a stuffed drain or the austere courtship of Mr. Wilson, the pharmacist. Her performance is opposite and qualitatively equal to her delineation of St. Bernadette, for which she captured the Academy's statuette. Charles Boyer, never before distinguished as a comedian, contributes all the laughs, genuine charm and dubious philosophy called for in the role of Adam Belinski, an engaging chap, whose friends can always prod him into borrowing twenty pounds.From among his supporting players Mr. Lubitsch has mined a humorous bonanza, especially in the case of Richard Haydn. His portrait of the pompous pharmacist, given to adenoidal discourses, meticulously enunciated, is the film's comic high mark. Una O'Connor, as his indigent mother, hasn't a line to speak, but makes her raucous throat-clearing expressive and funny. Reginald Owen, as the lord of the manor who vaguely recalls Hitler as \\"the chap who wrote that book, 'My Camp'\\"","excerpt":"Sara Allgood and Ernest Cossart, as rigidly correct servants; Margaret Bannerman, as the lady of the household; Peter Lawford, as her son, and Helen Walker, as his reluctant fiancee, and Reginald Gardiner and Sir C. Aubrey Smith, both of whom play bit parts, add to the frivolous goings-on. To repeat, apart from the landed gentry and the plumbing fraternity, whose stuffiness kids, \\"Cluny Brown\\" is gentle ribbing which should be enjoyed by most persons.

Freedman Plaza on Central Park's southeast corner. Currently in residence is ''Corner Plot,'' above, a magical, site-specific work by Sarah Sze. From the outside you see a low pyramid constructed of brick, glass and metal, resembling the rooftop corner of an apartment building like the one diagonally across Fifth Avenue from the plaza. It looks as if a whole building had toppled and sunk into the ground as a result of some natural or supernatural disaster. Up close you can see through windows on two sides, down into one of Ms. Sze's signature, semi-Cubist, semi-Surrealist environments made of materials and objects you could purchase at Home Depot, Staples and Wal-Mart. There are multilevel shelves, abstract gridded structures, yardsticks held in place by clamps, desk lamps projecting every which way, a miniature flight of spiral stairs and a plant with round, bright green leaves. The space is also neatly stocked with household goods like toilet paper rolls, white towels, water bottles, soap bars and a fire extinguisher. It looks partly like a survival shelter created by a mad architect and partly like an unusually imaginative department store window display. The interior is not quite as wonderful as the fantastic exterior leads you to expect, but the sculpture as a whole scores a rare public-art hat trick: it appeals to the cognoscenti, intrigues random passers-by and delights children.

Although the new show will have problems breaking into a difficult market, the new location should be helpful.

Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.    Broadway    ''BETRAYAL.'' A stylish but seriously unbalanced revival of Harold Pinter's 1972 study of marital infidelity, told in reverse chronological order. Seemingly the most accessible of this playwright's major works, the drama invests a familiar formula with a gnawing, transforming sense of how opaque people remain to one another. The ravishing but miscast Juliette Binoche plays a woman having an affair with the best friend (Liev Schreiber) of her husband (John Slattery). An ideal ''Betrayal'' offers an equilateral triangle, in which the roles of manipulator and manipulated keep shifting. Here, under David Leveaux's elegant and chilly direction, Ms. Binoche and Mr. Slattery don't always strike the ideal balance between baffling and being baffled. Mr. Schreiber, on the other hand, is superb, turning thinking into a spectator sport and making sure those Pinteresque silences never feel empty. You leave believing you have watched his entire performance in close-up (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300.

VLADIMIR FELTSMAN, who redefined himself as a Classicist after being promoted at first as a Russian firebrand, is looking beyond the palette of the modern piano and exploring Mozart's piano sonatas on a reconstruction of a Mozart-era Walter fortepiano. Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Tishman Auditorium of the New School, 66 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village","excerpt":"Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Mannes College of Music, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan; also Oct. 3 and 10 at Mannes, and Oct. 12 at Tishman; (212) 229-5488, newschool.edu/feltsman; $25, $10 for students and 65+, $100 for all five concerts.    A highlight of this summer's Mostly Mozart Festival was the streamlined, semistaged period instrument performance of Mozart's ''Idomeneo,'' led by William Christie. Mozart operas are at their best when the scale is intimate, but the grand opera approach survives as well. For listeners who like these works sounding big and beefy, the Metropolitan Opera revives its ''IDOMENEO'' on Thursday. The cast includes DOROTHEA RÖSCHMANN, OLGA MAKARINA and BEN HEPPNER, with JAMES LEVINE conducting. 7:30 p.m., (212) 362-6000; $15 to $375.    Though it has received less attention than the Mozart anniversary, the Shostakovich centenary is this year as well. His 13th Symphony, with its moving text by Yevgeny Yevtushenko, commemorated the 1941 massacre at Babi Yar, and its first movement is the centerpiece of ''BABI YAR REMEMBERED: YEVTUSHENKO AND SHOSTAKOVICH IN WORD AND SONG'' at the Museum of Jewish Heritage. (It will be played in the composer's two-piano version by Mischa and Cipa Dichter and the bass Valentin Peytchinov.) The program offers other Shostakovich works as well, and Mr. Yevtushenko will read his poetry. Wednesday at 7 p.m., 36 Battery Place, Battery Park City, (646) 437-4202, mjhnyc.org; $25 to $65.

The 60 artists represent a mere tip of the creative iceberg in a country changing with breathtaking speed. One way or another, those changes will affect the world. An important show.

This sharply installed survey of 94 artists covers several decades of work, much of it by a generation of photographers who came of age in the 1960's and 70's. The pictures are sorted by broad themes (people, beauty, family, religion, etc.), and formal polish tends to predominate over conceptual grit. The terrain is, over all, unsensational ordinary life, with the heat now and then turned up high. Images of urban churchgoers, Louisiana sugar cane cutters, the magnetic Billie Holiday and children in African refugee camps sit side by side. The eclectic array has its share of bland entries, but there are dozens of wonderful artists here, and their collective spirit is persuasive.

Museums    * ''ETERNAL EGYPT: MASTERWORKS OF ANCIENT ART FROM THE BRITISH MUSEUM,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Feb. 24). An extensive renovation at the British Museum makes possible an American tour for works from its legendary Egyptian collection, many being allowed out of the building for the first time. Included are treasures that are almost always on display in London, like one of the museum's proud red granite lions from the 18th dynasty. Other high points include the great Buddha-like stone carving of Amenhotep III and seven papyruses from the Book of the Dead. Presented in fairly strict chronology, the works trace Egyptian art along its entire 3,000-year trajectory from the Old Kingdom to the Roman conquest in 30 B.C. The goal is to show that the art was not tied to Old Kingdom precedents but subject to stylistic development, formal innovation and changes in emotional tenor. With the superb quality of the British works and the august proportions of Brooklyn's galleries, the demonstration proceeds with exceptional beauty and clarity.

Here, then, is the result of an informal search over the last few weeks to find the best free hors d'oeuvres in town.

In the places cited, expect to spend about $1.50 for a beer or a glass of wine and around $3 for a drink of hard liquor, unless otherwise noted.

And here it is, looming like a giant stuffed bat on a stick, the easiest target on Broadway.

Even the crème de la crème can curdle every now and then. This musical adaptation of Aristophanes' 2,400-year-old comedy of gods and playwrights has the highest concentration of blue-ribbon talent of any show now on Broadway. It stars Nathan Lane, the only actor who qualifies as serious royalty in the thinning world of musical comedy, and Roger Bart, whose very smile has been known to stop a show. The director and choreographer is Susan Stroman (''The Producers,'' ''Contact''). And the composer is -- reverent pause, please -- Stephen Sondheim. Yet despite these fine ingredients, what should have been a zesty, airy soufflé is a soggy, lumpy batter that never shows the slightest signs of rising. Staged in 1974 as a publicity-garnering, hourlong novelty by the Yale School of Drama -- around and in the university gymnasium swimming pool, if you please -- this bauble of a show has been reshaped to fill two and a half hours. The results suggest that to stretch something this slight is to shatter it (2:30). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $65 to $95 (Brantley).    + ''GOLDA'S BALCONY.'' In October 1973 a 75-year-old woman who grew up in Milwaukee nearly started a nuclear holocaust. The woman, of course, was the Israeli prime minister, Golda Meir; the occasion was the 1973 Middle East War. As a story, it needs very little help from a dramatist or, for that matter, from a director, a designer, an actor or any other theatrically creative type. Moreover, the elements of the pure narrative are so colossally charged with tension and consequence that understatement is the way to go. ''Golda's Balcony'' doesn't go that way, however. It is not the story of a crucial moment in world history but a ponderous essay wrapped in melodramatic autobiography, acted with a soulless verve by Tovah Feldshuh and presented in a cheesily overwrought production directed by Scott Schwartz (1:30). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. No performance tonight and tomorrow. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 5 and 8:30 p.m.; Wednesdays and Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 and $86.25; a limited number of student rush tickets are available on the day of the performance for $26.25 (Bruce Weber).    * ''HAIRSPRAY.'' Portraying the plus-size Baltimore housewife Edna Turnblad, Michael McKean is more creditable than credible. Having appeared in deadpan film mockumentaries like ''This Is Spinal Tap,'' Mr. McKean knows the value of playing comedy straight. He doesn't accessorize Edna's housecoat with overwrought feminine mannerisms, and his timing is dead-on. Yet unlike his Tony Award-winning predecessor, Harvey Fierstein, Mr. McKean never makes that final leap of faith that brings out the woman in a man. This shifts the show's emphasis to the younger generation in this pop fable of racial integration and rock 'n' roll. And Carly Jibson, as the boundary-breaking Tracy Turnblad, and Jennifer Gambatese, as her nerdy best friend, combine the hormonal glow of adolescence with the confidence of old pros. Though ''Hairspray'' can be tedious when preaching via big-throated anthems or satirizing via clunky caricature, it is newly vibrant in bringing out the randy rhythms in early rock 'n' roll that made parents fear for their children's chastity (2:30). Simon, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $65 to $100, with a limited number of $25 rush tickets available by lottery at the theater at 5 p.m. for the evening show and at 11 a.m. for the matinee (Brantley).    *+ ''I AM MY OWN WIFE'' (Tony winner for best play and best actor in a play). Doug Wright's one-actor play, with a thrillingly accomplished performance by Jefferson Mays and a diamond-sharp production directed by Moisés Kaufman, tells a terrific story based on a real person, Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (né Lothar Berfelde), a soft-spoken but tenaciously gender-bending biological man who died in 2002 at 74. Her lifelong obsession -- Mahlsdorf preferred to be thought of as female -- was the preservation of furniture, especially from the 1890's, and other household relics like Victrolas and gramophones. Her devotion to her astonishing collection, with which she turned her home into a museum, gave focus and motivation to a life whose grandest achievement was that it proceeded to its natural end. The play is largely about Charlotte's enduring the cruel repressions of the Nazis and the Communists, and her harrowing tales of survival through the eras of the Gestapo and the Stasi are nothing short of breathtaking. Ah, but are they credible? That also becomes an issue in the play, which very subtly but, in the end, quite powerfully makes a case for the necessity of storytelling in our lives. Among the play's resonant assertions is that lives themselves are narratives, and that the perspective, sympathy and reliability of the narrator is crucial to our understanding of them (2:15). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $86.25, with $20 student and teacher tickets at the box office the day of show (Weber).    *+ ''WONDERFUL TOWN'' (Tony winner for choreography). In this captivating revival of Leonard Bernstein's musical love poem to Manhattan, Donna Murphy has given one of the most dazzlingly accomplished performances you're ever likely to see. As the writer Ruth Sherwood, the role Rosalind Russell slayed 'em with in 1954, Ms. Murphy, who leaves the show after Sunday (to be replaced by Brooke Shields starting Tuesday night), blithely juggles assorted gleaming styles without ever breaking character. If much of Kathleen Marshall's staging of this tale of dewy Ohio sisters in New York isn't up to Ms. Murphy, well, what would be? And the orchestra, under the direction of Rob Fisher, is superb, giving ebullient life to Bernstein's lighthearted city symphony of a score. The wisecracking lyrics are by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Gregg Edelman is the manly object of both sisters' affections (2:30). Hirschfeld, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $56 and $101 (Brantley).    Off Broadway    *+ ''GUANTÁNAMO: 'HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM.' '' On an anxious night, you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: You are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario was immortalized by Franz Kafka in ''The Trial.'' It is also the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. First produced in London by the Tricycle Theater, this calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work. But it exerts an icy visceral charge that is never achieved by flashier agitprop satire, like Tim Robbins's Bush-bashing ''Embedded'' (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60 (Brantley).    + ''HERE LIES JENNY.'' Conceived and staged by Roger Rees, with musical direction by Leslie Stifelman and choreography by Ann Reinking, this cigarillo-slender show weaves songs by Kurt Weill into a vague narrative cycle about the life and times of one weary woman. Her name is Jenny, and it seems fitting that she should be portrayed by Bebe Neuwirth, who won Tony Awards playing hard-bitten gals from the shady side of the street in ''Sweet Charity'' and ''Chicago.'' But don't expect lurid thrills. The mood is more pensive than prurient, with Ms. Neuwirth's character presented as a soft, battered, sentimental creature, like a rag doll that has been played with too hard. ''Here Lies Jenny'' is not the sort of show to kick you into gear for a long night on the town. It's more like a reassuring lullaby, which progresses from brooding nostalgia to hope for the morning to come (1:15). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 5 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 7 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $60 (Brantley).    + ''THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS -- THE MUSICAL!'' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater, and parody is the best kind of narcissism. So many of today's musicals strut fancy sets and special effects. A good parody needs smart writers and winning performers; ''The Musical of Musicals -- The Musical!,'' a York Theater production, has four, and two are the composer Eric Rockwell and the lyricist Joanne Bogart. Taking their plot straight from corny old melodrama, they spoof the styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Kander and Ebb. The Jerry Herman segment is the weakest because his work is the simplest; the pretensions of Lord Lloyd Webber make a better target. The other three are good, zany fun. They have the joie de vivre we want from a musical (1:40). The Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. No performance tonight and tomorrow. Mondays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2:30 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Margo Jefferson).    * ''SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW.'' A giggle of clowns led by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. And so it is, as Mr. Polunin, with his baggy yellow romperlike costume, his red ball of a nose, his tufts of white hair and his shaggy red bulbous shoes, teams with his cutup colleagues. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title, propelled with blizzard force in a dramatic finale (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. And so it is, as Mr. Polunin, with his baggy yellow romperlike costume, his red ball of a nose, his tufts of white hair and his shaggy red bulbous shoes, teams with his cutup colleagues. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title, propelled with blizzard force in a dramatic finale (1:30).

In 1937 the Nazis seized a large collection of Expressionist works from the Kronprinzen Palace in Berlin, Germany's first museum of contemporary art. But this branch of Nationalgalerie Berlin has made great strides in restoring what was the heart of its collection. This show of 40 works by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Emil Nolde, Max Beckmann, George Grosz, Otto Dix, Hannah Hoch, Paula Modersohn-Becker and others touches on the history of German modern art -- Expressionism, Dadaism, Neue Sachlichkeit -- from around 1910 through the post-World War I period. Its title is drawn from the early preference of the Expressionists for rural places versus their later attraction to the city. Satirical thrusts at the failures of the Weimar Republic by Hoch, Dix and Grosz are also standouts.

Thursday to Tuesday, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.","excerpt":"Saturdays, to 10 P.M. Through Aug. 30. \\n\\nStrong images and a high-impact theme combine to make this a particularly substantial exhibition. Its thesis, the distorted interpretations of American Indians that began in the 19th century, is developed by placing paintings, drawings, prints and photographs that contributed to stereotypes next to recent art by tribal members. \\n\\nThe new work is intended to project the Indian experience and ideology more accurately. In a number of instances, the artist comments directly on what is offensive in the earlier piece.\\n\\nOrganized by Bridget Goodbody with Renee Fotouhi, the exhibition has work by contemporaries with major reputations, including Carl Beam, Edgar Heap of Birds, Fritz Scholder, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Kay WalkingStick and Phil Young.\\n\\nEthnographic interpretations, land attitudes, spirituality and identity are some of the issues explored. Usually, the messages are clear, but wall texts further underscore the show's politics. A marked degree of stylistic boldness emphasizes the passion in the arguments for revisionism.\\n\\nOne section suggests that the traditional 19th-century expansive landscape scene depicting a seamless harmony between the Indian's world and nature is an erroneous myth. A more intense and symbolic view, represented by Ms. WalkingStick's paintings, transforms cliffs into paired, magical abstract signs and translates earth into a rough, raw, highly visceral and physical surface.\\n\\nIn one of the most striking paintings, \\"Indian Horse,\\" Ms. Quick-to-See Smith takes on the famous George Catlin, expressing her rage over the artifice in his images by including copies of his drawings and then painting over them. \\n\\nThere is a comparable mastery of vigorously expressive techniques in two fine pieces by Carl Beam. They also manipulate borrowed images to invent visual metaphors for recognition and nonrecognition of the Indian presence in American society.\\n\\nTelling contrasts in smaller pieces include David Neel's photograph of a tribal chief in contemplative pose, with eyes lowered and hands clasped.  This is beside a 1917 contrived image of a tribal member gazing outward toward some distant mystical spirit.\\nMilton Avery and \\"Magnum Opus\\"\\n Vered Gallery, 66 Park Place, East Hampton. Daily, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Through Aug. 26. \\n\\nAdmirers of Milton Avery (1885-1965) and his synthesized experiences of nature know that he had such an open approach to what he chose to distill, simplify and rework that it is always possible to come upon surprise paintings. \\n\\nOne of these, a dark, stacccato, angular interpretation of surf and rocks, is a highlight of this exhibition.  In some respects, it recalls the influence of German Expressionism in drypoints that the artist had made 20 years earlier.\\n\\nAvery looked for a magic that he called \\"radiance,\\" and usually achieved this effect by allowing his arbitrarily colored surfaces and forms to seem saturated with light.  Luminosity and tone usually take precedence over description. The large \\"Sand Bar and Sea,\\" with its vibrant flat, yellow shape suggesting the sand bar, is a good example.\\n\\nIn addition to the oil paintings, there is a sizable group of watercolors that touch on four decades and tend to call attention to how well-suited Avery's goals were to that medium. \\"Tall Pines\\" is a striking example of his reduction of images to a kind of semi-symbolism, while \\"Evening Light\\" and \\"Breaking Wave\\" reveal how close he could come to totally abstract effects.\\n\\nIn \\"Magnum Opus,\\" 30 examples from a distinguished photography collection show enough of the medium's pivotal history to convey the sense of developing visual codes.  With the earliest years especially, one realizes that this material was part of a revolution in ways of seeing and ways of retaining information.\\n\\nThe survey begins with W. H.Fox Talbot's handsome 1844 calotype \\"Articles of China,\\" an image that vibrates with historic resonance, and reaches to Cecil Beaton's crisp and moving 1954 view of a Grand Street bridal shop.\\n\\nApart from the artistic and technical achievements here, the range of subjects demonstrates the camera's contribution to information and intellectual discourse. The value of genre themes, for example, is presented in John Thompson's dramatically composed scene of activities aboard a Chinese junk in 1868. There are also images that capture horrors of the Civil War, beautiful details of Yellowstone, revelations of archeology and characterisics of exotic journeys.\\n\\nIn a different sense, Harold Edgerton's 12-part sequence featuring a tiny droplet, from 1935, can be considered a landmark inspirational piece, for it claims an abstract and conceptual role for photograpy.\\n Rebecca Alston\\n Elise Goodheart Fine Arts, 61 Island View Drive, Sag Harbor. Friday to Monday, noon to 5 P.M. Through Aug. 23. \\n\\nMs. Alston makes a good try at updating and giving new vitality to the constructivist mode that had a significant theoretical and philosophical impact earlier in the century. The range of her ideas is impressive, even though the sense of detachment inherent in the geometric approach seems out of step just now.\\n\\nClear, crisp definitions and diagonal forces are basic to these paintings and wall reliefs, with every angle important in developing the dynamic tension that serves as a subject.\\n\\nWith strong, unpredictable color and a variety of textures, Ms. Alston seems to test how inventive one can be with a restricted vocabulary. To her credit, she injects a lightness and playfulness into what is usually a serious, humorless approach. \\n\\nShe may base a relief on a regular grid, then suddenly allow layers of superimposed shapes to thrust out with no respect for boundaries. Another work might solidify shadows and turn them into geometric schemes, and still another might tip forward unexpectedly. Here Ms. Alston might be considered part of the contemporary spirit in the way she suggests irony.\\n\\nAn obvious confidence with space of every type is one of the artist's strong points. A more open piece, closer to wall-mounted sculpture, is a particularly successful departure. Its flame-like protrusion introduces greater complexity and brings a hint of emotion to what is usually considered an abstraction of reason.

The Ottomans ceded authority to the British in that year, and a formal British protectorate was organized. When British forces withdrew from the Persian Gulf region in 1971, Qatar entered into negotiations with the emirates of the Trucial Coast to join the federation of the United Arab Emirates. When those negotiations broke down, Qatar declared its independence on Sept. 3, 1971. For over 30 years it has been politically stable under one ruler, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, although he was deposed by his son in a bloodless coup in June 1995. He has claimed he wants to move the country toward democracy and has called for a free press, limited elections, and allowing women to vote. Qatar's economy is dominated by oil, natural gas (Qatar has the world's third largest supply) banking, and shipping services in the port of Doha.
