However, like some features in this genre, the script merely is a jerry-built foundation for sweeping spectacles of battle that often obliterate its story line, leaving only naive bits of propaganda more obvious than its history.More than twenty years ago Mr. Vasiliev proved with the noted \\"Chapayev\\" that he could handle panoramas of battle and lots of men and horses with striking cinematic effect. He has not lost his touch in \\"Heroes of Shipka,\\" which treats of the Russo-Bulgarian victories in 1877 against the Ottoman Turkish rulers of the Balkan Peninsula.Scenes of a stealthy Russian crossing of a river as viewed from the eminence of a mountain top are visually exciting. The charge and mowing down of the attacking Turks as they attempt to dislodge the defending Russians and Bulgars at Shipka are truly spectacular and the crossing of the Balkans in the dead of winter for the final victory over Suleiman Pasha at Plevna is a military exercise come alive.The director not only uses his color cameras to capture men battling against vividly picturesque backgrounds but reportedly also had the advantage of having authentic soldiers to deploy in his mass scenes. These battalions, composed of officers and men of the Bulgarian army, make a vast array in the climactic clash on the bleak, snow-covered field outside of Plevna.Although the sound and fury of battle is unreeled effectively, the director's principals are hardly heroic in their impact on a viewer. B. Samoilov, as General Skobolev, who leads his loyal troops to victory despite the machinations of the Czar's sychophantic advisers, is given to posing, patriotic declamations and stroking his Dundrearies.

The line between farce and tragedy is drawn in blood where secular and Islamic Turkey seem to explode on contact","excerpt":"Ka falls foul of believers' charges of atheism, while the secular government cops fear his snooping.    MONUMENTAL PROPAGANDA, by Vladimir Voinovich. (Knopf, $25.) A satirical but often touching Russian novel whose indomitable heroine, Aglaya Revkina, an ancient, irreformable Stalinist, loathes the wimps and consumers who wrecked Communism; she cherishes a discarded statue of Stalin in her apartment for 40 years.    THE PERSISTENCE OF MEMORY, by Tony Eprile. (Norton, $24.95.) Part fable, part coming-of-age story, Eprile's first novel concerns Paul Sweetbread, a burdened, divided South African Jew with something of a crush on the great blond Afrikaner brutes who served with him in his country's endless, unforgettable ''Border War'' in Namibia and Angola.    COCKTAILS, by D. A. Powell. (Graywolf, paper, $14.) Exceptional poems by a poet of extravagant imagination whose long, stuttering lines can render personal glosses to New Testament scenes or reflect his personal sexual history (the title puns on the medical treatments that keep his H.I.V. in check).    JEROME ROBBINS: His Life, His Theater, His Dance, by Deborah Jowitt. (Simon & Schuster, $40.) A grand survey of the great and deservedly popular choreographer of ballet and Broadway, as well as a personal examination of a radically unhappy man; at 57 he could call himself ''a Jewish ex-commie fag who had to go into a mental hospital.''    A SEAHORSE YEAR, by Stacey D'Erasmo. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) D'Erasmo's intelligent, intimate novel explores issues of art and sex in an anything-goes San Francisco and vicinity, where Christopher, a teenage boy whose biological parents are both gay, is threatened by mental illness. When he hits the road, his absence threatens the stability of the extended family he leaves behind.    BOILING POINT: How Politicians, Big Oil and Coal, Journalists, and Activists Are Fueling the Climate Crisis -- and What We Can Do to Avert Disaster, by Ross Gelbspan. (Basic Books, $22.) Gelbspan, a reporter who learned to fear global warming while researching a previous book, indicts all parties (see the subtitle) in this one, where he joins muckraker predecessors in both exposing evils and proposing bold proceedings to eliminate them.    PASTORELLES, by John Taggart. (Flood Editions, paper, $13.95.) A poet of understated, photographic accuracy pins his love of rural Pennsylvania, its stone walls and old beech trees, on lines whose flat repetitions suggest dryness and frustration; a style so unembellished permits him to undertake an irony-deprived high style when he chooses.

The third entry in a four-book project, ''The Silver Screen'' is a series of variations on celebrity and its distortions of family life. In a far-from-chronological narration, the fame attained by Bel Murphy, a silent film star, works its changes on two generations, inverting the proposition when a daughter enters a witness protection program.

PERSEPOLIS 2, by Marjane Satrapi. (Pantheon, $17.95.) Satrapi's second graphic memoir picks up with the 14-year-old Marjane in a boardinghouse in Vienna, where her parents in Iran have sent her to be educated in safety and freedom. Freedom, as it often does, leads to trouble, and the obviously non-Austrian Satrapi winds up homeless. Back in Iran, she fits in no better than ever. Does this sound charming, funny and tender? Well, it is.    ATTACK POODLES. And Other Media Mutants: The Looting of the News in a Time of Terror, by James Wolcott. (Miramax, $22.95.) Wolcott's abundantly comic wrath condemns pundits and other media icons who have served, he believes, as flacks for President Bush and for his policies.    BUSHWORLD: Enter at Your Own Risk, by Maureen Dowd. (Putnam, $25.95.) Through the lenses of pop culture and pop psychology, Dowd, currently an Op-Ed columnist for The Times, sees the election of 2000 as the culmination of an Oedipal drama, and the second gulf war as the product of a confluence of conservative ideology and parricidal urges.    CLOUD ATLAS, by David Mitchell. (Random House, paper, $14.95.) This novel, by an author who seems to specialize in difficulties, appears bent on rendering every kind of experience; it covers about 1,000 years in narratives involving such folks as a New Zealand stowaway, a book editor and a goatherd in a blasted future.    JACOB'S LADDER: The History of the Human Genome, by Henry Gee. (Norton, $25.95.) From William Harvey onward, this readable, insightful volume by a British science writer tells us what is known about human genes and how it became known; it also cautions us that this knowledge does not contain the meaning, if there is one, of being human.    COLLECTED POEMS, by Donald Justice. (Knopf, $35.) Justice (1925-2004), like most modern American poets, spent most of his life around universities, and much of his attention looking behind him, preoccupied with the evocation of nostalgia and the endings of things, in simple diction and sometimes in archaic postures. He had the nerve even to wag the apostrophe, the address to someone not present or something without ears (''O marvelous early cigarettes!'' ''O counters of spectacles!'').

A caption under the picture says that the window ''had been built by a former religious tenant who wanted a view to the church.'' Elsewhere I read that the house the Kafkas lived in was built ''against'' the church, so perhaps they did share a common wall. In very old cities, such things are possible.   I imagine Kafka in his study, raising his head occasionally to look out, not at the world but into the brooding vastness of the church - a view in keeping with his religious conception of his work, ''writing as prayer.'' In the haunting cathedral scene in ''The Trial,'' Joseph K. says that ''the size of the cathedral struck him as bordering on the limits of what human beings could bear.'' Kafka looked into these limits every day.
