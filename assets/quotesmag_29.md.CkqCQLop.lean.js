Owing, undoubtedly, to the drastic cutting of the German censors, who are said to have been strongly opposed to a picture depicting the hardships of the involuntary idle, this offering scarcely lives up to expectations.Essentially, \\"Kuhle Wampe,\\" which happens to be the name of a former Summer resort near Berlin, which was turned into a tent colony for the unemployed unable to pay house rent, is a film in the Russian style, with enough individual action to sustain a certain interest in the developments. The tragedy of hosts of impoverished German families, dependent upon a few marks a week in unemployment benefits, or, in many cases, upon local relief, is epitomized in the experiences of Annie, her father and mother, and her young brother, who commits suicide when he is removed from the insurance benefit list.After depicting this tragic happening, the film turns to the unemployed colony whither the family is taken by Fritz, the chauffeur sweetheart of Annie. Notwithstanding the poverty of most of its inhabitants, an air of contentment and even gaiety obtains in Kuhle Wampe, particularly at the party given to celebrate the engagement of Annie and Fritz. And the scenes at the Red Sport Festival, promoted by the Labor Sports Union, reflect a confidence in the future.
