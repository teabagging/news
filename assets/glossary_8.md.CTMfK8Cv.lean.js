Sondra Loring made much of it on Saturday night in a program shared with Kristin Eliasberg, presented by the Danspace Project. Flashing soft white light and small pools of light made by lamps hung close to the floor emphasized the vaulting height of the space. Booming music poured into its expansive openness, issuing from a band ranged at the back. And figures in black cloaks and a seemingly live body falling from the balcony high above set the dramatic mood of Ms. Loring's \\"Blackout.\\"      Throughout, there was an undercurrent of dark mystery and theatrics, though the choreography itself was a relatively understated matter of ebbing ranks and brief bursts of solo dancing filled with soft-edged convulsive dips, rolls and slashing limbs.

True, Mr. Robbins does give the hint of a suggestion in his title for this flowing suite of dances: this is a gathering. The men and women know each other. But they also seem tinged with a fresh American innocence and a European knowingness and calm, gathered in a wide open space that might be a prairie for Old World pastoral encounters.    The Chopin piano pieces to which the ballet is danced help sustain the illusion, as does a choreographic mix of European folk-dance accents and sweeping lifts and runs across the airy open stage. And a slightly subdued performance by the New York City Ballet on Thursday night at the New York State Theater made it plain that the ballet is as validly a dream as it is a robust picnic.

The next moment Mr. Prey was singing in mock innocence, insinuating, coaxing, seeming to be the voice of the Erlking himself, tempting the child with visions of dance and song and flowers.   Finally, Mr. Prey was the sick child borne on horseback, crying out in urgency that his father attend to what he sees, that these are not visions of willows gleaming in the night, that the Erlking was about to seize him. When the Erlking's seductive lines turn demonic, Mr. Prey's face twisted with the threat. And when the father, after shuddering at the child's cries, looked down at the child in his arms, the pause before the last words was chilling: Mr. Prey seemed to be staring into the face of death. It was an extraordinary enactment.

Mr. diCorcia went to Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, an area frequented by male prostitutes and other hustlers, and paid men to pose for him. The results, which combine elements of traditional documentary photography and staged imagery of the sort found in advertising and commercial photography, raise challenging questions about the boundaries between fiction and reality.    In a typical photograph, a model-handsome young man sits in front of a glowing sign for a fast-food restaurant at night. In another, a man bathed in blue light is seen through the screen of a motel window, a portable radio pressed to his ear. Carefully posed and lighted, scenes of this sort take on a sense of dramatic moment and, often, of unspecified threat. (Further examples of Mr. diCorcia's work from this project, along with earlier pictures of his family and friends done in a similar style, are on view at Wooster Gardens, in SoHo.)

There were times when William Black achieved that effect on Tuesday evening when he played works by Bach, Poulenc, Griffes and Schumann at Alice Tully Hall. Yet as counterweights to those transcendent moments, others seemed oddly distant and flat, as if the pianist had spent so much effort conceptualizing the music's structure and contours that he lost sight of its color and depth.   Mr. Black's power of illusion was at its strongest in Poulenc's Nocturnes, eight gracefully descriptive character sketches composed between 1929 and 1938 and not played as frequently as they deserve to be. Mr. Black captured the spirit of each unfailingly and made their extramusical qualities -- a slight impetuousness in the first, mischievousness in the fifth, stateliness in the last -- seem vivid and tangible. In technical terms, too, he was entirely on target. He produced a sound that had a gentle haze, yet the music's textures were clean and unambiguous.

The film, which opens today at the IFC Center, is only tangentially concerned with the whys and wherefores of Bible Belt Pentecostalism. Directed by Howard Smith and Sarah Kernochan, it assumes that the kind of charismatic faith healing at which Mr. Gortner excelled as a child prodigy is a moneymaking racket. What makes the movie more than a glib exposé of what Mr. Gortner calls ''the Jesus business'' is Mr. Gortner himself (the name Marjoe is a hybrid of Mary and Joseph), a parentally exploited, ruthlessly disciplined child, who, at the age of 4, was billed as ''the world's youngest ordained minister.'' The movie's vintage film clips of this wind-up baby preacher (above) in full flail are creepy but oddly compelling","excerpt":"imagine Shirley Temple as an adorable, hot-wired faith healer spouting scripture with flamboyantly choreographed body language: the little kid is irresistible. After renouncing his profession at 14 and taking a seven-year break, Mr. Gortner returned to the pulpit as a nonbeliever who was strictly in it for the money. Or so he says, as he gleefully exposes the tricks of his trade and demonstrates how his grown-up style incorporates moves garnered from rock stars like Mick Jagger. Mr. Gortner, who went on to have a minor career as an actor in mostly B- and C- movies, comes across as an overgrown teenager, at once preening and vulnerable, calculating and silly, pathetically eager to impress the sophisticated East Coast filmmakers with his cool and charisma. More than 30 years later, he looms as an unsavory, if fascinating, cultural product of the Jesus-hippie connection that flourished in the early 1970's. On Jan. 31, the movie is also being released on a DVD that includes Ms. Kernochan's 2002 film, ''Thoth,'' which won an Academy Award for best documentary short subject.

Three months seems to have been time enough for Nat Tate's 15 minutes to be over, but some interesting questions remain.     Boyd's tale of young Tate's rise as a second-generation Abstract Expressionist, supported by critics and dealers and sought after by collectors, seems on its face to be a satire on the New York art world at its first great moment of commercial and critical success. The story ends with Tate's destruction of his work and his suicide, following a visit to Georges Braque, in whose studio he presumably sees what true artistic mastery is. Understanding his own mediocrity, Tate grasps the meaning of his success and ''the presaging of a future he did not welcome.'' Boyd goes on to say, ''Tate was one of those rare artists who did not need, and did not seek, the transformation of his painting into a valuable commodity to be bought and sold on the whim of a market and its marketeers.''
