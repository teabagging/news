It was only about the width of a pencil eraser, but even that was too big. I got out a stiff horse brush and gave that pig and her companion a serious brushing, which is one of the great joys in a pig's life. Then I raked out all the old hay in the pig house, closed the two pigs inside with a fresh hay bale to tear apart, and hauled the house off to a different part of the pasture. I brush them every time I feed them now, and I haven't seen any lice since. Eventually, as I'm brushing, the pigs flop over on their sides and lie there, barely breathing, eyes closed, legs practically quivering with pleasure. I try to remember to watch just how much affection I let myself feel for them.    Affection is what we're really farming up here, farming it mostly in ourselves. Snow fell late the other afternoon, and as it thickened all around me, I realized that there is nothing more definite in the world than the top line of a red pig against the snow. I can always see the self-interest in the animals, and perhaps they see it in me too. But there is always something else, as well. Badger's joy when he bounds out of his kennel in the morning is unspeakable. Is it freedom or is it me? The horses drift their flanks in my direction when they nuzzle up to their hay. Is it just a scratch they want or do they have something to tell me? The chickens crowd up against the chicken yard fence to watch as I approach with the feed bucket, and I have to admit that this is small-town self-interest at its purest, the look of the line in front of the payroll office.

While honeyed words, an attractive letter package and an inviting proposal are all important, the key element is the list to which the letter is sent. What list was I on that would attract Representative Vander Jagt's committee? Fortunately, as a mail-order practitioner, I use a different misspelling of my name for each item I order by mail, just to keep track of lists. Last year in the gift season, I expansively ordered a package of prime sirloin steaks for friends in Maine. Since then, the Nebraska-based meat purveyor has been deluging me with invitations to reorder -- all with the same misspelling of my name as on the original letter and as on the letter from Representative Vander Jagt.   What led the Republicans to believe this was a meaty list for them? Did they figure only well-heeled Republicans could afford to order steaks costing $20 plus per pound? Perhaps, in these fat-fearing, fiber-favoring times, only Republicans would be curmudgeonly enough to order red meat in quantity.

For his crafty old fuddy-duddy becomes quite a trial himself, with his flamboyant courtroom performance, before the trial in progress is done.This is to be regretted, since Mr. Redgrave's behavior takes the mind away from an interesting mystery involving an accused man who is deaf, mute and blind. And this poor chap, locked in eerie silence and decently played by Kieron Moore, is the most intriguing figure in the picture. No wonder Mr. Redgrave works so hard.It is the accused, whose afflictions have been with him since birth and whose marriage to a childhood companion has for some mysterious reason gone awry, who commands the audience's interest, curiosity and sympathy. He is the point of concentration for what freshness there is in this court-room film. And the pictorial explanation of his background and the visual probing of the crime for which he is arraigned constitute an absorbing study and a teasing uncertainty.In the performance of these things, Ann Todd is taut and wistful as the wife and Leo Genn is quietly impressive as the long-time tutor of the afflicted man. Beside their rather solemn persistence in pursuing a serious theme, Mr. Redgrave's eccentric play-acting seems more than a little out of tune.Director George More O'Ferrall may have felt he was getting variety this way, but the effect is oddly provoking. Mr. Redgrave is less a character than a clown. As a consequence, \\"The Green Scarf\\" is a mottled and unconvincing thing.

This is the first peak summer season since the F.A.A. lifted the slot controls that were imposed as a result of the air traffic controllers' strike to limit the traffic at major airports. And as a result of the enormous pent- up demand for air travel - and the ability of the airlines to meet that demand after deregulation - many more flights have been added to the system. General, or non-commercial, aviation and military activity around major urban airports has also increased, placing even greater demands on the air traffic control system.

He was born in Argenteuil-sur-Seine on May 13, 1882, and he died in Paris on Aug. 31, 1963. He had a state funeral in the courtyard of the Louvre, at which Andre Malraux delivered an inspired harangue by torchlight, and in May of this year his centenary will be marked by a large official retrospective exhibition in Paris.   His situation in the United States is not quite so clear, for a number of reasons. Taste in this country was led for many years by the Museum of Modern Art, and although Braque is of course represented in the museum he has never enjoyed the prominence accorded to Matisse, to Picasso, and to Miro. An exhibition entitled ''Braque in the Museum of Modern Art'' would not need a fat catalogue.   This being so, it has come about that although the development of Picasso has been studied minutely in this country in exhibition after exhibition, the development of Braque has not. His status as the cofounder of Cubism, with Picasso, is never questioned. But the precise nature of his contribution has to be spelled out from books, and whereas the books on Picasso stretch from here to Hoboken, the books on Braque are few and brief.

But now the fazenda de cafe, or coffee plantation, once the seat of a powerful, slave-holding rural aristocracy and the source of Brazil's biggest export, is being rediscovered and newly appreciated as a significant part of the country's architectural legacy.         Built in the 19th century as vast, self-sufficient agricultural complexes, the fazendas are now status symbols for a new generation of wealthy gentleman farmers who have replaced coffee with thoroughbred Arabian horses and prize cattle. But more than just a beautiful country house, the fazenda has come to symbolize a new interest in Brazil's culture and history.

The so-called streamer may be included in the wet fly category, although it is almost always designed to represent, or vaguely approximate, some small forage fish, while the wet fly can be minnow or aquatic insect in nymphal form.\\n\\nIt is not clear why so many American fly fishermen born after World War II choose to ignore the wet fly. It is probably a blend of several things, including a touch of snobbery inherited from England, where, on some streams, anything but a floating fly is considered an abomination.

And to keep it from getting soggy, it is best to cook it separately from the topping. Maybe that does not qualify it as a pizza, but by whatever name, the flavors of the topping are rich and satisfying, with the sweet and the tart playing off one another.    Olive paste or spread has been around for a few years, but I had never used it until this summer. Made with black olives, olive oil, vinegar and other seasonings, it is a speedy and zesty alternative to Italian or French olives. Since very little is required to produce the distinctive olive flavor, the small jar will last awhile in the refrigerator. If you cannot find it for this recipe, substitute about a dozen pitted, chopped olives. Roasted Tomato and Sweet Onion Pizza   2 pounds plum tomatoes  1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano  1 1/2 pounds onions  1 tablespoon olive oil  3 9- or 10-inch flour tortillas  1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary  1/2 cup dry white wine  1/8 teaspoon hot pepper flakes  2 teaspoons olive paste or spread.    1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    2. Wash tomatoes and trim stem ends. Using thick slicing blade of food processor, place tomatoes on their side in feed tube and slice. Roast on the top of the stove in enameled oven-roasting pan with the oregano, stirring often to prevent sticking.    3. Using thin slicing blade of food processor, cut onions into quarters and slice. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet and saute onions over medium high heat 5 to 7 minutes.    4.
