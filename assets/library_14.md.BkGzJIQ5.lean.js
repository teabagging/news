The Florida citrus department is trying to dispel the notion that a ripe orange must have orange skin. \\"We know based on research that the American consumer makes his or her orange purchase decisions based primarily on color,\\" said Dr. Dan L. Gunter, the department's executive director.   No oranges are picked before they are mature, regardless of whether the skin is bright orange or completely green. Cooler nighttime temperatures are needed to set the orange color; oranges from areas where the nights are warm tend to retain some green in the skin. The same is true of grapefruits that may appear more greenish than yellowish. They're from warmer regions of the state.   As for artificially colored oranges, Dr. Gunter said they account for about 10 percent of those sold retail. \\"We only color them when a broker or a retailer requests it,\\" he said. \\"One object of this campaign is to be able to eliminate the practice.\\"   He also said the bumper crop had brought orange juice prices down to an average of $4.04 a gallon as of December, from a high last year of $4.59. \\"Retail prices should continue to fall if stores pass along the benefits of the wholesale reductions to consumers,\\" he said.

The Whys of Cooking    A couple of interesting books have recently been published for those who would like to know the whys of cooking, not just the hows.   \\"The Curious Cook\\" by Harold McGee ( North Point Press , $19.95), is every bit as scientific as Mr. McGee's previous book, \\"On Food and Cooking\\" (Scribners, 1984), but is less weighty and more personal than the first book. The new book is a collection of essays and lively reflections on cooking matters and questions like preventing salads from turning brown or whether searing meat really seals in the juices.   Mr. McGee is endowed with healthy skepticism and loves to take a generally accepted cooking practice (like searing meat), test it according to every variable and come up with contradictory results. He speculates on how the theory came about and sweeps the reader along the logical progress of his thinking and his own enthusiasm for discovery. The book is hard to put down.   He has done a great job on mayonnaise, taking apart the notion that an egg yolk can absorb no more than three-quarters of a cup of oil and, while he's at it, coming up with a recipe using safe, cooked yolks.   Other useful confusions , like why it's all right to rinse mushrooms clean instead of wiping them, as many books advise, and why opening the oven for a minute or so will not damage whatever is baking, are based on scientific evidence.   \\"The Epicurean Laboratory\\" by Tina Seelig ( William Freeman & Company, $15.95) answers many of the typical questions like why bread rises or souffles fall and would serve as a basic primer for students of cooking. But there is no investigation of generally accepted cooking notions, some of which Mr. McGee debunks, like the assumption that cold liquids freeze much faster than hot liquids.  Peanut Butter (Cont.)    No longer is the choice simply smooth or chunky. There's more. Peanut Butter Classics in Pawling, N.Y., offers cinnamon raisin -- sensational on a good raisin nut bread -- and chocolate chip flavors. These come in both smooth or chunky versions in 12-ounce jars. A package of all four is $30 including shipping. For information: (914) 855-3050.   These flavored peanut butters are sold individually by a number of stores, among them the Burke & Burke stores in Manhattan, where they are $7.99 each; Bloomingdale's, White Plains, $7; Ronna's Sweet Necessities, 1 Chase Road, Scarsdale, N.Y., $5.25; Sigmund's, 683 Middle Neck Road, Great Neck, L.I., $4.99; and From Fruits to Nuts, 508 Milbourn Avenue, Short Hills, N.J., $7.20.   Another seductive peanut butter variation is peanut honey butter, a velvety whipped blend of peanuts and honey from Oregon Apiaries in Newberg, Ore. A 12-ounce jar is $5 at Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Avenue (74th Street). The Art of Blind Tasting   This semester, Harriet Lembeck has added an intriguing course to her wine and spirits program in mid-Manhattan. Called \\"The Techniques of Blind Tasting,\\" it explains how to evaluate wines in a blind tasting, showing the role of different components and the differences in various grapes, vinifying methods and aging. It will be conducted in two sessions, Feb. 12 and 19, 7:30 to 9:30 P.M. at the Helmsley Hotel, 212 East 42d Street. The course is open only to those who have completed Ms. Lembeck's regular eight-session course and to professionals in wine. The cost is $180. For information and registration: (718) 263-3134. In '90, More of Everything    MORE new grocery and drugstore products were introduced in 1990 than in any other year since a market research company began keeping records in 1970, the company says.    The concern, Marketing Intelligence Services of Naples, N.Y., said in a recent report that 15,879 new products were introduced in 1990, an increase of 18.9 percent over 1989. The previous record was set in 1987.   The total surprised researchers, who, on the basis of the first quarter of 1990, had predicted a continuation of the 1988 and '89 decline in new products. In the tally of new products the company includes different sizes and flavors or varieties of existing products. These accounted for nearly two-thirds of the list.   The report stressed a proliferation of products for which environmental claims were made, 11.4 percent of the total. Assertions about nutrition also played a major role, with 15 percent of new foods advertised as having low or no cholesterol and 13 percent trumpeting low fat or no fat.
