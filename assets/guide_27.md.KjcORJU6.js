For Ms. Carter, whose groups have helped nurture the talents of many younger instrumentalists, this also meant giving individual musicians a fair amount of room in which to stretch out.    Adding to the challenge was a theme announced in the concert's subtitle, \\"The Music Never Stops.\\" During the intermissionless 90-minute event, the singer and her musicians attempted to keep the music continuous, right down to Ms. Carter's singing the introductions and segues to most of the selections. Although she did pause once or twice to make remarks, the music was for the most part unbroken. The idea of musical continuity gave the evening a natural sense of thematic ebb and flow, with songs about goodbyes forming an expressive nucleus.

The Belt Theater, 336 West 37th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues; 7 p.m., $10. (Also Thursday and Saturday.)    TIME MARCHES ON  Previews begin tonight for ''Little Women the Musical.'' Compared to the usual assortment of tough-talking broads and hard-boiled schemers, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy will make for unusually earnest presences on Broadway, but there they'll be, keeping diaries, braiding one another's hair and ever so demurely coming of age. The show is scheduled to open on Jan. 25.  Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m. $60 to $100.    A BANDIT QUEEN AND A DRUG MULE  On DVD this week: ''Bandit Queen'' (Koch Vision, $24.98), the 1994 film based (supposedly) on the story of Phoolan Devi, who became a feminist hero in India after her incarceration for a vengeful mass murder; the first season of ''Carnivàle'' (Warner Home Video, $99.98); the Ben Stiller comedy ''Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story'' (Fox, $29.98); and the underdog Oscar contender ''Maria Full of Grace'' (Warner Home Video, $27.95), about a teenage Colombian drug mule.    ON THE HORNS  Calexico, a Tucson-based mariachi-influenced pop band, gets to New York City a few times a year. From the tight horn section to the dreamy slide guitar, its live shows are blistering.  Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side; 8 p.m.; $17.    WEDNESDAY 12|8    FRENCH TWINS  The Juilliard Theater Orchestra accompanies Julliard's vocal students in an opera double bill: Debussy's ''L'Enfant Prodigue,'' about a son returned home, and Ravel's ''L'Enfant et Les Sortilèges,'' about a bad boy set right by the critters and furniture of his bedroom.  The Juilliard Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; 8 p.m., $10 and $20. (Also Friday and Dec. 12.)    BING'S BIRTHDAY  In honor of the centennial of Bing Crosby's birth, the New York Public Library today screens ''If I Had My Way'' (1940), in which Crosby plays a good-hearted New York construction worker. Thursday's program is a two-hour collection of rarely seen TV performances.  Donnell Library Center, 20 West 53rd Street, Manhattan;2:30 p.m.; free.    SPHINX COMPETITION  Alumni of the first seven Sphinx Competitions -- a competitive training program open to black and Latino string players -- perform at Carnegie Hall tonight. The 19-year-old violinist Gareth Johnson, a winner of the 2002 competition, took the fast track to Carnegie: he didn't pick up the violin until the age of 10.  Carnegie Hall, Isaac Stern Auditorium, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street; 8 p.m., $20 to $80; reservations: (212) 247-7800.    THURSDAY 12|9    HANUKKAH CAROLS  For the past 12 years, the composer Phil Kline has broadcast his ambient and ethereal music on boomboxes held by roving carolers. This year Mr. Kline tries it out for Hanukkah with the program ''Night Lights.'' All participants are welcome and encouraged to bring their own boomboxes. The prerecorded cassette tape will be supplied. Caroling will begin on the roof of the Jewish Community Center in Manhattan, then wend its way through the massive building and pour out onto the streets. Refreshments will be provided at the end.  334 Amsterdam Avenue, at West 76th Street; 6:15 p.m.; free.    GOTH AMONG THE RUINS  The big pop offerings being released on CD this week include the ''American Idol'' competitor Diana DeGarmo's ''Blue Skies'' (RCA, $18.98) and the actress Lindsay Lohan's ''Speak'' (Casablanca, $13.98), but there is a surprise: the Cure's 1979 pure gloom-wave album ''Three Imaginary Boys'' (Rhino Records, $24.98), which was released as ''Boys Don't Cry'' in the United States, is being reissued with bonus tracks, including, unbelievably, a cover of ''Foxy Lady.''    FRIDAY 12|10    POETRY'S PROSPERITY PROJECT  The New York Quarterly, a poetry journal, presents a benefit weekend of evenings devoted to works by its founder, William Packard. The event's title, A Dying Art: The William Packard Festival of Original Works, belies the lively spirit of the publication. Tonight's events consist of plays inspired by Mr. Packard's work; Saturday night's activities are devoted to readings by poets published by the Quarterly.  American Theater of Actors' Chernuchin Theater, 314 West 54th Street; 8 p.m.; suggested donation.    ANOTHER 80'S REVIVAL  The East Village art scene of the early 80's is given the historical treatment in a huge exhibition opening this week. The collagist David Wojnarowicz and the photographer Peter Hujar are well established, but lesser-known talents like the painter Martin Wong get their due as well. In his paintings of love and graffiti on the Lower East Side, Mr. Wong gives a hint of the untamed downtown that no longer exists.  ''East Village U.S.A.,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art/Chelsea, 556 West 22nd Street; 12 to 6 p.m.; $3 to $6. (Through March 19.)    A NEW GENESIS  A group calling itself the Musical Box has set itself an incredibly specific undertaking: it has chosen to recreate -- down to the masks and outfits -- mid-70's performances by the British pop band Genesis, from the tour supporting the 1974 concept album ''The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.''  TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, 199 Chambers Street, Borough of Manhattan Community College; 8 p.m.; $47 to $50. (Also Saturday.)    SATURDAY 12|11    DANCING AND IMPROVISING  In the fourth annual Dance Improv Game Show, bossy kids get to tell dancers and choreographers what to do onstage. Unlike most game shows, this one has no prize, but participants can see their words made flesh.  The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; 2 p.m.; $10.    AN EPIPHANY CAROL  It's holiday music that you aren't sick of: Byzantine Christmas and Epiphany chants, sung by members of the Romeiko Ensemble. The singers will then be joined by musicians from Istanbul for the Sufi memorial ceremony of Mevlana, which is observed Dec. 17.  The Church of St. Mary the Virgin, 145 West 46th Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $15 to $30. For tickets, contact the World Music Institute: (212) 545-7536.    HAIRDRESSERS UNDER FIRE  It sounds like the premise of a joke: a group of American hairdressers set out for postwar Afghanistan to teach the locals how to cut, color and perm. But ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul'' isn't a comedy -- it's a documentary, of an actual outreach program. Part of the Reel Jews film festival, which ends today(www.92y.org).  Makor/92nd Street Y, Steinhardt Building, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan; 7:30 p.m.; $9.    THE GENDER WARS  In the tiny gallery space of Foxy Production, the artist Tara Mateik will lecture on a theory: that the medical establishment has brainwashed us with an overly narrow concept of gender. Sounds dry, sure, but in a tongue-in-cheek PowerPoint presentation, Mr. Mateik will also induct the audience into the Society of Biological Insurgents, a secret cell of gender revolutionaries.  Foxy Production, 547 West 27th Street, sixth floor, Chelsea; 7 p.m., free. (Also Dec. 16 and 18.) R.S.V.P at dare@foxyproduction.com.

Directed by Philip Gröning  6 p.m. Thursday, Museum of Modern Art","excerpt":"noon Sunday, Walter Reade Theater       A German documentary about Roman Catholic monks who barely utter a word, ''Into Great Silence'' runs 162 minutes -- 162 engrossing, entrancing, enlivening minutes. Operating the camera himself, the director, Philip Gröning, brings us inside a world as mysterious and often as silent as the dark side of the moon, a charterhouse of Carthusian monks in the French Alps. Founded in the 12th century, the Carthusians are among the most rigorous of all Catholic orders, since the monks (and separately accommodated nuns) mostly live alone in their individual cells. In an overwhelmingly noisy world, the Carthusians seek God in solitude; all things considered, including the enviable tranquillity and focus of their lives, you soon understand why.      Because solitude is the essential vocation of the Carthusians, ''Into Great Silence'' is purposely low volume, with no voice-over and little exegesis. (Indeed I found most of my facts about the Carthusians at the order's helpful Web site.) Framed by the seasons, the film opens in a wintry hush with the introduction of two initiates. In the days and seasons that follow, the filmmaker takes us in and around the charterhouse and cells, following the initiates and monks as they eat, pray, work -- planting, cooking, sewing -- and sometimes play. Through unrushed rhythms and a harmonious mise-en-scène, Mr. Gröning finds beauty in a mote of dust, a patch of newly tilled earth and the long white eyebrows that hang over an aged blind monk's eyes like a curtain. Grace, it seems, makes little noise.

Carrying on the tradition of Goya and Daumier with gusto and pungency, one section of the show contains 38 drawings, some never before shown, covering issues, people and events from 1908 through last year.   It is called \\"In Good Conscience: The Radical Tradition in 20th-Century American Illustration,\\" and it includes George Bellows's \\"Murder of Edith Cavell\\" (1918), Reginald Marsh's \\"Bread Line\\" (1928), Paul Cadmus's \\"To the Lynching!\\" (1935), and Ben Shahn's \\"Sacco and Vanzetti\\" (1952).   John Sloan, William Gropper and Sue Coe are among the other artists whose work illustrates everything from reported German atrocities in World War I to the stock market crash of 1929 to the civil rights struggle, the Vietnam War, political assassinations, world hunger, homelessness and the AIDS crisis. The curator for the segment was Bernard F. Reilly Jr., curator of prints and photographs at the Library of Congress.   A second show is devoted to the lithographs, etchings, drawings and sketchbooks of Alan E. Cober, titled \\"The Artist as Illustrator/The Illustrator as Journalist.\\" The retrospective spans 30 years and includes commissions executed for Esquire, Harper's, Time, Rolling Stone, The Atlantic and The New York Times, focusing on Mr. Cober's visual reportage of news, culture and the environment. Steven Heller, a senior art director for The New York Times, was curator of the Cober part of the exhibition.   Both shows will remain through Sept. 27, after which they will travel to Dartmouth College in New Hampshire until mid-December, then to the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts in Alabama through late February.   The Katonah Museum is on Route 22 at Jay Street, off Exit 6 of I-684, then east on Route 35 and south on Route 22. Viewing hours are noon to 5 P.M.

A family fishing expedition will be conducted by the County Parks Department today at 2 P.M. in Playland Lake. The lake, made by damming a former bay, takes up 80 acres of the 90-acre Edith G. Read Sanctuary.   Ken Soltesz, curator at the sanctuary, will lead the group into knee-deep water with a long seining net supported by about 10 people. The net is dipped into the lake to pick up a variety of marine life, which may include jellyfish, shrimp, small flounders, minnows, killifish, pipefish and sticklebacks.   The catch will be placed in buckets of water for observation before being returned to the lake. In summer the tides bring in salt water and fish from Long Island Sound; during the rest of the year fresh water prevails, fed by rain. At its deepest point the lake measures 10 feet.   To reach the site without paying a parking fee, drive to the left of the Playland toll booth, follow the parking lot past the roller coaster and watch for the sanctuary sign on the right. The program will end around 3:30 P.M., and participants should wear clothes and shoes that withstand getting wet.   Another seining session is scheduled on Sept. 19 in Croton Point Park beginning at 7 P.M. and conducted by lantern light. Christopher Letts will be the leader. There is no charge for either event. Call 593-2602 for more information. SHOPS AND POPS    The site of the defunct Danbury Fair still draws people from several states. But instead of admiring the livestock, rattling and rolling on the midway rides, and slurping cotton candy, they shop, shop, shop at the Danbury Fair Mall, at the dozens of shopping plazas around it, and at Stew Leonard's. Getting to Danbury on I-684 from White Plains, then taking Connecticut Route 84 to the mall, is a matter of about 33 miles and 40 minutes.   At 8 P.M. Saturday, a day of shopping might be completed with a pops concert conducted by Skitch Henderson and featuring Judy Collins and the Ives Symphony Orchestra. It will be performed at the Charles Ives Center for the Performing Arts, on the Danbury campus of Western Connecticut State University, not far from the mall. Reserved tent seats are $20 and $25; lawn seating is $12 in advance, $15 at the gate. Call (203) 797-4490 for tickets.   The mall is anchored by Lord & Taylor, Macy's, Sears, G. Fox and J. C. Penney and contains 210 specialty shops, including Laura Ashley and Lerner's, and 20 restaurants. Stew Leonard's is a barnlike supermarket with 125,000 square feet of fresh produce, meats, fish, its own dairy products, takeout dishes, imported cheeses, groceries, flowers and an in-store bakery. Outdoors there is a petting zoo; indoors, animated figures of singing cows, farmers and country musicians stand atop the food cases. Prices are lower than average because of volume sales and spot purchasing. ART OF A SORT    A promotional campaign at a Scarsdale shop is producing a bizarre display of \\"art,\\" if one accepts the premise that anything that is framed is art. Now being framed is an airplane wing from World War II. To create a window display of travel mementos called \\"Souvenirs From the States\\" or \\"The Great American Frame-Up,\\" the Scarsdale Art and Frame Shop is seeking items from all 50 states to be framed at a 20 percent discount, then displayed.   Marilyn Bloom, the owner, says, \\"Anything can be framed.\\" So far her workshop has framed a Pony Express saddle bag, autographs of some of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, boat gear, Navajo rugs, sand paintings, and, assembled as a collage, a Colt 45, holster, sheriff's badge and photograph of a sheriff.

Eisenstein's new and much-heralded Russian film, the first part of \\"Ivan the Terrible,\\" which came to the Stanley on Saturday. And the desire to see it will be not only because it is the first film from Eisenstein, one of the really great artists in the medium, in nearly eight years","excerpt":"nor because of the recently reported difficulties of this irrepressible man with the guardians of Soviet culture over the second part of the \\"Ivan\\" trilogy, nor because they are passionately interested in a sixteenth-century Russian czar.They will want to see it—or, rather, they should want to see it, very much—because it is, in its pure display of cinema, one of the most imposing films ever made. Mark you well, now—we are not saying that it is a great dramatic work nor a gem of historical narration nor of social philosophy. It is, in the recognized tradition of previous Eisenstein films, almost completely lacking in conventional narrative style, and the simplest liaisons of continuity, as we expect them in story-telling, are eschewed.In staging a panorama of the reign of Ivan IV, from the time of his coronation to his first renunciation of the crown, Eisenstein has patterned his picture in a series of theatrical tableaux, vast and elaborate representations of episodes in the ruler's career. And, without making visible endeavor to show character in any more than the broadest strokes, he has put on the screen a human conflict of the sternest and most elemental sort. On the one hand is Ivan the Terrible, a tall and ferocious man, determined to unify Russia and expand its borders to the limits of his grasp. And on the other hand are the rich and greedy boyars, suspicious of Ivan and jealous of their power. In between are a few court intriguers and rather tentative intruders from the masses below.And what there is of personal drama, Eisenstein has expansively worked out in ominous scenes of stylized acting and searching looks at expressions of face. There is the friend and most trusted associate of Ivan who secretly covets the throne and seeks to seduce the czarina when Ivan is believed to have died. And there is the dark and malicious boyarina who wants the throne for her imbecile son and who presumably intrigues with other boyars to wrench it from Ivan's grasp.But all of these aspects of drama—and even the assault by Ivan on the city of Kazan—are presented in a style of pageant acting, quite similar to pantomime. And they are accompanied—or orchestrated—to a magnificent score by Prokofieff. As a matter of fact, the musical scoring and the employment of tonal qualities are quite as important in this picture as the eloquent images cast upon the screen—images brilliantly created by sumptuous decor and splendid camera work.The result is a film of awesome and monumental impressiveness, in which the senses are saturated in medieval majesty. The opening sequence, for instance, in which the coronation of Ivan is displayed, with the pomp of ceremonials and the glorious hymning of a cathedral choir, while the bells of Moscow ring in a silver paean outside, is one of the grandest sequences that we have ever seen. And some of Eisenstein's compositions with individuals and crowds are past all compare.His performers, too, are fascinating. Nikolai Cherkassov as Ivan is superb, a monolith of a person, eloquent in bearing and speech. And Nazvanov is a creature of pale treachery as his most trusted friend, while Ludmila Tselikovskaya is a doll with odd expressions as his first wife.To be sure, this conception of Ivan as a fierce and tempestuous man, bent on bringing all Russia into one nationality and achieving this aim, apparently, at the expense of anyone who stands in his way, is conspicuously totalitarian. And Ivan might just as well be one of Hitler's Teutonic heroes as a man venerated by the Soviet state. But, for all its suggestive ideology, the film is a work of art and not to be missed by those people who want to see the screen eloquently employed.

Riegle Jr.:  Introduction    The United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics initiated preliminary inquiries into allegations of misconduct by Senator Alan Cranston, Senator Dennis DeConcini, Senator John Glenn, Senator John McCain, and Senator Donald Riegle, in connection with their actions on behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr. and Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. In the course of its preliminary inquiries, the committee held hearings over a two-month period which began Nov. 15, 1990.                    . . .         While the committee has concluded that none of the Senators' actions . . . when considered without regard to any contribution or other benefit, violated any law or Senate rule, each act must also be examined against more general ethical standards to determine if there was any impropriety because of any relation between those actions and campaign contributions or other benefits provided by Mr. Keating and his associates.                    . . .         Based on all the available evidence, the committee has concluded that in the case of each of the five Senators, all campaign contributions from Mr. Keating and his associates under the Federal Election Campaign Act were within the established legal limits, and were properly reported. Similarly, from the available evidence, the committee concludes that the Senator's solicitation or acceptance of all contributions made in these cases to state party organizations, political action committees, and voter registration organizations were, standing alone, not illegal or improper","excerpt":"nor did any such contribution constitute a personal gift to any Senator.   With respect to each Senator, there remains the question of whether any actions taken by the Senator, standing alone or in combination with contributions or other benefits, constitutes improper conduct or an appearance of impropriety. The committee has examined the specific conduct of each Senator and has determined that under the totality of the circumstances: the conduct of each of the five Senators reflected poor judgment; the conduct of some of the Senators constituted at least an appearance of improper conduct; and the conduct of one Senator may have been improper.                    . . .         Recommendations  Constituent Service    As noted in the course of the committee's hearings, the Senate has no specific written standards embodied in the Senate rules respecting contact or intervention with Federal executive or independent regulatory agency officials. . . .   The committee believes that the Senate should adopt written standards in this area. A specific proposal should be developed either by the Senate Rules Committee or by a bipartisan Senate task force created for this purpose.                    . . .         Campaign Reform    The inquiries in these five cases have shown the obvious ethical dilemmas inherent in the current system by which political activities are financed. The committee notes that over 80 percent of the funds at issue were not disclosed funds raised by candidates for Senate or House campaigns under the Federal Election Campaign Act. Rather, such funds were undisclosed, unregulated funds raised for independent expenditures, political party \\"soft money,\\" and a non-Federal political action committee. Any campaign finance reform measure will have to address these mechanisms for political activities, as well as campaign fund raising and expenditures directly by candidates, in order to deal meaningfully and effectively with the issues presented in these cases.   The committee urges the leadership and members of both the Senate and the House to work together in a bipartisan manner to address the urgent need for comprehensive campaign finance reform. The reputation and honor of our institutions demand it.                    . . .         Panel Findings  Senator Cranston    . . . The committee finds that there is substantial credible evidence that provides substantial cause for the committee to conclude that, in connection with his conduct relating to Charles H. Keating Jr., and Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, Senator Cranston may have engaged in improper conduct that may reflect upon the Senate, as contemplated in Section 2 (a) (1) of S. Res. 338, 88th Congress, as amended. To wit, there is substantial credible evidence that provides substantial cause for the committee to conclude, based upon the totality of the circumstances, including but not limited to the following conduct or activities, that Senator Cranston engaged in an impermissible pattern of conduct in which fund raising and official activities were substantially linked:   (1) From April 1987 through April 1989, Senator Cranston personally, or through Senate staff, contacted the Federal Home Loan Bank Board on behalf of Lincoln, during a period when Senator Cranston was soliciting and accepting substantial contributions from Mr. Keating. On at least four occasions, these contacts were made in close connection with the solicitation or receipt of contributions. These four occasions are as follows:   (i) As a result of a solicitation from Senator Cranston in early 1987, Mr. Keating, on March 3, 1987, contributed $100,000 to America Votes, a voter registration organization. This contribution was made during the period leading to Senator Cranston's participation in the April 2 and April 9 meetings with Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin J. Gray and the San Francisco regulators.   (ii) In the fall of 1987, Senator Cranston solicited from Mr. Keating a $250,000 contribution, which was delivered to the Senator personally by Mr. Keating's employee James Grogan on Nov. 6, 1987. When the contribution was delivered, Mr. Grogan and Senator Cranston called Mr. Keating, who asked if the Senator would contact new Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall about Lincoln. Senator Cranston agreed to do so, and made the call six days later.    (iii) In January 1988, Mr. Keating offered to make an additional contribution and also asked Senator Cranston to set up a meeting for him with Chairman Wall. Senator Cranston did so on Jan. 20, 1988, and Chairman Wall and Mr. Keating met eight days later. On Feb. 10, 1988, Senator Cranston personally collected checks totaling $500,000 for voter registration groups.   (iv) In early 1989, at the time that Senator Cranston was contacting Bank Board officials about the sale of Lincoln, he personally or through Joy Jacobson, his chief fund raiser, solicited another contribution. (This contribution was never made. American Continental Corporation declared bankruptcy on April 13, 1989.)   (2) Senator Cranston's Senate office practices further evidenced an impermissible pattern of conduct in which fund raising and official activities were substantially linked. For example, Joy Jacobson (who was not a member of his Senate staff and who had no official Senate duties or substantive expertise), engaged in the following activities with Senator Cranston's knowledge, permission, at his direction, or under his supervision:   (i) Senator Cranston's fund raiser repeatedly scheduled and attended meetings between Senator Cranston and contributors in which legislative or regulatory issues were discussed.   (ii) Senator Cranston's fund raiser often served as the intermediary for Mr. Keating or Mr. Grogan when they could not reach the Senator or Carolyn Jordan, the Senator's banking aide.   (iii) Senator Cranston received several memoranda from Ms. Jacobson which evidenced her understanding that contributors were entitled to special attention and special access to official services. Senator Cranston never told her that her understanding was incorrect, nor did he inform her that such a connection between contributions and official actions was improper.                    . . .         The committee, pursuant to committee supplementary procedural rules . . . shall proceed to an investigation under committee supplementary procedural Rule 5; and that Senator Cranston shall be given timely written notice of this resolution and the evidence supporting it, and informed of a respondent's rights pursuant to the rules of the committee.                    . . .         Senator DeConcini    Based on the evidence available to it, the committee has given consideration to Senator DeConcini's actions on behalf of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. While aggressive conduct by senators in dealing with regulatory agencies is sometimes appropriate and necessary, the committee concludes that Senator DeConcini's aggressive conduct with the regulators was inappropriate. The committee further concludes that the actions of Senator DeConcini after the April 9, 1987, meeting where he learned of the criminal referral, were not improper in and of themselves.   While the committee concludes that Senator DeConcini has violated no law of the United States or specific rule of the United States Senate, it emphasizes that it does not condone his conduct. The committee has concluded that the totality of the evidence shows that Senator DeConcini's conduct gave the appearance of being improper and was certainly attended with insensitivity and poor judgment. However, the committee finds that his conduct did not reach a level requiring institutional action.   The committee therefore concludes that no further action is warranted with respect to Senator DeConcini on the matters investigated during the preliminary inquiry.  Senator Glenn    Based on the evidence available to it, the committee has given consideration to Senator Glenn's actions on behalf of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. The committee concludes that Senator Glenn, although believing that the Lincoln matter was in the process of resolution, exercised poor judgment in arranging a luncheon meeting between Mr. Keating and Speaker Wright in January 1988, some eight months after Senator Glenn learned of the criminal referral. There is disputed evidence as to whether Lincoln's problems with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (F.H.L.B.B.) were discussed at that meeting. The evidence indicates that Senator Glenn's participating did not go beyond serving as host. The committee further concludes that Senator Glenn's actions were not improper or attended with gross negligence and did not reach the level requiring institutional action against him.   Senator Glenn has violated no law of the United States or specific rule of the United States Senate; therefore, the committee concludes that no further action is warranted with respect to Senator Glenn on the matters investigated during the preliminary inquiry.  Senator McCain    Based on the evidence available to it, the committee has given consideration to Senator McCain's actions on behalf of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. The committee concludes that Senator McCain's actions were not improper nor attended with gross negligence and did not reach the level of requiring institutional action against him. The committee finds that Senator McCain took no further action after the April 9, 1987, meeting when he learned of the criminal referral.                    . . .         Senator McCain has violated no law of the United States or specific Rule of the United States Senate; therefore, the committee concludes that no further action is warranted with respect to Senator McCain on the matters investigated during the preliminary inquiry.  Senator Riegle    Based on the evidence available to it, the committee has given consideration to Senator Riegle's actions on behalf of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. The committee finds that Senator Riegle took steps to assist Lincoln Savings & Loan Association with its regulatory problems at a time that Charles Keating was raising substantial campaign funds, for Senator Riegle. During the course of the hearings, possible conflicts arose concerning actions on the part of Senator Riegle that caused the committee concern, but the committee finds that the evidence indicates no deliberate intent to deceive. The evidence shows that Senator Riegle took no further action after the April 9, 1987, meeting where he learned of the criminal referral.   While the committee concludes that Senator Riegle has violated no law of the United States or specific rule of the United States Senate, it emphasizes that it does not condone his conduct. The committee has concluded that the totality of the evidence shows that Senator Riegle's conduct gave the appearance of being improper and was certainly attended with insensitivity and poor judgment. However, the committee finds that his conduct did not reach a level requiring institutional action.   The committee concludes that no further action is warranted with respect to Senator Riegle on the matters investigated during the preliminary inquiry.

The ''situation'' he refers to was my fruitless single-handed attempt to call attention to the scourge of international terrorism by protesting Kreisky's notorious embrace of the P.L.O. chieftain, Yasir Arafat. Only three months before this conference, in October 1985, Palestinian terrorists on the cruise ship Achille Lauro had thrown Leon Klinghoffer, an elderly American, overboard in his wheelchair.    In brief written remarks, respectfully couched, and addressed to a panel that included Kreisky and Pierre Trudeau of Canada, I noted that in 1979 Kreisky became the first European leader to bestow state honors on Arafat. (He was not to be the last, given the roster of Western notables who in 2004 attended Arafat's funeral.) But Kreisky did not, in fact, ''handle the situation'' with grace","excerpt":"nor did the panel's moderator, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who angrily cut me off in midsentence. As for Kreisky himself: he announced at the start his suspicion of the existence of a large conspiracy directed against him. ''I told my friend Trudeau,'' he fulminated, ''that every such conference decides on its victim, and this time it is Kreisky.'' Then he went on to justify P.L.O. terrorism. Upbraided by the moderator, I retreated amid hisses and groans. One particularly incensed spokesman for writerly humanism spat in my face; and so, as Rushdie puts it, ''the trouble quickly passed.''     ''As I recall,'' Rushdie writes, ''Kreisky's defenders pointed out that during his chancellorship, Austria had taken in more refugee Russian Jews than any other country.'' He might also wish to recall that in 1973 Kreisky capitulated to the P.L.O. by agreeing to close down the Schoenau transit headquarters for those same Soviet emigrants.    Kreisky's grand conspiracy, as it happened, consisted of one lone writer clutching a single sheet of paper, an appeal for signatures to a statement that quoted a Chekhovian aperçu: ''Writers and artists should engage themselves in politics only enough to protect themselves from politics.'' An idea that might have been especially pertinent in a conference atmosphere zealously congenial to the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, whose representative writer, an official said to be in charge of prisons, publicly conceded that his regime had only ''a little tiny bit of censorship.''

At least nine teams have realistic aspirations of winning the championship. And the majority of the contenders are in the Western Conference. Even some coaches in the Eastern Conference admit that the balance of power has shifted to the West.    \\"You could be an awfully good team in the West this year and struggle just to make the playoffs,\\" said Stu Jackson, the Knicks' coach.    Here is a capsule look at all 27 teams. Statistics are from last season.  EASTERN CONFERENCE: ATLANTIC DIVISION Boston Celtics Quick Recap: 52-30 record last season, lost to Knicks in first round of the playoffs. New Faces: Dee Brown (18th pick in the draft), Chris Ford (coach, a former Boston assistant), Brian Shaw (returned after season in Italy), Stojan Vrankovic (signed as free agent from Yugoslavia). Top Guns: Larry Bird (24.3 points, 93 percent free-throw average), Kevin McHale (20.9 pts., 89.3% f.t.), Reggie Lewis (17 pts.), Robert Parish (15.7 pts., 58 percent field-goal average, 10.1 rebounds). Game Plan: Ford wants the Celtics to use the fast break more, taking advantage of the speed of Shaw, Lewis and Brown. But the average age of the front line is 34, making Boston susceptible to fatigue in April and May. Playoff savvy and experience make the Celtics a contender, but only if they remain healthy.  New York Knicks Quick Recap: 45-37, lost to Detroit in second round of playoffs. New Faces: Greg Grant (free agent from Phoenix), Jerrod Mustaf (17th pick in the draft). Top Guns: Patrick Ewing (28.6 pts., 55.1% f.g., 10.9 rebs., 3.9 blocks), Charles Oakley (14.6 pts.), Gerald Wilkins (14.5 pts.), Kiki Vandeweghe (11.7 pts.). Game Plan: Coach Stu Jackson wants to play more of an up-tempo game, hoping for easier scoring opportunities. If Vandeweghe remains healthy and Mark Jackson returns to old form, New York should win 45 to 55 games. But despite Ewing's dominance, the Knicks need more from the supporting cast to get past the second round of the playoffs.  Philadelphia 76ers Quick Recap: 53-29, lost to Chicago in second round of playoffs. New Faces: Manute Bol (in trade from Golden State), Rickey Green (free agent from Indiana), Brian Oliver (32d pick). Top Guns: Charles Barkley (25.2 pts., 60% f.g., 11.5 rebs.), Hersey Hawkins (18.5 pts., 88.8% f.t., 42% f.g.), Johnny Dawkins (14.3 pts.), Mike Gminski (13.7 pts.), Ron Anderson (11.9 pts.), Rick Mahorn (10.8 pts.), Bol (3.1 pts.). Game Plan: Barkley is completely recovered from shoulder surgery. Bol should put a few more fans into the seats, and a few more shots into the basket. One of last year's biggest surprises, Philadelphia has enough offense to repeat as division champions, but its bench still lacks depth, which will hurt should any of the starters suffer an injury.  Washington Bullets Quick Recap: 31-51, failed to make the playoffs. New Faces: Pervis Ellison (in trade from the Sacramento Kings), A.: J. English (37th pick). Top Guns: Bernard King (22.4 pts.), John Williams (18.2 pts.), Ledell Eackles (13.5 pts.), Mark Alarie (10.5 pts.), Darrell Walker (8 assists), Charles Jones (2.4 blocks). Game Plan: Knee injury to Williams last season ended any hopes for the team to make playoffs. He has recovered, but trade of Jeff Malone leaves major void in the offense. The jury is still out on Ellison, whose injury-plagued rookie season earned him the nickname Out-of-Service Pervis. The Bullets should once again be out of the playoffs.  Miami Heat Quick Recap: 18-64, failed to make the playoffs. New Faces: Willie Burton (ninth pick), Bimbo Coles (40th pick), Alec Kessler (12th pick), Jeff Sanders (in trade from Chicago). Top Guns: Rony Seikaly (16.6 pts., 10.4 rebs.), Sherman Douglas (14.3 pts.), Glen Rice (13.6 pts.), Kevin Edwards (12 pts.), Jon Sundvold (44% on 3-pointers). Game Plan: The Heat's bid for instant respectability failed when Cleveland matched Miami's offer sheet to John (Hot Rod) Williams. Seikaly is becoming a force, but he needs more help. Once again, Miami will watch the playoffs from the beach, but they should crack the 20-victory barrier.  New Jersey Nets Quick Recap: 17-65, the worst record in the league. New Faces: Jud Buechler (38th pick), Derrick Coleman (first pick), Tate George (22d pick), Reggie Theus (in trade from Orlando). Top Guns: Theus (18.9 pts.), Chris Morris (14.8 pts.), Sam Bowie (14.7 pts.), Derrick Gervin (12 pts.), Mookie Blaylock (10.1 pts.), Lester Conner (2.1 steals). Game Plan: After bad chemistry, injuries, lack of talent and nonexistent fan support of last season, the Nets figure things can't get worse. Coleman will help, but he missed virtually all of training camp, which will slow his early progress. No one knows when Roy Hinson will be back from knee surgery. This will be another season when the Nets will be fortunate to win 30 games. CENTRAL DIVISION Chicago Bulls Quick Recap: 55-27 record last season, lost to Detroit in Eastern Conference final. New Faces: Dennis Hopson (in trade from Nets), Cliff Levingston (free agent from Atlanta). Top Guns: Michael Jordan (33.6 pts., 2.7 steals,), Scottie Pippen (16.5 pts., 2.5 steals), Hopson (15.8 pts.), Horace Grant (13.4 pts.), Bill Cartwright (11.4 pts.), John Paxson (10 pts.), Craig Hodges (48.1% on 3-pointers). Game Plan: A serious threat to unseat the Pistons as division champions. Pippen, Grant, Stacey King and B.: J. Armstrong continue to improve, while Jordan continues to be Jordan. The Bulls desperately need the home-court advantage to defeat Detroit in the playoffs. Detroit Pistons Quick Recap: 59-23, won second consecutive league championship. New Faces: Lance Blanks (26th pick), Tree Rollins (free agent from Cleveland). Top Guns: Isiah Thomas (18.4 pts., 9.4 asts.), Joe Dumars (17.8 pts., 90% f.t.), James Edwards (14.5 pts.), Mark Aguirre (14.1 pts.), Bill Laimbeer (12.1 pts.). Game Plan: Chuck Daly is often overlooked, but he is a superb game coach and his players still respect him after eight seasons. Despite strong personalities, this team continues to avoid the dissension that often destroys great teams. No team plays better defense, and that gives Detroit an excellent chance to win another title.  Cleveland Cavaliers Quick Recap: 42-40, lost to Philadelphia in first round of playoffs. New Faces: Milos Babic (50th pick), Danny Ferry (entering league after a season in Italy). Top Guns: Mark Price (19.6 pts., 88.8% f.t., 9.1 ast.), John Williams, (16.8 pts., 2 blocks), Brad Daugherty (16.8 pts., Larry Nance (16.3 pts.), Craig Ehlo (13.6 pts., 41.9% on 3-pointers), Steve Kerr (50.7% on 3-pointers). Game Plan: Williams's Fort Knox contract gives Cleveland the league's highest payroll. But when healthy, this team can compete with anyone and is clearly a contender. Was it worth trading Ron Harper to acquire Ferry? We'll find out.  Indiana Pacers Quick Recap: 42-40, lost to Detroit in first round of playoffs. New Faces: Antonio Davis (45th pick), Kenny Williams (46th pick), Michael Williams (free agent from Charlotte Hornets). Top Guns: Reggie Miller (24.6 pts., 41.4% on 3-pointers), Chuck Person (19.7 pts.), Detlef Schrempf (16.2 pts.), Rik Smits (15.5 pts., 2 blocks), Vern Fleming (14.3 pts.). Game Plan: The Pacers did not make a significant off-season trade","excerpt":"nor did they get a first-round draft choice. To improve, they will need consistent seasons from Smits, Fleming and Person. Still not ready to challenge Detroit, Chicago or Cleveland.  Atlanta Hawks Quick Recap: 41-41, failed to make the playoffs. New Faces: Stephen Bardo (41st pick), Tim McCormick (in trade from Houston), Sidney Moncrief (returned from retirement), Rumeal Robinson (10th pick), Bob Weiss (coach, former San Antonio coach and Orlando assistant), Trevor Wilson (36th pick). Top Guns: Dominique Wilkins (26.7 pts.), Moses Malone (18.9 pts., 10 rebs.), Doc Rivers (12.5 pts.), Kevin Willis (12.4 pts.), John Battle (10.9 pts.). Game Plan: Hawks are getting older without getting better. Wilkins and Malone sometimes have trouble meshing. If team sneak into the playoffs, it probably won't stay long.  Milwaukee Bucks Quick Recap: 44-38, lost to Chicago in first round of playoffs. New Faces: Frank Brickowski (in trade from San Antonio), Steve Henson (44th pick), Danny Schayes (in trade from Denver). Top Guns: Ricky Pierce (23 pts.), Jay Humphries (15.3 pts.), Alvin Robertson (14.2 pts., 2.5 steals), Jack Sikma (13.9 pts.), Fred Roberts (10.5 pts.), Schayes (10.4 pts.). Game Plan: Robertson, a guard, led the Bucks in rebounding last season, which is why they traded for Brickowski and Schayes. But the Bucks still lack frontcourt scoring and overall quickness. Their streak of 11 consecutive seasons in the playoffs is in serious jeopardy.  Charlotte Hornets Quick Recap: 19-63, failed to make the playoffs. New Faces: Kendall Gill (fifth pick), Jim Les (free agent), Johnny Newman (free agent from Knicks), Doug Roth (free agent from Washington), Steve Scheffler (39th pick). Top Guns: Rex Chapman (17.5 pts.), Armon Gilliam (16.7 pts.), Dell Curry (16 pts.), Kelly Tripucka (15.6 pts.), J.: R. Reid (11.1 pts.), Muggsy Bogues (10.7 asts.). Game Plan: Except for the play of the 5-foot-3-inch Bogues, there is little to get excited about with this team. Newman may wish he were back with the Knicks by Christmas. At least Charlotte has good fans.

George Rondo, the show's original director in 1985, has filed a $3 million lawsuit against Dan Goggin, the play's writer, director and co-producer. On May 10 the State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that the case should go to trial, probably in the fall.   Mr. Rondo says that although he contributed creative material to the show, a campy take on nuns and parochial school that is still playing Off Broadway, he makes no claims on Mr. Goggin's copyright","excerpt":"nor does he say he is a co-author of the book. His suit, he says, is \\"based on giving Dan Goggin six months of my time, conceptualizing the show and directing it, for which I was never paid.\\"   Mr. Rondo says he did not have a written contract for the show but had an oral agreement with Mr. Goggin. He says he was dismissed after Mr. Goggin disagreed with his interpretation of the material. Mr. Goggin then assumed the role of director.   \\"When I worked on the show in 1985, it was called 'The Nunsense Story,' \\" Mr. Rondo recalls. \\"But some of the material written by Steve Hayes, who was Dan Goggin's co-author, was not acceptable to us, and Steve was let go. I worked with Dan on removing that material, changing the title, and I directed an encapsulated version at Don't Tell Mama.

We are confident that this will be decided in Dan Goggin's favor.\\"  Newly 'Forbidden'     The only thing to do about a Broadway season like this one is to laugh, and that's something Gerard Alessandrini is good at. In \\"Forbidden Broadway 1991 1/2,\\" his newest edition of theatrical spoofs, he skewers just about every show that opened this season. The working titles of some of the new numbers, pending permission from the real show's creators, are \\"Swillomania,\\" for \\"The Will Rogers Follies\\"; \\"I Hit Hamlet,\\" a takeoff on Nicol Williamson's heavy-metal approach to acting; \\"The Secret Deodorant Garden -- Made for a Woman,\\" a poke at the cult status of the classic novel on which the musical \\"The Secret Garden\\" is based, and \\"Six Degrees of Segregation,\\" a sketch that Mr. Alessandrini is still fine-tuning.   There is a spoof of Stephen Sondheim's \\"Assassins\\" in which an actor who plays Mr. Sondheim sings, to the tune of \\"You Can't Get a Man With a Gun,\\" \\"You can't make a hit with a gun.\\" Mr. Alessandrini has also written a song between the helicopter in \\"Miss Saigon\\" and the chandelier in \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" because, he says, \\"They're the two biggest stars on Broadway, and they deserve a duet.\\"   Other highlights include \\"Topol's Nightmare,\\" inspired by the number \\"Tevye's Nightmare\\" in \\"Fiddler on the Roof,\\" in which Zero Mostel comes back from the dead to haunt his successor, and a new segment called \\"Close a Little Faster,\\" dedicated to the flops of the current season. The title is taken from the nickname given a few seasons back to the unsuccessful Charles Strouse-Alan Jay Lerner musical \\"Dance a Little Closer.\\" Among the new selections, Mr. Alessandrini says, are \\"No Kay!,\\" referring to the much-touted \\"vacation\\" that \\"Oh, Kay!\\" took in mid-season before a scheduled spring re-opening that never happened; and \\"Show Gone,\\" referring to the short-lived \\"Shogun: The Musical.\\"   \\"Forbidden Broadway 1991 1/2,\\" now in previews at Theater East, officially opens on June 20. Not the Last 'Kiss'     This is the last weekend to see Craig Lucas's \\"Prelude to a Kiss,\\" which abruptly posted its closing notice on Tuesday night. It surprised many in the theater, since Steve Guttenberg joined the cast only eight weeks ago and the actress Taylor Young played her first performance the night the notice went up.   The only time a show closes is when it doesn't make money. But the co-producer of \\"Prelude,\\" Michael David, says the closing is not a reflection of Mr. Guttenberg's drawing power at the box office. \\"We've had a 54-week run,\\" he says, \\"and we've weathered the tough times well. But now, we want to leave without licking the pavement.\\"   Mr. David says the industry wisdom of \\"star equals money\\" isn't that wise after all and applies only in the early stages of a show's life. More to the point, he says, is that the regular theatergoing audience in New York is small and needs to be developed so that nonmusical plays can run longer, with or without a star. \\"Initially, the show was hot no matter who was in it, and certain people will come no matter what,\\" Mr. David says. \\"But let's put it this way: A. J. Foyt couldn't win the Indianapolis 500 if his car ran out of gas. Steve Guttenberg was in the same position.\\"   But \\"Prelude,\\" a love story about a young couple and a mysterious older man, is going strong outside New York.

Maugham himself felt, grudgingly, that he was better known for the film adaptations of his books than for the books themselves.     Maugham, who died in 1965 at 91, enjoyed an extremely long and productive career, which is a good start for a writer hoping to rack up his kind of stats","excerpt":"nor does it hurt that so many of his works were filmed more than once.

It had cost a mind-bending $2-million to produce, starred just about everyone who was ever connected with Griffith, featured dozens of others not then very well known, like Eric Von Stroheim as a Pharisee (whom I've yet to find in the film), and it intercut four different stories of intolerance through the ages, locked together by the image (out of \\"Leaves of Grass\\") of a woman (Lillian Gish) rocking the cradle of humanity.The public, which has never liked to have its mind bent, was apparently confused. The film was a financial failure. The critics, who were in awe of Griffith, were respectful of the film, but bored by everything except its spectacle.It is not difficult to find flaws in such a giant work, but they are small flaws, and it is an idiot's pleasure to dwell upon them, as John Howard Lawson once did when he complained that nothing happened to the woman rocking the cradle. Knowing Lawson's ideas, I suppose he would have liked the woman, towards the end of the film, to abandon the cradle to take up arms at the barricades of Babylon, to kneel at the foot of the cross in Jesus's Judea, to throw a cobblestone at Catherine de Medici after the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, and to be on hand, in the modern sequence, when The Dear One saves The Boy from the gallows.\\"Intolerance,\\" however, doesn't have much to do with the sort of perfectly composed screenplays Lawson analyzes at such length in his \\"Theory and Technique of Playwriting and Screenwriting.\\" Like all great art, it transcends the theories and techniques that give some order to lesser art.Tonight, almost 55 years after its New York opening, \\"Intolerance\\" will be shown for what I'm told is the first time in something approximating its entirety on New York television, beginning at 9 o'clock on Channel 13, as part of the series titled \\"The Silent Years.\\" An uncommonly genial Orson Welles, who is a great moviemaker himself when he is not voicing the little homilies of Eastern Airlines (\\"It's impossible to remain a stranger when someone asks you to pass the yams\\"), is the host for the series that is allowing us to see, at home, some of the greatest films of the silent era (\\"Broken Blossoms,\\" \\"The Gold Rush\\"), as wel as a lot of representative ones, all from the collection of Paul Killam,Although I have some nagging reservations about the manner of this presentation of \\"Intolerance,\\" which I saw last week on a television monitor at Channel 13, I can't imagine that anyone who has the slightest interest in movies will miss this screening with a good conscience. I'm talking principally to those people who always mean to get to the Museum of Modern Art, and to Anthology Film Archives, but never quite make it.Of historical interest is the fact that the film, which is usually seen in conventional black and white, is being shown here in what are described as the original color tints designed by Griffith. Like so many silent moviemakers, Griffith sought to reinforce the moods of his drama by switching from one tint of color film stock to another, from scene to scene. The tints I saw the other day are lovely — soft blues, ambers, pinks—and have the effect of giving mellow life to what Welles rightly describes as the 19th-century theater tradition out of which Griffith came.It is not difficult to marvel at the physical spectacle of \\"Intolerance\\" — the Babylonian sequence and Griffith's extraordinary crane shots have never been equalled","excerpt":"nor does it take a film buff to appreciate what has been called (maybe twice too often) the fugue-like structure of the film, the careful tempo of the cross-cutting that finally culminates in a positive orgy of interrelated, simultaneous climaxes, in Judea, Babylon, Paris and \\"a western American city\\" in 1916.\\"Intolerance,\\" however, has a lot more than this. It has, among other things, some beautiful performances, particularly by Mae Marsh as The Dear One, a modern strike sequence that is as stark and straight as a Dreiser exposition, and, over all, the sensibility of a romantic, extremely complicated man who, after the racial madnesses of \\"The Birth of a Nation,\\" came forth with an essay on intolerance, which so often gets away from its subject that, if the title cards were removed, you might forget about intolerance completely.Don't be bothered by those title cards (\\"The loom of fate weaves death for The Boy's father\\"). They are part of the literature of an era, and if you find them camp, the fault is not in the film.I'm bothered, however, by two aspects of this showing—the fact that it is accompanied by a busy piano score that I found insistent and intolerable, and not comparable to what I imagine the live symphony orchestra accompaniment to have been originally. It gets awfully cute. I'm also sorry that, because of technical problems, the film has to be projected at the sound-film speed of 24 frames a second, which is why all the characters seem to walk like penguins. The film was shot at speeds varying from 12 to 20 frames a second, which, when properly projected, give as life-like an illusion of action as do contemporary films.I would hope that people coming upon \\"Intolerance\\" will take this into consideration. Silent movies did not. in fact, look \\"funny.\\" If you want to check this out, Anthology Film Archives, located in Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival Theater complex on Lafayette Street, will next be showing \\"Intolerance\\" in their repertory on Sept. 29 at 8 P.M.

Yet, Telemann's industriousness may have created one of the problems posterity has had with his music - namely, the feeling that anyone who composed so much music must have churned out his works mechanically and without much thought.

Caro's characteristically monumental self-defense may have been taxed with more than they care to know about the 1948 senatorial victory of Lyndon Johnson over Coke Stevenson (\\"My Search for Coke Stevenson,\\" Feb. 3). But Mr. Caro's response to my review of his romance, \\"Means of Ascent,\\" in The New Republic of June 4, 1990, only raises again serious questions about his writing of history.   Robert Caro has a reverence for facts, which is admirable. He suggests that his encyclopedic thoroughness is unmatched, and must therefore be accepted as canon. In political history, however, Mr. Caro's narrow, positivistic cult of the fact will take you only so far. In this field there are many kinds of facts: reputations, images and prejudices are as much facts as vote counts, dates and place names.   \\"Not even Johnson's people disagreed about Stevenson,\\" Mr. Caro told The New York Times on March 31, 1990, implying universal admiration for Stevenson's sterling political character. But now Mr. Caro describes a highly developed negative perception of Stevenson fervently held in many quarters, not least within \\"the Johnson circle.\\" Mr. Caro assumes that because L.B.J.'s supporters have a vested interest in their criticism, it must be spurious, as if a motive sufficed to establish a lie.   \\"I was reading the approximately 56,000 pages of documents in the Johnson Library relating to the campaign,\\" he writes sanctimoniously in The Book Review about his positivist method. Mr. Caro might have taken note, however, of the less than admiring letter to Johnson about Stevenson's reputation written by J. Frank Dobie, the famous folklorist and historian of the West, which may be found in Johnson's House Papers, Box 89, the same papers that Mr. Caro says he has combed like no one else: \\"Coke stands for dollars and he does not stand for civilized life as it is furthered by schools, hospitals, and other institutions that must be promoted at public expense. I thought the attack you made on him as having the point of view of a county politician very good. Just call him a county politician. I think his proper place is in Kimble County.\\"   In his reply to my review, Mr. Caro has responded in detail to one (and only to one) of the many criticisms I made of his idealized portrait of Stevenson. I had interviewed Mark Adams, Stevenson's former secretary (a source cited by Ronnie Dugger in his biography of Johnson, \\"The Politician,\\" but not interviewed by Mr. Caro). Mr. Adams told me that many Texas politicians took money from oil companies and disguised the payoffs by pretending that they were payments for leases for oil drilling on land the politicians owned. Most of these leases were never registered. Mr. Adams also said that he was present at a curious meeting involving Stevenson and a lobbyist that Mr. Adams believed may have involved just such a deal. I noted that Mr. Adams's testimony was circumstantial and that its importance was in its confirmation of aspects of Stevenson's reputation -- it was widely believed in political circles in Texas at the time that he made these sorts of deals, which had contributed to his well-known sobriquet, Calculatin' Coke.   Mr. Caro says that he has conducted an investigation that has unearthed material proving that Stevenson earned $19,571 in a registered lease from the Magnolia Petroleum Company, not the (ultimately unprovable) $75,000 that Mr. Adams conjectured Stevenson took from unregistered leases. Mr. Caro's numbers, of course, prove nothing about any other of the rumored Stevenson deals or about his many sly political maneuvers. Mr. Caro took the widespread rumors about Stevenson seriously enough to devote considerable energy to researching them, but did not allow his readers to weigh his evidence before presenting his conclusion. Surely serious historians have a responsibility to incorporate even those facts that don't particularly suit their interpretations. The price of such full historiographical disclosure, however, is complication. Mr. Caro insists instead on a Manichaean narrative in which Coke Stevenson is a saint, \\"a folk hero\\" in Mr. Caro's words, so that Johnson can appear as a complete sinner. Instead of all the relevant facts and a complex story, Mr. Caro prefers congenial facts and a simple story.   He now acknowledges in passing that in his book he failed to chronicle Stevenson's extensive record of racism, which I described at length in my review -- a record so virulent that Stevenson was sternly rebuked for it by United States Attorney General Francis Biddle. Yet Mr. Caro feels compelled to insist that the sole flaw he is willing to recognize in his hero was shared by Johnson because of his campaign rhetoric against civil rights. Mr. Caro makes no effort to distinguish between Stevenson's heartfelt racism and Johnson's opportunism","excerpt":"nor does Mr. Caro bother to explain why almost all those in favor of civil rights backed Johnson and why the Dixiecrats backed Stevenson. (Dan Moody, Stevenson's lawyer in his case challenging the legality of L.B.J.'s victory, was an especially outspoken racist and Dixiecrat, a fact Mr. Caro neglected to mention.) The problem for Mr. Caro on this point is that it must undermine his future volumes on Johnson, when he emerges as the champion of civil rights. Having equated Johnson's political positioning in 1948 with Stevenson's authentic racism, Mr. Caro has diminished his own ability as a historian to illuminate Johnson's unfolding political life. Mr. Caro's morality play of \\"bright\\" and \\"dark\\" sides clashing in Johnson's character rules out a deeper understanding.   It is more than a little bizarre that a man who presents what he's writing as political history -- as a treatise on power, really -- not only refuses to write political history, but dismisses it. In his reply, as in his book, Mr. Caro stubbornly remains innocent of the political context of the events he describes. A few basic facts are needed.   In 1941 Representative Lyndon Johnson, the leading New Dealer in Texas, ran for the United States Senate against the reactionary Governor, W. Lee (Pappy) O'Daniel, a populist demagogue backed by, among others, Coke Stevenson. Every independent observer agrees that O'Daniel won the election with stolen votes. Former Governor James Allred charged that it was the Stevenson camp that had stolen the crucial votes. Johnson and every member of his entourage also believed this. (Whether or not Stevenson stole the votes, it is a fact of enormous political significance that it was widely believed he did, not least by L.B.J., who even spoke about it when he was President.)   In 1944 anti-Roosevelt forces, led by O'Daniel and quietly encouraged by Stevenson, split from the Democrats to form a right-wing, openly racist party called the Texas Regulars, with the aim of throwing Texas' Electoral College votes to the Republican Presidential candidate, Thomas E. Dewey. When this gambit failed, the Regulars went back into the Democratic Party in an effort to seize control. After two tumultuous conventions, they were repulsed by the Loyalists, who forged an alliance with Johnson. L.B.J.'s senatorial campaign against Stevenson (called a \\"mountebank\\" by Sam Rayburn, the hero of Mr. Caro's first volume on Johnson) was seen by them as part of a bigger struggle.   In Mr. Caro's book, however, all of this is completely absent. He does not even once mention the Texas Regulars. He explains in his reply that he is not \\"convinced\\" that this political history, involving every significant figure in Texas, played any role in the 1948 campaign. His reasoning eludes me, though I understand that for Mr. Caro the campaign was about only one thing: Stevenson's \\"reputation\\" (which he reports tendentiously) and Johnson's \\"destruction of that reputation.\\" Mr. Caro deals in individuals who are neatly dissociated from the larger forces swirling around them.   Some of Mr. Caro's cherished facts may not be as easy as they might seem. According to his account, Johnson in 1948 had made a deal with George Parr, the corrupt \\"Duke of Duval,\\" who held sway over large sections of south Texas. In a town called Alice in Jim Wells County, Ballot Box 13 was withheld on Election Night until the outcome became apparent. Then the ballots from that box gave Johnson his 87-vote margin of victory. After my review of Mr. Caro's book appeared, I received a letter from James M. Rowe, who, as a reporter for The Corpus Christi Caller-Times, was the only journalist for a daily newspaper to cover the area where the controversy over the stealing of the election occurred. Mr. Caro himself described Rowe in his book as \\"the reporter who knew Valley politics best in the post-war years.\\" \\"I, too, have tried to guide Robert Caro along the line of truth over legend in his search for the real Lyndon Johnson,\\" Rowe wrote me. At his own initiative, Rowe arranged to meet with Mr. Caro to give him his account of what happened. \\"Just before the series of excerpts appeared in The New Yorker magazine,\\" Rowe wrote, \\"he called to check on the scene at the Texas State Bank when Stevenson and his party, along with Frank Hamer  [ the former Texas Ranger, who had ambushed Bonnie and Clyde ] , went in to look at the poll and tally lists from Box 13 at Alice.\\"   In his climactic scene in \\"Means of Ascent,\\" Mr. Caro wrote: \\"Coke Stevenson and Frank Hamer walked side by side, two tall, broad-shouldered, erect, silent men -- two living legends of Texas, in fact -- two men out of another, vanishing age, another, vanishing code, marching down a street in a dusty Texas town to find out for themselves, and prove to the world, how Lyndon Johnson had gotten the two hundred crucial votes.\\" Mr. Caro goes on to describe how Hamer intimidated    pistoleros    blocking the way into the bank where the election records were kept, forcing them to part for Stevenson. About this passage, Rowe observed: \\"It left my mouth ajar when I read of the 'dusty' scene -- after all, I followed the party into the bank and was the only reporter there. . . . There were two banks, Texas State Bank and Alice National Bank. Furthermore the streets for many blocks around both banks have been paved for as long as I can remember. There wasn't any dust around or near the bank when we went in. What is more, I never heard Frank Hamer say a word, nor did I see the    pistoleros    at or near the bank entrance as described by Caro.\\" Rowe added: \\"I share with at least several hundred thousand Texans astonishment over the picture of Stevenson painted by Caro.\\"   In the study of history, omniscience is an impediment to knowledge.

If a recipe for bread stuffing or roast chicken called for the herb, I'd reach for the rectangular tin on my mother's spice rack. I never tasted fresh sage until about a decade ago, when I sampled fried sage leaves, delicately battered and drizzled with lemon juice, in Giuliano Bugialli's rustic Florentine kitchen. With that first bite (rapidly followed by several others) came the discovery that there is a stunning difference between graceful, fresh gray-green sage leaves with their velvety surface and the dried or powdered form. Appearance is only the most apparent distinction.\\n\\nMany accomplished cooks and gardeners assert that sage is one of the best herbs to dry because it retains its aroma and pungency. I can't disagree, especially if the product is relatively fresh. Still, I find that unless dried sage is slowly simmered, as in a stew or sauce, the dish is apt to retain a musty taste. With the fresh herb, the opposite is true: some of the most exciting tastes evolve when the leaves are used uncooked or just warmed through. Fresh sage pesto served with a roast shoulder of veal, as prepared by Ali Barker, the former executive chef of the Union Square Cafe in Manhattan and the Garden City Hotel on Long Island, is a dazzling example. It is virtually impossible to imagine using dried sage leaves for this preparation. As the smooth, uncooked puree of sage leaves and walnuts blends with the thickened pan juices, the flavors meld, forming a robust complement to the fork-tender meat.

The Maples own it—old Gramp, the bloodthirsty tall-story spinner; Jason, whose refuge from mediocrity is in the uniform of the Black Horse Vigilantes (it was the American Legion in the play, but the cinema is more careful about treading on toes), and Gabby, who reads Francois Villon—even though she can't pronounce the name—and hungers for art and beauty, preferably amid French surroundings.Into this charmed circle stumbles Alan Squier, member of the doomed ineffectual intellectuals, an idealist by birth, a defeatist by experience. On his heels come Duke Mantee and his outlaw band, seeking temporary refuge before burning their way to the border with the law at their heels. Under the menace of their guns the Black Mesa Bar B-Q grows autobiographical and lives are adjusted, somehow, to fit a happier pattern of existence.Well done, although it defies every canon of cinema law, is \\"The Petrified Forest.\\" Perhaps it was more effective on the stage; all we know is that it does well enough on the screen.

If a temporary cerebellumectomy could be performed as you gave your ticket to the field marshal at the door, \\"She Learned About Sailors\\" could be enjoyed without irritation and even with profit. The suggestion should not be misunderstood as a donning of the high hat in contemplating the new comedy. It simply happens that its humor is rooted so definitely in an unvarying pattern of elementary screen comedy that, unless the spectator is fortunate enough to be suffering from arrested development, his enjoyment cannot help decreasing from scene to scene.For example, the knockabout team of Mitchell and Durant, who wrecked some of our best stages before going to Hollywood, are present almost continuously in the picture. Having the interests of their audiences at heart, they will kill themselves with a little encouragement. They bite, kick, scratch, I punch and gouge each other with such a cheerful disregard for their personal safety that it is impossible not to be impressed and ungrateful not to be amused. But it happens that the law of diminishing returns cannot be suspended even for Mitchell and Durant. If a spectator could forget how much he laughed while the clowns were pummeling each other during the first thirty minutes of the film, he would be in the happy position of being able to enjoy them all over again in the last thirty minutes.Despite the orgiastic promise contained in the title, the salts are on their good behavior in \\"She Learned About Sailors.\\" The reasonably uproarious laughter which it aroused at the Roxy on Saturday night seemed to be couched mainly in the shrill treble of the children. As Lew Ayres explains to Alice Faye, people have got the gobs all wrong. A little innocent fun is all they want. Thus, after Mr. Ayres and Miss Faye, a cabaret singer in Shanghai, decide they are in love, Mr. Ayres nobly renounces their pact on the ground that a sailor's earnings are just large enough not to get along on. His pals, Mitchell and Durant, complicate the situation by destroying his letter of renunciation and substituting one of their own. But it is straightened out to everybody's satisfaction in San Francisco.While there is no desire in this corner to tamper with the course of the cinema's most popular emotion, it must regretfully be observed that Miss Faye, a promising Jean Harlow type with a sulphurous voice and personality, is not altogether happy in the rôle of the innocent maiden. As for young Mr. Ayres, his portrait of a hard-boiled swab seems a little boy-scoutish after James Cagney's in \\"Here Comes the Navy.\\" The humor contributed by Harry Green as the Argentine impresario is limited to his screen name, which is José Lopez Rubenstine. Among the film's better properties is a song, \\"Here's the Key to My Heart,\\" which Miss Faye renders pleasantly.The Stage Show.\\"The Big Bad Wolf\\" is also on the bill. The Roxy's stage show, a Fanchon and Marco unit with Wesley Eddy as master of ceremonies, presents Tommy Mack, with Frank Hurst and Eddie Young","excerpt":"Nord and Jeanne, Rosette and Luttman, Ade Du Val, Margot Claire, Frankie and Clem, Mildred Patterson and the Gas Foster Girls.

Is man meant to spend life with only one mate? Can a literate person satisfy his intellect through the exhilaration of outdoor physical labor? Clyde Rice tussles with these questions throughout \\"Nordi's Gift,\\" the sequel to his first volume of autobiography, \\"A Heaven in the Eye.\\" In this volume, the author, now 87 years old, recounts his experiences from 1934 to 1955, and his vivacious writing conveys the passion and immediacy of his younger years. Mr. Rice revels in jobs that demand muscle -- he chopped and sold cordwood, repaired ships, built a boat and fished for tuna, opened a lumber mill. The book's most enthralling passages are devoted to the author's family. His strong voice and remarkable memory combine to produce finely wrought portraits of his wife, Nordi, and her niece, Virginia, with whom Mr. Rice fell in love. Readers may wonder about and even condemn some of the author's decisions. He divorced Nordi to marry Virginia","excerpt":"Nordi later lived with the new couple. (If that sounds strange, imagine working on and off, as Mr. Rice did, for a stepmother who despises you and a father easily swayed by his spouse.) As a social history of the American Northwest (Mr. Rice is a native of Oregon), \\"Nordi's Gift\\" makes for engrossing reading -- with one caveat. Adept with an ax, Mr. Rice cuts trees more easily than he cuts through prose. Too many technical descriptions of logging and shipbuilding impede his story.

After watching him in the throes of clowning, we shudder at this alarming thought.For Mr. Wisdom, whose name becomes him about as fitly as a hula-hula skirt, would be honored to have the privilege of holding the third Ritz Brother's coat. To put him in a class with Lou Costello would be to flatter him recklessly. To mention his name with Red Skelton's would be to libel the latter.The forte of this sawed-off Cockney, who is almost as thick as he is tall, seems to be an incredible ability to act like an absolute dunce. He giggles, gawks, grimaces and dangles his hammy hands in the manner of an amiable moron, which is virtually what he is in this film. He's a slow-witted, butter-fingered stock clerk in a London department store who is fired and hired all through the picture by a pompous (and equally stupid) boss. And the characteristic of his clowning is manifested by such cheerful things as his gleefully throwing china or getting stuck in a revolving door.Perhaps his miserable showing in this picture is not all his fault. Perhaps the script writers and the director, John Paddy Carstairs, should take some blame. Certainly somebody made a bubu by having old Margaret Rutherford, that wonderful muffin-faced comedienne, appear but briefly in a shoplifter's role. But then, of course, had they let her get into it just a little more, she would have run circles round Mr. Wisdom and blithely dashed away with the film.As it is, she and Moira Lister, Lana Morris, Jerry Desmonde and Derek Bond are little more than tenpins for Mr. Wisdom to Knock around in a film which, by Hollywood standards, would not do credit to Poverty Row.Heaven help the British, if Mr. Wisdom is really their boy.

There are two prevailing styles of dwellings: halftimbered buildings and thatched roofs we also call Tudor, and solid atone for manors and chateaus. Even farms are sometimes surrounded by high stone walls, making them look like fortified villages. It rains a lot in Normandy, which is why a stay at a beach resort inevitably allows time for a visit to the colorful fishing ports, as well as to the many towns and villages with monuments spanning centuries of Norman history from William the Conqueror to the French Revolution. Just a listing of notable churches, abbeys, and castles would fill this page. The Normandy Channel Coast includes the ports of Cherbourg, Le Havre and Dieppe.

In the view of the conductor (and others of like mind), the music at the very heart of concert life needed to be cleansed of accumulated debris, lethargic tempi and bombastic manners.   The polemics, though, were noticeably absent when Mr. Norrington conducted the Orchestra of St. Luke's at Avery Fisher Hall on Friday night. The only sign of principle was in a parenthetical remark in the program notes that the all-Schumann program would be played with a Schumann-sized orchestra , and that strings would use very little vibrato -- an approach now shared by many orchestras. There were no radical revisions of tempo or interpretation, no arguments that Schumann's Cello Concerto and his Third Symphony have, until Friday, been distorted.
