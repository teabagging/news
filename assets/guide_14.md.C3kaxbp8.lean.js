Mayonnaise, the other essential ingredient, is used in well-seasoned mixtures, so the fat-free type, which leaves something to be desired in terms of flavor when used plain, will do just fine.

Among those it has won are a case for women with AIDS who had been denied disability benefits, and another for special-education students who had not been properly screened. Those days are over. Squeezed by Federal financing cuts and a new law that bars its lawyers from pursuing class-action suits, South Brooklyn Legal Services has lost half of its  staff through layoffs and attrition over the last year, and must farm out about  30 pending class-action cases to private lawyers and other organizations. Under the budget passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton in April, legal services agencies nationwide, which are financed with Federal, state and private contributions, are required to dispose of class-action suits by the end  of this month. Republican critics in Congress had asserted that Legal Services lawyers filed suits to advance their political agenda rather than serve the poor. Congress also cut Federal financing for the Legal Services Corporation, which distributes money to Legal Services of New York and more than 300 other agencies nationwide, by 30.5 percent, to $278 million from $400 million. Citywide, Legal Services agencies, which represent the poor in civil court, lost 20 percent of their staff members since last year, according to the Legal Services Staff Association. But South Brooklyn -- one of the city's largest with a staff of 50 last year --  has been among the hardest hit, in part because its lawyers have historically clocked dozens of hours each week on class-action suits against city, state and  Federal agencies. Fees generated from successful suits accounted for about 10 percent of its annual budget, the agency's director, Chip Gray, said. \\"It was a significant part of our work and now it's going to be gone,\\" he said.  \\"It doesn't keep us from representing individual clients. But in terms of protecting the rights of poor people as a group, we are somewhat less capable than we were in the past.\\" A Fordham University law professor, Matthew Dillard, said the bar on class-action suits had eviscerated the power of Legal Services to challenge government policies and hindered poor people's access to the courts. \\"If you can't have class action, lawyers have to work retail, rather than wholesale,\\" said Professor Dillard, a former staff lawyer for the Legal Aid Society of New York, which no longer receives Legal Services money. \\"The class action was one way of bringing legal services to people so they could be served  indirectly, if not directly.\\" The Federal cuts have rippled across the Legal Services system throughout the city. The Legal Services Corporation was forced to drop out of its 20-year-old case against the city charging racial quotas favoring the Hasidim in public housing in Williamsburg, according to its director, Martin Needelman. He said the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, which had been involved in the case, will take it over. Mr. Needelman said his agency also lost about 10 percent of its staff. Bronx Legal Services handed off more than a dozen class-action suits and lost 10 of its 60 staff members. In Manhattan, MFY Legal Services consolidated its five offices into three, according to its director, Wayne Hawley.

A6    U.S. Diplomacy in Germany  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice drew a promise from Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany to do more to help in Iraq and a warm endorsement of President Bush's call for democracy in Iran, after she rebuffed a European request to join negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.

A10    Setback for New Governor  In a setback for Gov. Christine O. Gregoire of Washington, the newly installed Democrat who faces a Republican challenge to her election, a judge said his courtroom, and not the Democrat-controlled state Legislature, was the proper forum for an inquiry into the election results.   A13    EDUCATION    Colleges Clamor for Students  With student populations on the nation's campuses expected to decline in the next decade, many public universities are recruiting out-of-state students in hopes they will keep enrollments rising and bring in extra money through higher tuition.

The company would build office buildings and housing at the 13-acre West Side railyards.

And old jokes is really what &quot;Blonde 2&quot; is all about. Reese Witherspoon returns as Elle Woods, the indefatigable sprig of a girl whose disposition is as sunshiny as her hair. Previously, she conquered Harvard Law School, a venue in need of a new world order, and in the nominal sequel, she takes on the moribund legislative branch in Washington. Elle is working as an aide to Representative Rudd (Sally Field), a fellow Delta Nu. Probably the funniest thing in the picture is seeing these Oscar-sized forces of nature: Ms. Witherspoon, the most determined actress of the 21st century, is posed pert nose-to-nose with Ms. Field, whose blurted &quot;You really like me&quot; sentiment disguised a will equally steely. But Charles Herman-Wurmfeld and the writer Kate Kondell don't make enough of this match-up. Instead, &quot;Blonde 2&quot; is repetitive rather than reiterative, going over the same material as the first. The snappy, happy Elle is ridiculed by Rudd's worldly and world-weary aides, especially the tough, crude Grace (Regina King). So, Elle has to wear them down, win them over, yet still find time to get married. The movie assumes not only that Elle did not learn anything from the first movie, but that its lessons of perseverance and open-mindedness were lost on audiences, too. — Elvis Mitchell There's Nothing Wrong in Washington That a Little Cream Rinse Can't Fix"},{"year":"1952","title":"CENSORSHIP DIES HARD","excerpt":"Legally Doubtful Agents Still Ban 'The Miracle'"},{"year":"1933","title":"Prohibition KING CANUTE ROLE NOT FOR VIRGINIA","excerpt":"Legally Dry State Is Unable to Sweep Back Surrounding Sea of Beer.

And why isn't the film called \\"Sex Crimes,\\" which is, after all, what it's about? Probably because most films about women don't know when to separate sex from love, or when to bring them together. If recent movies offer any clues to cultural standards, then that nagging good-girl/ bad-girl stereotype (bad girls are sexual, while good girls are not) is alive and thriving where you least expect it.   \\"Love Crimes\\" means to be a provocative sexual thriller with a large, honest dose of political incorrectness. An assistant district attorney, played lifelessly by Sean Young, goes undercover to catch a sex criminal who is masquerading as a famous photographer. The man, who benefits on screen from Patrick Bergin's handsome looks and charm, lures women into posing nude, then has sex with them when they feel they have lost their will to resist -- sometimes because he has frightened them, sometimes because he has flattered them.

An enormous fluorescent &#8220;42&#8221; soon appeared amid the cut&#8208;away walls of his kitchen (top, left) to commemorate his 42d birthday and 42d Street. Architect Hugh Hardy's environment (above) grew in the same way. In the altogether respectable living room, Alice Lyndon,, wife of the dean of architecture at MIT, and Hugh improvised a sculpture of stove pipes (designed by Alice with Hugh adding the lights). A billboard promoting VISTA was cut up to become a ceiling of onlooking graduates; the billboard's lettering (hung upside down) marches around the room. Frivolous as it may appear, such spontaneous design stems from a serious premise: There are new ways of approach ing, exposing and solving any problem., &#8220;It is an exercise that we give to students,&#8221; says Charles Moore. &#8220;Take a set thing; by the applica tion of paint and graphics, make something different out of it.
