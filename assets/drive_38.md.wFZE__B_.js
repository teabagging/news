when pressed by Ben-Veniste if there had been any thought that gap was caused not by accident but instead on purpose, Haig says there has been discussion of what he has referred to as 'Devil theories';

These mollusks -- culled from the shallow waters among the eelgrass and sandy floors of Long Island Sound and Great Peconic Bay, on to Gardiner's Bay and the northern shores of Montauk, all the way up the shoreline to Maine -- brought in harvests by the ton. But that was before pollution and red tides all too frequently wiped out entire crops. While many of these beds undergo a careful replenishing, Nantucket holds on to one of the few great scalloping waters on the Northeast coast.\\n\\nDuring the fall and winter lull, when summer residents and tourists have all but vacated the island, Nantucket returns to a simpler way of life. The few baymen that are left on the island take their flat-bottomed boats into the harbor and little bays around Coatue and spend the season stalking the scallop. The bayman's life may be as fragile as the ecosystem that supports him, but he is content only on water.

Review and article dates are in parentheses. Prices are current.  The Golden Unicorn     18 East Broadway at Catherine Street, (212) 941-0911 -- This glittering second-story Chinatown spot is part a la carte restaurant and part Oriental party palace. You enter a sparkling banquet hall of marble and chrome with chocolate-brown rugs, pink curtains, white tablecloths and potted plants.   The Golden Unicorn actually has two menus, an encyclopedic main document and a smaller one for house specialties. Best bets are from the latter. In general, stay away from fried foods, which tend to be heavy and greasy. Among the best dishes are sliced chicken that comes out sizzling with sweet onions, ginger and black pepper","excerpt":"scallops atop cubes of bean curd, cooked in a bamboo steamer and daubed with a thick, salty black-bean sauce; a shrimp, chicken and squid combination with a chili-laced hot sauce, and baked crabs in a mildly hot curry sauce dotted with peas.   Other fine options include cubes of flounder combined with good hefty prawns and crab meat in a lovely scallion-flecked shellfish sauce and salt-baked shrimp zapped with black pepper. Appetizers range from $2 to $7; main courses $8.50 to $25. Sunday dinner from 4 P.M. to midnight. (Review, Oct. 14, 1988.) Azzurro     1625 Second Avenue at 84th Street, (212) 517-7068 -- This minuscule, family-run place continues to turn out superior Sicilian-style pastas, salads and seafood. The dining room of Azzurro is a narrow rectangle with brick walls and a white tile floor. Overhead, a dusk-blue ceiling is sprayed with tiny inset lights.   The food is fresh and unpretentious. Starters include eggplant Sicilian style; baby artichokes with garlic and olive oil; fennel and orange salad, and warm fresh mozzarella with roasted peppers and prosciutto. Among the main courses are veal chop paillard with fresh tomatoes and set on a bed of arugula; bucatini pasta with fresh sardines, raisins, pine nuts and wild fennel; penne and eggplant with tomato sauce; grilled swordfish with greens and tomatoes, and annilleti ca carne capuliata -- ring-shape pasta with a meat-raisin-tomato sauce. Appetizers range from $7 to $8.50; entrees $12.50 to $15. Sunday dinner is from 4:30 to 10:30 P.M. (Article, Oct. 19, 1990.) Rosa Mexicano     1063 First Avenue at 58th Street, (212) 753-7407 -- One of the few authentic Mexican restaurants in town, Rosa Mexicano is largely the creation of Josephina Howard, the chef and co-owner, who is a diligent researcher of Mexican regional cooking. Her menu is relatively light, emphasizing grilled meats and fish as well as casseroles seasoned with mole sauces, various chili combinations and herbs. Most dishes are mildly spiced.   The front room, with a long, open kitchen, is the livelier and louder of the two dining areas. The back room, done in warm rose-colored stucco, is ringed by high-back pink banquettes and has dramatically illuminated tropical greenery in the center. You might want to start off with the house margarita, made with pomegranate, or the traditional version. : both catch up with you fast.   Rosa Mexicano has become justly renowned for its superior guacamole, which is prepared at tableside to your specification. Another favorite starter is taquitos de moronga, good grainy corn tortillas rolled around blood sausage, onions and fresh coriander. Also recommended are the taquitos de tinga poblana, tortillas filled with shredded pork, smoked jalapeno chilies, onions and tomato.    Entrees include marinated loin of pork baked in banana leaf with a mild citrus sauce; de-boned chicken leg marinated in a paste of chile and spices and steamed in parchment paper and served with homemade tortillas; and tamal en cazuela, a lusty casserole of corn meal with chicken and earthy dark mole sprinkled with melted fresh cheese. Appetizers range from $5.75 to $11; main courses $14.50 to $24. Sunday dinner, 5 P.M. to midnight. (Review, Jan. 5, 1990.) Chelsea Central     227 10th Avenue between 23d and 24th Streets, (212) 620-0230 -- While it is geographically in Chelsea, this inviting saloon-style restaurant is not likely to be discovered by neighborhood strollers unless they happen to be strolling to a muffler repair shop down by the Hudson River. The food is hardly saloon grub, though. The chef, Stephen Meyers, came here after stints at La Caravelle, Le Bernardin and Sign of the Dove.   Chelsea Central has a well-worn charm, with a long mahogany bar, stamped tin ceiling, tile floor, ceiling fans and cafe tables with bentwood chairs. Tulip sconces diffuse soft light on the brick walls. Somehow, the more refined food has prompted patrons to dress up, though you still see neighborhood regulars in pullovers and khakis. Starters on the current menu include butternut squash ravioli; salad of grilled wild mushrooms, arugula and endive with balsamic vinaigrette; backfin crab cakes with black-bean relish; and warm duck confit salad with chickory and lardons.   Other courses are seared peppered tuna with black olives and orzo colored with tomatoes and Swiss chard, or pan-roasted red snapper with a red-wine sauce and accompanied by Swiss chard; roast loin of pork with braised cabbage, confit of shallots and garlic mashed potatoes; and to top it all off, there are chocolate bread pudding with cinnamon creme anglaise or the pear crisp served with white chocolate ice cream. Appetizers range from $5 to $9; entrees, $14 to $21. Dinner on Sunday 4:30 to 10 P.M. (Review, Nov. 10, 1989.)

Webster, Director of the F.B.I., who said he didn't consider the firebombings of family-planning clinics to be acts of terrorism (news article, Dec. 5). There has been silence at the top of the Administration. President Reagan has not spoken out against terrorist acts perpetrated upon family-planning centers across the country.  The law of the land makes the choice of abortion legal and a private matter. Nevertheless, a fanatical fringe is using the tactic of terrorism to try to force family-planning clinics and women's-health centers out of business. The nation's top cop - the F.B.I. Director - says that firebombings of clinics across the country are not terrorist acts. Mr. Webster said: ''The objective is social. I don't believe it currently meets our definition.'' Thousands of people who visit clinics like ours may become fearful. At the same time, the staff of these centers and clinics live with fear that any day they or their clinic may be next on the ''hit list.'' Fortunately, no one has been injured or killed to date.

Fashion scouts who have just returned from the fall 1991 men's wear shows in Milan, Italy, report that scarfs are now rivaling ties as face-framers for men. Printed in slightly blown-up tie patterns like paisley figures or medallions, these lengths of silk are being shown tucked in the open neckline of a high-buttoned jacket, covering the shirt underneath.   It's a new way for designers to make such jackets seem a little less formal. Undoubtedly it will add a lot of dash to a man's appearance, provided he knows how to handle one with panache.   Women, of course, have long known that tossing a length of fabric loosely around the neck instantly illuminates the face and adds a flash of color. The important thing is not to be timid. Really go for it. Don't settle for a little itty-bitty piece of cloth that will barely fill in a neckline. The standard 36-inch scarf is pretty limited as well.   What really works is a 54-inch square. Fold it so it makes a triangle. Now fling that around you and see what twists and turns you can create. It's easy to put that much fabric under a coat. Just place the tip of the scarf's triangle in front, pointing down. Then drape the two ends around your neck and bring them forward. The scarf will fall in a flattering, but not bulky, cowl. Remember, the idea is to look dramatic, not to end up feeling hopelessly swaddled.
