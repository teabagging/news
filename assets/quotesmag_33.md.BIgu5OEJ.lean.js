Certainly she played it that way at her first performance, her September confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Alexander gave a flawless reading of her prepared statement, a script mingling heartwarming autobiography (\\"In 1945, a man I barely knew, my father, returned from the war\\") with unimpeachable idealism (\\"The arts are life-enhancing and bring joy\\"). She hit the Senators' softball questions out of the park. And what reviews! Claiborne Pell pronounced the nominee's address the most eloquent he had heard in 33 years, citing it as \\"another reason why more elocution and acting should be taught in schools.\\" The small crowd packed into the hearing room gave Alexander a standing ovation.   The committee unanimously endorsed her a few hours later.
