Senator Joseph R. McCarthy gave his name to the anti-Communist furor of the 1950's, but he bore little responsibility for most of the actual repression. He did not, as you state, lead the fight to keep out undesirable aliens. Nevada's powerful Democratic Senator Pat McCarran did.   But blaming individuals for the excesses of McCarthyism distorts reality. Most American politicians supported these measures. Only 10 senators voted to sustain President Harry S. Truman's veto of the 1950 Internal Security Act, which contained the immigration restrictions incorporated in the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act.    It was the misguided, but widely shared, conviction that the country's security required the restriction of individual rights that led to the excesses of the McCarthy era.   Such concerns still threaten our freedom. Since the Federal Government tends to invoke national security to justify incursions against individual rights, that the conference immigration bill allows the Secretary of State to bar aliens \\"under exceptional circumstances\\" is hardly reassuring.

McCord retired from CIA in '70 after 19 yrs of service; quotes Alch as saying that newly-designated CIA Dir J R Schlesinger 'could be subpoenaed (to testify at the trial) and would go along with it'; says that by time trial began in Jan he was 'completely convinced that White House was behind the idea and ploy...and that White House was turning ruthless, and would do whatever was pol expedient at any 1 particular point in time to accomplish its own ends'; says he refused to go along with plan, thus incurring anger of fellow conspirator E H Hunt Jr; Alch declares through associate that 'it would be inapproporiate to comment at this time because of atty-client relationship' with McCord; another atty involved in case confirms that there had been serious discussions among defendants and their attys about possibility of contending that men were particpating in CIA mission; says he got 'impression that (Com for Re-Election of Pres) certainly had no objection to that kind of a defense'; McCord notes, in his memorandum dated May 4, that there were 'indications as early as July that Com for the Re-Election of the Pres was claiming that Watergate operation was CIA operation'; quotes Hunt's wife, who reptdly handled money for Watergate defendants after their arrests, as saying that P L O'Brien, atty for re-election com, had 1st told her that break-in at Dem hq was CIA operation; quotes Hunt as saying on more than 1 occasion that Hunt had information in his possession that 'would be sufficient to impeach the Pres'; quotes Mrs Hunt as saying that her husband delivered bitter lr to K W Parkinson, Repub atty, in which Hunt threatened 'to blow the White House out of the water'; threat was apparently made because Hunt was not receiving enough money from re-election com in mos after his arrest according to other sources; Parkinson denies knowledge of plan to describe bugging as CIA operation; McCord says he became convinced that White House dismissed CIA Dir R Helms last fall 'in order to put its own man in control'; says another purpose was 'to lay the foundations for claiming that Watergate operation had been a CIA operation and that 'Helms had been fired for it'; D R Young Jr, former Natl Security Council member who helped supervise White House activities of Hunt and Liddy in mid-'71, talks with Asst US Atty Silbert on May 8; McCord provides no evidence for his allegations about White House's attempt to dominate CIA but suggests that some specific information about move was supplied to him by R C Mardian, Asst Atty Gen;

With McCoy Tyner's 15-piece big band, the leader's splashy, thick-chorded approach to the piano translates to lush orchestrations in which every register is densely populated: tuba sharing bass lines with the bass, congas meshing rhythms with the trap drums, and brasses (including French horn along with trombones and trumpets) trading melodic sections with saxophones and woodwinds. Harmonies become chorales that use unexpectedly rich chromatic chords, and a prominent flute or piccolo often twitters up above.    The arrangements add detail to the music, but never at the expense of its drive. In Tuesday's second set at the Five Spot (4 West 31st Street, Manhattan), uptempo compositions by Mr. Tyner bustled along, especially \\"Fly With the Wind,\\" in which a modal vamp and a quasi-African polyrhythm emerged from a rumble of percussion to spur ensembles and solos, then melted into a percussion coda as if to say that rhythm was the music's wellspring.

The large number of short-sellers who were betting against the aerospace company started bailing out, in some cases with big losses. But they jumped too quickly.   For the last few months, McDonnell Douglas's shares have been diving faster than an F-15, and they continued downward yesterday. They closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $39.125, down $1.625 on the day. The price has declined $20 a share in a month, and since last fall has lost more than half its market value.   The decline has been so sharp that McDonnell Douglas, which is based in St. Louis, is considering stepping in to start buying shares itself. Herbert J. Lanese, the company's chief financial officer, said in an interview yesterday that with the stock trading at 35 percent of its book value a share buyback would make sense. He declined to say how many shares the company might purchase or at what prices.   \\"We've got some cash,\\" Mr. Lanese said. \\"We're considering going into the market for some of our own shares.\\"   Mr. Lanese said the loss of investor confidence had been exaggerated by thin trading. Of McDonnell Douglas's 39 million shares, about half are owned by employee stock plans or McDonnell family trusts. As a result, only 18 million shares or so are available for active trading, and Mr. Lanese said any active buying or selling had an outsized effect on the price.   But to many investors, the problems extend well beyond liquidity. For starters there is the growing uncertainty over McDonnell Douglas's chances of cobbling together a deal, announced with great fanfare in November, to sell up to 40 percent of its commercial aircraft business for $2 billion to a nascent aerospace company in Taiwan.   There are also nagging concerns about the ability of the company to control cost overruns on its largest Pentagon contract, the C-17 transport plane, and head off mounting Congressional opposition to the program. If those problems are not enough, the company is being battered by the depressed worldwide market for jetliners, a result of the hard times being suffered by airlines.   Apparently disenchanted by McDonnell Douglas's continuing troubles, one of its largest institutional shareholders, the Magellan Fund, started selling big chunks of the stock in the middle of May, including a 500,000-share block on May 14, traders said. Seeing profit in the downward spiral, short-sellers have surged back in recent weeks. Mr. Lanese said short interest in the stock might now be as high as 3.5 million shares, up from 3.2 million on May 15 and just over 2 million as recently as February.   The eroding confidence among investors has also extended to their faith in John McDonnell, the chairman and chief executive.   \\"From the outside looking in, it looks like they haven't made enough of a change in the corporate culture and enough of a change in the way they make decisions to give people confidence in the company's prospects,\\" said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence in New York. \\"There's a management core there that's excellent, but they're also being burdened by what I would call a less decisive c.e.o. than is appropriate.\\"   The losses suffered by most airlines and the end of the cold war have made for a tumultuous time for all military contractors and aerospace companies. In McDonnell's case, much of the uncertainty centers on the proposed deal with Taiwan Aerospace, which appears to be collapsing. Without the $2 billion that deal would provide, McDonnell Douglas will be unable to afford to develop a planned jumbo jetliner, the MD-12. And without the MD-12, McDonnell Douglas will be unable to remain competitive with its rivals in commercial aircraft, the Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie, the European consortium.   The question now is whether McDonnell Douglas's share price is bottoming out, creating a buying opportunity.   \\"Not yet,\\" said Lawrence M. Harris, an analyst at Kemper Securities in Chicago. \\"It's possible there could continue to be some slippage from these levels, not because of changed fundamentals but simply because of investor psychology.\\"   Mr. Rubel of C. J. Lawrence put it in even blunter terms: \\"Their performance hasn't given me the confidence to stick my neck out to get people to buy the stock.\\" Market Place","excerpt":"McDonnell Stock: Delayed Descent"},{"year":"1970","title":"attys and accountants for both sides continue to work out projections to determine potential earnings of drivers and owners under new fare schedule they hope will be enacted by City Council","excerpt":"McDonnell stresses there is still no agreement; Lindsay calls situation 'sensitive,' declines further comment Both Sides Continuing Efforts To Work Out Taxi Agreement"},{"year":"1959","title":"Many of Wall Street's brokerage and investment banking concerns will start business today under new partnership and corporate agreements involving top personnel additions, promotions and departures.

But jazz musicians -- well, let's check the record books. Yes, it looks as if Bobby McFerrin is definitely the first circular-breathing jazz singer to conduct the Beethoven Seventh Symphony.    At a glance, Mr. McFerrin's performance with the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra at the Garden State Arts Center here tonight must have struck some as a gimmicky idea for a pops concert. Billed as his New York-area conducting debut, the program included a group of short popular classics and some of Mr. McFerrin's own vocal improvisations, along with the Beethoven. Review/Music","excerpt":"McFerrin Conducts"},{"year":"1992","title":"When the first recordings of Bobby McFerrin were released, in the mid-1980's, listeners were amazed by his flexibility, range and inventiveness. Singing unaccompanied, he used circular breathing techniques and vocal acrobatics to fill the musical space around his melodies, giving the impression that he was a human music box, both singer and band in a single organism. When he sang \\"I Am My Own Walkman,\\" who could argue?   He did not sing that song at Carnegie Hall on Thursday night, when he joined forces with the keyboardist Lyle Mays and the drummer Jack DeJohnette. But its message -- that instead of listening to music, one should make it -- was the point of the show, which was part of the JVC Jazz Festival. Throughout the 90-minute set, he wove individual listeners' responses to his antics into the rhythms of his improvisations, or exhorted the audience at large to repeat short melodic phrases.
