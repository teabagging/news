This 1987 painting-sculpture is very much a Pfaff work: exuberant, even antic, multicolored, turning the history of art on its ear in an upbeat, good-natured way.    It has been given the place that was previously occupied by a painting-sculpture by Frank Stella that was similar to the Pfaff in its operatic exuberance and in the way it seemed to burst from the wall. Mr. Stella is one of the Museum of Modern Art's heroes. Substituting the Pfaff for the Stella is a direct challenge to the museum's view of art history. It asks the public to concentrate a little bit less on the stars of that history and a little bit more on the ideas, styles and sensibilities that are shared by numerous artists at any given moment.

''Our concern,'' the commissioner said in explaining the new N.F.L. program yesterday, ''is the health and welfare of the players - those taking drugs and those injured by those taking drugs.''   Until now, ''those injured by those taking drugs'' had never been mentioned publicly by the N.F.L. or any other sport in the argument for drug testing. Ever since the frenzy of some players was stirred by amphetamines more than a decade ago, some players justified taking amphetamines in order to cope with an opponent who did, particularly in a matchup between an offensive lineman and a defensive lineman.

That was why he was supportive when Jordan Ross came forward in 1968 with a grandiose plan for International Digisonics and its black boxes in every market, monitoring local stations for their encoded commercials and automatically reporting to a centralized computer. Digisonics failed, though, because the codes, intended to be visual but off the viewing area of a television screen, were showing up on the screen and annoying viewers. The Federal Communications Commission turned the plan down, Mr. Engelke recalls.

They are hoping to achieve greater success this time by inserting the tissue into the part of the brain known as the putamen, instead of into the caudex nucleus.    Although neither of the earlier patients showed any marked improvement after the transplants, Dr. Lars Olson of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm said in an interview that experiments with monkeys had raised hopes that the new technique would meet with greater success.   The purpose of the transplants is to insert tissue that produces dopamine into the brain. The absence of dopamine is believed to cause Parkinson's disease, an affliction that affects muscular control, chiefly in the elderly. The adrenal glands, adjacent to the kidney, can synthesize dopamine.
