At the age of 43, Clemens led the majors with a 1.87 earned run average and would have won far more than 13 games had he received more run support. Aside from Mariano Rivera, there is not a more dominant closer than Brad Lidge, who had 41 saves this season and posted a stunning 13.18 strikeouts per nine innings.    BRAVES  The Braves were missing three-fifths of their starting rotation at various points this season, but pitching Coach Leo Mazzone pieced together a staff that helped deliver the Braves' 14th consecutive division title. Jorge Sosa, acquired from Tampa Bay at the end of spring training, helped offset the loss of Mike Hampton by going 13-3 with a 2.55 earned run average. The Braves' ace, John Smoltz, missed his final start last Wednesday with a sore shoulder.    HITTING    ASTROS  The Astros' offense stagnated early. It could not recover from the departure of Jeff Kent and the absence of Lance Berkman due to off-season knee injury. But Morgan Ensberg emerged as the team's best clutch hitter, slugging 36 homers and knocking in 100 runs, and Berkman made up for lost time by hitting 24 homers and driving in 82 after he returned.    BRAVES  Andruw Jones finally emerged as the dynamic middle-of-the-order threat that he was expected to become. Jones led the major leagues in home runs (51) and the National League in runs batted in (128) and benefited from increased production from the leadoff hitter Rafael Furcal and the No. 2 hitter Marcus Giles. Furcal scored 100 runs for the third consecutive season, and Giles's 45 doubles ranked fourth in the majors.    FIELDING    ASTROS  The Astros' defense is strong at every position, but most notably at catcher, where two-time Gold Glove winner Brad Ausmus has committed one error in 133 games. In the outfield, Lance Berkman and Jason Lane anchor the corner spots, and the speedy Willy Taveras patrols center field. Taveras has done an excellent job offsetting the loss of Carlos Beltran to the Mets.    BRAVES  One year after committing 116 errors, the Braves made only 86, the fewest in the National League. Shortstop Rafael Furcal, blessed with the best infield arm in the major leagues, has cut down on his mistakes, and Atlanta's outfield defense improved dramatically as soon as Jeff Francoeur was promoted. He had 13 assists in only 66 games. Center fielder Andruw Jones, a near lock for his eighth consecutive Gold Glove award, had 11 assists.    X-FACTOR    ASTROS  The Astros proved they can overcome some difficult circumstances. They began the season with a 15-30 record but held off Philadelphia to win the wild card for the second consecutive year, thus becoming the first team since the 1914 Boston Braves to reach the playoffs after falling 15 games below .500. So even if the Astros quickly fall behind Atlanta in this series, they shouldn't be discounted.    BRAVES  At some point, the Baby Braves are going to have to start playing like the rookies they are. Right? Manager Bobby Cox is comfortable in what he can expect from the Joneses, Chipper and Andruw, but if his ultratalented bunch of rookies, led by hometown favorite Jeff Francoeur, can continue to contribute, the Braves may get past the first round for the first time since 2001. Spotlight | Baseball Playoffs","excerpt":"NATIONAL LEAGUE SCOUTING REPORT -- Houston vs. Atlanta"},{"year":"2005","title":"PITCHING    PADRES  The Padres have only two pitchers, Jake Peavy and Adam Eaton, who have won 10 or more games this season. Peavy is a legitimate ace, and Eaton, who has battled injuries all season, is finally showing signs of being healthy. The back of the rotation has been inconsistent and the Padres have been forced to rely on Texas castoffs Pedro Astacio and Chan Ho Park.    CARDINALS  The Cardinals posted a major league-best 3.49 earned run average, buoyed by the dominance of Chris Carpenter and a solid bullpen. Although Carpenter stands a strong chance of winning the National League Cy Young award, he did not win in his final four starts, allowing 22 runs in 21 and one third innings. He must return to his midseason form to increase the Cardinals' chances of advancing. The lefty Mark Mulder (16-8, 3.64 earned run average) is a formidable No. 2 starter.    HITTING    PADRES  The Padres do not have an explosive offense, and the spacious dimensions of their home stadium, Petco Park, have not helped matters much. They ranked 27th in the majors in runs scored, 28th in total bases and 25th in home runs and batting average. Ryan Klesko's team-leading 18 homers were less than half as many as the leaders on the other three National League playoff teams.    CARDINALS  There are no weak links in the Cardinals' lineup. DavidEckstein is among the league leaders in on-base percentage for leadoff hitters (.364), and then, of course, there is the middle of the order. Albert Pujols had another tremendous season (41 homers, 117 R.B.I. and a .330 average), and Jim Edmonds was not far behind with his 29 homers and 89 R.B.I.    FIELDING    PADRES  Shortstop Khalil Greene and second baseman Mark Loretta do not have exceptional range, but they still form one of the league's more formidable double-play combinations and anchor a defensively strong infield. The Padres suffer in the corner outfield positions, where a lack of foot speed from Ryan Klesko and Brian Giles sometimes proves problematic.    CARDINALS  The Cardinals no longer have the services of Gold Glove winners Scott Rolen (injury), Edgar Renteria (Boston) and Mike Matheny (San Francisco), but they still boast baseball's best defensive center fielder, Jim Edmonds, who makes difficult catches look effortless. When healthy, right fielder Larry Walker has one of the strongest and most accurate arms around.    X-FACTOR    PADRES  If the starters can provide seven quality innings and leave with a lead, the Padres' chances of winning increase almost exponentially. Relievers Scott Linebrink and Rudy Seanez are a combined 15-2 and boast earned run averages below 2.70. And closer Trevor Hoffman is close to a sure thing. He has converted 42 of 45 save opportunities.    CARDINALS  The Cardinals put together a huge early lead in the N.L. Central and cruised the rest of the way, still ending up with the best record in baseball. It will be interesting to see how the Cardinals respond when playing their first meaningful games in a long time. Manager Tony La Russa, a postseason veteran, is an adept motivator and should not have much trouble inspiring his players.
