DMX stars as the drug dealer King David, who pops up in the streets again after a long absence. Rolling into the frame in a player's classic — a late 70's Stutz Blackhawk — King David shrugs his way back into the hard-knock life. He quickly reaps what he sows and, mortally wounded, passes all his worldly goods to Paul (David Arquette), a scrambling white would-be writer. King David's estate includes an audio journal of his life, which provides flashbacks and a narrative-within-a-narrative that answers the shaken Paul's curiosity. It's the highlights of King David's high life that propel &quot;Alone.&quot; Like all of Goines's heroes, King David is a scourge on the periphery, and the movie dramatizes his corrosive effect on the margins with savvy muscularity. Every life he touches he leaves in ruins — a need to deface beauty as a result of self-loathing is implicit, and DMX signals that motivation with sly hostility. To say that King David is the best part he's ever had is an understatement; he has never felt the need to inhabit a movie in this way before. — Elvis Mitchell Dying Without Remorse, A Bad Guy Who's Lonely"},{"year":"1949","title":"Landon, M: Never Dies the Dream India Severn","excerpt":"NEVER DIES THE DREAM.

You often hear of top executives getting them -- windfalls that would pay off the mortgages in entire neighborhoods, with enough left for a few centuries' worth of groceries. But at Chemical Bank, some goodies trickled down to humbler workers last week, too; when the stock topped $50 for three days running, a share plan announced a year ago kicked in. The numbers had considerably fewer decimal places than those in executive pay packages -- a profit of $1,481 (before taxes) -- but it did spark interest. \\"It was amazing how suddenly the whole organization began paying attention to the stock price,\\" said Chemical's chairman, Walter Shipley, who at yearend owned 551,950 shares and has options to buy 530,000 more.  TOBACCO  Yes, It's a Drug. Now What?     The F.D.A. has this tricky problem. It has decided that nicotine is an addictive drug, and one that's clearly dangerous; plug those facts into a legal computer and you'd have to ban cigarettes. It can't do that, of course -- smokers would probably burn Washington to the ground (or bury it in ashes). So last week the agency sent some more modest ideas to the White House (given the explosiveness of this issue, it passed the buck). These included banning vending-machine sales, clamping down on sales to minors, and barring \\"Joe Camel\\"-type ads (which seem to have nearly vanished anyway). Even such modest measures face a rough ride, though. Tobacco is \\"a legal commodity\\" and should be treated as such, said one tobacco-state lawmaker, while another was \\"distressed\\" and \\"annoyed.\\" . . . Also last week, a glimpse into tobacco history: In 1950, an epidemiologist named Morton Levin wrote one of the first papers to show that smoking causes lung cancer, and campaigned against smoking throughout his career. Dr. Levin just died at 91.  SPENDING IT  Down and Out at Genentech    It's hard to get by on nearly $1 million a year. So to make ends meet -- and considerable ends they must be -- G. Kirk Raab kept borrowing from Genentech, where he happened to be chief executive. Finally, Mr. Raab sought a $2 million personal-loan guarantee from Roche Holdings of Switzerland, even as he was negotiating the sale of his company to Roche -- a deal, by the way, that shareholders say shortchanged them. This was too much for the board, which sent Mr. Raab packing last week. That ended a stormy tenure at this fast-growing company, one marked by strong criticism of its sales practices. A top Genentech sales executive, in fact, is about to go on trial on charges of paying kickbacks to a pediatrician to prescribe Genentech's growth hormone.  INVESTIGATIONS  Blowing a Golden Whistle    It is not, generally, a great idea to bite the hand that feeds you -- especially if that hand belongs to a powerful company like Archer-Daniels-Midland. That company has fed Mark Whitacre very nicely, in fact: as head of the BioProducts division, he is a rising company star. But it's unclear whether that star will keep rising. For last week it turned out that Mr. Whitacre, working with the F.B.I., secretly taped executives' conversations as part of an inquiry into possible price-fixing. Though whistleblowers have popped up in all sorts of places to denounce corporate naughtiness, it's highly unusual for such a high executive to play that role.  TRADE  No Favors From China    Yes, we can talk tough with China all we want -- on human rights, on Taiwan's status. But highmindedness, no matter how virtuous, might also have its costs, for China's sheer bulk gives it indisputable power. Last week, after saying that no decision was due for months, China snubbed Ford and Chrysler to give Mercedes a $1 billion contract to build mini-vans and engines in China, even though Mercedes has never actually built a true passenger mini-van -- you know, with all the cup-holders. Chinese officials denied that rising tensions with Washington had anything to do with the decision, but Detroit has to be wondering. DIPLOMACY  The Next Step in Vietnam    The building of a diplomatic bridge to Vietnam raised emotional issues -- some people saying the move was overdue, others insisting it wouldn't be time till all the missing were accounted for. But put those issues aside for a moment: a big step in healing the wounds will come when goods can flow freely between the nations. And despite last week's opening, that can't happen quite yet. Still needed are a trade agreement and preferred trading status, and even then American companies must struggle to catch up with Asia and Europe to do business in a country with 73 million people, more than France or Britain.  AUTOS  Japan Meets One Trade Goal    Remember that hoopla-laden trade agreement with Japan last month, the one that made the world safe for Lexus owners? No numbers. No specific targets. Just words. But most people have probably forgotten that when George Bush went to Tokyo three years ago, Japan's auto industry set a target of buying $19 billion worth of American parts in the year that ended this past March, twice the previous level. And guess what: Japan did so, and more. Figures out last week showed $19.86 billion in purchases. There's a footnote, though: that figure is total purchases, not imports. Most parts were for Japanese plants here. Japan had set a goal of $4 billion in imported parts, but fell short with just $3.23 billion.  CONSOLIDATION  One Bank, Indivisible    Something strange is going on. One advantage of a national Government -- politics, if possible, aside -- would seem to be the economies of scale it offers in running things. But everyone's been slamming the centralized bureaucracy as a failure. Banking, though, is heading full-blast in the opposite direction. Repeatedly citing \\"economies of scale,\\" the nation's banks are tripping over themselves in a rush to merge into behemoths. A few weeks ago, First Union said it would buy First Fidelity of Newark. Then last week PNC agreed to buy Midlantic, and First Chicago and NBD agreed to merge into a Midwest powerhouse. The value of the deals: $5.4 billion, $3 billion and $5.3 billion. But there was no truth to rumors that Citibank was buying the Federal Reserve.

Well, Peter Shaffer, for one. His play ''Amadeus,'' now transmuted into a Milos Forman film with a screenplay by Mr. Shaffer, shows that he continues to care deeply. Over the years, invoking a dramatist's license, he has taken ever more fanciful liberties with musical history to indict poor Antonio Salieri, the rival composer who in his last years supposedly confessed to poisoning Mozart. (He just possibly may have done so, though no hard evidence exists to support the idea.)   By brilliantly intertwining fact and fantasy, Mr. Shaffer has given the Salieri legend a second-stage boost that is likely to keep it in orbit for this generation, just as Pushkin's poem and Rimsky-Korsakoff's opera on the same subject did in the 19th century. Perhaps it is up to the psychiatrists to tell us why we are so eager to believe that Salieri, the common man personified, is a black villain.

In Vermont, Dr. Mills championed the liberal alternative, statewide portfolio assessment -- a collection of students' class work, including writing and research projects. But Dr. Mills has spent most of his career atop state bureaucracies (he's never taught public school, nor been a principal or superintendent) and you don't survive in that political realm without lightning flexibility. In 1995, when he was hired as New York's education commissioner, the Board of Regents and the new Republican governor wanted an aggressive test program, and overnight, Dr. Portfolio became the Scorekeeper.    The Scorekeeper introduced record numbers of state tests: five new Regents tests that everyone will soon have to pass to get a high school diploma, as well as assessment tests for elementary and middle school kids.

It is, of course, a malancholy photoplay which should appeal to the patriotism of every American heart, a story which has taught and will continue to teach a lesson","excerpt":"nevertheless in the film version there does not seem to be sufficient reason for the headstrong young Nolan to be so swayed by Aaron Burr. To damn his own country in the face of his mother's plea was something one is not apt to forget in looking at the film. But Nolan is always shown to be an object of sympathy on the different warships on which he sailed, a prisoner who was not to hear the name of the United States. He is courageous when confronted with danger, eager to help the officers and men on the vessels. But a whisper comes to one asking why he was not a little loss impulsive, little more thoughtful, when that moment arose when he received the opportunity to stick to the land and the clan that bore him.Perhaps it will inspire many to give an extra thought to patriotism even now, old a story as it is. There are some stirring sequences, and it makes one think how foolish was this young man who cursed his native heath! His mother's love lasted to her dismal end, and Ann Bissell, his old sweetheart, went to President after President to seek his pardon. Did he deserve the pardon? Was he fully contrite? It was only answered in a half-hearted way in this production.From the pictorial viewpoint there are a number of good sequences, especially that in which an American warship engages a piratical vessel. There is the struggle aboard, and the hard-faced sea robbers endeavoring to get away. Topmasts and sails crumple and fall to the decks as the shots pass through. There are sharpshooters in the crow's nest and out on the rigging. Men are seen apparently struck by bullets falling far below into the sea, and down under the decks on the pirate vessel is what the captain terms his \\"black cargo of gold-slaves.\\" They are chained and cringing, fearful of the roar of the guns, of the scampering of feet on the deck above—hoping for release.It is an effective scene where Nolan boards the first vessel, instructions being sent that he must not hear or sec of the United States. Nolan is quite well played by Edward Hearn. He hears the order that he is to be treated according to his rank of officer and a man, and Peter is told to officiate as a servant to the young renegade. Harvey Clark as Peter gets some fair comedy out of his rôle. His facial make-up at all times is excellent, but Peter is apparently hopelessly ignorant of naval discipline. All captains look alike to him, and he has seldom the thought of saluting. He nudges these officers or taps them on the back when they are mounting a gangplank. He is an interesting spectacle always, with his patent-leather hat, his bell-bottomed trousers and his short jacket.There is also a storm sequence in this picture in which Nolan volunteers to help to tie up one of the loose, heavy guns. The water is seen beating over the decks, the vessel rolling and the gun sliding back and forth, men keeling over as they are caught in its path. The miniature of this vessel—as is usual in such shots—is quite blurred and ineffective. It is the camera work during the pictured storm aboard the vessel that counts, as it does also in the scenes where the warship attacks the pirate ship.Pauline Starke plays Ann—the faithful Anne! As a young belle she is sweet and sympathetic, but she does not appear sufficiently changed in some of the chapters. She does splendidly as the aged woman who finally prevails upon President Lincoln (George Billings, who played the part in \\"The Dramatic Life of Abraham Lincoln\\") to pardon Nolan. Here is a really effective touch showing the sympathetic streak in the martyred President. He does not haggle, but promptly signs the pardon and then kisses the old woman who had requested it.There are several startlingly abrupt jumps in this picture, in which one is not made aware of the passing of years, and the visions of the old mother, the sweetheart and Nolan come upon one so suddenly that it seems as if Nolan were back in his own home. These are pictured in too distant a fashion instead of being double exposures. While we think of it, we wonder that Rowland V. Lee, who directed this production, in the first chapters aboard the old Essex has all the officers with white trousers, even on a stormy night. However, this is a worthy film, and one which will interest the many thousands who have read Edward Everett Hale's unforgetable story.

Books of The Times"},{"year":"2003","title":"THE STORIES OF ALICE ADAMS. (Washington Square, $17.95.) The 53 elegantly turned tales in this collection, published over the four decades before the author's death in 1999, focus on characters who give themselves over to a kind of emotional drift or who struggle against their passionate natures. Adams's third-person narration, which explores the infinitely variable avenues of loss, allows her ''to exercise to the maximum her impressive powers of observation and insight, as well as her equally impressive ability to summarize motivation,'' Angeline Goreau said here last year. ''It is this voice . . . that gives the stories their feeling of authenticity.''    THE AGE OF SACRED TERROR: Radical Islam's War Against America, by Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon. (Random House, $15.95.) The authors, both senior counterterrorism officials for the National Security Council during the Clinton administration, describe how the White House tried to take action against Al Qaeda before Sept. 11 but was largely thwarted by the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the military, which were standoffish, sluggish and uncooperative with one another. Last year in these pages, Evan Thomas found this ''a surprisingly lively -- and disturbing -- tale of bureaucratic vexation.'' Militant Islam Reaches America, by Daniel Pipes (Norton, $15.95), examines the rise of ''Islamism,'' which the author calls a virulent 20th-century totalitarian ideology, and argues that moderate Muslims are complicit in its success, and that the United States has dangerously failed to identify and target Islamism on its own shores. His account is ''blunt and passionate,'' if ''occasionally inconsistent,'' Judith Miller wrote in the Book Review in 2002.    CHARLES DARWIN. The Power of Place: Volume 2 of a Biography, by Janet Browne. (Princeton University, $22.95.) The concluding volume of the author's account of Darwin's life and times focuses on his popular success after the publication of ''The Origin of Species,'' which paradoxically made him a celebrity in Britain even as the scientific community rejected his core ideas about natural selection. The result is ''a consuming portrait not only of Darwin but of Victorian civilization,'' John Tooby said in these pages last year. ''This biography is matchless in detail and compass, and one feels an abiding gratitude that Browne was willing to sacrifice so many years of her life to reconstruct Darwin's.''    THE GOOD REMAINS, by Nani Power. (Grove, $13.) This fictional elegy for the town of Ashland, Va., follows a highly talkative cast of locals -- chief among them a flirtatious baby doctor from an old Southern family -- as they prepare for the Christmas holiday. ''Every one of Power's dozen or so characters brims with life and goofiness and -- not unrelated to goofiness -- human frailty,'' Claire Dederer wrote here in 2002. ''Power's writing gives off the unmistakable whiff of the truth.''    SEEK MY FACE, by John Updike. (Ballantine, $13.95.) Fusing fiction with art criticism (a longtime interest of Updike's), this novel tells how in the decade or so after the end of World War II, American artists, led by Jackson Pollock -- who appears here as the action painter Zack McCoy -- made New York the mecca of the art world. The result is a ''fascinating'' but uneven hybrid, John Banville said here last year. Updike ''may not succeed in finding the face he seeks","excerpt":"nevertheless the search throws up other discoveries, other recognitions, other illuminating revelations.''    IN RUINS: A Journey Through History, Art, and Literature, by Christopher Woodward. (Vintage, $14.) On this eclectic tour of European landscapes, a historian reflects on the spooky but cathartic gratification to be had from contemplating the ruins of grandiose ambitions, from the Roman Colosseum to the plains of Troy. ''Woodward's prose is nimble,'' David Quammen wrote in these pages in 2002, and he is ''especially knowledgeable about visual artists, both famous and obscure, who have documented or darkly imagined ruination.''    FIREWALL, by Henning Mankell. (Vintage Crime, $13.) Kurt Wallander, the memorably gloomy detective in Mankell's absorbing series of Swedish police procedurals, uncovers a global conspiracy linked to two seemingly unrelated cases: the senseless murder of a taxicab driver by two teenage girls, and the baffling death of a man at an A.T.M.

Well, one starts with some perfectly magnificent photography by Jack Couffer.This camera work is so stunning that it immediately establishes a sensitive texture for a simply story of a roaming nonconformist with wings and a human voice. Intelligently and tastefully, the director-producer, Hall Bartlett, and the author, Richard Baoh, have integrated the bird's musings with arresting passages of silence and a surprisingly effective score sung by Neil Diamond, who composed it with Lee Holdridge.To one viewer, who loved the first half, the only catch is the final footage, when our feathered hero comes home to convert his old flock with some gummy platitudes. This portion is a bit pat and even synthetic, for all the clever photographic simulations of massed bird chatter and anger. This aspect of the movie, its technical manipulation, is at times remarkable.The picture also runs far too long.

To his apartment came ladies who should have known better and others who just wanted to save their sisters from his fell clutches. And he even had an expensive cocktail shaker and a Japanese servant all ready for their visitations.The plot revolves around the secretary of a noted divorce lawyer, her sister and his newest client. The client owns the mustache and the apartment. The sister visits him. Then the secretary (who is going to marry the lawyer, by the way) pays a call to beg him to give up the sister. Then the sister marries, and the situations go all over again with reverse English; for she (the newlywed) visits him (with the mustache), begging that he (ibid.) give her (the secretary) up for ever and ever.

WHAT exactly were those eight Americans after when their airplane crashed in a fog off the coast of Antarctica on the last day of 1985? What could move eight men to spend roughly $1,000 each for 48 hours of dampness amid sea lions and penguins?   The answer dominates Roland Huntford's ''Shackleton,'' a vivid, thorough and rewarding biography of the relentless British adventurer Sir Ernest Shackleton (1874-1922). The answer is that bizarre but weighty word ''Antarctica.'' The breathless quest for the white desert ended horribly for those eight and their two crewmen, and in the end no less sadly for Shackleton, who died after two massive heart attacks at the age of 47 while sailing south on his fourth expedition for glory and fortune","excerpt":"nevertheless, the ice continent compelled them absolutely and against reason. If this quest suggests a boy's vision of the world, it is, and the commonplaces of life - debts, family, politics, heartbreak - cannot stop genuinely spectacular boys like Shackleton from pursuing a fantastic destiny at the bottom of the world.

From the rounded blue and white canopy marking the entrance to the cozy, pinlighted bar to the deep French-blue dining room with glittering crystal chandelier and wall sconces, gilt moldings framing seascapes, ficus trees in illuminated corners and tables felicitously appointed, the decor suggests serious aspirations. And the food - presented beautifully, prepared carefully and unerringly fresh - most often rises to the occasion. \\n\\n The name of the restaurant is somewhat deceptive. Some fish and shellfish items appear on the menu, a tank displays lively lobsters and specials of the day usually feature fish","excerpt":"nevertheless, the menu is clearly ''Continental'' and many entries found jejune. But any similarity to routine cuisine stops there, for Ron Treppeda, the chef, inventive without being outre, interprets French and American (rather than Italian) dishes with a lightness influenced by the nouvelle cuisine. Skillful shopping by Nick Michalatos, the owner, completes the successful picture.

The half-hour flight on the evening of April 8 officially launched daily commercial air service between the former enemies.         Travelers accustomed to the long waits and other vexations of crossing between Israel and Jordan by bus or taxi at one of three land crossing points are certain to welcome the air service. The flights are priced competitively with land travel -- $83 one way on both El Al and Royal Jordanian, with round-trip air packages starting at $140, and at $120 for a stay in either capital of more than three nights -- and far less time-consuming. Moreover, they offer a spectacular aerial view of the holy land over which Jordanians and Israelis have fought since Israel's creation in 1948. What took the old caravan  travelers more than a week to cross now takes half an hour, a shorter and cheaper flight than the New York-Washington shuttle.

Not-so-subtle hints like these are a good indication that your character needs some improving. The enclosed Personality Worksheet will help you identify areas you'll want to concentrate on in the coming months.    Irritability. Do you nag your spouse? (7 points.) Bark at your co-workers? (4 points.)    Substance abuse. Do you smoke? (10 points.) Drink? (10 points.) Eat saturated fat? (10 points.)    Sloth.

Are you: a) watching TV (3 points), b) flipping through magazines (5 points), c) staring at the ceiling (10 points)?    Procrastination. Did you file your taxes at midnight on April 15?

In the last few months, there has been a dramatic surge in property damage claims by local and state governments that have found asbestos in their schools and office buidings.    Asbestos was widely used from the 1930's until the late 1970's as a fire retardant, pipe-wrapping and insulation material. As long as it stays in place, the asbestos does no harm. But when it begins to crumble, it releases fibers that lodge in the lungs of those who inhale them. Since the diseases caused by these fibers can take decades to manifest themselves, exposure is especially dangerous for young children, who have many years ahead for the asbestos to work its harm.
