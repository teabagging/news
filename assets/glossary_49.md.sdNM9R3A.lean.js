(Da Capo, $17.95.) In the first full-length biography of the sweet-natured creator of more than 70 children's books, the author (a scholar and lifelong Oz fan) portrays Baum (1856-1919) as an ironist whose 14 Oz books stress the homely American virtues of self-reliance and practicality, as well as tolerance, egalitarianism and a deep mistrust of leaders. Last year in the Book Review, Brooke Allen found this ''a strong and sympathetic portrait.''    EVA'S COUSIN, by Sibylle Knauss. (Ballantine, $13.95.)

(Grove, $15.) This follow-up to ''Barrow's Boys'' (2000), Fleming's account of the British Admiralty's search for the Northwest Passage from 1816 to 1845, tells of the race to reach the North Pole between the 1850's and 1926, an obsession that attracted many explorers and plenty of controversy. Fleming ''has great narrative gifts, and his brief character sketches draw readers in while pithy summaries of each expedition carry us on breathlessly from one ice hummock to the next,'' Jonathan Dore said here last year.    ZORA NEALE HURSTON: A Life in Letters. Edited by Carla Kaplan. (Anchor, $19.95.) The prolific Hurston -- she wrote novels, stories, folk tales, plays and essays -- may be most often associated with the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920's, but she was a highly inventive quick-change artist, this sampling of nearly 500 letters suggests. Though ''they tell us something of how she viewed the outside world and clarify some of her thinking about art and politics,'' Hurston ''emerges . . . more of an enigma than ever,'' Ann duCille wrote here earlier this year.    DISTURBANCE OF THE INNER EAR, by Joyce Hackett. (Carroll & Graf, $14.) This first novel's narrator, a brilliant but artistically blocked cellist, is stirred back to life when she encounters an exquisite 16th-century cello that, like her, has a history deeply linked to the Holocaust. The result is a ''singular and sometimes haunting'' tale, Jennifer Marie Reese wrote here last year.    FROM THE LAND OF GREEN GHOSTS: A Burmese Odyssey, by Pascal Khoo Thwe. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) The author, now in his 30's and living in London, recounts his improbable escape from Myanmar, an intensely beautiful land virtually sealed off from the outside world since the 1960's by a repressive, corrupt military. Last year our reviewer, Barbara Crossette, called this a ''powerful portrait of a suffering nation'' by a ''writer of uncommon elegance and sensitivity.''    RUMPOLE RESTS HIS CASE, by John Mortimer. (Penguin, $13.) Horace Rumpole, the curmudgeonly London barrister and hero of 12 other collections of stories, is pushing 70 by now, but despite his gout, chain-smoking and penchant for bad wine, he finds time to defend a crew of lowlifes and lost causes. These tales (which culminate, inevitably, in a courtroom heart attack) ''won't disappoint die-hard fans,'' Patricia T. O'Conner wrote here last year. ''Horace is at his rumpled best, quoting Wordsworth, scratching under his yellowing horsehair wig'' and ''puffing at his cheroots.''    AMERICAN SUBLIME: Landscape Painting in the United States, 1820-1880, by Andrew Wilton and Tim Barringer. (Princeton University, $35.) According to the authors, mid-19th-century painters from Thomas Cole to Frederick Church ''celebrated the beauty of the wilderness at the moment of its historical transformation'' by settlement and industry. In 2002 our reviewer, Christopher Benfey, said, ''The spectacular paintings . . . retain their power to entice and overwhelm.''    BORN TWICE, by Giuseppe Pontiggia. (Vintage International, $13.) This utterly unsentimental Italian novel focuses on a father's struggle to cope with his son's severe disability and his ambivalent reaction to his child's limitations. The author's ''artful'' story ''lays bare the moral stakes in representing the disabled,'' Lawrence Venuti wrote here in 2002.

This concern may come from a belief that the artistic object is imbued with some residue of its creator's psychic energy, much as sacred artifacts or Zen ink drawings are said to pack a spiritual charge.    Putting this bias aside is difficult, mostly because it takes away the works' most interesting aspect. It does, however, make it easier to assess how the paintings hold up under art-critical scrutiny. Though there are more alleged Hitler paintings around than one artist could do in a lifetime (apart from subjugating most of Europe), there are enough authenticated works -- for example, the four now being fought over in the courts by the Army and Billy Price, the collector and self-published author of ''Adolf Hitler: The Unknown Artist'' -- for a critique.

Instead of huddling around an open hearth, keeping doors tightly shut between rooms or even going to bed with a nightcap (the knitted kind, of course), people reveled in a newfound freedom.   Even in the depths of winter they were able to move around their houses without shivering. Architects seized upon the opportunity to develop open-living plans that eventually became synonymous with the American home of the 20th century.   Not necessarily so anymore. The 80's are beginning to see a return to the huddling concepts of past centuries. Consider, for instance, what some homeowners are doing for thrifty winter warmth these days:   For most of the 18 years that Virginia and Alfred Wage have lived in their spacious, four-bedroom colonial-style home in Fairfield, heating was never a problem. But lately oil bills had become excessive, especially so, it seemed, since many of the rooms were rarely used now. Their three children were grown and Mrs. Wage was working full time as a nurse.

Then pack your bags, Powerbooks and buckskin drums and head for Gerry Spence's Trial Lawyer's College, a monthlong, $2,900 retreat that starts Aug. 1 on Spence's ranch in Dubois, Wyo. Drawing on big-name legal and media talent (this year's invitees include Johnnie Cochran and Larry King), Spence, the folksy lawyer best known for defending Imelda Marcos, uses New Age trappings to teach students to turn their repressed emotions into jury-swaying power. \\"I would rather have a skilled nurse represent me than a young lawyer,\\" says Spence. Why? Because nurses, at least, have \\"learned how to listen -- how to love.\\"          Now in its third year, the camp kicks off with a moving ritual: campers get  in the mood by walking around Spence's barn in a quiet, somber circle. They are  then softened up with psychodrama, in which they act out difficult personal and  professional situations. (Tears are common, say graduates.) Later, Spence and other legal elders -- \\"old warriors\\" -- teach basic courtroom skills.

She also has a terrible time keeping her clothe on, try as she will. When they aren't torn off in usually friendly struggles, they are stolen while she sleeps. Sometimes she's reduced to wearing a dinner napkin. Sometimes she just gives up and wears nothing, but she is never daunted. Nobody in the villa notices.In addition to a body that invites constant assaults like Everest, the girl possesses the kind of optimistic American purpose that pioneered the West, invented the light bulb and developed frozen food. She is as curious unflappable and self-assured as a favored child and, as she is ravaged by the world so does she ravage it. When she finally departs the villa at least one of its inhabitants has expired in the sheer joy of contemplating her.\\"What?\\", which opened yesterday at the Coronet Theater is a male chauvinist pig sort of comedy. It is not consistently inspired in its lunacy, but it is so totally without redeeming social value that it should be protected and, from time to time, cherished, as when a grumpy maid attempts to clear the air of flies and mistakes and aerosol can of shaving cream for Fly-Tox.Anarchic comedy is a form that continues to challenge Polanski even though neither he nor his script collaborator, Gerard Brach succeeded in their earlier 'Cul-de-Sac\\" or \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers.\\" Perhaps, like verse drama, it's become one of those things that need only to be attempted to succeed in partial measure. It can be fun to watch the try.Occasionally Polanski and Brach seem to want to introduce a system of surreal disorder to the girl's adventures in the villa, but I doubt that they really much care beyond presenting us with an Alice trying to comprehend an X-rated Wonderand. Among the inhabitants are Marcello Mastroianni, playing a former pimp with a sense of honor and a passion for sado-masochistic games","excerpt":"Hugh Griffith, the Villa's ancient owner, once a great collector of art, now a man who prefers the object to its artistic image, and other assorted odd balls, including Polanski himself.The girl, the villa and the performances are beautiful enough to bridge those sequences when the film, like its heroine, seems searching for explanations that will never be found.
