Paul Haggis's hard-hitting film about racial and class tensions in Los Angeles has an enormous ensemble cast, including Sandra Bullock (playing way against type), Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Loretta Devine, Ryan Phillippe, Thandie Newton (above, with Mr. Dillon), Keith David, Brendan Fraser and Jennifer Esposito. But if one character is the damaged heart of the story, it is Mr. Dillon's, a racist police officer. His two scenes with Ms. Newton illustrate just how complicated the human psyche and notions of responsibility and power can be.    BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS (2003)  Friday at 10 p.m. on Sundance  Stephen Fry's giddy, good-looking period film, based on Evelyn Waugh's ''Vile Bodies,'' is about London's beautiful, party-happy 20-somethings in the 1930's, determined to prove that life isn't at all serious when, of course, it is. Adam Fenwick-Symes (Stephen Campbell Moore) wants to marry Nina Blount (Emily Mortimer, left, with Mr. Moore) but has no money. Her father (Peter O'Toole) writes Adam a check but signs it ''Charlie Chaplin.'' Adam wins big money on a horse race but then can't seem to collect. Nina may actually marry someone else. And then the 30's draw to a close.    ALL THIS AND HEAVEN TOO (1940)  Wednesday at 12:15 p.m. on TCM  ''There is tragedy enough in the world,'' says Charles Boyer as the Duc de Praslin, a 19th-century Parisian nobleman and unhappy husband. ''I don't think we have to buy our tears.'' They don't make love stories like this anymore. Praslin is a good man, but his gloomy, complaining, child-neglecting wife (Barbara O'Neil, playing the antithesis of her best-known character, Scarlett O'Hara's mother in ''Gone With the Wind'') is making his life miserable. Then along comes Henriette Deluzy-Desportes (Bette Davis, left, with Boyer), a sweet, soft-spoken governess who charms the four children as well as their father. Praslin and Henriette are models of propriety, but their feelings are overwhelming. A murder is committed. Anatole Litvak directed.

The attacks were carried out by harrier jets from the carrier Hermes. One of the jets was struck by Argentine antiaircraft fire, but returned safely, the British said. The two ships were believed to be supplying food to the Argentine troops on West Falkland, the more sparsely populated of the two islands. (Page A1, Column 6.) The U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires denied that it was guilty of any ''inappropriate conduct'' in the Falklands crisis. The unusual statement followed Argentine newspaper reports that Ambassador Harry W. Shlaudeman and other embassy officials had met with opposition political leaders in an attempt to ''destabilize'' the military junta lead by Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri. The newspaper reports had cited unidentified sources high in the Government. Argentine journalists and Western diplomats said the sources for the accusations were leading officers in the junta.

Peace in the Middle East will still be pursued through President Reagan's inititative, Mr. Reagan said, despite the apparent refusal of Jordan to join any negotiations. Jordan's unwillingness to participate was ''an impediment,'' Mr. Reagan said, but he was ''very hopeful'' that progress could still be made. He said that his telephone conversations with King Hussein and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia indicated that they had not abandoned peace efforts.

Each week there are more choices, even more farmers. As you plow through the crowds and rustle through the greens, you might want a little help focusing. Here it is. These purveyors at local farmers' markets are among the best. Most bring crops to market month after month. But each has a specialty worth trying at the peak of its season.

New Jersey Produce With Korean Parents    Nevia No left South Korea when she was a child and never expected to become a farmer, but she found her niche as a grower of Asian vegetables -- like avocado squash, Chinese long beans, edamame and chili peppers. She and her former husband, Kwang Yoo, tend a 90-acre farm in Bordentown, N.J., where she experiments with new vegetables grown from imported Korean seeds. ''You have to watch the shoots, the bud, the leaves, the tops, at every step,'' she said. Her many Asian-American regulars come for herbs like red shiso and greens like tatsoi, but her greatest expertise is in cucumber varieties. ''The Korean cucumbers are crispier, the Japanese ones are juicier, the lemon ones are round and sweet, and the Armenian ones have the thinnest skins,'' she said.    AVAILABLE -- Asparagus, herbs, cucumbers and greens are in now. After July 4, squash, beans and peppers will appear.    SELECTING -- ''When you can see tiny spikes on the cucumbers, that's a sign of freshness,'' she said. ''They rub off under running water.''    STORING -- Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate.

Instead of its being removed, New York State also put a sales tax on those items.   During the same Depression another great idea was born, Social Security, to provide security for our aged by putting a small tax on income. Now the Social Security tax is no longer small, and the money collected is used to balance the budget -- never the original intention!   Somewhere down the line gasoline was taxed to maintain roads and bridges. Why weren't the road and bridges maintained?   A 25-cent toll was placed on bridges and tunnels to cross the Hudson and East Rivers, to be removed when the bonds were paid up. The bonds were never paid up.

I therefore quickly dismissed all thought of Nakamichi's TX-1000 turntable. At $7,000, it costs roughly 10 times as much as other first-rate designs. It is (and ought to be) very good. Other than that, what it gives you for those extra thousands of dollars is the ability to compensate for eccentric records. Eccentricity, in this context, means that the hole isn't smack in the middle, and this turntable has a very clever and highly complicated mechanism that shifts the center spindle to make up for off-center motion.

A number of bankers and economists said that the small decline indicated that the Federal Reserve would continue to keep a tight rein on the money supply and that, as a result, short-term interest rates would not decline despite new evidence of a deepening recession.   ''My best guess for the immediate future is that short-term rates will be flat,'' said Jay N. Woodworth, vice president and economist of the Bankers Trust Company. ''Considering the economy, these rates should be expected to fall.''

With the small decline, M-1, which consists of currency in circulation plus all kinds of checking accounts, ended the year growing by 5.5 percent for the 12 months ending December 1984, just below the midpoint of the Fed's target growth range of 4 percent to 8 percent.

The large increase did not surprise market analysts, but was a reminder that ''the trend seems to be towards accelerating money supply growth,'' said William O. Sullivan, director of fixed income research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    Yesterday's announcement marked the first time the Fed has published money supply data for weeks ending on Monday. The shift accompanied a change to nearly contemporaneous reserve accounting rules for the banking system.

''Nobody expects the Fed to change policy anytime soon as a result of these numbers, which explains why the short market did not move,'' said one dealer in Treasury securities. ''But in the long end of the market, there is always somebody willing to speculate about the more distant future.''    By late in the day, the Treasury's 11 3/4 percent bonds due in 2014 were offered at 102 1/8, to yield 11.49 percent, up about 7/8 point on the day, and up 1/2 point after the money supply announcement. Other note and bond issues rose smartly after the announcement, with the 10 5/8 percent notes due in December 1988 offered at 99 7/8, to yield 10.66 percent, up 3/8 point on the day, and about 1/4 point after the announcement.

The increase was in line with expectations, and prices on the credit markets remained basically unchanged.     But many analysts said they were highly concerned about the continuing strong demand for credit, especially following the Government's announcement earlier in the day that the economy had grown by a stunning annual rate of 8.3 percent in the first quarter.    Economists said they were primarily worried about the sharp jump in borrowing in the commercial-paper market by nonfinancial companies. These borrowings soared by $1.573 billion in the week ended April 11, according to the Fed. And that came after the Fed's report last Friday that business loans at the nation's large banks rose almost $2 billion in the week ended April 4.

Short-term interest rates rose sharply after the Fed's announcement, as traders quickly decided that the Fed had little choice now but to combat excessive money supply growth by making credit scarcer in the banking system, thereby driving up interest rates.   Some economists were more circumspect, however. They said the recent increases in short-term rates were evidence that the Fed was ''leaning'' against rapid money supply growth without yet undertaking an outright tightening of monetary policy that would send interest rates higher during a recession, possibly endangering a recovery.

Some monetary experts, such as Stanford University's Ronald I.  McKinnon, suggest that domestic money supply may now be an obsolete concept because economies have become so open and interdependent.   Professor McKinnon, now on leave at the Hoover Institute, argued in a recent paper - circulated at the Treasury and Federal Reserve before last week's monetary meeting in Frankfurt - that there is a very strong case for internationalizing American monetary policy and harmonizing it with those of West Germany and Japan.   The dollar, the mark, the yen and to a lesser extent the Swiss franc, as the principal reserve currencies, make up what he calls the world money supply, and he says this is where the focus should be.  ''It's like shooting yourself in the foot when you only look at the domestic indicators,'' he adds.

Monsieur Le Docteur Wins National Hurdle Handicap"},{"year":"1928","title":"That shining light of sophistication and suavity, Adolphe Menjou, appears as an unimaginative French officer in \\"A Night of Mystery,\\" an adaptation of Victorien Sardou's play \\"Ferreol.\\" It is a chronicle that is not exactly plausible, and the mentalities of the characters are decidedly man-made. They threaten when they are told to do so and they forget to tell, to save the plot. They are gallant in almost a foolish fashion, and they twist a French court scene to suit the exigencies of a Hollywood studio. All this is chiefly due to Lothar Mendes's none too brilliant direction, for, in spite of its failings, this tale, through Ernest Vajda's occasional cleverness, succeeds in holding the interest.As Captain Ferreol, Mr. Menjou has a remarkable fondness for a military cape with a white silk lining. He needs but little excuse to wear it, and when he goes to Algiers, he dons it under Africa's scorching sun. The only scenes in which this cape is not worn by the chivalrous officer is when he is seated at a desk. There may be those who have perhaps seen a French officer sporting a cape with a white silk lining, and the excuse for wrapping it around him on the fringes of the Sahara may be that it kept the heat off. Well, never mind.Captain Ferreol is an unusual man. He is obviously vain, but meticulously gallant. He is placed in an awkward predicament when a murderer threatens to expose the Captain's secret visit to the beautiful Marquise de Boismartel if Ferreol breathes a word to the authorities about the crime. Subsequently, Ferreol goes so far as to risk placing his neck in the shadow of the guillotine rather than \\"lie like a gentleman.\\"In a court scene Mr. Mendes gives his conception of French jurisprudence, which is a clumsy mixing of British and French procedures. The testimony of the witnesses is told in a few flashbacks, with the obvious intention of proving the guilt of Jérôme d'Egremont, a brother of Thérèse d'Egremont, Ferreol's financée. Jérôme knows nothing of the crime and Ferreol, after trying to bribe the real slayer to get out of the country, himself proceeds to write out a statement confessing to the murder.This narrative is accompanied by a set of absurdly verbose subtitles that are often irritating, because a child could see where far fewer words would have strengthened the episode. Some of these captions, even now, could be eliminated without losing anything of the meaning of the scenes.Mr. Mendes's direction is along conventional lines. It is hardly original, although he gives flashes of a steamship and locomotive wheels to denote a journey from Algiers to France, which is always interesting.Mr. Menjou's acting is as smooth as usual, but there are times when he might have been photographed to advantage, for not infrequently his face is of the same shade as the wall behind him, which causes the scene to appear somewhat flat. Evelyn Brent has rather a thankless rôle with which she does all that is possible. Alice White, despite the fact that she is the Captain's financée, is not called upon to do much that could be construed as acting.

For weeks and weeks they bring out the most abominable dribble: stupid little farces about army life before the war, egregious sentimentalities concerning peasant maidens from the Rhine, operettas with singing where there should be dialogue and conversation where there should be vocalizing—and then all of a sudden in one week they hurl a series of masterpieces at us. That is almost too much for the critical digestion—and where am I to dig up an adequate supply of superlatives?The week began with a blare: \\"Stürme über dem Mont Blanc\\" (Storms on Mont Blanc) at the Ufa Palast. This is the first film that Arnold Fanck has completed since \\"The White Hell of Pitz Palü.\\"\\"Mont Blanc\\" is even more gorgeous. The director, the leading players, the flier Udet and three courageous camera men were four months on the summit of Mont Blanc itself. The pictures which they brought back are positively breathtaking. The steely rocks cutting through the snow. The clouds lying massed below us. The glaciers laced with rifts. An airplane fighting its way above the mountains through a driving storm. The sun breaking through between two layers of clouds, silhouetting the peak at Mont Blanc. Avalanches thundering down the mountainside in terrifying beauty. But there is no use attempting to describe all this—it is the fearful loveliness of high mountains caught up by tireless human energy into the brief two hours that limit the film.Impressive Scenes.As usual in such films the story is not particularly important and this one suffices. It makes us realize the terrific dangers to which the mountaineer is exposed. A young man who sends the weather reports from the summit of Mont Blanc has his gloves blown away while regulating the wind-measuring apparatus and before he can get back to his cabin his hands are completely frozen. It is now impossible for him to light the fire in his stove, so there is nothing left for him to do except to try to get down the mountain, as he would freeze to death if he stayed on. He gets halfway down on his skis, but is stopped by impossible cracks in the glacier and has to return. In the meantime the door has been blown off his cabin and it is now drifted full of snow. With his elbow he gives the S O S signal on his radio and a rescuing party headed by the girl whom he loves sets out for him. But they are held up for a long time by the glacier cracks and the first person to reach him is a flier friend of his who braves the dangers of an electrical storm.And to the film's photographic beauties are added the natural manliness of Sepp Rist in the leading male rôle and Leni Riefenstahl's ability as a skier and mountain climber (though her acting ability is even below the film leading woman's average).Art Dominates.Then at the Capitol we had \\"The Murderer Dimitri Karamasoff,\\" a film whose merits lie in quite another direction. Here art, not nature, has the upper hand. Its inspiration was one of the richest of novels, Dostoyevsky's \\"The Brothers Karamasoff.\\" But wisely enough there was no attempt made to squeeze the epic fullness of the book into the scenario. Leonhard Frank, himself one of Germany's best modern novelists and dramatists, has concentrated only on Dimitri and left the rest of the figures, with the exception of Grushenka, merely background and casual undertone. The weakness of Dimitri is made clear to us. We feel his vacillation between the pure sweet girl to whom he is betrothed and the fiery sensuousness of the coquette Grushenka. Although his commitment to Siberia for the murder of his father is a judicial crime, we feel, as Dostoyevsky meant us to, that it is a fit atonement for his life of uncontrolled passion. This is a scenario with a will to consequences, with an artistic conscience — how many of them can you recall?And what a splendid \\"collective\\" the Terra assembled to bring it to life. The novelist Leonhard Frank I have already mentioned, but the film director Fedor Ozep, the stage director Erich Engel, the composer Karol Rathaus and the players Anna Steen and Fritz Kortner have all an equal share in the achievement. Ozep is perhaps the best of the younger Russian directors—his \\"Yellow Ticket\\" and \\"Living Corpse\\" (Redemption). Here he has brought to bear all the camera technique of the Russian film and added sound to the pictorial. Erich Engel, after Max Reinhardt the leading German stage director (and that is saying a great deal), was responsible for the dialogue and again showed his ability to characterize through the color and tone of voice. Rathaus is known in the musical world as one of the solidest talents among the younger generation and here proves that he can write music that expresses and underlines the mood without forcing itself into the foreground. Fritz Kortner gives as Dimitri his best performance in the talker. Evidently, owing to the curbing hand of Erich Engel, who has often been his director on the stage, his work is reserved and simple.On a different level but still a distinctly satisfactory evening's entertainment is the German version of \\"The Trial of Mary Dugan,\\" made by the Metro in Hollywood. It is finely played and directed and gives a very just transcription of Bayard Veiller's melodrama. Of course, just as in the English version, it makes no attempt to be a film, but is merely straightforward, photographed theatre—a form which can only be successful in isolated instances. But \\"Mary Dugan\\" has a strong dramatic plot, considerable variety and holds through to the very end. So despite the inadequate reproducing equipment at the Kurfürstendamm, the audience was gripped and moved.
