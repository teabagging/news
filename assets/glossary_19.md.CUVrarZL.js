The decision of the Grumman Corporation pension plan trustees to use the plan's holdings of Grumman stock to foil a takeover attempt by the LTV Corporation raises fundamental questions about the fiduciary responsibilities of pension fund managers and how much control companies can exert over the funds they contribute to the plans.   Should the managers' sole concern be short-term return on investment? Or can they make what may appear to be more unorthodox investments if they adopt a longer-term view? To take the case of Grumman, is it wise to make investments that benefit the company sponsoring the pension plan?   The last question resembles those raised when New York City was wrestling with near bankruptcy a few years ago and the city's five big pension plans purchased Big Mac bonds. Critics said that an impartial party, not concerned with the city's welfare, probably would not have made those investments.

The beauty of his outstretched arms and bat acting as one, making contact with the ball and launching a rocket, would be lost to me if he did it for any other team but the Mets. Question of the Week","excerpt":"Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD: Trading Darryl Strawberry would be a major mistake by the Mets because of the scarcity of left-handed home-run hitters today. And I strongly doubt the Mets would receive equal value in trading their most valuable asset.  WILLIAM PARLAMIS  Brooklyn Question of the Week","excerpt":"Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD: So Strawberry is a bit of a baby. Every fanatic fan is a bit of a baby (even I, a 64-year-old grandmother) - that is what makes us so crazy about baseball. No way should Strawberry be traded. Darryl generates excitement every time he comes to bat. He has the capacity to elicit our wildest fantasies, sometimes less than heroic, he identifies us with our failures. Question of the Week","excerpt":"Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD: It's a long season. At some point in June or July when Darryl comes to bat in a close game with the bases loaded, and radio announcers for both teams are discussing the possibility of an intentional walk, then all of his bad behavior of the spring will be forgotten. You just can't trade a player like that. Question of the Week","excerpt":"Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD: Internecine quarrels aside, what's a harmless little kiss? Does Mozart compose without a family? Does Picasso paint without being born? And haven't we all seen the torture of being born to a violent wind? New York lost an entire organization to L.A. Must we lose Darryl Strawberry, too?  ROBERT GUADAGNINO $ Question of the Week","excerpt":"Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD: The Mets should trade Strawberry only if, after the 1989 season, he and his ill-advising adviser, Eric Goldschmidt, are unbudgingly determined to leave New York. No team can afford to lose a talent like Strawberry to free agency without first trying to get several good players in return through a trade. Question of the Week","excerpt":"Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD: Besides the Mets' pitching staff, Strawberry is the only outstanding player the team has. Sure Hernandez was, Jeffries could be, and McReynolds might be. But, none brings the magic to the plate like Strawberry. His ability to hit the long ball at a pitchers' park, his blazing speed, topped with his m.v.p.-like stats the last two years makes him the top everyday player in the National League, and maybe in the Major Leagues. Question of the Week","excerpt":"Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD: Definitely, for the right-handed hitter they seek. And better while he still has two years left in his contract so the trade is more appealing to other teams. How about Strawberry for Eric Davis? Both players are unhappy where they are and Davis is a much better fielder.  ROXANNE ABBRACCIAMENTO  Jackson Heights, Question of the Week","excerpt":"Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD: For equal, or nearly equal value, yes. Despite being a feared hitter, he does have significant failings. His defense is suspect, if not downright poor. He catches the ball off-balance and is then in a poor position to throw. His powerful arm is more than negated by the number of extra steps he takes to release the ball. Question of the Week","excerpt":"Should the Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD:  Darryl has proven to be a liability in the field, lazy on the bases, and a poor hitter in both his average and his power when men are on base. Would the Mets be sacrificing home runs by trading Darryl? Probably. But more importantly, would the Mets be a better team with a player in right field who batted, played hard everyday, and who hit better than .260 for a career? Question Of the Week","excerpt":"Should The Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD:  Absolutely not. Trading away Strawberry would become a blunder similar to the exportation of Nolan Ryan and Tom Seaver. Darryl is the premier left-handed power hitter in the National League. He has been plagued by injuries all season which have resulted in a drop of his statistics.  RICHARD S. Question Of the Week","excerpt":"Should The Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD:  No. Certainly he's not always a model player. But the Mets would miss his power. So a hasty trade when his value is down would be a serious mistake. I wouldn't want a whole team of Darryls. But one is certainly a good thing.  MARC I. WHINSTON  Flushing, Queens Question Of the Week","excerpt":"Should The Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD:  No. Since I'm a Chicago native, any detriment to your team makes it easier for my team to win the division.  MARK J. KASPER  New York Question Of the Week","excerpt":"Should The Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD:  Why not? They have traded all the other players who might have made the Mets great again. People like Hubie Brooks, Wally Backman, Mookie Wilson, Len Dykstra, Roger McDowell, Rick Aguilera, David West. And on and on. So why trade Strawberry and let him hit .350 with somebody else? Question Of the Week","excerpt":"Should The Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD:  In 1986, Strawberry helped the Mets to a championship, and in 1988 he was robbed of the MVP. Leave Darryl alone and allow him to be the respected star he would be in any other city. Are we allowing history to repeat itself by giving away another franchise player and future Hall of Famer?  KEVEN P. Question Of the Week","excerpt":"Should The Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD:  Strawberry's lack of maturity and lackadaisical play both on defense and offense make him expendable. He definitely should be traded to the American League for a number of quality players, while he still has value. By trading him, it may help him to grow up and also help the Mets, by showing that even big name stars can be traded. Question Of the Week","excerpt":"Should The Mets Trade Strawberry?"},{"year":"2001","title":"A NUMBER of years ago the novelist Sinclair Lewis wrote a book with the title, ''It Can't Happen Here.'' Never mind the subject matter, but the notion would certainly have been applicable to the tenants of Shea Stadium for much of this season. Repeat as National League champs? How about National League chumps? Get back in the World Series? You serious? Look at the standing: the Mets have a better chance of beating out the nearly expired Expos for last place in the N.L. East than getting even a wild-card spot in the playoffs.    Only the most starry eyed of fans, the Alice and Alfred of Wonderland, could give the Mets a chance. Their hitting has been the worst in baseball, their pitching staff has been suspect and almost every time they've had an opportunity to win a close game, they've found a way to hand it to the other team. They've been the Meals on Wheels of baseball.

Question Of the Week","excerpt":"Should the Nets Trade The No. 1 Draft Pick?"},{"year":"1990","title":"LEAD: Yes. Since there isn't a bona fide ''franchise'' pick in the draft, the Nets might be better off trading the pick for an established player or two. I think the Nets could pry loose Chris Mullin from Golden State.       GREG KIERNAN    Stamford, Conn. Question Of the Week","excerpt":"Should the Nets Trade The No. 1 Draft Pick?"},{"year":"1990","title":"LEAD: The Nets should draft Georgia Tech's Dennis Scott with their No. 1 pick. Trading this pick for a veteran player would not benefit the club over the long run. At 6 foot 8 inches, Scott could provide the long-distance 3-point shooting that they expected from Dennis Hopson. Question Of the Week","excerpt":"Should the Nets Trade The No. 1 Draft Pick?"},{"year":"1990","title":"LEAD: The Nets have floundered more from a lack of leadership than a lack of talent. They should trade the No. 1 pick for a proven veteran (or two) from a winning program. Maybe they can make it a point guard to pull the reins in on Dennis Hopson, and to get the ball to Sam Bowie. Fat Lever and Sleepy Floyd might be available. Question Of the Week","excerpt":"Should the Nets Trade The No. 1 Draft Pick?"},{"year":"1990","title":"LEAD: Yes. While there are many talented players in the upcoming college draft (Derrick Coleman, Dennis Scott, Gary Payton, etc.), there are no ''franchise players'' such as Patrick Ewing and David Robinson. The Nets are in need of a prolific scorer, and can trade their first selection to the Clippers for Ron Harper, along with one of their selections. Question Of the Week","excerpt":"Should the Nets Trade The No. 1 Draft Pick?"},{"year":"1990","title":"LEAD: Chances are that if the Nets draft Derrick Coleman, he'll have more of an impact than did Chris Morris, Dennis Hopson or Mookie Blaylock, the Nets' first-round picks the last three years.

Ever since Billy Martin came to New York he brought a unique style of managing that made the game much more exciting to watch.

He was a contemporary and intimate of Bonnard and Vuillard, but the mention of his name evokes in America, if anything, only a glimmer of recognition. A full-scale rescue operation is under way at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven. \\"Felix Vallotton: A Retrospective\\" presents an excellent painter who lived from 1865 to 1925 and was alive to the fresh currents of the 20th century. \\n\\n\\"Artist and author, anarchist rebel and solid bourgeois, Felix Vallotton eludes characterization as he eludes the more Paris-centric views of Post-Impressionism,\\" says the curator, Sasha Newman. If Vallotton, who was born in Switzerland, is known in the United States at all, it is through his woodcuts, which Ms. Newman calls trenchant.

And the fruits of that process were much in evidence in a program presented by the company at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday night, when Miss Watt performed \\"Hollow Lady,\\" a solo created for her by Alwin Nikolais.    Remarkably selfless for so self-aware a performer, Miss Watt is the rare dancer who can get away with scampering onstage. She did that, lightly and deftly, in a show-stopping solo in Limon's \\"There Is a Time,\\" which closed the program. In a way, Nikolais's solo is the opposite side of that coin.

The picture, which shows a model in a bathing suit and cloak running on the beach, was startling in an age when most fashion photographs were carefully staged confections shot in the studio. But it also suggested a new way of viewing women, as free and unabashedly physical.    By the time Munkacsi made this invigorating picture he was already well-known as a photojournalist in Berlin, working for the lively illustrated news magazines that thrived in Weimar Germany. A retrospective of his work, organized by the Aperture Foundation and now at the Fashion Institute of Technology, traces Munkacsi's career from his early work in Hungary to his final fashion shot, taken in 1962, of a model wearing a turban with long cloth ends that droop like a sad rabbit's ears.
