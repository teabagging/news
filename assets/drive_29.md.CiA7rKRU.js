American investors want to know why their Government didn't warn them that the Mexican economy was sicker than it looked. The Mexican finance minister says things would not have gotten this bad if investors on Wall Street hadn't been so eager to send money. And as the United States Congress began balking at the Clinton Administration's proposal to bail out Mexico with $40 billion in loan guarantees, the Mexican stock market and the peso took another plunge.   So what else is new?   The history of foreign investing is littered with disaster stories. Governments fall, and their successors renege on their debts. Currencies are devalued.

Shortly afterward, the New York laws were changed, opening the door for others to follow.\\n\\n\\"The milk business is as political as it is pasteurized,\\" Mr. Goldman, 43 years old, said, alluding to the numerous state and Federal regulations as well as farm subsidies.\\n\\nTo increase the demand for milk, which has slipped 20 percent in the last 20 years, Mr. Goldman has proposed that the industry, through the United States Department of Agriculture, establish a \\"processor promotion fund\\" for fluid milk products (not, for example, cheese or butter). Processors would be assessed three-fourths of a cent a quart for the fund, ultimately creating a treasury of $200 million to be used for marketing and advertising of fluid milk. \\n\\nIn addition, he suggested that a research and development fund be created by assessing farmers one-tenth of a cent a quart. This $75 million fund would be used to expand the variety of fluid milk products.\\n\\n Mr. Goldman's proposals caught the attention of the House and Senate agricultural committees, and he was invited to Washington to present his ideas to them. Recently, his proposals were incorporated, with modifications, in the 1990 Farm Bill, which was passed by Congress. \\n\\nLike most big dairies, Farmland processes and distributes milk but does not produce it. It buys milk from about 800 farmers in the region.\\n\\nBut Mr. Goldman remembers when his grandfather hand-milked a herd of cows and his grandmother delivered raw milk by horse-drawn wagon. In the 50's, Fairlawn Dairies, then run by his father and uncle, merged with Paterson's Farmland. When the dairy moved here in 1970, its name was changed to Farmland.\\n\\nMr. Goldman, who grew up in Glen Rock, returned to the dairy after graduating from college and worked his way up from the production floor to president in 1988. He lives in Woodcliff Lake with his wife and three children.\\n\\nQ. What made you decide to enter the New York City market?\\n\\nA. Farmland was already selling milk in Rockland and Orange Counties and, after a two-and-a-half-year battle, in Westchester County.\\n\\nIf our growth were to continue, it was logical to look toward New York City, with its nine million customers. Although we have other products, such as juices and mixes, milk sales account for more than half of our business.\\n\\nSince milk is more perishable than cheese or other dairy products, we can only sell it within a 100-mile radius of the plant. And here we were, 15 minutes from the George Washington Bridge, and the State of New York said we were not allowed to cross it.\\n\\nI felt both from a business point of view and personally it was not appropriate for any state to be keeping out a legitimate competitor for the purpose of protecting dairies that were there. Milk prices were higher in this noncompetitive environment, so New York was not only doing a disservice to the industry and the Constitution, but also to the citizens of their own state.\\n\\nQ. How were you successful where others failed?\\n\\nA. We developed a comprehensive strategy together with our attorneys on how to approach the issue. We began by focusing on Staten Island. I went to grocery stores and supermarkets there enlisting support of store owners and consumers, telling them how they were being hurt by lack of competition","excerpt":"how higher prices were cutting sales.\\n\\nWe put coupons in our Staten Island ads, asking consumers to sign them in support of our license application. I gave 10,000 coupons to Governor Cuomo. We hired a lobbyist in Albany. \\n\\nHearings dragged on until December of '85, when we finally won in Staten Island. The price of milk immediately dropped an average of 40 cents a gallon, and I immediately applied for a license to sell milk in the other four boroughs of New York.\\n\\nAfter another year of hearings, the New York Commissioner of Agriculture turned down our request. Three weeks later, a Federal judge overturned this decision, declaring it unconstitutional.\\n\\nQ. What happened when you first began to send your delivery trucks into the city? How is the market today?\\n\\nA. The competition did not lay down and let us roll over them. Angry picketers from some of the five entrenched New York dairies violently protested the loss of union jobs to an out-of-state processor. They beat up one of my drivers and smashed windshields. I had to get restraining orders in each county to remove them from outside of supermarkets where Farmland milk was sold; I put security guards on the delivery trucks.\\n\\nSeveral dairies from both New Jersey and Connecticut have since entered the market. While competition remains intense, our market position has stabilized. About half of our business today is in New York City, Long Island and Westchester.\\n\\nQ. What are the reasons for the decline in milk consumption?\\n\\nA. The primary reason is that the milk industry has taken its position as the American beverage for granted for so long that we have failed to recognize that it is no longer true. Too much time has been spent on the regulatory aspects of the product -- what level support prices should be -- as opposed to aggressively marketing the product to eliminate surplus and cost to government altogether.\\n\\nBecause milk is fresh and wholesome, of high nutritional value, doesn't mean people are going to drink it.\\n\\nSoft drink companies are advertising their products as real new-generation kinds of products, but they really are not nutritional. But these companies can afford extensive and expensive ad campaigns partly because the cost of their ingredients -- mainly sugar, water, flavorings -- is very low compared to the selling price of the product. Thus, money is left over for advertising.\\n\\nWith milk, however, the bulk of its cost is in the value of the milk itself. Thus, farmer, processor and distributor alike must find other ways to finance similar marketing efforts.\\n\\nQ. What are the advantages of the processor promotion fund?\\n\\nA. Under supervision of the U.S.D.A. and a board of processor representatives, the milk industry would put through legislation to assess dairy processors around the country three-fourths of a cent per quart to the fund, to be used for marketing of fluid milk only.\\n\\nThis is important because milk used for fluid milk brings in a bigger profit to the farmer. Processors pay more for that milk, so increased demand would boost farmer income to help maintain dairy farms nationwide, assuring locally produced fresh milk.\\n\\nAnother advantage of the fund would be to lower the Federal deficit. With increased consumption of milk, there would be less surplus for the Government to buy. In some years, this cost to the Government has been several billion dollars.\\n\\nAlthough the farmers are now assessed one-third of a cent per quart by the American Dairy Association, this money is used for marketing of all dairy products. More is needed. The National Dairy Board last year spent only $16 million on fluid milk ads; the soft drink industry spent over $500 million on advertising. I suggest lowering the assessment to one-tenth of a cent per quart and that the monies be put into a new product research and development fundfor fluid milk.\\n\\nWe will then begin a self-support program for the industry, which I feel is preferable to a Government support program.\\n\\nQ. What are your future plans?\\n\\nA. We have a suit filed in Connecticut to open the barriers existing in that state, now preventing outside dairies from selling milk there.

He is one of the few who seem to know and care something about motion pictures. He has been heard to defend, with something approaching vehemence, the use of words on the screen, as if somebody had said that they should never be used, and he has sometimes given the impression that, in his opinion, words were the main medium of expression on the screen, the pictures being incidental, a necessary evil, perhaps, or at most mere illustrations for the more vital text. But this impression is erroneous. It is contradicted by Mr. Hughes's pictures. They speak for him more clearly than his words. The point is, they speak.\\"The Wall Flower,\\" which is at the Capitol this week, is evidence immediately at hand. It is the first photoplay directed, as well as written, by Mr. Hughes and so may be taken as representing something of his idea of how a motion picture should be treated—and it is treatment, and not story-stuff, that's under consideration at the moment. The name of this film tells one what it's about. Before he sees it he knows that there's an unattractive girl in it, whom the boys avoid at dances and other parties. But she's the heroine, so, of course, she will be triumphant in some way in the end. It's all a foregone conclusion. The only question is","excerpt":"how is it done? What's been made of the old story? Everything depends on that.Well, Mr. Hughes began by treating his heroine as a subject of sympathetic comedy. His idea, apparently, was to win laughs at her expense and at the same time to make the laughter kindly. And, with the indispensible aid of the pantomimic Colleen Moore, he has succeeded. He has made Idalene Nobbin, the wall flower, an amusing and also an appealing figure. Except in a few scenes where he has let the comedy run too far toward burlesque, he has made Idalene persuasively natural, too. Her environment of small town and college life is genuine. Most of the people around her, in the beginning, are real.All of which means that Mr. Hughes has made motion pictures that mean something. He could not have vivified his story with words. He uses subtitles, of course—too many of them, it must be confessed—but his story is told mainly in the language of motion pictures. Little bits of business here and there, significant camera shots, sequences of scenes illuminating each other—these are the things that give it life, these are the things that make it tellingly lifelike—in the beginning.But only in the beginning. For the story becomes so absurdly far-fetched in its latter part that no treatment, verbal or pictorial, can save it. It would seem that, after Mr. Hughes had shown his wall flower as she might conceivably be, some executive, some officially officious studio person, came to him and said: \\"That's all right, what you are doing there, Mr. Hughes, but you know you can't go on like that, you really can't. The picture can't be as simple as that all the way through. You must have some rich people in it, you know, a swell home, with a garden and an expensive-looking ballroom. You ought to have something novel, too, you know, something a bit startling. How about a fancy swimming pool with something unusual about it! Why not have the heroine become a classy dancer and do an act at the pool, say a water dance? She could appear in a dressed up shower bath and do some steps and then dive into the pool. That would be great stuff.\\"So they did it all—rich people, swell home, swimming pool, shower bath, and everything.And the last part of the picture is totally uninteresting.Also at the Capitol, and interesting from beginning to end, is Hy Mayer's latest Travelaugh, \\"Such Is Life Where Paris Shops.\\" THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD: They have made it more difficult to toss even one coin into the Trevi Fountain, let alone the Hollywood allotment of three.

I saw the handwriting on the wall and decided to turn my gardening hobby into a business. My late wife, Eva, had been a Macy's executive, and we rented a rundown store in the shadow of the good old Third Avenue el. The sign outside read, \\"Philip Truex presents The City Gardener.\\"    Alas, customers were few and far between, so when an immaculately dressed little gent walked in one day, he got a warm reception. He introduced himself as Mr. Devine, and produced a color photo of an \\"Empire Hall Stand,\\" which looked pretty snazzy. He wondered if I cared to display it, complete with greenery, and share the proceeds on consignment. I had little hope that it would sell in our neighborhood but figured what the hell.   The production arrived the following day, and it certainly did give the shop a bit of a fillip. Resplendent in white and gold, backed by a large mirror and topped with a golden eagle flanked by two urns sporting lion heads, it was spectacular, indeed. Third Avenue strollers paused to gape, but that was all.   One fine day a week or so later, a stunning young woman arrived in a chauffeur-driven limousine and asked to see the hall stand up close. She hobbled in on crutches, one leg in a cast, handling her problem with grace and humor. She headed for the piece de resistance. \\"It really is elegant","excerpt":"how much is it?\\"   I quoted the rather hefty price.    \\"I'll take it,\\" she murmured in a voice like sweet music. \\"Can you arrange to have it shipped?\\"   \\"Certainly,\\" I stammered.   \\"To Washington, D.C.,\\" she said, fishing for her checkbook. \\"The name is Mr. and Mrs. John F.

Now an ambitious show of work by black and Hispanic artists using photographic processes, first shown at the Studio Museum in Harlem two years ago, has returned to the area and is on view at the Port Washington Public Library. Local viewers thus have a second chance to see this informative and stimulating essay into important critical territory. Organized by Deborah Willis of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, \\"Constructed Images: New Photography\\" undertakes the salutary task of examining the effects that racial or cultural difference might have on the works artists produce.    Not surprisingly, what's most notable about the works being shown is simply how diverse they are, and how broad a range of issues they address. The work reflects a variety of distinctive visions, from Tyrone Georgiou's conceptually based constructions that attempt to differentiate pictorialist, modernist and post-modernist ways of handling the medium, to Todd Gray's photocollages of silhouetted bodies juxtaposed with other figures drawn in charcoal and conte crayon. As the show's title suggests, most of the work stretches photography beyond its traditional task of recording events in the world, but even that isn't always the case, as Jeffrey Scale's black-and-white documentary study of a Harlem barbershop demonstrates.

At the very least, it's a difficult thing to convey. The movies have long offered us ministers, miracles and the poignant sight of children kneeling sweetly in prayer, but the innermost religious spirit is more elusive. And in its more fanatical forms, religious thought is particularly hard to depict, since it's so likely to look foolish or frightening.   Yet, two new movies, ''Ashram'' and ''Ticket to Heaven,'' have made some effort to capture deeply religious ecstasies and conversions on camera. These films - the former an amateurish documentary about a commune in India, the latter a smooth, understated drama detailing the near-brainwashing of a young cult member - couldn't be less alike in their approach to their subjects.

Credit union involvement has been particularly widespread. A total of 132 federally insured credit unions have $104 million of uninsured deposits in Penn Square. (Uninsured deposits are balances in excess of $100,000.) There are eight credit unions in New York State alone that have almost $10 million of such deposits. Based on the current assessment of the Penn Square situation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, each depositor, including the big institutions, should get 80 cents on each dollar, but it may take several years. Meanwhile, the deposits are earning no interest.   As far as Federal regulators know, none of the institutions with uninsured deposits in the bank have formally notified their depositors of the loss. Commercial banks and savings and loan associations are not required to do so, while credit unions need only make such disclosures in a footnote to their monthly financial statements, which are posted on the bulletin boards at the credit union offices.

Sports of The Times","excerpt":"How Significant Is It?"},{"year":"1961","title":"ANDRE CAYATTE, the director whose dedication to legal themes has resulted in such outstanding French films as \\"Justice Is Done\\" and \\"We Are All Murderers,\\" again is cynically contemplating man-made law in \\"An Eye For An Eye,\\" which opened at the New Yorker yesterday.This time, M. Cayatte is deliberate to the point of ennui on occasion, but his unrelievedly grim study proves to be an exotically fascinating affair with a starkly surprising dénouement that holds a viewer's attention despite its basically funereal pace.In filming \\"An Eye For An Eye\\" in Syrian deserts and towns, M. Cayatte has captured the raw beauty of an ancient terrain corrugated by time and weather with his color VistaVision cameras. If the color is uneven on occasion, the settings around Damascus bring into sharp relief desolate scenes unchanged since Biblical times. And the story that he adapted in collaboration with Vahe Katcha, the author, and Pierre Bost (\\"Devil In the Flesh\\") is almost as bare as the arid locales.Except for the first half-hour or so where it is illustrated that Curt Jurgens, chief surgeon at a small hospital, refused, while relaxing at home, to help an unknown patient, who subsequently dies as a result of an extra-uterine pregnancy, the film is largely a cat-and-mouse play as the surgeon is circuitously hounded by the deceased woman's husband.M. Cayatte and his associates are not obvious. And they lean heavily on the arm of coincidence. One wonders how Folco Lulli, the designing husband, happens to be in the café where the harassed doctor is trying to avoid his tormentor","excerpt":"how Signor Lulli happens to be involved in an auto accident with the doctor; how he can manage to entice him to a distant village in which there is conveniently an injured Arab.There are other seemingly contrived happenstances, but an indulgent observer can overlook them, since the director's point seems to be to expose the methods of a wily Oriental seeking his own brand of justice without resorting to murder. In this, M. Cayatte succeeds admirably, even though one wonders whether a surgeon steeled by his profession and constant responsibility would be plagued by conscience over an act that could only be construed a misdeed by omission. As has been noted, the pace of \\"An Eye For An Eye\\" is as unhurried as a camel caravan. But, as Signor Lulli, inexorably and with a minimum of dialogue, leads his thirst-plagued and well-nigh exhausted quarry over rocky gullies and parched mountains, the plot's twists do provide surprises most of the way. And the climax, as the camera rises high over the parched land to reveal the two principals, one wounded, the other staggering toward Damascus, is worthy of O. Henry and fits the film's title.Herr Jurgens is, despite the reasoning of the scenarists, a tough man softened by doubts. And he does show changes of feeling that seem consistent with the facts as presented here.Signor Lulli's portrayal of the bulky, taciturn schemer also is believable within the context of the script. A widower obviously governed by age-old laws, he will not raise his hand in anger but callously contrives to lead the doctor to self-destruction, despite medico's explanation of the fatality of ectopic pregnancy.The English subtitles literally translate the French, if not the Arabic, dialogue. But \\"An Eye For An Eye\\" is not dependent on talk as much as it is on M. Cayatte's view of the law. It's a terribly somber view minus romance or happiness. It makes for a serious, professional drama of limited appeal.

Its earnings have climbed at an average rate of 40 percent a year. Despite this rapid growth, Electro Rent is still relatively small. Sales in the fiscal year ended May 31 were about $43 million. There are only 4.4 million shares outstanding.

Ms. Fazio-McGrory is a master's level social worker in the AIDS Center Program at St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital Center on Tenth Avenue in Manhattan, one of several facilities in the city that offers comprehensive care to people with AIDS. She is part of an interdisciplinary team of hospital personnel who apply their different skills and knowledge to the care of patients with full-blown AIDS. Many of their patients are in the final stages of the remorseless disease, wary of its malevolent endgame surprises and down to choices that mock the very idea of free will. The dichotomy is more illusory than real, but to the extent it exists, doctors and nurses and other people with medical training tend to the patients' bodies. Ms. Fazio-McGrory takes care of their psyches. She is a comforter, a counselor, a reality check, a broker of services, a massager of the system.

B ut the charity was going to pay a bargain price for the house, and t he taxpayer wanted to know whether the difference between the fair m arket value of the vacation home and the amount he intended to c harge could be claimed as a charitable deduction.   Thousands of dollars hung on the outcome, and the taxpayer could not afford to go ahead with the deal if the deduction were denied. So he did what more and more people are doing these days and requested a special advance ruling - known as a private letter ruling - from the Internal Revenue Service. The answer, issued earlier this year, was favorable, and presumably it gave him peace of mind as he went forward with the deal.   ''The major purpose of the letter ruling program is to provide taxpayers with certainty in advance of consummating a transaction,'' said Gerald G. Portney, the I.R.S.'s top technical expert and head of the section that issues the rulings.

It is simply the saga of a tough, strong-arm bucko, who allegedly has spent some post-graduate years in America, and his adventures in keeping the members of a narcotics-peddling gang working at top efficiency for the big boss.That our tight-lipped, tactiturn hard guy is not precisely all he seems to be, is apparent even to a moviegoer who can't spell marijuana. And it appears to be a foregone conclusion long before the last reel that the constabulary will come through with the climactic crackdown that will round up the ring.But that, as has been noted, is merely a standard framework for an excursion through the Parisian lower depths that is chillingly revelatory. The United States Bureau of Narcotics, the distributors report, is using \\"Razzia\\" to instruct its own agents in the methods of drug traffickers. That's understandable. An observer can learn how the syndicate gets its raw wares (from Yugoslavia, it says here) via secret compartments in railroad cars","excerpt":"how the narcotics are processed also is indicated and the methods of distribution via wholesalers and \\"pushers,\\" who vend it various ways, are strikingly illustrated.The producers, in short, are not glorifying any aspect of this degrading human condition. The furtive operators and the bistros, dives and fancy apartments in which they work are sleazy and depressing, albeit colorful. That the dope users, as well as the sellers, are far from virtue is made painfully plain. Deviates, opium smokers and other unfortunates \\"hooked\\" by the habit pass in stark review. The \\"raid,\\" when it finally comes, is a welcome relief.Jean Gabin, an experienced strong and laconic type, adds another portrait to the gallery for which he has become justifiably well known. He makes a convincing gangster who is forceful in action and sparing with his words. Marcel Dalio is adequate in a comparatively brief performance as the rich and designing narcotics syndicate chief. Magali Noel is sultry as M. Gabin's mistress. A large platoon of gents, headed by Lino Ventura and Albert Remy, as M. Gabin's chief \\"muscle\\" men, leave the impression that they never saw a casting director's office but just stepped from a police line-up. And Lila Kedrova, plays an addict, who is also a \\"pusher,\\" with disturbing realism.The progressive jazz score is an effective musical background and the English subtitles capture the flavor of some of the underworld argot spoken by the principals. In shedding light on a horrible practice, credit \\"Razzia\\" with providing shocking effects, if not inspired melodrama.

But the similarities end at  the tall white doors of the main building, called Bliss Hall. On the East Coast, an expensive private-school education is considered a rung on the ladder  to upper-crust America, and in the halls of such places the quiet codes of high-society conduct are imparted along with lessons in trigonometry and French. At Lakeside, the tone is distinctly . . . well, there isn't tone. There are faded T-shirts and lots of neo-grunge flannel and every make of athletic shoe imaginable -- and not a blue blazer in sight. There is no one, in fact, who is dressed or talking as rich kids do, or are thought to. There are garden burgers  being prepared in the cafeteria and scores of computers booting up and, on the stage in the community meeting room this particular morning in September, a girl named Katie Coxon. She is describing for about 200 middle-schoolers a brainstorming session at which she and other eighth graders worked up a list of  adjectives with which they hoped to describe their lives come the year 2005: relaxed, bold, talented, friendly, productive.         Lakeside is expensive (about $12,000 a year).

Not only has e-mail opened up a whole new medium for personal correspondence, it has also launched the modern corporation into the Internet age with the promise to free workers from the tyranny of too much paper and too little time. It succeeded so spectacularly, however, that what was once blissfully asynchronous is now woefully chronic. For even moderately busy e-mailers, a hundred new messages a day is nothing out of the ordinary. Just as the answering machine gave us a reason to avoid the phone, e-mail has given us a new incentive to delay work in the morning: in-box dread.    The e-mail glut doesn't affect only individuals. AOL, Computer Associates, Intel -- a murderers' row of Internet companies -- have all tried various methods of restricting the volume of e-mail within their companies. Perversely, the few workable solutions to the surfeit of e-mail seem to involve even more e-mail. Multiple addresses, which many time-management experts recommend, make for fewer messages in each account but more accounts, and more time spent checking them all. Wireless e-mail lessens the scramble to wrap up correspondence before heading home for the night, but thereby leaves leisure hours vulnerable to e-mail's taint.

Yet the crippling expenses are largely absorbed by legal costs, often leaving little for the victims. How did the nightmare begin, and what can be done to break out of it?   Some nine million American workers have been exposed to asbestos in the last 40 years, many of them in World War II shipyards. Not until a 1964 study by Irving Selikoff of the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York did the danger of asbestos become fully apparent. Because lung diseases caused by asbestos may take 20 to 40 years to develop, the first wave of the epidemic has hit only recently.

Rather it aspires to demonstrate, in the ambitious, quasi-sociological manner of the newer art history, \\"what portraiture meant in terms of 18th-century English culture and society.\\" As Marcia Pointon shows in her highly discerning discussions of several \\"conversation pieces\\" (a favorite 18th-century subgenre that depicted placid family groups in domestic settings), portraits served as \\"a form of quasi-legal genealogical statement\\" for both the aristocracy and the gentry. One chapter of \\"Hanging the Head\\" is devoted to the physical location of portraits, establishing how and where they were hung (hence the rather awkward title). Elsewhere Ms. Pointon, who teaches art history at the University of Manchester, considers portraiture as a trade, \\"a highly developed business in a buyer's market,\\" detailing how even successful portrait painters were forced to endure the almost unbelievable arrogance and penuriousness of aristocratic patrons. The oddest but not the least fascinating chapter, entitled \\"Dangerous Excrescences: Wigs, Hair and Masculinity,\\" sets forth in extraordinary detail the fetishistic significance of the wigs seen in so many portraits of 18th-century gentlemen.

These negotiations attempt simultaneously to remove the large Cuban military presence from Angola and to bring about Namibia's transition from South African rule to independence under Security Council Resolution 435.   The efforts have monopolized the attention of the Reagan Administration's top African specialists for the last three years, to the near exclusion of creative initiatives on the rest of the continent. The two issues are intrinsically difficult, and in the eyes of many, the Reagan team has not helped matters by consciously entangling the two and by showing uncommon tolerance for repeated South African military adventures deep into Angola and for its open supply of arms and money to an opposition movement waging guerrilla warfare against the Angolan regime.","excerpt":"HOW TO HELP ANGOLA GET RID OF THE CUBANS"},{"year":"1996","title":"To the Editor:         \\"Beware the Pitfalls of Foster Care\\" (Op-Ed, Jan. 21) implies that after a woman who was receiving family preservation services hanged her 3-year-old child, Illinois eliminated family preservation with disastrous results.

Amid tight security and worry over a terror attack, helicopter rotors chopped through the sound of hymns throughout the three-hour ceremony.   A1    The pope's funeral Mass began nine days of spiritual mourning, but it also opened a political chapter -- the subtle campaigning before the gathering of cardinals in a conclave starting April 18 to elect a successor.   A8    Prayer to Follow Royal Wedding  Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, who have been lovers, on and off, for the past 30 years, plan to follow their wedding ceremony with a religious blessing, the centerpiece of which will be a stern prayer of penitence from the 1662 Book of Common Prayer.   A3    Epidemic in Angola Spreading  The death toll in Angola from an epidemic caused by the Marburg virus rose to 174 as some aid workers reported that terrified people had attacked them and that a number of health workers had fled out of fear of catching the disease. Seven of Angola's 18 provinces have now reported suspected cases.

A13    North Korean Weapons Talks  There have been two senior-level meetings between North Korean and Chinese leaders over the last two weeks to discuss the North's nuclear-weapons program, but the Chinese have failed so far to persuade North Korea to rejoin nuclear disarmament talks. Informal discussions have begun on new, more aggressive strategies.   A14    Japanese Goods Protested  Several thousand young Chinese marched through Beijing's high-tech district, calling for a boycott of Japanese-made goods, a rare legal protest that underscored the sharp deterioration in relations between Asia's two most powerful countries.

Some hikers may find it worthwhile to buy one of the various foam-padded equipment belts or cases that fit individual cameras and lenses and then can be placed in daypacks or backpacks. If these are too expensive then one can resort to such makeshift solutions as wrapping packing material or foam padding around each camera and lens and then jamming these into a tight place at the top of the pack so that they will stay wrapped, yet can be quickly reached.

In the search for solutions, Mr. Milchman zeroed in on Montclair's Board of Education. Its seven members have always been appointed by the mayor, and as a result, Mr. Milchman and others say, candidates are culled from a select group of civic organizations and tend to represent limited points of view.

The summit's delegates will negotiate the Free Trade Area of the Americas (F.T.A.A.) accord, which critics have dubbed ''Nafta on steroids.''     No one's willing to predict just how many activists will converge on the Francophone city, but through the movement's now familiar mix of tactics -- borrowed from punk rock, 1930's Spanish anarchism, New Age feminism, nonviolent resistance, environmental activism and rave culture -- organizers managed to get their message heard across the continent and around the world. They plan to stage a Carnival Against Capitalism in the city itself and various disruptions along the U.S.-Canada border. More modest actions are planned at the San Diego-Tijuana crossing, as well as in some 60 other cities from Thunder Bay, Ontario, to Buenos Aires. Whether they pull it off remains to be seen, as does the extent to which the police will be able to anticipate and contain these actions.

Removing the old wallpaper is seldom a pleasant or fast job, but it need not be especially difficult if tackled in the right manner.    If the old wall covering has a plastic or canvas backing, or if it was one of the so-called strippable types (these use a special paste that is supposed to let you peel the paper off when you want to remove it), you should be able to peel each strip off after you have scraped one corner loose.

If a button is loose or missing, for instance, insist on having it fixed.    Temper temptation. In a store filled with all sorts of enticing items tagged at drastic discounts, it's all too easy to succumb. Stay the hand that reaches for the credit card and ask yourself once again: Do I really need this? Will it work with what I already own?   Keep your eye on the wallet and coat you came in with.

Not only is it handy to have a larder filled with one's own produce to fall back on, but it is also likely that the quality of many vegetables will be superior to that obtained from produce markets.\\n\\nCanning is one choice. Although time consuming, it is the best method of preserving those vegetables that are most perishable. The choice of those to be canned is largely one of common sense. Tomatoes canned at the peak of their season in late summer will be of the highest quality. Tomatoes canned in the fall are of low quality to begin with and will be of inferior quality to those purchased at the store. A late crop of snap beans, on the other hand, will be of superior quality in the fall and would be a good candidate for this method of preservation.

Professional window cleaners start with the right tools. They use a squeegee of high quality brass or stainless steelto remove the window solvent. These are available in different lengths, but a 10- to 14-inch blade is the most practical. If the blade is too long, you can shorten it with a hacksaw. You can also purchase an extension pole for the squeegee that will allow you to wash second floor windows while standing on the ground.

Research universities and national labs in the United States receive more than $60 billion a year in Federal research funds. A good, or controlled, diffusion of new American government-funded technology -- the kind we all want in concept -- occurs only when someone in the private sector is willing to make an investment. New technology may be created by Government funds, but it never benefits the American tax-paying consumer, or anyone else in the world, without the involvement of a private investor.   The only reason anyone in the private sector has for investing in technology is to try to gain or improve a competitive advantage. For good diffusion, new technology must first be converted into an international shape and form that can provide an investor a competitive advantage.   Unfortunately, bad diffusion of new Government-funded technology takes place all too often in the United States, and especially at our research universities and national labs. A vast majority of the new technology being produced by these institutions is left in an unconverted state. This means that it is not being protected or put into economically and internationally transferable forms -- like patents. This omission, particularly in creation of foreign patents, is one of the most seriously overlooked trade-related issues of our time.   A traditional American university research report that may contain important new technology is simply not designed for investment purposes. Furthermore, it typically becomes a public document, available to the world, the moment it is indexed at a university library. This means that it can be copied and sent around the globe -- let's say, for argument's sake, to Japan -- where a Japanese company is then free to take the new technology created at an American university or national lab. If we have not taken the proper steps and international initiatives, we usually cannot stop the Japanese or anyone else from taking and using our Government-funded technology.   If this new technology is not protected and converted, it dies on the shelf at the university library or is picked up by someone, somewhere else in the world, without our permission. International collaboration is fine, but international ownership, for free, of American-funded technology is not.   I completely agree with Jerome Wiesner's statement (letter, Jan. 8): \\"We need an informed debate in the nation and the world, reflecting the subtleties and complexities of international life, trade, economics and how the United States supports scientific and technological research that drives our economy. We need to understand the complexities of the balance of trade of money and ideas.\\"   We must begin to feel more responsibility for the diffusion of our technology. L. ANDREW WITHERS JR.

Such a lot of composers and their music has not been lined up in a film since goodness knows when! It was produced in Italy and in Paris—in Technicolor that is quite good.The connecting thread in this pasticcio is the part that was played in the so-called \\"golden age\\" of Italian opera by the heads of the house of Ricordi, a Milanese music publishing firm. This part, so far as a filmgoer can gather, is mainly one of helping young composers to get their starts and holding their hands when they are in romantic trouble. But this is enough of a thread with which to stitch the tales.The first of these is of Gioacchino Rossini, whose \\"Barber of Seville\\" is published by the first of the house of Ricordi and presented by him for a second and successful showing after its first performance was booed off the stage. In the meantime, Rossini is having a rather tempestuous love affair with an opera singer whose former lover, we gather, does not entirely approve. This will give you some idea of the nature of the romantic content of this film.As the musical contribution to this legend, in which Roland Alexandre plays Rossini and Marta Toren plays the lady he loves, there are familiar scenes from \\"The Barber,\\" with the vocalizing being done by Tito Gobbi and Giulio Neri—all very handsomely.Succeeding episodes tell how Donizetti (Marcello Mastroianni) tames the tempermental diva, Virginia Marchi (Micheline Prelle), in the rehearsals of his \\"Elisir d'Amore\\"","excerpt":"how Vincenzo Bellini (Maurice Ronet) is permitted to die in loneliness on the night his new opera, \\"The Puritans,\\" is being sung by his former sweetheart (Nadia Gray); how Giuseppe Verdi (Forco Giachetti) abandons composing after his \\"The Masked Ball\\" is jeered for being \\"old-fashioned\\" and then returns with his triumphant \\"Otello.\\"The final episode, which is thoroughly sentimental and yet the most affecting withal, tells how Giacomo Puccini Gabriel Ferzetti) is inspired to compose \\"La Bohème\\" by a Parisian grisette (Danielle Delorme) and then looks for her in vain on the night of the opera's opening. She is not there because, of course, she has died.The little stories are amusing or touching and the operatic scenes are lushly staged—all of which gives an air of golden romance and nineteenth-century opulence to the film. An impressive array of opera singers contribute their voices to the rendering of the scenes. Distinguished among them are Mario del Monaco singing the final aria of \\"Otello\\" and Renata Tebaldi singing the dying song of Mimi in \\"La Bohème.\\"Paola Stoppa is lively and amusing as the founder of the firm of Ricordi, which, by the way, is almost forgotten as the picture progresses for nearly two hours.

Not only that, but he wants to reach in and use $5.5 billion of that company nest egg as part of the down payment. If he's just trying to get the share price up, he succeeded, as the stock rose $9.50 in a day. And if he really wants to own it, he's betting big that Chrysler won't need that money.

AIRLINES  Continental Scraps Its Diet  Purists may see it as justice for using that mangled spelling, but the demise of Continental Lite last week was more the failure of an idea that some say was doomed from the start. Not that low-fare \\"airlines within airlines\\" can never work -- United's doing fine with its West Coast shuttle. But Continental's attempt to go lo-cal -- sorry, low-cal -- just never worked. Too many planes were added too quickly, resulting in lots of repairs -- and lots of canceled flights. So the airline, after losing $140 million on the experiment, scrapped it. The logos on 100 planes will be painted over, the first-class seats brought back -- and no more peanuts, or \\"peanuts fares.\\" So, like the waistline of an erratic dieter, fares go up, fares go down. Someday maybe the airlines will get it right.  MARKETING  Happy Birthday Dear Blunder  Do you suppose that Ford Motor, 10 years after offering the Edsel to a resoundingly ungrateful public, celebrated that fiasco's anniversary? Not likely. But, hey, this is the 90's -- everything's upside down. So it was that Coke, far from being red-faced a decade after the \\"new Coke\\" follies, last week actually celebrated the anniversary of that too-sweet marketing blunder. Maybe, as Pepsi unsweetly suggested, Coke was just \\"trying to put the right spin\\" on the inevitable anniversary stories. But then again, as Coke's chairman, Roberto Goizueta, pointed out, the company's market value has grown from $9 billion to $75 billion in that decade. New Coke -- which Mr. Goizueta, by the way, decided to introduce -- has not exactly hurt. NO TRUMP  If Eloise Could See It Now  On Oct. 1, 1907, when the Plaza opened in a blaze of ornate glory, could guests like the Vanderbilts ever have imagined the wild ride the hotel would be taken on by those who held the cash at the century's far end? Could they, in short, have imagined Donald Trump? Surely not. Mr. Trump, a tireless collector of \\"trophies,\\" bought the Plaza in 1988 -- with borrowed money -- and then borrowed even more on it to help him buy Eastern Airlines, among other things. This house of loans tottered in 1992, with Citibank and other banks winding up the true owners -- and Mr. Trump a 51 percent owner in name only. The banks wanted out, and last week buyers were found -- a Saudi prince (the same one who put big money in Citicorp a few years back) and a Singapore company. The price: $325 million (Mr. Trump had paid $400 million). Eloise, at last report, was cowering in a closet. CURRENCY  A Little Dollar That Wouldn't  You'd think that if everyone wanted to stop the dollar from falling in value against the yen, something could be done. But forces greater than mere governments are clearly at work here, for even though both Washington and Tokyo want to even things out, the dollar stays weak -- it now buys just 83 yen, compared with 100 in January. Just last week Japan -- its goods becoming awfully costly on world markets -- offered an emergency rescue plan, including a cut in its discount rate to an unheard-of 1 percent. It also moved to promote imports and cut regulations to whittle away at its trade deficit -- seen as the main culprit. To no avail. Exchange rates barely budged, and Tokyo stock prices fell sharply. Back to the drawing boards. LEGALITIES  His Appeal Was Not Insane  At the 1993 sentencing hearing, the judge in the Crazy Eddie case said his goal from the start had been to redress the wrongs resulting from \\"the fraudulent activities of this defendant\\" -- Eddie Antar, that is. Irate as he may have been at one of the largest stock frauds ever, that's not the way a judge should talk. At least that's what a Federal appeals panel ruled last week as it overturned Mr. Antar's stock fraud and racketeering convictions, saying the judge had shown prejudice. Mr. Antar may now face a new trial on charges that he inflated the price of Crazy Eddie stock in the 80's. THE ECONOMY  Inflation Made at the Fed  It really becomes a chicken-and-egg problem: Which came first -- Federal Reserve interest-rate increases or inflation? Yes, the Fed kept saying it was lifting rates to keep inflation nice and cool. But a funny thing turned up in the price figures last week. Yes, inflation was still in check -- producer prices were up just 0.1 percent, consumer prices just 0.2 percent. But where did a big part of that 0.2 percent come from? Directly from the Fed -- its rate increases have driven up automobile finance charges by a third in the past year. And -- surprise! -- that drove transportation costs up far faster than the overall rate.  RESTAURANTS  The Day the Smoke Cleared  \\"Excruciating and bothersome\\" -- one can easily imagine such words being uttered by a nonsmoker who felt an enjoyable meal had been ruined by someone else's cigarette smoke. But last week it was a smoker voicing that sentiment, as a strict New York law went into effect that bars smoking in most city restaurants. It's \\"part of the whole Big Brother thing,\\" said another smoker. Restaurant owners are worried -- and, in some cases, poorer. One spent $40,000 for renovations to comply with the law. But is it all fair? Smokers, of course, can smoke on the sidewalk. Then again, nonsmokers could always eat on the sidewalk.  TAXES  No Discount on Boardwalk, Yet  Parker Brothers is having a high old time celebrating Monopoly's 60th anniversary. Here's the latest: After calculating that that pesky $75 \\"luxury tax\\" would now, in New Jersey, be $2,746.27, it proceeded to catch today's tax-cut fever. At a ceremony in New York tomorrow -- tax day, of course -- Parker is scrapping the luxury tax for the whole anniversary year.

Mrs. O'Connor is an alumnus of the Oxford School in West Hartford, CT and graduated from Smith College in 1935 before embarking upon a dynamic and illustrious career in business and a life of service to many community organizations. Mrs. O'Connor had a extensive career with IBM Corporation, one which began in 1935 when she was among the first 25 women employed for Sytems Service work and was assigned to the Newark office where she assisted salesmen in serving customers.

In 1943 she was promoted to the corporate level as the first woman Assistant Vice President of the Company.

A Novel on Solid Victorian Lines","excerpt":"Howard Spring's \\"My Son, My Son!\\" a Story of Two English Generations, Is Told With Sustained Emotional Power"},{"year":"1963","title":"IT appears that the French film producers who made the big historical drama \\"Lafayette\\" have been seeing too many Westerns and too many of those ponderous spectacle films, loaded with battle scenes and blockheads, of the sort that they make in Italy.For this giant-screen color picture, which came yesterday to the DeMille, presents the American Revolution as though it had been a combination of the siege of Fort Apache and the battles of the Crimean War.As the Battle of Brandywine is dished up in this thoroughly rococo film, you might think it took place by a real river on the broad Wyoming plains rather than along a creek near Philadelphia in a well-populated countryside. And the Battle of Yorktown in this picture is an attack upon a large log-built stockade that sits out in wide-open country within viewing distance of the boundless sea.Furthermore, these interesting battles are engaged in by the oddest mèlange of cavalrymen and foot soldiers that a spectacle director could conceive. Long lines of mounted horsemen in blue and gold uniforms, looking for all the world like smart battalions of John Ford's Seventh Cavalry, sweep across rolling country to clash with facing columns of Scottish Highlanders, decked in full regalia and with bagpipes skirling down the line.And behind these fiercely riding horsemen comes the legendary swarm of \\"ragged Continentals,\\" a sea of coonskin caps and feather-trimmed headgear, howling to the strains of \\"Yankee Doodle,\\" with a fiery Lafayette leading them.But whatever notion of the nature of the American Revolution the director, Jean Dreville, may have had, it was no more bizarre than the notion of the French court of Louis XVI that he offers in this film. It is an image of posturing people, costumed to the nines and moving about with the air of actors who have been warned not to damage or soil those costumes.In short, this elaborate fiction of the Marquis de Lafayette, who came from France to aid the American Revolution and became a favorite of George Washington, is gaudy and artificial, scenic in spots (when set in France), but played with pedantic pomposity by an amusingly conglomerate cast, which is not helped by a stiffly written addendum of dubbed English dialogue.Michel Le Royer gives us a blend, pearly toothed Lafayette","excerpt":"Howard St. John puffs himself out like a pigeon as a pageant-style George Washington; Jack Hawkins makes General Cornwallis an 18th-century Colonel Blimp and Orson Welles plays Benjamin Franklin like a cracker-barrel character in a television show.If the young French participant in our Revolution had been anything at all like the ad for a dentifrice we see in this picture, he would get a good Yankee razz to go home.\\"FIASCO IN MILAN\\" is a rickety Italian satire about a gang of bumbling thieves. Remember \\"Big Deal on Madonna Street\\" several seasons back? It is the same kind of picture—but this one can't hold a candle to it. The film, with Vittorio Gassman and (ever so briefly) Claudia Cardinale, opened yesterday at the R.K.O. 23d Street.Not only is this heavy-handed little comedy strictly in the minor league, but it also looks dated. And since the direction is credited to Nanni Loy, now solidly represented here by \\"The Four Days of Naples,\\" surely this must be an earlier, left-handed exercise.One thing can be said for it: here is the most verbose import in years. Most of the cast, excluding Miss Cardinale as a demure bride-to-be, tend to yell their heads off. The clamor starts when some small-time, Roman underworldlings band together to hijack the \\"pool\\" of a football game in Milan. It gets hysterical, at least acoustically, during the robbery. Things quiet down somewhat in the home stretch (more chaos, retribution and one or two genuinely funny bits).It's too bad the entire romp is acted and staged in high, screeching gear. If only Mr. Loy had tried a steady second. Furthermore, the guys themselves seem dimwits who probably couldn't manage an egg haul from a henhouse.A few sideline incidents, with a shrewish wife and a strip-teaser (credit pouting Vicky Ludovisi for some superb natural scenery) don't make our heroes more interesting—or funnier, as was intended.One hospital scene toward the end is quite amusing, though it involves the gang's eldest member, a droll little chap named Carlo Pisacane, who struts through the picture nattily, piping in a childish treble and stealing the show. Petty larceny, Mr. Pisacane.

Born in New York City, NY on June 13, 1936, daughter of Mary Elizabeth Lydon and Alphonse Michael Silvestre. Pat lived in the Bronx with her mom and her first job was a line girl at Horn & Hardart Cafeteria. Knowing this would not suffice, she convinced the family patriarch, her grandfather Nicholas Silvestro, to allow her to join the 1st Sergeants Program for Army Nurses in New York State, so she could attend school. Succeeding in her quest she went to Lenox Hill Hospital School of Nursing and graduated in 1958. Pat's thirst for knowledge never stopped. She received a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Columbia and a Master's in Hospital Administration from Baylor. Her military education: Army Medical Department Officer Advanced Course, Department of the Army Inspector General Course, (Pat was the 1st female placed on the I.G. team) and the Chief Nurse Orientation Course. Upon retirement, she became an Instructor at the American Red Cross. During her Army career, she held a variety of clinical, administrative and staff positions: Madigan, the 121st Evac. in Seoul, Korea, Fort Gordon, Fort Jay, a tour at the U.S. Army Recruiting Command, the office of the Surgeon General as Assistant Chief for the Army Nurse Corps Procurement, Surgical Hospital, Quang Tri, the 95th Evacuation Hospital Republic of Vietnam, Inspector General U.S. Army Health Services Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Fort Campbell, the Army Regional Medical Center in Frankfurt, Germany and Fitzsimmons in Colorado. She was the youngest Colonel in the Army. Pat's army career ended with her retirement on September 25, 1986. However, her new life of retirement in San Antonio, TX began anew with an old life long motto of serving others. She started at the SAMM Shelter volunteering for the night shift in downtown San Antonio. She became an active field worker for the Red Cross and when mobility became a problem she became an instructor. She became a vital member of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, where she used her skills and character for many years to benefit those who needed a helping hand. As a member of her church she served as a CCD instructor, lector, and Parish Council. She remained an active member of Kiwanis, Veteran's of Foreign Wars and the Women's Overseas Service League for as long as her health permitted. Paraphrasing M. Rausch's words about Colonel Silvestre, ''What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us. You have left a trail of excellence as exhibited by your family, friends, and colleagues and the future holds great promise","excerpt":"however it is what lies within you which has touched 'The Body of Christ.''' Alfred Adler, one of the fathers of modern psychiatry, said one of the dominant impulses that every human being is born with is the instinct to get ahead. The problem arises whether one is willing to channel it for good. Christ said that in the Kingdom of God greatness is measured in terms of service. And you my friend have accomplished that level of excellence because you were always ready to the cries of those in need. Your service has cost you through the years to bleed and suffer knowing the price for greatness is long hours and many sleepless nights. There is another quote which puts you in mind. ''You Pat, are a very special individual who at all times and every where gave her strength to the weak, her substance to the poor, her sympathy to the suffering, and her heart to God. The endless number of people who have crossed your path will bear witness to this. When a void existed you were ready to step in and serve with honor and humility. It is yourcommitment in ministering to others which has touched us all.'' Colonel Silvestre's awards and recognitions are too numerous to mention. Colonel Patricia Ann Silvestre passed away at the Army Retirement Community in San Antonio, TX on March 12, 2006. She leaves behind dear friends, colleagues, cousins Nancy Guerin, Dorothy Lyons, Michael Guerin, their families, and her sister, Marietta.

The main issue dividing the Central Bank and Treasury economists, and ourselves was that of devaluation.

Because this content can include advertisements and links to download sites, ICPs also provide a channel for the promotion and distribution of Web browsing software. Executives at Microsoft recognized that ICPs were not nearly as important a distribution channel for browsing software as OEMs and IAPs.  Nevertheless, protecting the applications barrier to entry was of such high priority at Microsoft that its senior executives were willing to invest significant resources to enlist even ICPs in the effort. Executives at Microsoft determined that ICPs could aid Microsoft's browser campaign in three ways. First, ICPs could help build Internet Explorer's usage share by featuring advertisements and links for Internet Explorer, to the exclusion of non-Microsoft browsing software, on their Web pages. Second, those ICPs that distributed software as well as content could bundle Internet Explorer, instead of Navigator, with those distributions.  Finally, ICPs could increase demand for Internet Explorer, and decrease demand for Navigator, by creating their content with Microsoft technologies, such as ActiveX, that would make the content more appealing in appearance when accessed with Internet Explorer. . . .    Cross-marketing arrangements in competitive markets do not necessarily make those markets less competitive","excerpt":"however, four characteristics distinguish this case from situations in which such agreements are benign. First, Microsoft was able to offer ICPs an asset whose value competitors could not hope, on account of Microsoft's monopoly power, to match. Second, Microsoft bartered that asset not to increase demand for a revenue-generating product, but rather to suppress the distribution and diminish the attractiveness of technology that Microsoft saw as a potential threat to its monopoly power. Third, and more specifically, Microsoft prohibited the ICPs from compensating Netscape for promotion of their products even while not attempting to prohibit the promotion itself.  This reveals that Microsoft's motivation was not simply a desire to generate brand associations with Internet Explorer. Finally, Microsoft went beyond encouraging ICPs to take advantage of innovations in Microsoft's technology, explicitly requiring them to ensure that their content appeared degraded when viewed with Navigator rather than Internet Explorer. Microsoft's desire to lower demand for Navigator was thus independent of, and far more malevolent than, a simple desire to increase demand for Internet Explorer.     The terms of Microsoft's agreements with ICPs cannot be explained in customary economic parlance absent Microsoft's obsession with obliterating the threat that Navigator posed to the applications barrier to entry. Absent that obsession, Microsoft would not have given ICPs at no charge licenses to distribute Internet Explorer.  What is more, Microsoft would not have incurred the cost of componentizing Internet Explorer and then licensed that version to Intuit at no charge. By sacrificing opportunities to cover its costs and even make a profit, Microsoft advanced its strategic goal of maximizing Internet Explorer's usage share at Navigator's expense. . . .    Foreclosing Apple as a Distribution Channel for Navigator     By the summer of 1996, Apple was already shipping Internet Explorer with the Mac OS, but it was pre-installing Navigator as the default browsing software. After a meeting with Apple in June 1996, Gates wrote to some of his top executives: ''I have 2 key goals in investing in the Apple relationship -- 1) Maintain our applications share on the platform and 2) See if we can get them to embrace Internet Explorer in some way.'' Later in the same message, Gates expressed his desire that Apple ''agree to immediately ship IE on all their systems as the standard browser.''    One point of leverage that Microsoft held over Apple was the fact that ninety percent of Mac OS users running a suite of office productivity applications had adopted Microsoft's Mac Office. In 1997, Apple's business was in steep decline, and many doubted that the company would survive much longer. Observing Apple's poor performance in the marketplace and its dismal prospects for the future, many ISVs questioned the wisdom of continuing to spend time and money developing applications for the Mac OS. Had Microsoft announced in the midst of this atmosphere that it was ceasing to develop new versions of Mac Office, a great number of ISVs, customers, developers, and investors would have interpreted the announcement as Apple's death notice.    Recognizing the importance of Mac Office to Apple's survival, Microsoft threatened to cancel the product unless Apple compromised on a number of outstanding issues between the companies. One of these issues was the extent to which Apple distributed and promoted Internet Explorer, as opposed to Navigator, with the Mac OS.    At the end of June 1997, the Microsoft executive in charge of Mac Office, Ben Waldman, sent a message to Gates and Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer, Greg Maffei. The message reflected Waldman's understanding that Microsoft was threatening to cancel Mac Office:    The pace of our discussions with Apple as well as their recent unsatisfactory response have certainly frustrated a lot of people at Microsoft. The threat to cancel Mac Office 97 is certainly the strongest bargaining point we have, as doing so will do a great deal of harm to Apple immediately. I also believe that Apple is taking this threat pretty seriously . . . .    Apple increased its distribution and promotion of Internet Explorer not because of a conviction that the quality of Microsoft's product was superior to Navigator's, or that consumer demand for it was greater, but rather because of the in terrorem effect of the prospect of the loss of Mac Office. To be blunt, Microsoft threatened to refuse to sell a profitable product to Apple, a product in whose development Microsoft had invested substantial resources, and which was virtually ready for shipment. Not only would this ploy have wasted sunk costs and sacrificed substantial profit, it also would have damaged Microsoft's goodwill among Apple's customers, whom Microsoft had led to expect a new version of Mac Office. The predominant reason Microsoft was prepared to make this sacrifice, and the sole reason that it required Apple to make Internet Explorer its default browser and restricted Apple's freedom to feature and promote non-Microsoft browsing software, was to protect the applications barrier to entry. More specifically, the requirements and restrictions relating to browsing software were intended to raise Internet Explorer's usage share, to lower Navigator's share, and more broadly to demonstrate to important observers (including consumer, developers, industry participants, and investors) that Navigator's success had crested. Had Microsoft's only interest in developing the Mac OS version of Internet Explorer been to enable organizational customers using multiple PC operating-system products to standardize on one user interface for Web browsing, Microsoft would not have extracted from Apple the commitment to make Internet Explorer the default browser or imposed restrictions on its use and promotion of Navigator.    Microsoft understands that PC users tend to use the browsing software that comes pre-installed on their machines, particularly when conspicuous means of easy access appear on the PC desktop. By guaranteeing that Internet Explorer is the default browsing software on the Mac OS, by relegating Navigator to less favorable placement, by requiring Navigator's exclusion from the default installation for the Mac OS 8.5 upgrade, and by otherwise limiting Apple's promotion of Navigator, Microsoft has ensured that most users of the Mac OS will use Internet Explorer and not Navigator. Although the number of Mac OS users is very small compared to the Windows installed base, the Mac OS is nevertheless the most important consumer-oriented operating system product next to Windows. Navigator needed high usage share among Mac OS users if it was ever to enable the development of a substantial body of cross-platform software not dependent on Windows. By extracting from Apple terms that significantly diminished the usage of Navigator on the Mac OS, Microsoft severely sabotaged Navigator's potential to weaken the applications barrier to entry.    Microsoft's Success in Excluding Navigator From the Channels That Lead Most Efficiently to Browser Usage      The cumulative effect of the stratagems described above was to ensure that the easiest and most intuitive paths that users could take to the Web would lead to Internet Explorer, the gate controlled by Microsoft.  Microsoft did not actually prevent users from obtaining and using Navigator (although it tried to do as much in June 1995), but Microsoft did make it significantly less convenient for them to do so. Once Internet Explorer was seen as providing roughly the same browsing experience as Navigator, relatively few PC users showed any inclination to expend the effort required to obtain and install Navigator. Netscape could still carpet bomb the population with CD-ROMs and make Navigator available for downloading. In reality, however, few new users (i.e., ones not merely upgrading from an old version of Navigator to a new one) had any incentive to install -- much less download and install -- software to replicate a function for which OEMs and IAPs were already placing perfectly adequate browsing software at their disposal. The fact that Netscape was forced to distribute tens of millions of copies of Navigator through high-cost carpet-bombing in order to obtain a relatively small number of new users only discloses the extent of Microsoft's success in excluding Navigator from the channels that lead most effectively to browser usage.    The Success of Microsoft's Effort to Maximize Internet Explorer's Usage Share at Navigator's Expense      Microsoft's efforts to maximize Internet Explorer's share of browser usage at Navigator's expense have done just that. The period since 1996 has witnessed a large increase in the usage of Microsoft's browsing technologies and a concomitant decline in Navigator's share. This reversal of fortune might not have occurred had Microsoft not improved the quality of Internet Explorer, and some part of the reversal is undoubtedly attributable to Microsoft's decision to distribute Internet Explorer with Windows at no additional charge. The relative shares would not have changed nearly as much as they did, however, had Microsoft not devoted its monopoly power and monopoly profits to precisely that end. . . .

The most widely used is the standard carpenter's wood-cutting saw. It is usually 24 to 26 inches long and has a springy metal blade permanently attached to a wood handle with a comfortable grip. Such saws come in two types: crosscut and rip.   As its name implies, the crosscut saw is for cutting across the wood grain. It has 6 to 10 teeth per inch. Those with fewer teeth make coarser, rougher cuts, but they cut faster. Those with more teeth make finer, smoother - and slower - cuts. Generally, a saw with about 8 teeth per inch is good for most do-it-yourselfers.   Ripsaws are for ripping - cutting parallel to the grain. The teeth are shaped differently and are usually only 5 or 5 1/2 to the inch. Few homeowners need one, because a crosscut saw can be used for occasional ripping","excerpt":"however, in long cuts with the grain, a crosscut is slower and leaves a more ragged edge than a rip saw.

Ideally, we would agree that our understanding of a photograph is inescapably shaped by all three","excerpt":"however, in the realm of art (at least as it is presently constituted) it seems important that the third term be emphasized: the photographer, not the camera or the subject, has dominion over the pleasure we take in photographs. If it were otherwise, according to this view, photography's status as an art would be suspect.   This perhaps explains why it recently has become fashionable in photography criticism to speak as if the photographer were a painter, freely choosing his or her forms and tones and their arrangement from an infinite universe of the imagination. Thus we hear work praised on the basis of its creator's ''lenticular drawing,'' and much discussion of the ''formal strategies'' employed in work that otherwise might be considered inconsequential or tiresome. The hermetic critical vocabulary of formalist art criticism is being dusted off and applied to the medium. Thus Janet Kardon, writing in the catalogue to an exhibition called ''Photography: A Sense of Order,'' which she organized at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia (through Jan. 27), speaks of ''certain shared conventions'' in contemporary photography:   ''One common photographic stance is frontal - aligning the lens of the camera parallel to the subject.

It also forgets to point out that the original tunnel plan was suggested in 1955 when the mission was to \\"fight nature.\\"   The review of the buyout alternative, beginning with the acquisition of 774 houses in the floodway, is always much exaggerated by various members of Congress, who have never examined our proposal in detail (despite countless requests to do so) and only take the interpretation of the corps as the final word.   The state's last attempt at a buyout was a success. With only $5 million available, 58 houses were purchased. A substantial backlog of applications to have property acquired exists today. Furthermore, it must be recognized that other states, like Maryland, have successfully carried out buyout programs, getting people out of the flood path and providing services to help them with the move.   It should be noted that the corps has spent somewhere in the neighborhood of $17 million in developing and presenting the tunnel plan over a period of 12 years. In 1989-90, it received $3.5 million more, and now Congress is giving it $5.5 million to continue. While certain members of Congress proudly say that this money is coming back to New Jersey, one must remember that it is our tax money being spent.   Never during the 15-year period has the corps responded in a positive fashion to the concerns for the environment. No wetlands mitigation plan exists, nor can one be ethically completed. Currently, the corps says 758 acres of wetlands will be destroyed. On a 2-to-1 replacement basis, Government regulations would call for the creation of 1,516 acres of wetlands. Where in northern New Jersey is this going to take place?   Considering the mega-environment damages and the mega-bucks to be spent, no guarantees have been presented by the corps that the tunnel will do the job. No backup program exists in case of a malfunction. This project is an experiment, and anyone who believes it will cost only $1.2 billion has been living on Mars.

Or safety, another big issue. Why is crime, which often establishes the boundaries separating the elite from the rest of the world, so rampant? Could it be a function of a justice system that paroles criminals too early, or that our country has no substantial gun-control laws? What about the decline of productivity, which steals real wage growth from the middle class?    These are the problems we face. Their causes have little to do with the proliferation of health clubs and home fax machines. We must solve the structural flaws in our system.

Pastor Emeritus First Presbyterian Church, Jamaica, New York. Raymond H. Swartzback, 79, an urban pastor who was a champion for social justice and was active in the struggle for civil rights died December 14, 2002, after a brief illness. He was a man who loved Jesus, ''the man'', and genuinely loved people, preaching, and listening to other people's stories. Ray set about to make friends of his neighbors. In this he was aided and abetted by a rare and genuine ability to practice Christian love. ''When God says, 'love thy neighbor,' he means for us to love him no matter who or what he is. The whole Christian message becomes irrelevant unless we put into action these beliefs, we say with our lips.'' Ray was one of the first leaders of Urban Ministry. In 1975 he accepted a call to the First Presbyterian Church, Jamaica, Queens, the oldest continuously worshiping Presbyterian congregation in the country. Prior to 1975 the membership of this church was 1500, but ''white flight'' had reduced the membership to 89 people. There was talk of Relocation, Abandonment, Sell-Out","excerpt":"however, that small band of members said, ''We will not be moved,'' and they opened their doors to the new immigrants who were moving into Jamaica, Queens. Today First Church Jamaica has a membership of over 800 from 33 birth nations. At the 333'rd Anniversary and Sanctuary Rededication in 1996 Ray counseled the congregation , ''Do not adopt a Sanctuary mentality. Do not allow this beautiful Sanctuary to become a place to play church, a soul gymnasium to practice spiritual exercises, but let it be a fueling station for involvement in the world out there.'' Mr. Swartzback was born in Baltimore, MD to John and Florence Swartzback. He graduated from City College, Baltimore, Maryville College, Maryville, TN, and McCormick Theological Seminary, Chicago, IL. Upon graduation from seminary in 1950 he was drawn to the churches of the inner-city. His first parish was a two-point mission field in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1956 he went to Calvary Presbyterian Church, Detroit, MI, a struggling congregation in a changing neighborhood. Here he trained eleven seminary graduate interns for work in urban ministry. Later he copastored Glenville Presbyterian Church in Cleveland, OH before going to Jamaica. During the Viet-Nam War years, he accepted a call to Westminster Presbyterian Church on the College of Wooster campus, where he extended his ministry to counseling students during those turbulent years. During WW II Ray served in Europe from 1942 to 1945 as a platoon leader of the 30th Division, 117 Infantry, where he received a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. Ray received honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees from Alma College, Alma MI, and The College of Wooster, Wooster, OH. He taught New Testament Literature at the University of Cincinnati, and for eleven years was a lecturer at the Presbyterian Institute on Industrial Relations at McCormick Seminary in Chicago. He has been identified with many ministerial, labor, and civic organizations. He is survived by his devoted wife Jane Hays Swartzback of 55 years, and three daughters Linda Pratt (Jeff) of Millersburg, OH; Carol Kirk (John) of New Marshfield; and Susan Quinones of Athens, and nine grandchildren. A scholarship fund in his name has been established at McCormick Theological Seminary, 555 S. Woodlawn, Chicago IL. The Celebration of his life will be held on January 11 at 4:00 p.m. at the First Presbyterian Church in Athens, Ohio. The Session and congregation of First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica thanks this fearless leader for his outstanding service to the church of Jesus Christ.

Having been intimately involved in the negotiations with E.P.A.  and Indiana health officials, I can state unequivocally that no ''deal'' or ''sellout'' was involved. As the prime contractor and participant in the negotiations for the cleanup of the Seymour site, let me offer a few facts:   * This project was indeed a candidate site for Superfund","excerpt":"however, the law required that the state put up matching funds. In the case of Seymour, the state would have to put up 50 percent (which it could not do) because the site is on municipally owned land.  Therefore, without the efforts of the 24 generators and the settlement with E.P.A., the site would remain a derelict for years, continuing to add to its already polluted environment. AN E.P.A.

Because state voters turned down a paid holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., conventions are being canceled, and the National Football League threatens to pull the 1993 Super Bowl from the Phoenix area.   Unfortunately many critics are ignorant of the facts:   * Tempe, where the Super Bowl would be played, Phoenix and nearby Scottsdale voted for the holiday. It was defeated largely by retired people living 200 miles away, along the Colorado River who voted against the holiday by 2 to 1.    In addition, Navajo County, with a large Indian population and Yuma County, along the Mexican border, with a large Hispanic population voted heavily against the proposition. We have a very small black population, and it would appear that other larger minorities voted negatively.   * A few days before the election, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue of the N.F.L. was quoted on national television threatening to pull the Super Bowl if the holiday was defeated. Exit polls showed that many people were angry at this meddling in Arizona politics and changed their votes.   * There were two Dr. King holiday propositions on the ballot, which confused voters. One would have eliminated Columbus Day as a paid holiday. And this antagonized Italian-American voters.   * Many people opposed the holiday because they did not want to add another paid holiday for government workers.   * A poll conducted by the Behavior Research Center after the election indicated that only 6 percent of the voters rejected the holiday on racist grounds.   The 1991 Super Bowl will be held in New Orleans, where the state has a King holiday proclaimed annually by the governor. Miami, Los Angeles and other sites of Super Bowl games have had serious race riots, but there have been no race riots in the Phoenix area.   Is Arizona racist? If we are, the degree probably is far less than in most metropolitan areas.   Finally, an alternative has been proposed that makes more sense. If approved, the state would have a civil rights day honoring all civil rights leaders and requiring all schools to devote the day to teaching about civil rights.

To find and photograph white wolves on the open green tundra of Ellesmere Island in the Arctic is one thing, but to do the same with dark wolves in the dark forests of northern Minnesota is quite another. Furthermore, the wolves of Ellesmere were unfamiliar with people and hence were not as wary as are timber wolves everywhere, which are persecuted and avoid us. Because of the elusiveness of his subjects, Mr. Brandenburg did some photography in a facility where the animals are studied. But wolves are no less wolfish in captivity, and the shots of them, along with the photographs of wild wolves, of the landscape and of other animals, make \\"Brother Wolf\\" a spectacular success.
