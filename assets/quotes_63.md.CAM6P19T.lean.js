The Roundtable packs a heavy wallop in Washington, largely because the company officers get directly involved in talking to legislators, labor leaders, bureaucrats and politicians, including the President.   Most recently the Roundtable played an influential role, Mr.  Mettler says, in helping to work out the compromise among Mr. Reagan, House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. and members of the Presidential commission on Social Security reform - a compromise that the Roundtable now intends to help lobby through Congress. Mr. Mettler says the compromise to shore up Social Security's finances for the next seven years was ''not exactly what we wanted, especially for the long run, but a reasonable first step forward.''   Mr. Mettler, who holds a doctorate in electrical and aeronautical engineering from the California Institute of Technology, is also chairman of the board at TRW Inc., which produces car and truck components, electronic and space systems, petroleum drilling and production equipment, fasteners, tools, bearings and other industrial products.

Force, on the Ground, Says Its Hands Are Tied  The United Nations Security Council resolution was seen at the time as the best way to halt the war between Israel and Hezbollah, but the resolution's language leaves open the question of what kind of policing power would be given to the international forces.  A1    Iran's Right Seeks More Power  Political jockeying by fundamentalist clerics in Iran for the coming election of the Assembly of Experts, the group charged with overseeing the country's supreme leader, is raising concerns that the government will move further toward authoritarianism.  A12    Iraqis Agree to Autonomy Talks  Iraqi political leaders agreed to start debate on a bill that has been at the heart of one of the most critical and divisive issues in Iraq: Whether Shiites in the south will be able to form semi-independent regions, as Iraqi Kurds have done in the north, that would control their own security as well as billions of barrels of oil. A4    Weighing In on Report  Democratic lawmakers, responding to an intelligence report that found that the Iraq war has worsened the global terrorist threat, said the assessment demonstrates that the Bush administration needs to devise a new strategy for the war. Republican Congressional leaders did not dispute the accuracy of the reports, although they continued to defend the American presence in Iraq.  A10    More Details on Torture Case  A report by a commission in Canada offers new insight into American actions in the deportation of Maher Arar. It describes the evidence behind the decision to send him to Syria, an attempt by American officials to deceive Canada about where he was, and confusion among top American officials about the two countries' roles in the case. A10    Brazilian Ahead Despite Trials  President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's support and legitimacy were sapped by the biggest corruption scandal in the country's modern history. But victory in the election seems probable anyway. A8    Thailand Bans Book on King  A detailing new and comprehensive history of the modern Thai royalty, written by an American journalist has been banned in Thailand. The book argues that in his 60-year reign King Bhumibol Adulyadej has generally exercised a preference for order over democracy. A3    Chinese Official Detained    The powerful party boss of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, has been detained for corruption, the Chinese state media confirmed. The action is considered part of an expanding crackdown by President Hu Jintao on graft that has focused on his political opponents. As Shanghai party boss, Mr. Chen enjoyed considerable leeway to run China's wealthiest urban region and his machine is considered one of the most corrupt.  A10    NATIONAL A14-23    G.O.P. Brawn Put to Test In Pennsylvania Race  As the midterm campaign enters its final stretch, Republican fortifications will be tested around the country but arguably nowhere as much as in Pennsylvania. Senator Rick Santorum has lagged behind State Treasurer Bob Casey in opinion polls, at times by double digits. His seat has become the Democrats' best hope for one of the six seats they need to regain a Senate majority.  A1    Christian Right Weighs Tactics  Openly anxious about grass roots disaffection from the Republican Party, conservative Christian organizers are reaching for causes to turn out voters this November, including raising the novel argument that recognizing same-sex marriage could also limit religious freedom.  A16    Strains of War Show on Unit  The pressures that the conflict in Iraq is putting on the Army are apparent in southeast Georgia, where the Third Infantry Division is preparing to go back to Iraq for a third tour.   A1    Congress Leaves Much Undone  Procrastination, power struggles and partisanship have left Congress with substantial work to finish before breaking for the elections. The fast-approaching recess and Republican focus on national security legislation makes it likely that much that remains will fall by the wayside.  A20    Medicare Under Scrutiny  Government records and interviews with federal officials show that Medicare's mistaken refund of 230,000 premiums was only the latest example of an often dysfunctional relationship between Social Security and Medicare.   A14    Industry Fears Cost of E. Coli  The halt in the spinach harvest ripples through all kinds of businesses and trades, from pickers left without work to packers left without product to restaurateurs left without ingredients.  A14    Fate of a Monorail in Doubt  Before the breakdowns and the budget problems it was a fantasy made real. But now the Seattle monorail, which opened in 1962 for the World's Fair, mostly sits, waiting for repair, and affirmation.   A23    NEW YORK/REGION B1-6    In Tiny New York Courts, Abuses of Law and Power  A yearlong examination of New York's justice courts has found overwhelming evidence that people have often been denied fundamental legal rights, defendants have been jailed illegally and others have been subjected to racial and sexual bigotry so explicit it seems to come from some other place and time.  A1    Needle Exchange Rethought  New Jersey lawmakers may well pass a bill soon to that would allow pilot needle exchange programs in the state.  B1    Abuse Cited at Two Centers  A 134-page report released by Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union on two juvenile facilities for girls in upstate New York concludes that the teenage girls are being abused, neglected and subjected to sexual harassment and assault.

It is no secret that America's favorite ballet troupe from London went into something of an acknowledged decline since its last local appearance in 1983.

Like Massenet's opera \\"Manon\\" and Puccini's opera \\"Manon Lescaut,\\" the ballet is inspired by \\"Manon Lescaut,\\" the short novel by the Abbe Antoine-Francois Prevost, which was first published in 1731 and remains a popular French classic.

London 430 628-2; two CD's.   TXT>   The great Brazilian Heitor Villa-Lobos was one of the most prolific composers of the 20th century; there seems to be no end to his literature for orchestra, let alone his many chamber and instrumental works. His music was better served on records in the LP era than it is now on CD; not one of the 12 symphonies (hardly his best work, it is true) is currently available. His frequently bizarre juxtapositions of lush romanticism and willful experimentation, shimmering with the raw, earthy glamour of Brazilian folk music, may be a bit too high in cholesterol for the Lite 90's.   Yet his was an eloquent and original voice. Among the most bewitching pieces he ever wrote are the piano concertos, composed at the end of his career, between 1945 and 1957. The legendary premiere recording of the Fifth Concerto, performed by Felicia Blumenthal and conducted by the composer, was reissued last year by EMI in a boxed set, \\"Villa-Lobos by Himself\\" (CDZF 67229). Otherwise the piano concertos have not been available for years.   Now London offers the five concertos, well performed with idiomatic flair by the Brazilian pianist Cristina Ortiz. Though each work was composed for a different pianist, Ms. Ortiz brings out an underlying unity. The Third and Fourth Concertos, for example, flicker between moods of darkness and light, nostalgia and joy, with a quicksilvery facility that seems to imply that these dichotomies are all aspects of a single, mysterious truth. A true Latin, Villa-Lobos was happy only when he was sad, and his lightest moments are shot through with melancholy.

The Canadian troupe, 53 years old this year, is not a starry sort of troupe, although it has an internationally known ballerina in Evelyn Hart. Instead, it concentrates on good classical dancing and a solid ballet repertory that seems to have broadened even further since John Meehan, an Australian danseur noble and former member of American Ballet Theater, took over directorship of the company in 1990.   The high point of the company's program on Saturday night at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College was not the showpieces by George Balanchine, Antony Tudor and Jiri Kylian, but a New York City premiere by Mark Godden, a soloist with the troupe and its resident choreographer. At first glance, Mr. Godden's \\"Symphony No. 1\\" and its score by the Canadian composer Christopher Rouse looked like familiar stuff. Mr. Rouse's music has a dark and turbulent way with anxiety. The ballet's dark set and the long, sleek lines of the costumes have a European-modern look, and certainly Mr. Godden has been influenced by the choreography of Mr. Kylian, a proponent of that school, with whom Mr. Godden worked.
