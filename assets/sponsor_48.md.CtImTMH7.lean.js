WHERE -- Tybee Island, Ga.  WHAT -- 4-bedroom house       The kayaking options are endless here. I can paddle along the mouth of the Savannah River near Fort Pulaski and watch the containerships come in, or go over to Little Tybee Island and go through canals accessible only at high tide. My wife is an Army surgeon and works very long hours, so when she is in a kayak, she just likes to drift. I'll plan our trips to the tide so we will drift along the Back River on Tybee, and when the tide changes we'll float back home.     My first trip in a kayak was seven years ago in Key West on an eco-tour. I later bought two kayaks. A few years ago I decided to buy a kayak kit and build my own. Planks of plywood are joined by copper wire, and when it looks like a boat it's ready. Then you sand it and put fiberglass on the inside and outside of the kayak. One of my favorite trips is to an area between Tybee and Little Tybee that the locals call the triangle. It's the equivalent of skiing down four-foot moguls. Hurricanes have also passed near Tybee creating big swells. One day I was out on the water as a storm passed with a couple of guys, some younger than me including one ex-Navy diver. We surfed down the six- to eight-foot waves and had the time of our lives spitting sand. Of course there is a big difference between 42 years old and 30 years old, and I spent most of the next day drooling on the couch.
