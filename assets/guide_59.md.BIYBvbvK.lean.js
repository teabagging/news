There are enough empty city-owned housing units to house every homeless person in the city. Let us provide people with homes, instead of wasting money on military-style evictions.   When I was in South Africa last year, I saw much the same tactics used against squatters in Soweto and other townships. To close Tompkins Square Park and squatter camps without providing adequate homes for those who have none is immoral. The leadership of the city's churches has over and over asked Mayor David N. Dinkins and his predecessor, Edward I. Koch, to provide our homeless with real homes, instead of shelters, jail and forced evictions.   It is bad enough that city budget cuts favor the rich and slash social services and self-empowerment programs.

Some of the characters are called upon to be both myopic and dense when the occasion arises, and never a thought is given regarding their hearing. William Beaudine, however, has taken some simple gags and turned them into nice bits of fun.There may be more hilarious ideas than the depicting of a none-too bright elderly gentleman painting the flooring of his porch and discovering that he has yet to paint the spot in the centre from which he has been working. Uncle Joe Boyd eventually solves this difficulty in an ingenious fashion, which stirs up a hearty round of laughter. In the early stages of this painting work a dog escapes from his bath and wanders over the newly painted part of the porch, much to the annoyance of Uncle Joe. This also caused, considerable hilarity.This irresponsible yarn begins with a princess of some mythical part of Europe, being rather tired of her duties and longing for her native heath, Millerstown, Ohio. The news that she is to return to Millerstown is what causes Uncle Joe to paint the porch and other people to wash the dog and prepare for welcoming their one and only princess.It chances that Princes Delatorre known in Millerstown as Ellen Gutherie, arrives much sooner than she is expected. She is dressed in simple fashion and only Uncle Joe and Philip Lennox, a young inventor, recognize her. Aunt Katie Boyd, who is extremely short-sighted, thinks that the Princess is the family dressmaker, and then the village scandal-monger reports in detail the intimate conversations she has witnessed between the supposed seamstress and Uncle Joe.So the poor little Princess, incidentally impersonated by Mary Astor, decides to don her court costume and wig. Then she is heartily welcomed by those who do not recognize in her the same girl they imagined to be the seamstress. As for Uncle Joe, he is constantly reminding his wife and others of the good laugh he is going to have in half an hour.Lloyd Hughes figures as Philip Lennox, who, because his inventions do not meet with success, is forced to clean windows for a living. It is not surprising, therefore, that the humble Lennox wins favor in Princess Delatorre's eyes just before the last scene, although one has to take it for granted that they are going to live happily ever after.Lucien Littlefield does excellent work as Uncle Joe. Mr. Hughes is sympathetic and natural. Louise Fazenda gives a splendid character sketch as Aunt Katie Boyd.A feature of the surrounding program is the personal appearance of that veteran screen actor. Jackie Coogan, who, in a skit with his father, John Coogan, reminds his paternal relative that it is the first time that he has seen him work. Mr. Coogan jokes about Jackie bringing home the bacon, and they both seem so happy about it that the audience enjoyed the chatter. Jackie and his father wore silk hats, gray check trousers, white waistcoats and spats. Prior to their appearance on the stage several excerpts from Jackie's films were screened.Just before they went on for their act, Mr. Coogan explained that his sudden dancing activities had resulted in a \\"charley horse,\\" and he limped about his dressing room. Jackie, so his mother said, is overweight, tipping the scales at ninetyone pounds, and a 300-pound performer confided to Mrs. Coogan that she could bring Jackie down to normay by depriving the boy of candy. This evidently did not meet with Jackie's approval, for he smoothed his glossy short hair and turned up his diminutive nose.Mr. Coogan showed his grit when, despite his game leg, he danced a few minutes during his sketch with Jackie. It is the first time that Père Coogan has been on the stage since Charlie Chaplin engaged Jackie for a part in \\"The Kid.\\" And now Jackie is on the shady side of 13.
