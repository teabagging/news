That level was raised to 18.5 million barrels a day, from the largely ignored 17.5 million, and the group reaffirmed its commitment to the $34-a-barrel base price. But without a system to enforce production, analysts were dubious about OPEC's ability to function as an effective bargaining force. (Page A1.) The inability of OPEC to reach an accord on production quotas will mean lower spot oil prices in the coming weeks, analysts said. (D6.)

The reduction, reflecting the world oil surplus, was the most substantial one by an oil producing nation since OPEC unified its oil price structure last October. The OPEC move was meant to help eliminate the surplus, but since then, because of recession and conservation, oil consumption by industrialized nations has continued to fall short of projections. Separately, Iran was reported planning a $1-a-barrel cut to increase sales of its crude oil. (Page A1.)   The 85-year-old rate for moving grain by rail in Canada will be raised if the Government gets its way. The rate, about one-fifth of the actual cost of shipments, has strong backing from western farmers, so Ottawa's Liberal administration is proceeding cautiously. (D2.)

Traders say heating oil and crude oil prices have dropped more than 5 percent on the spot market, after holding steady for several months. A similar trend is developing in gasoline prices. The decline puts pressure on OPEC nations to cut official contract prices, as some have begun to do through disguised discounts. (Page A1.)   Two of West Germany's largest steel concerns agreed to merge their steelmaking operations. The planned combination by Krupp Stahl and Estel-Hoesch would create Europe's second-largest steel company, with yearly sales of $5 billion. (D4.)

The new accord was seen as a victory for Algeria, which has long sought to raise gas prices to the level of world oil prices. The move caused fresh concern that Western Europe may become dependent on possibly unreliable energy sources. (Page A1.)

The program is intended to reduce consumer spending by $9 billion, or about 2 percent of France's annual output of all goods and services.

The drastic proposals follow this week's franc devaluation, the third since the Socialists came to power in May 1981. (Page 1.)   ''Long-term damage'' to American-Soviet trade has resulted from the curtailment of grain shipments imposed by the United States after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, a senior United States agricultural official said.

Peking blamed the American side for the impasse. Washington said it will impose quotas on the Chinese textiles unilaterally, retroactive to Jan.1, when the previous accord expired. American officials said the U.S. still expects to reach an accord, but has no choice now but to impose the quotas temporarily. (Page A1.)   Japan announced its third package of market-opening measures in less than a year. The new steps, welcomed by U.S. officials, are mainly aimed at curtailing such nontariff barriers as testing and certification procedures that tend to discourage importers. They contained little on the key issue of farm products, however. The announcement came just five days before Prime Minister Nakasone is scheduled to meet with President Reagan in Washington. (D1.)

Boeing 757's typically carry more than 200 passengers. Eos, an upstart premium carrier, showed off its seating configuration yesterday at the annual National Business Travel Association convention in San Diego. Passengers will have 21 square feet of personal space, including lie-flat beds. That's more per-person space than in any other business-class cabin, Mr. Spurlock said in an interview. Eos has pledged that its fares will be about 25 percent lower than the approximately $8,000 ''rack rate'' of major carriers with top-level business-class cabins, said Mr. Spurlock, a former top executive with British Airways.    STAND BY FOR HIGHER PRICES -- In 2006, domestic air fares should rise 4 percent to 6 percent over this year's","excerpt":"international fares are expected to go up 6 percent to 9 percent and worldwide hotel rates are likely to climb 7 percent to 10 percent, with the biggest increases in the Asia-Pacific area, in London and in Latin America. That's according to a new survey by World Travel BTI, the big corporate travel management company.    PLAYING CATCH-UP -- Long-haul fliers know that domestic airlines with international routes have lagged behind premier international carriers in the quality of their business-class cabins. Now, American Airlines, the operating unit of the AMR Corporation, intends to do something about the gap. American said yesterday that it would renovate business-class cabins on its Boeing 767-300's starting next year and on its Boeing 777's in 2007. The improvements, which include new lie-flat seats, new menus and improved in-flight entertainment systems, will make the airline ''highly competitive'' with foreign carriers offering luxury business cabins, the airline said. By the end of this year, American said, international flying will represent about 30 percent of its total seat capacity.    SAN FRANCISCO-SYDNEY NONSTOP -- Qantas says it will add three weekly San Francisco-to-Sydney flights to its international nonstop network in March. The service will be on Boeing-777-400ER aircraft with 14 seats in first class, 64 in business and 265 in coach. Flying time will be 14 hours and 35 minutes from San Francisco. Qantas made San Francisco one of its destinations when it first began flying to North America in 1954, then dropped it in 1994 and shifted its emphasis to Los Angeles, where it continues to have substantial operations. Meanwhile, Emirates said demand for service to Dubai is so strong that it will start a second daily nonstop from Kennedy International Airport on Nov. 7, flying A340-500 planes whose top-line feature is 12 fully enclosed first-class suites with sliding doors that can be closed for privacy.    DITCH THE BAGS -- For the next three months, you can ship your bags ahead free on Singapore Airlines on all outbound flights from Los Angeles International Airport. Passengers can opt to have their bags picked up at home and sent to their destination airport under an arrangement between Singapore and BaggageDirect, a luggage-shipping service. There is a two-bag, 70-pound limit, and a fee for pickup beyond 30 miles from Los Angeles International. Singapore says it will continue the service but charge a fee for it after the three-month introductory period.
