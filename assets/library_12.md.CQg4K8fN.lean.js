The exhibition is called ''Soundings'' and its subject is the role of sound in 20th-century art. It is about sound made, sound heard, sound remembered, sound assimilated, sound mimicked and sound commemorated. It is about known sound, unknown sound, putative sound and notional sound. Its points of reference go back to before World War I - to the acclimatization of random sound, for instance, by the Italian Futurists - and it also comes right up to date, with work made expressly for the show and the reconstruction of a complete scene from an opera by Meredith Monk that was first produced in 1980. The auxiliary programs include concerts, movies, mixed-media performances and sound workshops. ''Soundings'' is in effect an encyclopedia of the ways in which sound has affected the arts in the last three-quarters of a century.

Listeners can stop by for an act or two, or stay for the duration. There is no charge for admission and reservations are not necessary. The phone number for more information or to inquire about available seating is 358-3544. THE OLD STONES SPEAK   Five acres of burial grounds at St. Paul's Church, a national historic landmark in Mount Vernon, will be open for tours today and the last Sunday of each month through October at 2 P.M., free of charge.   The gravestones, dating from 1665 to the present, are carved in a variety of styles and stones, and the earliest ones are inscribed with the naive imagery of angels and celestial bodies typical of the period.   Hundreds of soldiers from the French and Indian War, the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812 and the Civil War are buried there, many in mass graves. David, Philip and Samuel Pell, founders of Pelham, and the artist Edward Gay are some of the more notable people interred.   The church is at 897 South Columbus Avenue, and a telephone call to 667-4116 will insure a tour reservation. TO AFRICA AND BACK   \\"If It Doesn't Break, It Won't Crack,\\" a new theater work by Theresa Folkes-Plair of New Rochelle, will be performed in Yonkers on Saturday at 2 P.M. in the auditorium of the Will Library, 1500 Central Park Avenue.   The 40-minute theatrical excursion to an African Village and back again defines the women of Africa in relation to the black women of America, and in microcosm, women everywhere. The piece weaves movement, music and narration together, in English and in Twi, the language of the Asante tribe of Ghana. Admission is free. Call 377-6441 or 337-1500 for more information. NEW TWIST ON OLD TALE   \\"The Trial of the Big Bad Wolf,\\" a musical comedy that twists the tale of Little Red Riding Hood, will be performed by the Theater Connection of Westchester Community College, at 75 Grasslands Road in Valhalla on the next two weekends.   B. B. Wolf (get it?) is charged with home wrecking, murder and sheep-hunting without a license, and for 60 minutes, interspersed with 10 musical numbers, he is subjected to a trial by the audience-turned-jury.   Appearing as witnesses for the prosecution are the snub-snouted Hamm Sisters Vocal Trio and Little Fred Riding Hood, a dapper rapper. Suitable for all ages, the show was directed by Pia Haas and choreographed by Molly Franzblau.   Performances are scheduled Saturday and Sunday at 7:30 P.M. through May 8, with Saturday matinees at 1 P.M. and Sunday matinees at 2 P.M. Tickets are $7, $5 for children through 12 and people 65 and older. Call 785-6567 for reservations or more information. For directions to the college call 785-6700. GOSPEL CONCERT   Dream Sounds, a series of Gospel and Spiritual concerts heard on Saturdays at noon over WVOX-Radio, will be presented in a live performance on Saturday at 8 P.M. at the Irvington Town Hall Theater.   The concert, incorporating jazz, blues, gospel and rhythm and blues into the program, will feature the 60-voice Westchester Interdenominational Fellowship Choir","excerpt":"Purpose, a nine-member vocal group from Manhattan; Michelle McKelvey, a classic gospel singer, accompanied by Tommy Moore, a pianist, and other soloists. The mistress of ceremonies will be Anni of the Dream Sounds radio show.   Tickets are $10 in advance, $15 at the door. Call 591-6602 or 948-6211 for reservations. The theater is at 85 Main Street. CAPITOL COMEDY   President Clinton, former President Bush and Pat Robertson have been entertained by the antics of the Capitol Steps, a troupe of current and former Congressional staffers who believe that they can be comedians just as effectively as movie actors can be presidents.   The group will perform on Thursday at 8 P.M. at the Mid-Westchester Y.M.-Y.W.H.A.'s annual benefit dinner. The event will be held at the Pepsico Theater of the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College.    Ticket prices are $100 for the show and dessert or $175 for a pre-performance buffet dinner, show and dessert.  Call 472-3300 for reservations or more information. CANINE WALKATHON   Next Sunday the S.P.C.A. of Westchester will hold a Walkathon for dogs and their owners. Anyone of any age can enter so long as a dog or two is in tow. Registration begins at 10:30 A.M., rain or shine, at Rockwood Hall Park in North Tarrytown, followed by an aerobic warmup for people and pets before the hike begins at 11:30.   Spring water and snacks for humans and animals will be provided along the two-and-a-half-mile route, which may be circled once or several times or merely strolled for a couple of dozen yards before heading home.  The pre-pledged donations of cash from friends, relatives and neighbors, which walkathoners must deliver at registration time, will help operate animal-welfare programs of the S.P.C.A. There is a travel prize for the person who collects the most money.   The park is part of the Rockefeller State Preserve, at the junction of Routes 117 and 9. To pre-register or get more information, call 763-9012.

One weekend morning, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the demands of home ownership, I found myself in the local hardware store buying supplies for the latest repair project. A harried-looking fellow entered the store and quickly approached the register.   \\"Do you rent carpet shampooing machines?\\" he asked.   \\"We do,\\" the clerk said, \\"but they're all out.\\"   \\"Thank God,\\" the man responded with relief.   I wasn't so lucky. --    ALAN STERN                      . . .           Dear Diary:     I have my feet in the wading pool at the West 93d Street playground on an extra-hot afternoon, baby-sitting my niece's children, 3 and 5, and watching what kids do with the hand-span, toe-deep stream that cuts across the playground and cascades down the three tiers of the miniature amphitheater that is the wading pool:   Float your Zabar's peanut-butter container down the stream with a leaf for a passenger till it tumbles down the waterfall. Walk down the stream one foot before the other, arms out like a high-wire artist. Scoop up water and join the permanent water fight. Gingerly lower your body to barely clear the waterfall","excerpt":"put just your tongue in the cold, rushing water. Lie down in the waterfall. Block the stream at the top of the waterfall with your plump bottom, then stand to let a brief Niagara leap from between your legs.   Throw sand in the waterfall. Throw sand on the drain to see if you can clog it. Patch the drain with leaves. Put a plastic bag over the drain. Take high splashy steps around the deepening water of the moat (there's an island in the middle of the wading pool). Daringly jump across the moat. Be happily terrified when your watcher swings you back and forth so that your feet send up sheer sheets of water and arching strings of diamond droplets. Pull out the plastic-bag plug and wonder at the whirlpool. Try to make it whirl the other way.   Run away when Aunt Barbara says it's time to go. Get caught. Walk home in your wet bathing suit.   When Mommy comes back and says: \\"Did you have fun in the playground? Was the water on?\\" just say, \\"Yes.\\" Hug her leg. Ask for a bagel with your spaghetti. --    BARBARA MICHALAK                      . . .         The place is the lounge of the American Hotel in Sag Harbor, L.I., where Janet Jacobs and her husband, Ted Fine, are waiting for a table. Enter three well-dressed 30-something women. They look around for a while. One speaks.   \\"I ate here once in the 80's,\\" she says. With that the trio exits.                    . . .           Dear Diary:     Whenever I'm traveling on business, I make a point of calling my answering machine in New York every afternoon for my messages. The machine records what callers have to say for as long as they keep talking or until the tape runs out.   On this particular day I had a message from my neighbor Tony, who called from his speaker phone. \\"Just wanted to see if you were around for dinner or a movie,\\" he said. Then I heard a slight click as he reached to turn off his speaker -- and missed.   So it was that from my hotel room in Cleveland I listened to a half hour of Tony puttering around his kitchen, Tony singing snatches of Gilbert and Sullivan, Tony washing dishes. I kept waiting for him to notice his error and hang up so I could hear the rest of my messages. No such luck. After the third rendition of a \\"Pirates of Penzance\\" patter song the tape was used up and the line went dead. Not only would no one be able to leave a message for the rest of my trip but there would be a hefty long-distance charge on my next bill.   Tony doesn't own an answering machine so I can't get revenge. But I am considering getting him a singing coach. --    BRUCE E. HALL                      . . .       THE FRESHMAN   Having moved quarts of clothes  and stereos inside your pint-sized room  we finally start to say our  ivy-covered bittersweet so longs.  And all the while I promise not  to be surrounded by my maudlin memories:  No thoughts of pig-tailed 4-year-olds  on Daddy-driven seesaws  or love-struck moody adolescents  on endless cordless phone calls.  Instead I am circled by future fantasies  of wide-eyed college kids swept up  in Western Civ and English Comp  or tame gentle frat parties with  light beer and late night laughter.  And suddenly released from my ruminations  we all squeeze these moments until you  disappear into the freshman dorm  kissing us and yesterday goodbye and  hugging newborn notions of bold tomorrows. -- ROGER GRANET                      . . .

Shopper:    I'll take half a pound, please.                    . . .           Dear Diary:     Strolling beneath an oak tree on Austin Street in Forest Hills, Queens, the other day, I was conked on the head by a falling acorn. At the time I was more amused than annoyed. Later I bgan to wonder how many other innocent pedestrians had also been so thumped. Was it a common occurrence? How many people were struck, say, on a given day? Were there statistics on such a phenomenon?   Early the next morning I returned to the scene. I counted the number of passers-by. I kept score of dropping acorns. Seventeen fell within 30 minutes. Three found their marks. The victims all had the same reaction. At first they appeared dazed by the surprise attack. Then, standing 'neath the row of trees, they gazed up to the sky. No one cursed. No one gestured angrily. No one sneered.   Rather, each seemed strangely pleased, beguiled that Mother Nature had chosen them for a thumping. It was as if the acorn, when it conked them on the bean, had imparted a touch of wisdom along with a dose of good cheer. As far as I could tell not one of the thumped exhibited a loss of faith or disillusionment in city life.   That's rather amazing, don't you think? --    ERNEST SLYMAN    Metropolitan Diary"},{"year":"1963","title":"western livestock ranchers put protection of grazing privileges above issue of fee rise, Cong hearings RANCHERS WANT GRAZING ACREAGE","excerpt":"Put Land Privileges Above Issue of Fee Rise"},{"year":"1921","title":"LONDON, Feb. 26.--The Allies took up today the future of Armenia and Kurdistan, and particularly the relation of the settlement for that region laid down in the Treaty of Sevres to actually existing conditions.

Nine other witnesses who appeared before the committee in the daylong hearing sought to focus attention on lethal weapons and the trade in illegal firearms in the city. The Op-Ed page has asked six specialists for their suggestions for coping with the flood of guns on the streets. \\n\\nIn 1990, New York City experienced a record high of more than 2,200 homicides. It is estimated that close to 70 percent of these crimes involved unlicensed firearms.\\n\\nNew York's gun control law is among the strongest, with stiff fines and mandatory jail sentences. Yet 16,214 illegal guns were confiscated by New York police in 1989. It is proof that so long as weapons, including Mac-10's, -11's and Uzis, are legally and effortlessly obtainable in less regulated states, our efforts to control the flow of guns will fail.\\n\\nThe citizens of New York must steadily and loudly beat the drum for more effective gun control at the Federal level. Tom Foley, Speaker of the House of Representatives, must allow the full Congress to vote on the Brady Bill. By establishing a national seven-day waiting period for the purchase of handguns, that bill will enable the police to conduct background checks of customers that would in turn regulate ownership of these weapons.\\n\\nNational legislation banning the manufacture and sale of semiautomatic and automatic weapons, with the exception of use by the military and police, is urgently needed.\\n\\nStrict liabilities must be imposed on manufacturers and distributors of semiautomatic and automatic weapons for injuries caused by these so-called sporting instruments.\\n\\nSome areas in the Persian Gulf today are safer for Americans than some parts of New York City.
