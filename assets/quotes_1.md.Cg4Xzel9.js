Miss Dressler, who has never failed to give an excellent account of herself on the screen, is particularly clever as Hattie Burns, an out-spoken widow, who, following a tirade against a Mayor seeking renomination, unexpectedly finds herself the unanimous choice of the feminine voters for the chief municipal office. The women, however, do not enjoy plain sailing, for the men break up one of their mass meetings, and those women who are not intimidated by their husbands eventually are driven home by a deluge of rain.Miss Moran fills the rôle of Ivy Higgins, who has a stuttering spouse. Mrs. Higgins happens to have political aspirations and when the women are about to nominate Hattie for the office of Mayor, Ivy, until her friend's name is mentioned, believes that the demonstration is in her favor.There is a dash of gangster activities in the course of this narrative, partly to reveal that the Mayor is a pawn of the chief malefactor and partly to hamper Hattie's political campaign. It develops that Benny, a misguided young man with whom Hattie's daughter, Myrtie, is in love, has been hiding from the police in the Burns garret. Subsequently he is cleared of a killing and as his testimony helps the police he goes to the altar with Myrtle on his arm and enjoys the satisfaction of knowing that he has a Mayor for a mother-in-law and that she has driven the desperado, Curango, out of Lake City.The incidents in this production that are most amusing are those in which the wives go on strike, forcing their husbands to look after all household duties. At one period Mr. Higgins passes the night in the barn and other obstinate males are much impressed by the variety of work the position of housewife entails. Quite a number of the scenes are farcical and occasionally rather raw, but they nevertheless elicited the desired laughter from the spectators.Like \\"Min and Bill,\\" in which it will be remembered Miss Dressler gave a talented portrayal, this current offering is probably another that will fill the coffers of the box offices. And although Miss Dressler is called upon to furnish a good deal of low comedy, there are moments in which she takes full advantage of any shining opportunity. This only awakens the hope that some day the producers will see fit to cast Miss Dressler in a pictorial narrative which will give full scope for her exceptional ability.Miss Moran makes the most of her part. Rosco Ates is funny as the stuttering Peter Higgins. Karen Morley is attractive as Myrtle and John Miljan handles the rôle of the scoundrel, Curango, with the necessary sangfroid. Tom McGuire also helps matters by his impersonation of the crooked Mayor. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Mayor Marie Dressler. Mrs. Murphy's Cherry Pies. The Genteel Criminal. A Woman Pays.
