Grimly checking on all three, apparently out of pure meanness, is a chambermaid who smacks her lips over the bleak finale.The whole thing, needless to say, hinges on sex.At least the French have made no bones about the baldness of the set-up. The scenario is credited to Charles Brabant, who also directed","excerpt":"J. Marcerou and A. Tabet. Most of the action takes place in the sleazy little boardinghouse, with Charles Vanel, Magali Noel, Raf Vallone and Betty Schneider creeping about the premises.In the background, oil field pumps drone away. The photography is lean and suspenseful and the dialogue (with some skittish translations), is held to the minimum. Most of this Ellis Films release unfolds in pantomime.Maybe it is just as well, considering some of the subtitles. At one point, somebody phones the police station. The English reads: \\"Pass me the Chief Inspector.\\" With or without gravy?This drama is also about a good third too long. Even so, the four principals do pretty well when extended close-ups put them on the spot.As the dangerous old roué, M. Vanel comes off best. Mlle. Noel, who resembles Sophia Loren, is appropriately torrid, and M. Vallone is broodingly virile. As the servant, Mlle. Schneider sports a dead-pan countenance throughout.

How much comedy the producer of the film intended to put into it is a matter for speculation. There's timid evidence that some of the scenes are really meant to be serious. But don't let that bother you. They are not. They are all funny.The story begins with a volcano and continues volcanic. It starts with a solitary girl on an island in the South Seas. That's the virgin paradise. If the presence of lions that love to stand statuesquely on rocky cliffs is more suggestive of a seaside zoo than of Polynesia, don't worry about it. What's geography among movie folk? Just accept this versatile island and the female Tarzan who inhabits it. She's really a lovely lady among lions. Her father and mother are killed by cannibals who think them responsible for the bad disposition of the volcano, and she is reared by a faithful old nurse who dies before she has time to teach her to wear clothes.So Gratia is there on the island with her lions and her monkeys and all of the other animals. But she is the heir to a fortune, and so they go looking for her, they being the secretary of the man who left the fortune and a crew that includes Bob Alan, broken sport, and Slim, ex-crook, now thoroughly reformed. They find Gratia and take her back to civilization. And of course there's a villian. He's the secretary, Bernard Holt, and be decides he will marry the girl for her money.Now, apparently this Holt has met only orthodox movie heroines before, the kind who like the cave-man stuff. At all' events he doesn't know Gratia. He foolishly puts himself alone in a room with her. That's what movie villains usually do. So it's all orthodox enough up to this point. But no further. Right away the heroine goes over and locks the door. The villain always does that, but not this time. Then Gratia attacks the man. And it's he, not she, who tries to get out and finds the door locked. Isn't that refreshing.\\" And the light! At first Holt thinks his only job is to hold Gratia down and take the key away from her, but after the girl has literally mopped up the floor with him, he has no such idea. He learns about women from her, and the knowledge convinces him that he'd better let the hero have the girl after all. So the picture ends conventionally. But its heresies are delightful.Pearl White is the wild woman. She makes the part realistic, with comic touches. This part of the comedy is intentional and good. Miss White does her own scampering on the island and her own fighting in New York. She really is enjoyoble.The other characters are more or less negative—Robert Elliott as Bob Alan, the hero","excerpt":"J. Thornton Baston as Slim, his pal, and Alan Edwards as Holt, the villin. The story was written by Hiram Maxim and directed by J. Searle Dawley. In some of his scenes Mr. Dawley has done excellent work. Others seem a bit carelessly made, but, as the film soon puts the spectator in a gay mood in which he simply refuses to take anything seriously, even this does not matter. It's altogether a mad, mad movie. THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1943","title":"King, J Travis Obituary 2 -- No Title","excerpt":"J.

Whatever may be said of its time-worn plot, its melodramatic lines and the sudden change of heart of those who are at first eager to string up that more or less gentlemanly highwayman, Dick Johnson, this production can at least boast of the presence of Ann Harding, who appears in the rôle created on the stage by Blanche Bates.In the play, Robert Hilliard was Johnson, and Frank Keenan acted Sheriff Jack Rance. In the silent picture, which was released in 1923, Sylvia Breamer, was the Girl, who in the dialogue production, has been given the name of Minnie","excerpt":"J. Warren Kerrigan officiated as Johnson and Russell Simpson as Rance. In this current contribution Rance is impersonated by Harry Bannister and Johnson is portrayed by James Rennie.Even though Miss Harding's performance is highly praiseworthy, the picture itself leaves a great deal to be desired. In THE NEW YORK TIMES review of the play, which was presented on Nov. 14, 1905, it was written that one could hear a pin drop while the Girl and the Sheriff were playing the poker hands, the stakes for which were the Girl and Johnson's freedom. This talking film, however, did not have the advantage of Mr. Belasco's brilliant direction and therefore the card game between Jack Rance and Minnie is not especially stirring.During the unfurling of this film one becomes curious as to how some of the high spots will be pictured. One waits for the moment when Johnson's blood drips from the rafters on the Sheriff's hand and one wonders how the inevitable happy ending is going to be accomplished. Some of the sequences are passable, but not a few of the lines are a trifle too ingenuous.Minnie totes a gun and knows no fear. She is respected by all the men in the community and it is emphasized that she has never been kissed. The privilege of the first kiss falls to Johnson and Minnie rages in her abode when she is given to understand that Johnson rather favors a Mexican girl in another town.In those days of 1850 a man who did not drink his whisky straight was supposed to be in need of having his hair curled. And when Minnie pours out a drink, it is a generous dose. There are faint suggestions here and there of Bret Harte, but that writer would never have permitted any stupid happy ending to mar his work. Here, one is prepared to see Johnson shoot himself after he has been permitted to have a few words with Minnie. The posse who a few moments before were only too eager to look at Johnson swinging from the limb of a tree, decide that the love of the outlaw and Minnie is sufficient reason to permit Johnson to live.Harry Bannister does well enough with the rôle of Rance and James Rennie is acceptable as Dick Johnson. John Francis Dillion's direction is more than slightly hurried in scenes when he ought to have taken his time. It is, however, a good deal better version of the old play than was the silent film and any picture with Miss Harding is worthy of attention.

Forty-three years later, they still recall with a clarity usually reserved for wedding days and the births of first children exactly where they were the moment news of the attack reached them. In that instant, the Depression seemed to end, taking with it their innocence, propelling them suddenly beyond the warm kitchens and familiar streets of youth into a dangerous and unfamiliar world. \\n\\n When, years later, they told their children of that moment, we listened as to bedtime stories, unable to identify with events that took place before our birth. As far as I was concerned, life began in 1952. Everything before was ancient history.\\n\\nWhen my generation suffered its own brutal awakening in 1963 I began to understand how a moment could become so crystalized in memory. Like our parents, we remember as if it were yesterday exactly what we were doing 21 years ago when word of the assassination of John F. Kennedy first reached us. I was sitting in a sixth-grade classroom studying math when our principal entered the room and motioned our teacher into the hall. When she returned, her red eyes shocked us into silence. ''President Kennedy has been shot,'' she announced. Then she hurried back into the hall, leaving us in stunned silence, too young to comprehend the full significance of the event, aware more through her tears than her words that something terrible had happened.

In the past it was known as \\"Service For Ladies,\\" but this present work bears the title of \\"Reserved For Ladies,\\" and Leslie Howard appears in the part played in the mute production by Adolphe Menjou. This current picture was made in England under the Paramount banner and it is even more amusing than its predecessor.It is an adaptation of a tale by Ernest Vajda, and Alexander Korda, the Hungarian producer of the American film, \\"Helen of Troy,\\" is responsible for its direction. It is indeed one of the outstanding British contributions, which reveals what can be done over there with American assistance. The supporting cast includes George Grossmith, Benita Hume and Elizabeth Allan.It is genuinely refreshing, intelligent fun, the dialogue being clever and the incidents neatly arranged. Mr. Howard plays Max, the efficient headwaiter of a London hotel, called the Grand Palace. In the voiceless picture the hotel was in Paris and the headwaiter boasted of the name of Albert. The various happenings are virtually the same as in the former work.Here there is Max falling in love at the first sight of Sylvia Robertson, a visitor to London with her father from South Africa. Max, it might be said, is an imperious headwaiter, with a gift of swift repartee. His looks are engaging and his manners beyond reproach. He does not wish the pretty Sylvia to know that he is a headwaiter and when she goes to the Austrian Tyrol he decides to follow her. There chances to come to the hotel in the Tyrol, a King, who in the old picture was styled the King of Lucania. This ruler recognizes Max, much to the latter's discomfort, but when Max informs the King that he, like the monarch, is traveling incognito, the royal personage respects the headwaiter's secret and even invites Max to his table.The result is that Sylvia, with whom Max has already found favor, suspects the young man of being a prince. In the old silent transcription there was the moment when the King was overheard saying to the head waiter that he the King, was only an obscure monarch, but Max or Albert was at the top of his profession. This line is omitted because Max is thought in this present film to be the heir to a throne.The time comes when Sylvia refers to the \\"unbridgeable social gap\\" between them, thinking of Max as a prince, and he, thinking of the truth, admits there is the social gap. The scenes in the Tyrol are not quite as well pictured as in the old feature, but the conversation is always witty.Eventually there comes the time when Max is compelled to return to his London hotel, and then Sylvia I discovers that her prince is only a head waiter—but such a head waiter! She drops a dish, expecting him to pick it up, but one of the alert waiters attends to this. He informs Sylvia at this dinner, for which she has specially requested Max to be in attendance so as to humiliate him, that the first duty of a head waiter is to remain perfectly calm no matter how excited the guest may become. Sylvia hazards that a waiter is supposed to behave like a servant in a country house and the quick-witted May corrects her by saying: \\"Like a doctor in a lunatic asylum.\\"Sylvia does not like the idea of Max wearing a white tie and he at once snatches a black ttie from a waiter and puts it on. Sylvia's guests are in sympathy with Max, but it is not long before he needs no sympathy, for the girl's father announces proudly that he started as a dishwasher and therefore there is no disgrace in his daughter falling in love with a head waiter, particularly a head waiter like Max.Mr. Howard's performance is splendid. Mr. Grossmith is capital as the philosophical monarch. Miss Allan is charming and vivacious as Sylvia. Benita Hume, a very pretty girl, makes the most of the part of a designing countess, who is infatuated with Max.This merry affair is prefaced by a stage entertainment, with such participants as Rubinoff, Dorothy Mackaill, the screen star","excerpt":"Jack Benny, Ledova, Neil Miller, Cliff Edwards and others.

It seems that there is a crook somewhere in the world who looks exactly like Jack, incredible as that may be, and it seems that this crook gets wind of his double's existence through a couple of other crooks who for some reason are dishwashers in the commissary department of this big engineering job, evidently a government project from the size of it, Boulder Dam, or something.To make a long story as short as possible, Jack gets framed by his twin, who not only looks, but talks, and even acts like Jack—that is to say, with a great deal of gentlemanly restraint and decency, seeing he's supposed to be a crook. But when Jack—the real Jack—is sent up for a twenty-year rap on the big payroll-robbery charge, he escapes and by a fortunate concurrence of circumstances ultimately is allowed to cooperate with the G-Men and bring his framers to earth, including the perfidious Patricia Ellis. And when you see Jack quietly retake his place at the engineers' table on the big government project, you feel a new respect for the Department of the Interior, which can forgive and forget a resemblance as striking as that between Jack, the engineer, and Jack, the public enemy. It still haunts us.All in all, \\"Fugitive At Large\\" should be remembered as a hard picture to beat in its special field of muscular melodrama. Give a man a horse he can ride, a pipe he can smoke, and a baritone solo he can accomplish without departing too embarrassingly far from his vocal range. Or, failing all these, give him a Jack Holt picture, and he will probably be just as happy, and a lot safer, really.At the 48th Street TheatrePlayed with great sincerity by a first-rate cast and provided with an entirely convincing rural setting, \\"Livet paa Hegnsgaard\\" (Life on the Hegn Farm), the Danish film now at the Forty-eighth Street Theatre, presents an attractive picture of country life in the little kingdom famed for its dairy products, its bacon and its cooperative enterprises.Of course, there are a couple of disagreeable characters in this simple tale of the love of the daughter (Karin Neelemose) of the surly farm owner (Holger Reenberg) for the sturdy young hired man (Karl Heger), but on the whole the people are honest and likable. Axel Frische is especially good as a sort of beloved vagabond working hard for the happy end.Arne Weel, director of this Scandinavian Talking Picture release, sandwiched several nice little songs and some gay dancing between the more serious parts of the film with excellent results.At the Teatro LatinoNobody can dispute the correctness of \\"Bodas de Sangre\\" (Bloody Wedding) as the name for the interesting Argentine film, based on a poem by Federico Garcia Lorca, the talented young Spanish author murdered in Granada by the rebels in August, 1936, on view at the Teatro Latino.The veteran Catalan actress, Margarita Xirgu, has every reason to curse existence of knives when her fine son (Alberto Contreras) and his villainous married rival (Pedro Lopez Lagar) kill each other, following the abduction of the former's vacillating bride (Amelia de la Torre) during the wedding festivities. Right at the beginning of the action she lost her husband and her oldest son in clashes over irrigation ditches.Done in somber colors and smoothly directed by Edmundo Guibourg for the C. I. F. A. concern, this is a grim sketch of life in those parts of Spain where water is scarce and passions run high. Some relief is furnished by pictureque dance numbers. Miss Xirgu's work is impressive, as is that of her associates.At the Miami TheatreThe season of Greek talkies has been opened at the Miami Theatre with \\"Otan o Syzygos Taxeideyei\\"(When the Husband Travels), a musical romance leaning heavily upon slapstick and farce, produced and directed by Toga Mizrahi in Alexandria, Egypt. Manos Philippides, popular with Greek-Americans in comedy roles, talks rather more than usual as a rich patent medicine maker leading a double life. Anna Kalouta and Marika Kalouta are satisfactory as his wife and sweetheart, respectively. Both are rather comely, but Anna is handicapped by a voice which must be labeled unlovely in any language.

When George Eastman introduced roll film and the box camera in which it was used in 1890 it was an immediate and resounding success and brought photography within the reach of the general public.   Now in 1982 the company founded by Mr. Eastman has introduced a new disk film and a camera to go along with it which promises to have the same impact on amateur photography as that first film and camera did, and also may eventually eliminate roll film as we know it today.   The new camera, which was introduced at a press preview on Feb. 3, is actually a highly sophisticated piece of electronic and optical equipment that is packed into a tiny case measuring 3x5x1 inches, and that weighs only 6 1/2 ounces complete. It is equipped with a highspeed f/2.8 four-element glass lens with universal focus, and comes with a built-in electronic flash. The film is advanced mechanically by a motorized advance which speeds the film through the camera almost as fast as the user can press the shutter release.
