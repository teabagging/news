A new museum of natural history and an adjacent nature walk has opened at the 63.5-acre nature preserve at Crane Point Hammock in Marathon. A three-person submarine capable of diving to 120 feet is available for rent at Conch Republic Divers (305-852-1655) at mile marker 90 in Tavernier.   At Little Torch Key at mile marker 28.5, near Big Pine Key, Captain Buddy's Family Trips (800-749-3868) has added a new glass-bottom boat that offers snorkeling excursions to the area's reefs and tours of the out islands. Snorkeling equipment and underwater cameras are available for rent.   The Marina del Mar Resort in Key Largo has almost doubled its accommodations with the addition of 54 rooms and villas, each with kitchen, living room, separate bedroom and balcony. Key Largo also has a new restaurant and motel. The Snappers Restaurant (mile marker 94.5) offers rental equipment for water sports as well as indoor and outdoor dining. The new Conch On In (mile marker 89.5), with seven rooms and boat dock, is a manatee observation site in winter.    Key West's Curry Mansion, the turn-of-the-century residence of one of Florida's first millionaires, William Curry, has opened an additional 15 rooms furnished with Victorian-style pieces. The keeper's quarters at the Key West Lighthouse, the only American lighthouse in the middle of a city, was restored and opened last month as a lighthouse museum. More information on the Keys is available from the Visitors Bureau (800-352-5397). A Week As a Movie Star    Did Hollywood stardom pass you by? For $7,500 a person, Hollywood Fantasy Corporation is offering the chance to try a week of life as a movie star. After being cast for one of about a dozen scripts, vacationers will spend a week in Palm Springs, Calif., rehearsing and receiving voice training and acting lessons, as well as fashion and beauty advice.    At week's end, vacationers will star in their own movie alongside the actors Elliott Gould and Maxwell Caulfield. Participants receive a videocassette of the final edited version of their production and of highlights from the week's rehearsals and parties.   The package, scheduled for Jan. 6 through Jan. 13, includes a private villa at the Palm Springs Marquis Hotel, a chauffeured limousine to and from the hotel, and admission to Palm Springs International Film Festival events. For an additional $2,000, participants may take a guest who can attend all the events except the rehearsals and taping.    Additional movie fantasy vacations are planned for Palm Beach, Fla., in March and San Antonio in April. Information: 800-545-8050. 2 Visas Dropped In East Europe    Bulgaria and Hungary have joined Czechoslovakia in eliminating visa requirements for American citizens. The policy changes, which took effect Oct. 3 in Bulgaria and Nov. 1 in Hungary, apply to Americans planning to stay up to 30 days in Bulgaria and up to 90 days in Hungary. Czechoslovakia exempted Americans from visa laws last May.   Yugoslavia, which temporarily lifted its visa requirements in July to promote tourism, will reinstate its visa laws on April 1, 1991. After then, visitors will need to obtain visas, which are free, at the border or by applying in advance to the nearest consulate.   Romania continues to issue visas, good for up to 30 days, to travelers at the border","excerpt":"Poland still requires visitors to apply for visas in advance, through a consulate. (Allow two weeks for processing and provide exact travel dates.) Both countries offer single- and multiple-entry visas.     Colombia no longer requires American visitors to obtain a visa or tourist card. To make multiple visits and stay for up to 90 days in a given year, Americans now need present only a valid passport and a ticket for entering and leaving the country.  Air Service To Palermo    Alitalia, the Italian airline, has started a new daily service from Kennedy International Airport in New York to Palermo, Sicily, via Milan's Malpensa Airport. Passengers change planes at Malpensa instead of having to transfer from Malpensa to Milan's Linate Airport, as they did previously. To celebrate the service, the airline offers -- through March 31 -- a $100 discount off advance-purchase round-trip fares. Before discount, economy fares paid 14 days in advance are $871 on weekends and $807 midweek. The flight departs Kennedy at 7:30 P.M. and is scheduled to arrive in Palermo next day at 1:40 P.M. Chinese Garden For Montreal    A Chinese garden, said to be the largest of its kind outside Asia, is scheduled to open in Montreal next June. The plan for the five-acre garden within the Montreal Botanical Garden includes an elaborate composition of waterways, rock gardens, hills, plants and pavilions with carvings.    The design derives from a style known as Meng Hu Yuan, or Dream Lake Garden, which originated during the Ming dynasty (A.D. 1368-1644). Chinese administrators stationed far from their homes, built gardens. The style is also known as the Yangtze style, because many of the officials who built the gardens were from the cities along the Yangtze River west of Shanghai.    The $4 million project was conceived in 1987 as a symbol of friendship between Montreal and Shanghai. The garden's wood carvings and peony trees and 300 of the 2,300 tons of stone came from China. About 50 people from Shanghai are working at the site under the supervision of Lei Wei-Zhong, of Shanghai, a garden designer of the Yangtze school. Interiors of the pavilions were completed last month.  DELHI DISPLAYS KASHMIRI WORK     NEW DELHI -- To give the artisans of the battered Kashmir Valley an outlet for their crafts now that the local tourist industry has collapsed because of separatist conflict, the state government of Jammu and Kashmir has built an outdoor crafts bazaar in the Indian capital.    Tucked into a piece of open ground between the state government emporiums on Baba Kharak Singh Marg, near Connaught Place in central Delhi, dozens of stalls will offer bargains from Kashmir throughout the winter. Called Kashmir Expo 90, the craft fair opened Nov. 5 and is expected to go on until the beginning of February.    More than 80,000 people in Jammu and Kashmir lived on traditional handicrafts -- weaving, furniture and woodcarving, carpet making and papier-mache work being among the best known.    So far the finest Kashmiri weaving and papier-mache work do not seem to be on display. But it is possible to find hand-embroidered woolen shawls for under $25 and plain lightweight wool shawls for as little as $5, along with namdha-work rugs of embroidered, compressed wool at from $12 or $15 up, depending on the size of the piece.    The permanent Jammu and Kashmir State Emporiums in Delhi will be well stocked this winter. One is near the outdoor Expo at 7A Baba Kharak Singh Marg and the other at 5 Prithviraj Road. Both are open Monday to Saturday 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. -- BARBARA CROSSETTE Travel Advisory"},{"year":"1928","title":"Non-aggression treaty accepted by Bulgaria LITHUANIA DEMANDS VILNA COMPENSATION","excerpt":"Poland Submits Kovno Treaty to Geneva Criticizing It as a Barrier to Peace."},{"year":"1998","title":"Russia's economic woes stand in contrast to Poland's successful transition from centrally controlled economy","excerpt":"Poland succeeded by encouraging small entrepreneurs, while Russia let oligarchs who controlled state-owned factories crack down on would-be competition; Poland stuck to scary decision to force insolvent firms into bankruptcy, while Russia props up incompetent businesses that cannot pay taxes or wages; photos (M) The World; Russia Is Not Poland, and That's Too Bad"},{"year":"1931","title":"State prosecutor, Warsaw, begins suit against ed of newspaper, Robotnik, for allegations against Judge Demant PROSECUTES AN EDITOR.","excerpt":"Poland Takes Action to Punish Allegation Against a Judge."},{"year":"1937","title":"B K Albrecht invents glue to make thin metal sheets stick to walls ' Amateur in Adhesives' Uses Hobby to Invent Way to Make Copper Stick to Wall at Fair","excerpt":"Poland Takes Option on Space"},{"year":"1927","title":"Luncheon meetings CALLS PROHIBITION GUARD OF LIBERTY","excerpt":"Poland Tells Rotarians That Legislation Is Designed to Protect Personal Rights.
