Formed in 1946 by Jose Limon, the troupe is presenting not only dances by Limon and Doris Humphrey but also work by Alwin Nikolais and Phyllis Lamhut, a choreographer of the Nikolais lineage, and Annabelle Gamson, a noted interpretor of the dances of Isadora Duncan and Mary Wigman.    The opening night program had its disappointments, though it got off to a punchy start with Ms. Lamhut's \\"Cleave,\\" a piece inspired by the dismantling of the Berlin wall. Both the dance and the score, composed by Robert Moran for chanting voices and instruments, have a percussive, roiling, continuous push that makes them exhilarating. The dancing builds subtly, beginning with simple walks along geometric paths for all eight dancers and gradually building to complex shifts of rhythmic accent, ranks and partners.

It is the legal Government of Nicaragua, recognized as such by the United States and the rest of the world, that the contras are attacking from United States-subsidized foreign sanctuaries.

The appearance last night of Horacio Gutierrez as soloist in that mighty bramble of a piece certainly augured well. Nor did his performance fall short in most important ways. A young artist who is rapidly taking a place high among the virtuoso pianists of his generation, he has indicated in the past that his technical and musical gifts are precisely the kind that a heavyweight work such as the Brahms Second requires. He met all such challenges well this time, too.

Those who manage to scrape through this type of spiritual lesson with the only two survivors, Linda Darnell and Dale Robertson, also will discover that many large questions have been disposed of before the last Indian is shot from the cliff.In the order of their importance, it is resolved that Mr. Robertson, a bank robber on the lam, and Miss Darnell, a dance-hall entertainer, are very much in love. Another last-minute realization is that others along the battle line, the Senator, the bank clerk accused of Mr. Robertson's crime and Miss Darnell's elderly companion, a fellow called the Minstrel, were highly deserving characters despite their various weaknesses that have been held up for scrutiny during the long siege with the Indians.To take but one example, when it is all over the principals acknowledge that the Senator, for all his lecherous glances at Miss Darnell and for all his silly bombast, had a pretty good point to make when he insisted that only brotherly overtures would solve the Indian problem. Many matters are put to rest that way some of them reaching far afield to touch on the United States Senate and the existence of God.\\"If only the Minstrel could have lived to see it,\\" pines Miss Darnell to her co-survivor as a glow of serenity settles over the strewn and littered scene.
