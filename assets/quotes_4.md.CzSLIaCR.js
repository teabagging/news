Mr. Broad paid $23.8 million for the elegantly composed steel sculpture, the last work in Smith's most desirable series. It was the highest price paid for any artwork during the last two weeks of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art auctions, and the highest ever paid for a work of contemporary art sold at auction. ''He bought the sculpture for his own personal collection,'' Ms. Heyler said of Mr. Broad in a telephone interview. ''But he realizes that it is a museum-quality piece, and so he intends to lend it to museums.'' Besides gracing his home in Los Angeles, Ms. Heyler said, the sculpture will be displayed at the Broad Contemporary Art Museum, a new building that will be part of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. This week Mr. Broad also bought a 1961 painting by Cy Twombly, ''Untitled (Rome),'' for $7.9 million, also at Sotheby's. ''That was also for his personal collection,'' Ms. Heyler said.
