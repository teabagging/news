But underneath that sexy, ebullient exterior lies the soul of an artist in love not only with dance but also with the theater. Those loves combine in Mr. Amargo's ''Poeta en Nueva York,'' an award-winning multimedia production inspired by the writing of Federico García Lorca, that will be presented tonight at City Center. Performed by Mr. Amargo's 30-member troupe of dancers and musicians, this ''flamenco musical,'' as he calls it, will also feature performances by guest stars who include the ballet wunderkind Rasta Thomas, recently in the Richard Move-Mikhail Baryshnikov production of ''The Show,'' and Spanish actors and actresses in filmed readings of the García Lorca poems. Described by El País, Spain's leading newspaper, as one of the most promising flamenco talents to have developed in years, Mr. Amargo, above performing ''Poeta,'' is greeted like a rock star in Europe. But New York has seen a lot of flamenco in recent years. What is different about this? ''It's not different, my company,'' he said. ''What's different is my feeling, my intuition about flamenco. People in Spain say it's eclectic. I like everything. But my power is my sexy flamenco feeling. My elegance. Sometimes flamenco is very savage.'' Mr. Amargo was trained in flamenco by Mariquilla and Maite Galán. He was inspired to begin training and classical Spanish dance at the Royal Conservatory of Madrid at 9, after seeing Antonio Banderas in ''Carmen.'' ''I don't like dance for dance,'' he said. ''If I liked that, I would go to the street or my father's house. For me the story is important. Movement is dance.''

It is a most graphic and compelling account of the building of the recently finished Turkestan-Siberian railroad. Viktor Turin, the director, has wisely refrained from introducing any fiction story. He confines himself to the details of construction and the impressions of the ignorant people, from the surveying of the route to the climax of the train speeding over the tracks.Some of the conspicuously interesting sequences depict the astonishment of the populace of Southern Siberian districts, when, for the first time, they see an automobile, one in which the surveyors are traveling, and finally when they ride up on horses and oxen and attempt to overtake the fast-traveling locomotive. These glimpses are bound to recall the reception of Stephenson's old locomotive, but they possess a dual interest, for in a relatively short time the ignorant Mongolian folk behold some of the amazing American inventions and ideas of more than half a century, such as steam shovels, pneumatic drills and other tools, steam hammers, the work of surveyors, the dynamiting of rock and so forth.M. Turin craftily contrasts the slow labor of the pick and shovel with the results of the monster steam shovel and also the pickaxe with the great upheavals of earth caused by dynamiting.This Soviet director's sense of humor is apparent in quite a number of scenes. When the dynamite fuses are inserted in the rock and the incredulous people don't know what to make of the new-fangled methods, old and young men, women, girls and children appear, with mingled expressions of amusement and alarm, from the recesses of their tent-like shacks. Then the first explosion is heard, with rock and earth flying in the air, and they withdraw from the open. Follow then several other explosions, and the results of modern minds come to the view of these amazed persons.As in Stephenson's day, the people in this picture are impelled to ridicule the work of the engineers. The idea of a vehicle darting hither and thither without any horse attached to it, perplexes and amuses them. One gleans that their impressions of this automobile are that it is an isolated specimen which is merely brought to them as a boast of the railroad builders. So far as the locomotive is concerned, they are also evidently prepared to scoff at that.When the locomotive is ready to be sent over the rails, a score of the doubting Thomases dash up on horseback. They watch the locomotive driver in the cab and suddenly there is a burst of steam, which sends those on oxen, ahorse or afoot, fleeing to safety. The Iron Horse having been apparently calmed, they return to show the speed of their horses and even their oxen against this ungainly contraption with which the workers, they think, are evidently having trouble because of the hissing of steam. Then the Iron Horse starts to move—as the onlookers imagined, very slowly. They are prepared to race with it. The locomotive's speed is increased and the riders keep abreast of it. The locomotive driver finally lets out the throttle and the men on horses and oxen are left behind, some valiant ones hopefully continuing. One of the horsemen realizing that his steed is winded decides to give chase to the locomotive afoot.It was Bill Shatov, a laborer on the Erie railroad here several years ago, who bossed 40,000 men in the building of the Turkestan-Siberian railroad. This road, which links the arid Turkestan with the resources of Southern Siberia, is about 750 miles long. It is said that Shatov spent more than ten years in this country, but never rose to be more than a pick and shovel man.M. Turin reveals himself to be a master of camera work, particularly in those scenes showing the calculations and maps of the engineers.\\"Turksib\\" is one of the most interesting films that has come out of Russia.
