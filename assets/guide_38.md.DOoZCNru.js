Based very loosely on the life of the great Renaissance painter, it makes a problematic effort to equate the society of 16th-century Toledo, Spain, with the society of today. Life, art and minority politics mingle on uncertain dramatic terrain.   The music is not to blame. Mr. Harper has produced an intriguing and sometimes entrancing score. A prolific Chicago-based operatic composer, he has managed a graceful fusion of elements drawn from multiple eras and genres. At climactic moments, he allows himself an un embarrassed neo-Renaissance grandeur, wild around the edges.

But out of the Pride at Work conference, as it was called, a national organization has emerged. A leadership group of labor activists gathered in New York again late last month to formally ordain the National Gay/Lesbian/Bi/Transgender Labor Organization, the group's politically inclusive full title. Alas, no acronym dare speak its name, and so the group will be known as Pride at Work. It has a national mailing list of about 600 names.   It may not seem like the most propitious moment for an alliance between the two groups most likely to be marginalized by those who must now be obeyed in Washington. The Democratic debacle is attributed in part to Bill Clinton's support for gay rights and his attempt to change the military's discriminatory sexual orientation policies early in his term. There are undoubtedly those in the union movement, with strong ties to the Democratic Party, who would regard gay rights as a lavender albatross. Supporting those issues, the argument would go, is to risk further alienating the gay-shy electorate.

Cohan Theatre further experiences of their travels, both in the South Sea Islands and in East Africa. This edition of their peregrinations is called \\"Across the World with Mr. and Mrs. Martin Johnson,\\" and like the film, \\"Hunting Tigers in India,\\" its interest is enhanced by Mr. Johnson's vocalized description of the scenes, and by incidental comments from Mrs. Johnson and also from one of the three Boy Scouts who accompanied the gun and camera hunters on part of the journey through the African zone.Mr. and Mrs. Johnson and a party of friends are first beheld in a New York apartment, where the picture is supposed to be screened. The room is then darkened and one sees the scenes photographed in various places, including the Solomon Islands, Vao Island, Langa-Langa Lagoon, the New Hebrides and other places in the South Seas, before making the big hop from there to Africa. The picture thus goes from the head-hunters to wild beasts. Some of the savages appear to have been posed for the camera, but that does not detract from the interest of the record. During one section of the film, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson found themselves in the alarming predicament of being captives of the ferocious savages, and there is a lapse of time when it was not possible to bother about photographing the happenings.Mr. Johnson explains the customs of the various tribes, their weaknesses for being tattooed, for wearing strange necklaces and for having the skulls of their enemies stuck on sticks and filled out with clay.The most exciting passages of this picture are those devoted to lions, who look sometimes as tame as dogs. There are scenes of lions sunning themselves, lions sneezing after sniffing at a stone covered with pepper, lions yawning, as if bored with the jungle","excerpt":"lions fighting over a carcass, and one or two of the more inquisitive lions being laid low by bullets, both from Mr. and Mrs. Johnson.It looks in some of the scenes as though the lions wanted to have a truce with the Johnsons. The animals seem as if they were curious as to why Mr. and Mrs. Johnson came to the jungle so frequently. There are so many of the beasts that one might almost have taken their licking their chops and their friendly attitude to mean that they intended to give a royal welcome to the white people from America.Mr. Johnson shows one lion in very much the same position as the Lanseer lions at the base of Nelson's monument in Trafalgar Square. But now and again there are the lions who didn't know enough to turn away from the unerring guns of the Nimrods and as they approach to investigate the doings of the human beings, they pay with their lives for their bravado.On part of the journey Mr. and Mrs. Johnson were accompanied by George Eastman, of Kodak fame, and Dr. Albert Kaiser.The jungle stretches are not confined to lions, for there are herds of other denizens of the African wilds, including elephants with flapping ears, several of whom looked more or less sympathetic. Then there are the white rhinos, which, according to Mr. Johnson, are really blacker than the black rhinos. They are called white merely because they roll in the white sand or earth. There are scenes of vultures swooping down on a carcass left by the gorged beasts, and of timid giraffes, now still and then loping away in their comic fashion. Mr. Johnson tells of seeing 128 giraffes in one group.The despised hyenas are also depicted scurrying to devour what's left of a carcass. The picture devotes a few scenes to wild dogs that hunt in herds and are therefore responsible for slaughtering many of the big game. Zebras come in for some attention and also a specie of antelope, that leaps as far as thirty feet in one bound.Mr. and Mrs. Johnson's film is prefaced by that extremely interesting production, \\"The Einstein Theory,\\" which has been exhibited for several years in various theatres and which recently caused considerable disorder at the American Museum of Natural History.
