Cohan Theatre \\"Broadway Scandals,\\" a back-stage story with songs and dances. Those who have not seen an audible picture concerned with a hoofer and his feminine partner, may decide that there is plenty to interest them in this offering, but others who may have witnessed the picturizations of \\"Broadway,\\" \\"Burlesque.\\" \\"Broadway Melody,\\" \\"Fox Movietone Follies\\" and \\"Big Time\\" will undoubtedly feel that this current production has familiar lines and scenes.It is a well-recorded film and one that is adroitly pictured. It has lengthy scenes of chorus girls cavorting on a stage and a stellar performer who most of the time receives far more applause from the screen audience than from their flesh and blood rivals in the house last night. In fact, the applause on the screen itself appeared to stay the hands of those in the theatre.Carmel Myers impersonates the prima donna named Valeska. Miss Myers was called to the stage before the projecting of the film and she sang one of the songs she renders in the course of this shadow adventure. She did it pleasingly, but nobody would imagine that she would be a sensation in a New York theatre, as this Valeska is supposed to be. Producers are pleased to meet Valeska, and stage managers and others stand in awe of her. She is good looking and knows what suits her in the sartorial line. Yet it seems surprising that the audience pictured before the spectators should have been so stirred by her simple songs.This great Valeska, whose partner is Ted Howard (Jack Egan), is a haughty person, and it takes none other than Mary, the slender, young creature, who is in love with Ted, to humble the prima donna. By that time Ted, who has been worried about his heart's desire, is certain that he loves Mary, who is incidentally, played by Sally O'Neill.It is Ted who sings \\"What Is Life Without Love?\\" and he and Mary are heard delivering a number railed \\"Does the Elephant Love Peanuts?\\"Valeska makes the most of a melody titled \\"Can You Read in My Eyes?\\" and she also sings with Ted a song known as \\"Would I Love to Love You?\\" Another song from the hero. Ted, is \\"Love's the Cause of All My Blues.\\"So long as the narrative does not intrude too impudently, one can be mildly entertained by some of the passages in this production. Miss O'Neil's acting is far better than her singing. Mr. Egan acquits himself favorably in his rôle. Miss Myers handles her part competently.

All he knew was he wanted to get away quick. It was 11 P.M. and there were still people about. But first he'd pull the hook on the fire alarm box to bring the law. He might steal cars for a living, but that didn't mean he wasn't a fan. The way Frankie saw it, if baseball was a four-season sport, he wouldn't steal cars at all.   Of course he recognized the Porsche, but it was the vanity plate that tipped him off: MALONE, for Hooker Malone, star New York Yankees pitcher, who tomorrow night would start the seventh game of the World Series against Cincinnati. Not that Malone had been a star so far. He had won Game 1 by a single run, then clutched in Game 4, got pulled in the fifth inning and the Yankees had lost by three.

Many arts presenters shudder at the very hint of audience boredom, but Vallejo Gantner, Performance Space 122's artistic director, says he is ''very excited'' to be showing the Iranian-born Mr. Sharifi's work as part of the space's Norway in New York festival of experimental theater and dance. Mr. Gantner describes the two-week event as the ''opening volley'' in creating more collaborative and touring opportunities between American and Scandinavian artists and presenters. He admits to a limited knowledge of contemporary Norwegian dance, but says he considers the festival ''an indicative cross section of some of the best work that's happening in Norway at the moment.'' For his part, Mr. Sharifi, above, who immigrated to Norway by himself at 14, mixes Iranian music with improvisational, chaotic movement to create a work that Mr. Gantner reads as an ''expression of alienation and the experience of being neither fully Iranian nor fully Norwegian.'' New Yorkers, whether or not they know Norway from North Dakota, can surely relate to that.

Much squishing, squashing and puncturing of bodies ensues, as the writer and director Jake West mounts a comedy-horror-sci-fi mash-up with the zest (and budget?) of a kid making movies in his backyard.

Greene. But the official end of the honeymoon probably dates back to Jan. 13, 1986. Two years had passed since the judge had presided over the court-ordered breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, and he had become increasingly suspicious that the new \\"Baby Bells\\" were ignoring ordinary telephone customers to rush into new lines of business.    \\"The disdain shown by some of the regional companies for their telephone obligations is as inexplicable as it is disconcerting,\\" he wrote in a blistering opinion. \\"A.T.&T. was imbued with a service mentality. By contrast, the regional companies, or some of them . . . indicate that an ascent into the ranks of conglomerate America rates far higher on their list of priorities than the provision of the best and least costly local telephone service.\\" 'Baby Bells' Wait","excerpt":"Hope Judge Relents"},{"year":"1991","title":"To the Editor:   The argument (\\"Baby Bells Wait","excerpt":"Hope Judge Relents,\\" March 10) that American consumers are being denied information services available in other countries is both stale and specious.   The hundreds of companies that already compete in providing world-class services and information to consumers through their telephone lines comprise one of the fastest-growing industries in America. For example, just two years ago, my company's services were used by 50,000 consumers; today, that number is rapidly approaching 1 million. And organizations throughout the world are negotiating with American information service companies to license American technology.   This growth of the domestic electronic information industry has occurred because the consent decree that created the Baby Bells wisely requires a separation between the monopoly owners of local telephone services -- the only game in town -- and the entrepreneurial companies that risk their own capital in sending consumer information through the telephone bottleneck.    Could the monopolists and the entrepreneurs compete on the proverbial \\"level playing field\\" in providing information through the very system the monopolists own? In theory yes, with effective regulatory safeguards. However, in administering the consent decree, Judge Harold H. Greene recognizes that existing regulations cannot insure fair competition as long as the telephone companies control the only gate in to the stadium. THEODORE C. PAPES Jr.  White Plains, N.Y., March 13  The author is president and chief executive of the Prodigy Services Company. The Baby Bell Conundrum"},{"year":"1991","title":"To the Editor:   \\" 'Baby Bells' Wait","excerpt":"Hope Judge Relents\\" (March 10) accurately described the issue of whether the antitrust consent decree in Judge Harold H. Greene's court should be lifted by him or Congress in order to allow these companies to enter the manufacturing, information services or long-distance businesses.   Members of the Association for Local Telecommunications Services have built or planned fiber-optic and microwave networks in more than 40 American cities, but the entire competitive industry has well under 1 percent of the local telecommunications market. The Bell local telecommunications monopoly is not even close to becoming \\"broken.\\"   We cannot understand why Judge Greene, the Department of Justice or Congress would consider allowing Bell companies into new lines of business when they engage in the anticompetitive practices that caused the decree in the first place. Until the Bell companies no longer have the \\"monopoly bottleneck\\" over local telephone service, Judge Greene et al should not even consider easing the antitrust decree restrictions, and the Federal Communications Commission and state public utility commissions should not consider further deregulation.

The industry lost $664 million from operations in the quarter, according to Airline Economics, an aviation consulting firm based in Washington.   Nevertheless, one of the first long-term studies that analyzes how the airline industry has performed under deregulation has found that, despite the turmoil and wild swings in profitability, the industry - when looked at from a long-term perspective - has recovered much of its financial strength.   The study, which was done by Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc., covers the years from 1977 through 1985, using the results of 15 major airlines. Among its findings were that the industry had been able to generate large amounts of cash to finance its capital expenditures, such as buying more fuel-efficient airplanes, but that, despite its strong cash position, the industry was still far below the levels of profitability of 1977, the year before deregulation went into effect.

The Commerce Department's ''flash,'' or preliminary, estimate is that the economy grew in the final quarter of 1984 at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, up from a revised figure of 1.6 percent for the third quarter.   In fact, the fourth-quarter improvement was greater than a simple comparison of the quarter- to-quarter changes in real gross national product - total output, corrected for inflation - implies. For final sales - the real G.N.P. minus the change in inventories - actually declined 1 percent in the third quarter, and the preliminary data suggest that final sales grew 4 percent or more in the fourth quarter.
