An instructive, if apocryphal, story is told about him.\\n\\nVisiting a middle-sized town one day, Bryan approached a young boy and asked how to find the Post Office. Pleased by the accurate directions, he invited the boy to be his guest at the tent meeting that night. \\"If you come tonight, young man,\\" he said, \\"I'll tell you how to get to Heaven.\\" But the boy politely turned him down, and Bryan, who wasn't used to such rejections, asked why.\\n\\n\\"How are you going to tell me how to get to Heaven?\\" the boy replied. \\"You don't even know your way to the Post Office.\\" \\n\\nIn recent years New Jersey voters have demonstrated the same kind of skepticism. With some notable and consoling exceptions, the party has had a discouraging lack of success in the last two elections, and now Senator Bill Bradley's sudden withdrawal has dealt us another blow. Is it time to despair? I think not, but it is definitely time to emulate the Senator and engage in some collective soul-searching. We need to ask ourselves six questions:\\n\\n Are we mature enough to admit that on some things we may have been wrong? The time has come to acknowledge that we may have been slightly intoxicated on an overdose of Keynesian economics. This is not a disavowal of the basic tenet of government's beneficial role as the primer of the economic pump. But there is simply nobody out there anymore who believes that just spending more money will solve the nation's problems. The sooner we admit our mistakes, the sooner we can return to enjoying the voters' confidence. \\n\\nDo our campaigns send the right message? In saying they wouldn't run for the Senate next year, both Mr. Bradley and the Republican former Gov. Thomas H. Kean spoke all too accurately of a mean-spiritedness that permeates today's political debate. I've sinned in this regard, but hope that I will not succumb again in the future to the siren song of negative campaigning. Is it really necessary or satisfying to humiliate or embarrass your opposition? Do we really want to win merely because we are perceived as the lesser of two evils? What a hollow victory that provides. I think rejecting negativism wins votes in the future. \\n\\nHave we looked pompous and stupid, claiming to have a monopoly on wisdom? It is arrogant and undemocratic to tell people what's good for them rather than listen to their legitimate concerns. People do not want politicians lecturing them about what they ought to want. Democrats must make a compact with the voters to honor them as citizens, not disdain them as mere subjects. People want value for their tax dollars, and respect from those who collect and spend them. \\n\\nHave we forgotten the basics? Is it beneath our dignity to work the streets, or have we just forgotten how to do it? In 1993, Jim Florio carried urban strongholds like Elizabeth and Trenton by less than 10 percent. In 1994, fewer than 4 in 10 registered voters participated. Shame on us. Democrats will always be outspent, but until recently we always compensated with people power. If we consider ourselves too important to knock on a door or work a phone bank, we will be permanently relegated to minority status.\\n\\nDo we know where we are going? Like the boy in the story, voters will turn down our invitations if we don't know what we're inviting them to. We must design a simple, honest, easily understood message that sets out our economic policies and social values. And the party must not abandon its commitment to the vuhierable and the fragile among us. Compassion for our fellow citizens has been our hallmark, and is still the best road sign we can post to demonstrate that we know our goals. \\n\\nHave we run out of good ideas? Absolutely not! But it is imperative that we demonstrate to the public that we are creative and responsive. Here is just a sample of what we might be presenting: New Jersey Republicans campaigned on a constitutional amendment to allow initiative and referendum, then promptly killed it. We now have a chance to expose their hypocrisy while truly exciting voters.\\n\\nI propose that we give the voters the final say in resolving the perennial crisis over school financing. A referendum in November 1997 would give them the choice between the current system and alternatives like a statewide school property tax or a new income tax system.\\n\\nDemocrats have faith in the voters.
