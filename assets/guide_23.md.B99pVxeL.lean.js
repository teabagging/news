And it's an important audience-building tool -- to entice people to come to the classics on our main stage through an indirect route. Some people say Shakespeare is frightening. This is a great way  to start. When I first saw this piece, I laughed till my make-up came off. Maybe this will get people to try one of the comedies.\\" Mr. Discher added: \\"It gives people exposure to the plays they might not otherwise get. And it opens their hearts to Shakespeare. But it can't be all about silly physical gags. It can't be joke, joke, joke, joke. For me, it's about exploring the language and finding the humor that can come out of it, which knocks down the staid museum-piece approach to Shakespeare. \\"The set with an upper and lower deck looks traditional, like you're coming to see something highfalutin at the Globe.\\" Kings.

But not the roller skates. To Mr. Reilly goes \\"all the girl stuff,\\" he said: Gertrude, Ophelia, Lavinia. \\"And more wigs than the others,\\" not to mention overuse of falsetto. Such specialization enables Mr. Reilly to articulate \\"the pattern of response\\" of Shakespeare's heroines to imminent death: \\"they throw up,\\" he said, citing Juliet's reaction to poison and Ophelia's to madness. And what else is Cleopatra to do after uttering the line, \\"Is this an asp I see before me?\\" \\"It's all a little grossed out and hysterical.\\" As for \\"Hamlet,\\" the segment lasts 20 minutes, only to be followed by a speedier version (one minute 20 seconds) and then one that runs backwards (one minute 30  seconds).

The centerpiece of his current Manhattan exhibition recreates the adjoining Long Island studios of the painters and spouses Eric Fischl and April Gornik, above. Through the glass front walls of the spacious, beach-house-style buildings, you can look in and see little versions of the artists at work, along with finished and unfinished canvases, lights, worktables, paint containers, brushes, unidentifiable bits of detritus and much more. Everything is so fully realized and finely detailed that the effect is almost hallucinatory. The rest of the exhibition consists of miniature sculptures focused on the variously messy and neat worktables of 15 other painters, including Chuck Close, Joan Snyder, Dana Schutz and Philip Pearlstein. Each is contained within a plexiglass case that has a set of headphones attached through which you can hear Mr. Fig interviewing the artist about his or her work and life. Obsessive is not quite the word for Mr. Fig's thoroughness. Rather, he pursues his work with the dedication of a scientist, a detective or a model-railroad hobbyist. No humor or satire is intended, yet there is something inadvertently amusing about an enterprise that treats with such reverential attentiveness every mundane piece of the artist's world.

Benhamou of 3Com received $6.6 million, not $39.5 million.    The table also misstated a component of the compensation for John R. Horne, the chief executive of Navistar International. Mr. Horne received no restricted stock last year, according to updated filings by Navistar with the Securities and Exchange Commission; Navistar's original proxy filing with the S.E.C., the source for the figure, reported that he received $5 million in restricted stock.     The lead article in the report misidentified the executive who received the equivalent of $231,000 from the MBNA Corporation to use the company's jet for personal trips. It was Charles M.

Anstey's old play, \\"The Man From Blankley's.\\" Alfred E. Green, the director, who was responsible for both \\"The Green Goddess\\" and \\"Disraeli,\\" may have winked his eye at anachronisms and permitted a few of the characters to be caricatures, but, notwithstanding these and other shortcomings, the final result is that this relic of the past possesses a good share of fun.Those who may object to Mr. Barrymore's dropping his \\"g's\\" and being somewhat extravagant in his grimaces, will probably reflect that Lord Strathpeffer (Mr. Barrymore) is so drunk that he hiccups his way through several sequences.Mr. Barrymore is at his best when he is endeavoring to explain to Mrs. Tidmarsh the habits of certain scarabs. Considering that Mrs. Tidmarsh believes him to be an impostor, a man whom she has hired from Blankley's department store as a fourteenth at dinner, because of the superstitions of the wealthy Gabriel Gilwattle, it is all the more ludicrous to see her endeavoring to humor the inebriated nobleman. He says that he has brought her a beetle from some distant place and he hazards that he has named the insect Oliver. This conversation leads Mrs. Tidmarsh to presume that Lord Strathpeffer is a little out of his mind.The dinner given by Mrs. Tidmarsh is one at which the butler, also engaged specially for the occasion, is counseled to exercise economy. This menial believes that Strathpeffer is the hired man from Blankley's and he therefore places upon his lordship's plate a rubber squab, one which little Miss Tidmarsh is in the habit of serving to her dolls. Imagine then the alarm of both Lord Strathpeffer and his hostess, when the bird on being prodded by a knife squirts out the gravy and also squeaks. For some reason or other this incident is all the more funny because the well-known Shakespearean player is fiddling with the rubber bird. Perhaps if one of the slapstick comedians were in the rôle it might not be nearly as humorous.Virtually the whole action of the film takes place in the weird looking Tidmarsh home, first in the drawing room, then at dinner and finally in the drawing room again. Mr. Barrymore sustains the comedy well and some of his limericks were received with gusts of merriment. This Strathpeffer sobers up a little as time goes on, chiefly because the Tidmarshes frown upon giving wine to a man from Blankley's.Lord Strathpeffer is a genuine nobleman, who happens to have mistaken the house where he was due at dinner through his condition and the heavy fog. He explains his recent inheritance of the title to Margery Seaton, the child Tidmarsh's governess, but at the moment, through the foggy condition of his brain, he is not prepared to say how he came to be at the Tidmarshes. The odd looking gathering elicits from his aspersions on their looks. Uncle Gilwattle, played by Albert Gran, does not like the sherry. Nor does Strathpeffer, but he, when asked by Gilwattle for his opinion of the wine, says that it is quite nice and nutty. A look of gratitude crosses Mrs. Tidmarsh's usually severe countenance as she informs him sotto voce that he said just the right thing.There is quite a deal of buffoonery in this adaptation of the play, and one of the caricatures of human beings, Mrs. Gilwattle, formerly of Chicago, appears to be a specimen worthy of work in a Mack Sennett farce. When she refers to the windy city. Lord Strathpeffer declares that he intends going there during the shooting season. Her husband has a habit of falling asleep with his mouth wide open at the dinner table and he has to be awakened with a dig in the ribs, much to the disgust of Mrs. Tidmarsh.The excitement created by Lord Strathpeffer's appearance at the dinner is heightened by the fact that he is suspected of stealing Mr. Gilwattle's watch. His lordship persists that he does not carry a watch and he shows that on one end of his watch chain he has a bottle opener and on the other end, a corkscrew. He does not know that the Tidmarshs' little daughter has dropped Mr. Gilwattle's timepiece in the upper pocket of his swallow-tail coat. She had been wondering what to do with the watch since she found it on the floor, it having fallen from Gilwattle's pocket while he was enjoying one of his periods of forty winks.It is pleasing to see Mr. Barrymore in modern clothes, but in spite of the merriment aroused by the farcical events in this offering, it would have been more satisfying to see this actor in a comedy with sharper wit than occurs here most of the time.Mr. Gran does very well with his rôle, but his make-up is somewhat reminiscent of a cartoon from Le ???Rird. Edgar Norton fulfills the demands of the part of the butler. Emily Fitzroy makes Mrs. Tidmarsh an excellent combination of hopeful severity and meanness. Loretta Young is attractive as the governess who falls in love with Strathpeffer and William Austin makes the most of an individual who delights in chattering about the pyramids.Before the screening of the feature production Giovanni Martinelli, the operatic tenor, is heard to advantage on a short Vitaphone film of the orison scene from \\"Faust.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"John Barrymore's Fun."},{"year":"1931","title":"From the viewpoint of production and John Barrymore's portrayal, \\"The Mad Genius,.\\" the current picture at the Hollywood, is admirable, but in the matter of some of the other performances and the dialogue this contribution leaves much to be desired. The spirit of the mad genius Tsarakov (Mr. Barrymore) seems to have influenced this film in an extraordinary fashion.Although the story, an adaptation of a play by Martin Brown, is interesting while Mr. Barrymore occupies the screen, it becomes numb once he disappears. Sometimes it recalls Mrs. Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" but as a whole it is more like Du Maurier's \\"Trilby,\\" with a male dancer in place of Trilby. Yet Tsarakov's influence over a youth never calls for hypnotism.Tsarakov is afflicted with a partly withered leg and a kind of club foot, and consequently he envies agility in other persons. He is constantly bemoaning the fact that his crippled condition prevents him from being a great dancer. In the cleverly filmed opening scenes he and his drug-addicted assistant, Serge Bankieff, are manipulating the dancing of puppets in a wagon show. Soon their attention is attracted by a boy fleeing from his furious father, the youth bounding over a fence and a gate like a gazelle. Tsarakov decides to hide the youngster from his angry parent and later he inculcates the desire to dance in the youth.By the time the young man, Fedor, becomes a great dancer, Tsarakov is jealous of his pupil. When Tsarakov hears that Fedor has fallen in love with a ballet girl named Nana, the mad genius feels that he is being thwarted in his ambition for his pupil. He dismisses the girl and when Fedor follows her Tsarakov, having a contract for years to run with Fedor, sends letters to all the European capitals warning the theatrical fraternity not to permit the young man to dance in their theatres.Tsarakov eventually succeeds in prevailing upon Nana to join a wealthy admirer and Fedor, who is under the apprehension that the girl no longer cares for him, returns to Tsarakov. Several excellent scenes follow, lastly one in which Tsarakov is killed by Serge, who has stolen all the drug powders which the ballet master kept to give his assistant from time to time.Marian Marsh, the Trilby of Mr. Barrymore's \\"Svengali,\\" is pretty but disappointing in this type of story. Her voice is quite unsuited to the rôle and occasionally a smile comes to her countenance when one feels that she ought to be downcast. Donald Cook plays Fedor without conveying much sympathy. As a comedy relief there is Charles Butterworth, who, good comedian though he is, is not fitted to such a story. In fact, besides Mr. Barrymore, the only other player who succeeds in his part is Luis Alberni, who figures as Serge.Mr. Barrymore, however, gives an excellent interpretation of Tsarakov. His lines are more carefully written than those of the other players. It is true that there are repetitious speeches from him, but this may be pardoned on the ground that the character is so often bemoaning his crippled condition. Mr. Barrymore indulges a fancy for squinting during some of the heated arguments Tsarakov has with other persons. Never for a moment is Mr. Barrymore off key, and it is somewhat distressing when such a brilliant actor is playing in the same scene with Miss Marsh.The staging of the production is brilliant, with a variety of contrasting scenes, some in an unpretentious home and others in a large theatre packed with spectators. Michael Curtiz, the director, deserves a great deal of credit for his share of the work and it is a pity that he did not have the power to order some of the dialogue changed and also have something to say concerning the selection of players.

Corrections"},{"year":"1990","title":"Perhaps the most striking thing about John Cage is his ability to reduce just about anyone in his vicinity to a gentle smile. For more than 50 years, the distinguished, influential and often provocative composer has been challenging audiences with his work and his ideas. All the while, his primary goal has been disarmingly simple. Mr. Cage is interested, as he puts it, in \\"increasing one's enjoyment of life, to become more open.\\"   The man and his philosophy are delineated skillfully and with warm admiration in \\"John Cage: I Have Nothing To Say And I'm Am Saying It,\\" a film directed by Allan Miller of the Music Project for Television. Vivian Perlis is the writer. The hourlong documentary, being presented as part of the \\"American Masters\\" series, can be seen at 9 tonight on Channel 13.   Mr. Cage, who was born in Los Angeles in 1912, became a student of the composer Arnold Schoenberg. The pupil soon realized he had absolutely no feeling for harmony.   Schoenberg was not encouraging: \\"You'll come to a wall. You won't be able to get through.\\"   Mr. Cage was unfazed. \\"Well, I'll bang my head against that wall,\\" he said.   He then went on to defy most of the standard notions concerning serious music. He experimented with theories of chance. For Mr. Cage, one sound, or noise, was as useful as another. Is the sound of a moving truck musical, he says, then adds with characteristic impishness, \\"Which is more musical, a truck passing by a factory or a truck passing by a music school?\\"   Using a format that is less chronological than thematic, the documentary homes in on the most important aspects of Mr. Cage's career, most notably his longtime collaboration with the choreographer Merce Cunninham. The two men are seen working together and their are clips from several dances, demonstrating how the music and the choreography proceed independently of each other.   Mr. Cunningham says two things are actually happening, \\"not necessarily connected or disconnected.\\" Meanwhile, amplifying everything from the plucking of cactus to bird-calls for his scores, Mr. Cage says he finds all noises \\"as useful to new music as the so-called musical tones, for the simple reason that they are sounds.\\"   Several of Mr. Cage's compositions are sampled in performance. One work, described as central, is performed nearly in full (for some reason there is a slight cut). This is the famous 1952 piece \\"Four Minutes and 33 Seconds.\\"   That's precisely how long the pianist, in this instance David Tudor, sits at a piano reading the score but never playing a note, leaving the audience to listen to the room's ambient sounds.   During the program, Jack Rockwell, a music critic for The New York Times, says, \\"What Cage is doing is letting the listener contemplate art as life.\\"   And that is the point of Mr. Cage's art and life. The writer Calvin Tomkins says the composer is really a missionary, eager for us to be artists and wake up to the world around us. The performance artist Laurie Anderson notes how he is always encouraging others \\"to just see what's right in front of them.\\"   This consistently insightful film leaves Mr. Cage in a country setting looking for mushrooms under a bed of autumn leaves.   \\"Our intention,\\" he says softly, \\"is to affirm this life.\\" Here's to gentle smiles all around.

His music and his personality had long since made him the central figure in the history of 20th-century American composition, and hence -- given the provinciality of our music prior to 1900 -- of all American composition.   Mr. Copland is central to our history because the story of American music would be so impoverished without him.

Since then, he has cared less about what we eat and more about the digestive process in general. His music pokes our stomachs and massages our gastric tracts, making sure that we notice more acutely whatever has found its way inside us.

Recording companies have also taken heart from the big sales of ''The Beatles Anthology'' series of unearthed recordings. An increasing number of boxed sets present material that used to be the province of bootleggers: live shows, alternative takes and unreleased songs, as if recording companies are rushing to release everything they own before the millennium.
