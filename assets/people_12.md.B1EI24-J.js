Mr. Chirbes's spare, impressionistic prose leads us through Manuel's desultory love affairs, his friends' dismal suicides, his exquisite sadness.

Three of the six works Mr. Slatkin conducted were American scores, two by living composers. One, a Terry Riley work, was a world premiere. Another, Joseph Schwantner's 1978 \\"Aftertones of Infinity,\\" was a deserved revival. And the third, Samuel Barber's Violin Concerto, has been inching its way into the standard repertory.   The three other works were 19th-century showpieces by Russian, French and English composers. Yet the most ubiquitous of these, Mussorgsky's \\"Pictures at an Exhibition,\\" was presented in an unusual composite orchestration. Add to the mix a reasonably high-profile soloist, the violinist Kyung Wha Chung, and the programs fulfill virtually all the requirements of the something-for-everybody format that is a necessity of modern orchestral marketing.    But if Mr. Slatkin's choices seemed calculated, they did not seem superficial. Most were works Mr. Slatkin has either performed frequently or recorded in the last decade. Mr. Schwantner's \\"Aftertones of Infinity,\\" for example, has figured in Mr. Slatkin's New York programs in the past, and he has recorded it with the Juilliard Orchestra.   Mr. Slatkin opened the Sunday evening program with it, and it proved the most striking of the American works he offered. Like many of Mr. Schwantner's works, \\"Aftertones of Infinity\\" is based on one of the composer's poems, in this case a dark, almost apocalyptic rumination.      The piece begins with a nonspecific shimmer and proceeds spacily for several moments before its strands begin to coalesce. When they do, the results are violent eruptions of percussion, brass and string writing, sometimes in patches so dense as to become a toneless aggregate. Invariably, haunting, lyrical passages emerge from these thickets. And in the work's final moments, the sounds of a glass harmonica and the orchestra's gentle vocalizing return the 15-minute work to the haziness of its starting point.   Mr. Riley's seven-movement, 47-minute \\"Jade Palace Orchestral Dances,\\" commissioned by Carnegie Hall for the Monday evening program, is the composer's most ambitious score. But its reach far exceeds its grasp. A founder of the Minimalist school, Mr. Riley has lately abandoned that style's hallmarks in favor of a multi-cultural language.    In its more appealing moments, the piece finds common ground among such diverse elements as ragas, blues scales, gamelan-like percussion figures, Oriental wind and brass scoring, free atonality, and synthesizer timbres that parrot Baroque continuo writing.    Alas, common ground is a rare commodity here, and in its absence, Mr. Riley allows his polyglot themes to swirl around one another freely. Still, the dances might have worked better if Mr. Riley had a clearer notion of what orchestral instruments can be safely asked to do. Quick tuba figuration, for example, can only lead to murkiness. And some of Mr. Riley's wind and brass combinations sounded painfully untutored. The performance was a mess, but there was probably not much more the orchestra could have done.     Mr. Riley might have profited from Mr. Slatkin's exploration of \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" on Sunday. More than 20 composers and conductors have orchestrated Mussorgsky's invitingly colorful piano work, and although the Ravel version is now standard, it can exert no claim of authenticity.    Mr. Slatkin selected movements from nine editions, including those by Sir Henry Wood, Leopold Stokowski, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Lucien Cailliet and Sergei Petrovich Gorchakov. It would be dangerous to extrapolate about any of them -- except the Technicolor Stokowski transcription -- on the basis of a movement or two. And perhaps it would have been more sensible and instructive to play one version complete.    But Mr. Slatkin offered some telling comparisons in a brief lecture-demonstration just before the performance, and the composite did have the virtue of keeping the listener unsure of what was coming next.   The orchestra played the Mussorgsky with beauty and sweep. But its real display piece was Elgar's \\"Enigma\\" Variations, in which Mr. Slatkin and his players reveled in the work's demand for broad gestures and a rich string and wind tone.    Mr. Slatkin and the orchestra were also supportive accompanists in the Barber, in which Miss Chung's considerable energy and agility were matched by warmth and passion.

The owner of the business discovers this through a beachcomber whom she befriends because he saved her from sharks while she was swimming. Later there is a fight, the British troops arrive and then a moonlit scene in which the two leading characters embrace.Rin-Tin-Tin, it should be mentioned, now that he has achieved what may be known as the barking pictures, gives what is perhaps the most intelligent performance, for he minces no words, makes no gestures and appears graceful at all times. He is a remarkable animal, for when the beachcomber points at something in the distance and speaks to Rinty, presumably in doggerel, Rinty dashes off, to return a few scenes later with a detachment of infantry.

Sewn onto a leather strap and worn as a bracelet, ring, belt, anklet or necklace. Also tucked into braids and dreadlocks and sewn onto coats, handbags and hats.\\n\\nWHO WEARS THEM: The growing visibility of the shells seems spurred by the fashion choices of musicians like Janet Jackson, Lenny Kravitz and the group Arrested Development, who all wear them in MTV videos. The shells are sold at bead shops, African import shops, sidewalk vendors and flea markets.\\n\\n\\"Cowries are getting more popular every day,\\" said Bangally Jagana, owner of Bangally African Expo at 34 1/2 St. Marks Place (near Second Avenue) in New York. His sales have almost doubled in the last six months, he said. \\nTHE NAME: Pronounced COW-ree or CUR-ree in the United States, KOR-ree in Africa and the Caribbean. The name comes from the Hindi word kauri, meaning pearl. The early Greek name meant \\"little pig,\\" a reference to the shell's stubby, rounded back. The Romans called them porci or porculi, in keeping with the pig theme. The French called them porcelaine, an antecedent of the word porcelain.\\nWHAT THEY MEAN: Depends on whom you ask. They are worn as tokens of good luck, symbols of pride in one's African heritage or a reflection of earthiness and spirituality.\\nCHARMED HISTORY: Cro-Magnon women wore breast coverings and girdles made out of cowries. In Pompeii, women wore cowries because they believed they prevented sterility, and the shell is still associated with fertility in parts of Africa, Asia and the South Pacific. Ancient Egyptians placed cowries over the eyes of mummies to guarantee sight in the afterworld. The Algonquin Indians and tribes in Sierra Leone worshipped cowries and considered them oracles in time of war.\\n\\nIn ancient China, the dead were buried with cowries in their mouths so that they would eat and live well in the hereafter. African tribal leaders used them to decorate canoes, weapons, wives and themselves. In the United States, the Plains Indians favored them because of their similarity to highly prized elks' teeth.\\n\\nOLD MONEY: The shells, 40 to a string, were legal tender in many parts of the world as far back as the fourth century B.C. Africans traded extensively for cowries, and hundreds of tons were shipped from Ceylon and other Indian Ocean ports to Zanzibar and East Africa.\\n\\nWhen metal coins were introduced in China in the seventh century B.C., they were shaped like cowries. Greek coins resembling the cowrie soon followed. The shells are still used as currency in remote areas of Australia and Africa.\\nPRICES: A single shell sells for about 85 cents. Simple earrings cost $4 to $12","excerpt":"rings and necklaces, $15 to $20. A basket covered with cowries is about $85 to $120.\\nINFLATION: In 17th-century Africa, two shiny cowries could be traded for a nice wife. Later, the price jumped to 2,500 cowries. In the 18th century, 60,000 shells would insure a supermodel-type bride, and 20,000 would garner an ordinary spouse. A cow cost 2,500 shells, 500 bought a goat and 25 bought a chicken. In India in the early 1800's, 16 million cowries once bought a large bungalow, and a church was built for 160 million shells.
