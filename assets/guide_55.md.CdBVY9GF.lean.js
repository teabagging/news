The Yankee eccentric rides again in this lively collection from a chamber orchestra based in his native Connecticut. The selections, some in the Ives Society's new critical edition, are mostly short pieces, but they culminate in the suite \\"Three Places in New England.\\" Despite somewhat shallow sound, the performances have vitality and a transparency refreshing for this rambunctious figure. -- Andrew L. Pincus  Gilbert & Sullivan: 'The Pirates of Penzance' and 'The Mikado'  D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and Orchestra conducted by John Pryce Jones. That's Entertainment Records TER 1177 and TER 1178; CD and cassette.      If this new company cannot yet deliver the traditional ensemble hauteur or the rich individual characterizations of classic D'Oyly Carte versions, it does offer musical bonuses. Sullivan's instrumentation, using cleaned-up manuscripts, is well detailed, and there are original versions of numbers -- like \\"Were You Not to Ko-Ko Plighted\\" in \\"The Mikado,\\" which has a dropped verse restored. Current British operetta favorites are featured, including Marilyn Hill Smith, a very fine \\"Pirates\\" Mabel, and Bonaventura Bottone, as Nanki-Poo.   -- Richard Traubner   Tobias Picker: Symphony No. 2 ('Aussohnung'); String Quartet No. 1 ('New Memories')     Leona Mitchell, soprano; the Houston Symphony, Sergiu Comissiona, conductor. Mendelssohn String Quartet. Elektra/Nonesuch 9 79246-2; CD and cassette.   Tobias Picker studied with that grand duo of American rationalists -- Milton Babbitt and Charles Wuorinen -- and, like them, possesses an abiding faith in the European 12-tone tradition. But his recent music, influenced by American trends toward tonality and accessibility, has opened up immensely, and his Symphony No. 2 sounds like full-blown post-Romanticism. This is, however, no easy return to Romanticism. Instead, it partakes of a chromatic Expressionism, underpinned by tonal references that burst to the surface only in the Straussian setting of a Goethe poem. The String Quartet No. 1, inspired by Georgia O'Keeffe, is more abstract and dissonant, but no less poignant.    -- K. Robert Schwarz    Crumb: Works for Piano, Vol. 1 Jeffrey Jacob, piano. Centaur CRC 2050; CD only.      Mr. Crumb's trademark gestures -- the clusters, whispers, tics, clicks and other-worldly evocations -- are impressively on display in this first installment of a two-volume traversal of his piano music. Mr. Jacob plays (and hums and strums) well, and the three selections include the hypnotically tinted and allusive \\"Makrokosmos,\\" Vol. 1, from 1972. The other works are terser and less gratifying: the Webern-tinged Five Pieces for Piano (1962) and the more convoluted \\"Gnomic Variations\\" (1982), written for Mr. Jacob. The album is marred by some careless tape editing.    -- Andrew L. Pincus   'Music for Martha Graham' -- Copland: 'Appalachian Spring'; Barber: 'Cave of the Heart' ('Medea')   Atlantic Sinfonietta conducted by Andrew Schenck. Koch International Classics 3-7019-2 H1; CD and cassette.     Here are two familiar works in their original guises. \\"Appalachian Spring\\" (1944) and \\"Cave of the Heart\\" (1946) were written for Martha Graham's ballet company, and that meant economy of means -- 13 instruments in the former case, 14 in the latter. Later, Mr. Copland fleshed out his score for the popular orchestral suite, and Mr. Barber recast his work as \\"Medea's Meditation and Dance of Vengeance.\\" In getting back to the originals, Andrew Schenck shows us a psychologically shadowed side of \\"Appalachian Spring\\" omitted from the suite and bares the raw fierceness of the \\"Medea\\" ballet. But more than that, Mr. Schenck and company turn in performances of danceable pulse and suppleness, all recorded in vibrant colors. -- Lawrence B. Johnson  POP/JAZZ Happy Mondays: 'Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches'  Elektra 60986; CD and cassette.     The Happy Mondays of Manchester are the most significant group to emerge from Britain's working-class \\"rave culture,\\" which has invented its own delinquent version of the \\"enterprise culture.\\" The rave culture works hard (drug dealing, bootlegging) and plays hard (getting high on Ecstasy and house music). Happy Mondays' music is a lumpy puree of 70's funk, boogie guitar and 1990 house production, over which the singer Shaun Ryder spews a queasy stream of consciousness: squalid tales of chemical and sexual excess, oblique observations of lumpen-prole life. When it works, as in the baleful, sultry shimmer of \\"Loose Fit,\\" it's brilliant. But too often, \\"Pills 'n' Thrills\\" is a perplexing mishmash. If the Mondays' sound and scene is the new punk, it's because it's designed to confuse and repel outsiders.   -- Simon Reynolds   The Flaming Lips: 'In a Priest Driven Ambulance'  Restless 7 72359; cassette and CD.     For many young rock bands, psychedelia is a gimmick. But for the Flaming Lips of Norman, Okla., it's a credo. The band's fifth release sounds like psychedelia's inbred eighth cousin, with blasts of metallic feedback, Moog-like whistling noises and three songs about Jesus. But the Lips don't just wallow in weirdness; their songs are cunningly constructed. \\"Five Stop Mother Superior Rain\\" builds from a moribund acoustic guitar into crisp verses framed by drips of slide guitar. From a psychedelic base the Lips have evolved into a genre unto themselves.   -- Karen Schoemer   Tom Ze: 'Massive Hits'  Luaka Bop/Warner Brothers 26396; CD and cassette.     Spinning art music from the roots sound of samba was the bossa-nova dream, and Tom Ze chased it with more passion and precision than any of his co-conspirators in tropicalismo, the Brazilian avant-garde pop movement of the late 60's. But where bossa nova came out all sighs and whispers, Tom Ze's best work over the last two decades -- compiled here by that increasingly sharp-eyed ethnomusicologist David Byrne -- tosses buzz, howl and calculated eccentricity into its meticulous balance of the dissonant and lyrical. Guitars tickle and saw, horns wheeze and menace, old bossa standards are syncopated to the brink of collapse. And never have American audiences been treated to a more thrilling display of the vigorous intelligence that tends to lurk beneath Brazilian pop's pretty surfaces.   -- Julian Dibbell   Edie Brickell and New Bohemians: 'Ghost of a Dog'  Geffen 9 24304; all three formats.     \\"Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars,\\" this Dallas sextet's 1988 debut album, was alternative Muzak, noncommittal folk-rock suited to activities no more strenuous than hanging posters. The singer and lyricist Edie Brickell may still be the prototypical dormitory rocker, with a pseudo-coffeehouse penchant for mistaking her own scribblings for poetry (\\"Ghost of a Dog,\\" \\"Oak Cliff Bra\\"). But in half of the 14 tracks here, she strings together her observances of minutiae into full-fledged narratives: \\"Times Like This\\" and \\"Carmelito\\" have a disarming immediacy of place and time. \\"Ghost of a Dog\\" may not be deep, but at least New Bohemians have left some of their ditsiness behind.   -- K. S.   Louis Armstrong: 'Vol. 5, Louis in New York'  Columbia 46148; all three formats.     This fifth chronological collection of Armstrong's records in the 1920's and early 30's includes his first attempt to expand from blues and black-oriented vaudeville songs to pop. Two classic performances in this vein -- \\"I Can't Give You Anything but Love\\" and \\"Ain't Misbehavin' \\" -- reveal an unsuspected ability to sing pop lyrics with rich emotion. There are also two curiosities -- records made in 1929 but not discovered until last spring. They are orchestral versions of \\"After You've Gone,\\" which had an Armstrong vocal when first released. The newly found versions were intended for South America, where there wasn't much market for records with English lyrics. Armstrong's vocal chorus is replaced by lackluster instrumental solos, one a wimpish alto that reflects his fondness for the sound of Lombardo saxophones.   -- John S.

Mr. Koch, who had avoided commenting on his post-election plans while enroute to his lopsided victory Tuesday, said those plans did not include dealing with Herman Badillo, his former deputy mayor, or State Senator Albert Vann, both of whom he accused ''vicious and vile attacks'' on him. Aides confirmed, however, that Mr. Koch had decided to appoint a minority advisory council on which Representatives Shirley Chisholm of Brooklyn and Robert Garcia of the Bronx will have principal roles.

The stereotype of the blues guitarist is a guy standing onstage with a pained expression on his face, his hands zooming up and down the neck as he squeezes out notes in a finger-tripping flurry of notes emphasizing flash and technique. Jimmy Dawkins, an unjustly obscure figure from Chicago, works the opposite end of the spectrum. Emotive and economical, he is more likely to turn his back on the crowd and stretch a taut note through several chords, and his solos have a gut-wrenching precision that eschews grandstanding. He resurrects the heart of the blues: its feelings, urgency and ultimate catharsis. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30 and 11:30. Tickets are $5. Malone in Overdrive     Michelle Malone, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052. At her best, Michelle Malone is the kind of singer and songwriter who can jolt things into overdrive. Working a raunchy groove that borrows from the Allman Brothers and the Rolling Stones without keeling over into Black Crowes-style mimickry, she can push her band into a jiving, bluesy frenzy that's no less authentic for being derivative.

His only equal in visual inventiveness is the cartoonist Winsor McCay, who drew ''Little Nemo in Slumberland.'' McCay's effects are lush alongside Herriman's imaginative austerity, but no one even approached Herriman for verbal ingenuity until Walt Kelly, a Herriman admirer, turned up with Pogo after World War II. Herriman experimented with a number of strips between 1902 and 1932, but it is ''Krazy Kat'' - which appeared from 1913 until Herriman's death in 1944 - on which his fame rests. Herriman worked many splendid variations on the basic plot which finds ''that nice 'kop,' Offisa Pupp'' attempting to keep Ignatz Mouse from beaning Krazy with a brick, which Krazy always receives as an emblem of love. The adventures of this unlikely trio are only the dramatic spine for satiric comment, philosophical rumination and Herriman's gentle display of affection for the eccentricity of human beings.

First reported to the West by the Dutch navigator Abel Tasman in 1643, the Fiji Islands were annexed as a British Crown Colony in 1874. Between 1879 and 1916, large numbers of Indian indentured laborers were imported to work on sugar plantations; eventually the original Melanesian inhabitants were outnumbered by persons of Indian descent. Fiji became an independent parliamentary democracy on Oct. 10, 1970, with most land ownership and political power vested in the Fijian minority. A parliamentary election in 1987 brought the Indian party to power; the elected government was ousted in a military coup, and Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabuka assumed control of the government on May 21, 1987. On June 2, 1992, he was sworn in as prime minister under a new constitution that guarantees a majority of seats for ethnic Fijians in the national legislature. He was reelected as the head of a coalition government in Feb. 1994. Yet another constitution (1997) restored Indian political rights, and elections in May 1999 led to formation of a government with Fiji's first Indian prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry. But in May 2000 a hostage crisis/coup led to the formation in July of an all-new, all-Fijian government which satisfied no one. Elections in 2001 resolved little: the (ethnic Fijian) Fiji United Party won a narrow victory over the (ethnic Indian) Fiji Labour Party but prime minister Lassenia Qarasa appointed only one Indian to his cabinet.

The first inhabitants of Palau (or Belau) probably arrived from Indonesia and the Philippines about 1500 B.C. The first European to visit the area was Ferdinand Magellan, in 1521. However, it was the British who dominated trade to Palau until 1885, when Pope Leo XIII acknowledged Spain's claims to the Carolines. Spain controlled Palau from 1885 to 1899, when it sold the territory to Germany. The Germans introduced coconut planting and phosphate mining, and introduced sanitary measures that arrested the deadly epidemics of dysentery and influenza, which over 120 years had reduced the population from 40,000 to 4,000. Japan occupied Palau in 1914, and over the next 30 years increased the mining, agriculture, and fishing industries. In 1938, Palau became a closed military area, and it was the site of heavy fighting during World War II. On July 18, 1947, the United Nations Trusteeship Council placed the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, including Palau, under U.S. authority. This trusteeship ended on Oct. 1, 1994, when the Compact of Free Association with the United States (approved by the voters of Palau) went into effect, making Palau an independent country in association with the United States. The United States continues to provide for Palau's defense and to provide aid. In return, the United States has the right to dock military vessels (including nuclear-powered vessels) in the islands for 50 years, and will consult closely on economic and environmental matters.

Though the Czech and Slovak languages are similar, the two peoples have always been far apart culturally and historically (much like the Letts and Lithuanians). The ninth-century Moravian Empire has been claimed as heritage by both peoples; but with the Magyar invasion of the Pannonian Plain in the 10th century, the Slovaks passed under Hungarian rule for 1,000 years. When in the 19th century a romantic-nationalist revival occurred, the Slovaks, under the leadership of Ludovit Stur, decided to use their own language in literature (though some of the most prominent writers in the Czech tongue were of Slovak origin, such as the poet Jan Kollár and the historian P.J. Safarik). Unlike the Czechs, the Slovaks took no part in the revolutions of 1848. They lacked a native aristocracy; their national leadership came from wealthy peasants, small-town shopkeepers and, above all, their priests. In the peacemaking at the end of World War I, as the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed, the Czech politicians Benes and Masaryk claimed to speak for the (nonexistent) Czechoslovak nation. They carried the day despite apparent Slovak loyalty to Hungary and even the opposition of Fr. Hlinka's Slovak Populist party to union with the Czechs. The synthetic “nation” of Czechoslovakia was created, governed by a sort of benevolent democratic dictatorship of the Czechs over the other nations. With the Munich crisis of October 1939, Hitler imposed a federal structure giving Slovakia almost complete autonomy in the renamed Czecho-Slovakia; in the following March, when Hitler obliterated Czech independence, an “independent” Slovakia was formed with Hlinka's successor, Magr Tiso, as president. But under the circumstances independence was illusory. German protection (against Hungarian revisionism) required complete Slovak accord with Reich foreign policy, including declarations of war on Poland (1939) and on the U.S.S.R., the United States, and Great Britain (1941). Domestically, Msgr. Tiso organized a one-party state with anti-Jewish legislation, half unwilling and half unable to resist the expulsion (and eventual extermination) of 60,000 Jews. The cement for a restored Czechoslovakia after the war was the Communist tyranny imposed in 1948. But the “Velvet Revolution” in 1989 overturned Yalta and brought victory over the Communists. As the Czech premier Václav Klaus pushed for free-market “shock therapy,” the Slovak premier Vladimír Meciar defended a slower “Slovak way” to capitalism. Economic differences inflamed by ancient Slovak resentment of the Czech majority led to a much-diminished federal government by the spring of 1992. In the summer the split became the “Velvet Divorce.” In July 1992 Slovak deputies to the federal Parliament blocked the reelection of Václav Havel to the presidency, and the Slovak National Council approved, by a vote of 113 to 24, a declaration of sovereignty. In September the two parliaments agreed to the terms. In accord with a two-to-one ratio of the republics' populations, the military and financial assets of Czechoslovakia were divided. By February even plans for a common currency had gone by the board, with only a customs union linking the two parts of the old state. On Feb. 15, 1993, the Slovak Parliament elected its first president, Michal Kovác, with Meciar, as prime minister. Spiraling inflation and high unemployment coupled with a corruption scandal toppled the Meciar government early in 1994, but a coalition government including many former Communists restored him as prime minister later that year. In Sept. 1998, a four-party opposition coalition toppled Meciar's regime. Mikulás Dzurinda became prime minister, heading a government whose principal focus was NATO and E.U. membership. On May 29, 1999, in Slovakia's first popular rather than parliamentary election of a president, Rudolf Schuster defeated Meciar in a run-off; but in July 2000, the cabinet, with Schuster incapacitated by illness, transferred presidential powers to the prime minister and parliament's speaker. Meciar was arrested on charges of fraud and abuse of power. Dzurinda put together a four-party coalition to stay in office and in May 2003 93 percent of voters approved, joining the E.U.

Lomas, based in Dallas, said it was forced to declare bankruptcy after the exceptionally high level of mortgage refinancings between October 1991 and August 1994 caused a rapid decline in the number of mortgages it services. Lomas said its deteriorating financial condition caused the risk of intervention by government agencies or private mortgage investors.
