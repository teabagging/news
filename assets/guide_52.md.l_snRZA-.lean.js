Waiting patiently, they wear numbered signs and trade hints and Richardisms (cries of \\"Whooooooo!\\" are everywhere). \\"You ain't got the Little Richard scream,\\" one is chided. \\"Richard never faced the piano, he always faced the audience, so that's what you got to do,\\" another is told.    Whenever the confusion threatens to become overwhelming, rip-roaring television clips of the real Richard serve as reminders that there is, after all, only one. But later in the film, even this notion is called into question. The actual Little Richard, who cooperated with the film makers briefly but then changed his mind and cut off contact with them, appears only fleetingly in a newly somber incarnation. He sits behind a desk in a business suit and sings \\"When the Saints Go Marching In,\\" and later on appears as the pitchman for a white-run business manufacturing garish Bibles for black customers. All this suggests that there may be no true Little Richard after all.

William Tecumseh Sherman, the first American urban renewalist, returned to tell the city fathers he had really bestowed a favor on them: They could build a modern city. After a lapse of about a century they took his advice, and today Atlanta's growth and prosperity are the envy of every Chamber of Commerce east of the Mississippi and south of Cincinnati. Atlantans, both black and white, are justly proud of their metropolis, and traveling salesmen exhausted from the ennui of Birmingham, Ala., or Raleigh, N. C., look forward to the joys of Atlanta. However, one caveat to travelers who come here seeking a &#8220;Babylon on the Chattahoochee,&#8221; as it has been called: Even though Atlanta remains a friendly town, filled with a lot of friendly people, bigness has not yet created the institution of greatness. The rapid growth has been in motion for about two decades, not time enough for the things that men cherish about big cities beyond air pollution and traffic jams to catch up with the economic indexes. That is not to say that Northerners exhausted with urban blight don't, find Atlanta refreshing and revel in the beautiful spring and fall, which are perfect for golf and tennis, or that Southerners drawn here don't find it the greatest thing since sliced bread. &#8220;Hotlanta,&#8221; the good ol' boys from the hinterlands cry, and every night you can find people craning their necks at the glass elevators sliding down the middle of the vast Regency Hyatt House lobby, the No. 1 tourist attraction in the city. But if glass elevators don't knock you out, Atlanta's night life can present a challenge. And forget about Sunday, when there is an absolute ban on all alcoholic beverages in bars,FOR CIVIL. WAR BUFFS&#8212;Grant Park is a kw minutes from downtown (don't lot.&#8208; a minute think it was named for Ulysses S.), and in the middle of the park is the Cyckrama, which sounds like a Honda dialership but is actually a panoramic painting of the Battle of Atlanta, a sort of circular nineton American Heritage foldout. If you wonder why it is housed in a inausoleti&#8208;like building, don't forget it was painted by Union artists about a Union victory (adults $125, children 75 cents). Kennesaw Mountain, site of the national battlefield park, is a short drive north of the city on 1&#8211;75. You.can drive or walk to the top to survey the countryside to the north where the Confederate defenders of Atlanta first engaged Sherman's troops. There is no museum, but maps and markers provide a feeling of the sweep and scope of the engagement. Margaret Mitchell, author of &#8220;Gone With the Wind,&#8221; ordered that her notes and unfinished writings be destroyed at her death but for hard&#8208;core &#8220;G. W. T. W.&#8221; buffs there's a Margaret. Mitchell room in the Atlanta Public Library, showing her few surviving personal effects. Bus tours into the Tara plantation country of Jonesboro, southeast of the city, are available during the summer. Stone Mountain, of no historic significance other, than that the modern Ku Klux Klan was revived there in 1915, is the centerpiece for a state park and has a titantic bas relief of Confederate heroes on one side. Admission is $2 but costs inside the park can pile up, including fares for such rides as, the sternwheel riverboat and the cable car to the top of the mountain, which is the world'sARTS AND CULTURE&#8212;The city foist from the ashes left from Sherman's torch, but no phoenix survived the 1962 crash in Paris of the airliner carrying the foremost: patrons of the arts in Atlanta. The cultural renaissance that was, under way perished with the victims and was replaced with a Maddoxism that bans plays like &#8220;Boys in the Band&#8221; and movies like &#8220;Last Tango in Paris.&#8221; The High Museum of Art, 1280 Peachtree. Street Northeast, has a Monet (one of the Houses of Parliament), but the collection is skimpy. The Atlanta Symphony, with Robert Shaw conducting, tends to be circumscribed by pressure to perform old favorites. To find out what attraction is currently at the Civic Center, from opera to bluegrass music, call 523&#8211;6275.MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S GRAVE&#8212;It's a simple grave at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, 407 Auburn Avenue Northeast, marked only, by a torch and the Words &#8220;Free at Last, Free at Last/Thank God Almighty, Free at'Last.&#8221; One day there may be a grander memorial, but masonry and glass won't change history, and &#8220;no matter how simple the grave, here lies the man who shook the conscience of a nation.DOGWOOD FESTIVAL&#8212;In early spring; Atlanta is one of the prettiest cities in the nation, blazing with the glory of blooming dogwoods, azaleas, camellias and jonquils. Festival week next April 6&#8211;14 will offer assorted tours of the countryside, outdoor art shows and craft displays. If you have the time, rent a raft and float down the Chattahoochee.

Most varieties of tulip will start to sprout after they have been continuously cold - from 32 degrees to 50 degrees Fahrenheit - for about 15 weeks.

Actually, Dr. De Hertogh says, ''99.9 percent'' of the cell division in the tulip is finished when the bulb goes dormant in the fall; in the spring, the cells do not multiply but simply elongate. After blooming, the plant goes to work forming another bulb, and the longer the cool period after blooming but before hot summers bring on dormancy, the larger the new bulb and the more successful next year's tulip. The long, cool North Sea springs of the Netherlands appear to why tulips grow so well there. Q&A"},{"year":"1980","title":"There is a certain, undeniable carnival flavor to it.

In recent days, our preoccupation with Iraq has been magnified by the debate that was triggered by President Bush's announcement of new U.S. military deployments to the region.    However, three other ominous foreign policy problems -- serious energy shortfalls in Eastern Europe","excerpt":"severe food shortages in the Soviet Union and the chronic ills of the Middle East -- lurk just over the horizon. These problems lack the immediacy of the gulf crisis but if left unaddressed could spawn crises of even greater magnitude.    While the countries of Eastern Europe, including Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, face potentially crippling energy shortfalls, their traditional supplier, the Soviet Union, is suffering its own oil production and energy problems. In addition, Moscow says it will soon shift to world prices and hard currency in its trade with former client states, which could mean billions in additional fuel costs for Eastern Europe.   These countries had planned to receive Iraqi oil in payment for past sales of Eastern European arms and other exports to Iraq. For the U.S., Japan and Western Europe, the U.N. embargo means we will not buy oil from Iraq. For Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, the embargo means these countries will not receive the oil Iraq already owes them.   The world community cannot neglect Eastern Europe as it struggles to overcome an impending energy crisis that could doom its quest for market economies and even jeopardize its emerging democracies.   In addition to asking the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to increase assistance to Eastern Europe, which the Administration is doing, I believe Saudi Arabia and our other friends among the oil producing states should be called upon to help. This should not pose an undue burden to the oil producers. Saudi Arabia alone has already realized a windfall profit of about $16 billion to $20 billion from higher oil prices and increased oil output.   We should urge the Japanese to help Eastern Europe with grants and low interest long-term loans, preferably through international organizations. This could be a much more meaningful Japanese contribution to stability than sending a few thousand Japanese troops to the Middle East.   As for the likelihood of serious food shortages in the Soviet Union, here is how a leading Soviet economic expert describes the domestic economic situation: \\"The market has collapsed, the budget deficit is dreadful . . . monetary circulation and the financial system are on the brink of complete disaster.\\" Against this gloomy backdrop, much of the fall harvest has been lost because of bad weather, poor transportation and inadequate storage and processing facilities. Moreover, because the ruble has become virtually worthless, farmers are refusing to sell their output to the central Government.   Should we help the Soviet people overcome a potential crisis of food supply as they struggle to move from a command to a market economy, from dictatorial one-party rule to representative democracy? The answer is yes: Chaos in a nation that possesses 10,000 nuclear weapons is not in our national security interests.   Two measures would help us as well as the Soviet Union. We should bring the recently initialed U.S.-Soviet trade agreement into force and waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which denies the Soviets most- favored nation treatment and U.S. Government credits. The President has said he would not initiate waiver action until the Soviet Parliament passes a suitable law governing emigration. Though the Parliament has not yet done this, Soviet emigration to Israel and other countries is booming. Free emigration is why the Jackson-Vanik amendment was originally passed. President Bush should forget the formalities and deal with the realities.   Waiver, rather than repeal, of the Jackson-Vanik amendment would keep its sanctions in our arsenal, in case Soviet emigration practices take a turn for the worse. Meanwhile, such U.S. Government programs as Commodity Credit Corporation credits, intended to facilitate the export of U.S. agricultural products, would be able to swing into action. This would help the American farmer and our economy while providing relief to the Soviet people as they weather a particularly difficult phase of their economic transition.   Second, the Soviet Union has under-exploited proven oil reserves and inadequately explored potential oil reserves. This overall energy potential cannot be realized quickly. But it is a valuable and needed asset, and U.S. companies have the expertise to enhance current oil extraction and explore new oilfields in the Soviet Union.    The bottom line here is an exchange of the Soviet Union's energy resources for our agricultural products. To make this happen, we need to clear away outmoded legal and bureaucratic obstacles that handicap our businessmen and farmers and needlessly complicate such logical, mutually beneficial deals.   The third problem is the stability of the Middle East after the gulf crisis. There are four factors that predate the current crisis and exist independently from it, but which make it more complex and dangerous: the wide gap between the have and have-not Arab states; the Arab population boom throughout the region; the lack of democracy in Arab states as well as a lack of regional economic cooperation among the Arab countries, and the Arab-Israeli conflict.   Taken together, the problems make difficult the possibility of peaceful economic and political development within and among Arab states. The per capita gross national product in the region varies from more than $10,000 in the richest countries to under $1,000 in the poorest, with the bulk of the population living in the poorer countries.   A present Arab population of something over 200 million could swell to some 500 million by the year 2025, placing unprecedented demands on limited resources, including water. And at the moment there is neither a genuine working democracy among the Arab countries nor any significant regional economic cooperation among them. Interrelated problems of this magnitude defy easy solution. There is an encouraging historical precedent, however.   In the late 1940's, the United States responded to economic stagnation in Western Europe with the Marshall Plan, which offered economic assistance once the European countries developed a common plan for economic recovery. Despite the obvious differences between postwar Europe and today's Middle East, the Arab countries need to think in terms of a similar area-wide approach, financed primarily by the region's oil exporting countries.   Regional cooperation should help to ease population pressures and vast economic disparities among Arab states, which taken together with the absence of democratic government contain the seeds of desperation and confrontation. The United States and other democracies should work with the countries of the Middle East to assist their transition to genuinely representative government.   Regional stability cannot be achieved, however, without settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. This is no time for high-profile initiatives that could exacerbate tensions between the Israelis and Arabs. But at some point the conflict will have to be settled through negotiations. Left unattended, the Arab-Israeli problem polarizes and radicalizes the peoples of the region. It provides cover for militarization and military rule in the area. It fuels an ever more lethal regional arms race.   This problem is distinct from the gulf crisis created by Saddam Hussein. Yet out of the current crisis could come a coalition of Arab nations willing to pursue peace directly with Israel. The goal of quiet and creative U.S. diplomacy should be to facilitate renewal and success of the peace process, in the light of changing Middle East realities. Benign neglect is not an acceptable option.

The motivating force in \\"Mrs. Doubtfire,\\" the season's most popular film, is a woman who kicks her husband out for no good reason, and whose crisp professionalism is presented as her worst character flaw. Meanwhile, back at the bookstore, Michael Crichton's latest movie-on-paper is \\"Disclosure\\" (Alfred A.

But Tom Sanders is suspicious, as well he should be: Meredith forces a drink on him, then arranges for her assistant (also a woman) to deliver a package of condoms and lock the door to Meredith's office. If Senator Bob Packwood were accused of this particular behavior it might sound embarrassingly clumsy, but Mr. Crichton presents Meredith as a serious threat to Tom's well-being. \\"She moved toward him in a steady, confident way, almost stalking,\\" he writes in another scene.

(Knopf, $21.) First published in Budapest in 1942, this elegant novel, set in a vast estate and the vanished splendor of Hapsburg empire, peaks in an amazing confrontation after 40 years between two of the parties in an adulterous turn-of-the-century triangle.    MARY SHELLEY, by Miranda Seymour. (Grove, $35.) The author (at 19!) of ''Frankenstein'' lived at the heart of English Romanticism and knew its characters","excerpt":"Seymour's new biography sketches the scientific background of ''Frankenstein'' and delineates the Shelley-Byron circle, including the sexual who-whom rotating around its two dominant rich kids.    THE WORLD BELOW, by Sue Miller. (Knopf, $25.) The grasp of this ambitious novel stretches to seven generations; the narrator, an up-to-date twice-divorced mother, hears in her grandmother's journals the voice of a simpler time, and recognizes the weight and power of the pastoral impulse, valuable however much it is recognized as a simplification.    THE GOOD GERMAN, by Joseph Kanon. (Holt, $26.) The deepest considerations of right and wrong pervade this novel about an American journalist searching for his prewar lover in the ruined (and harrowingly described) Berlin of 1945, where everything is for sale and experience with rocket weapons commands a very high price.    BORROWED FINERY: A Memoir, by Paula Fox. (Holt, $23.) A fascinating, fragmentary account by a novelist who has repeatedly put her life in her fiction; in reality, Fox's existence was somehow a calamitous insult to her mother, who got rid of her as fast as possible.    THE SAVAGE GIRL, by Alex Shakar. (HarperCollins, $26.) A wild first novel about a young woman who has moved to Middle City and taken a job with a trend-spotting visionary who sees a perfect product in diet water.    THE CHEESE MONKEYS: A Novel in Two Semesters, by Chip Kidd. (Scribner, $25.) Fiction, by a notable graphic designer, that feels autobiographical and sometimes acts like a manifesto on graphic design; its hero, a student at a big state university in 1957-58, himself has heroes: a bold, sexy, bohemian woman and a challenging, confrontational design professor.    PRESIDENT NIXON: Alone in the White House, by Richard Reeves. (Simon & Schuster, $35.) The author's deconstructions of Richard Nixon's fevered jottings on long yellow pads, radiating both the nobility and the madness of his own most intimate intentions; moods long familiar become fresh when Reeves reads them against unexpected contexts.    ALL FOR LOVE, by Ved Mehta. (Thunder's Mouth/Nation Books, $24.95.) Mehta's latest autobiographical work steps out of chronological order into the 1960's, when the author was looking for love and not quite finding it; his recollections of four women, and his correspondence with them, poignant and occasionally hilarious, reveal a lot about the era and the man.

There is still time to repair to the garage or basement and build a few of these simple sun-screens of your own.\\n\\nThe reason the A-frame shades are so eagerly sought after is that they are a neat, efficient alternative to the makeshift forms of shelter usually devised by gardeners. Before the A-frames, my garden often looked like a garage sale. Plants temporarily needing protection from the sun and drying winds were subjected to many indignities: tents made from bed sheets, upturned flats and bushel baskets, even inverted flower pots. The lath shades are a great improvement over the flower pots, which provided altogether too much shade and far too much humidity. The purpose of the lath screens is to conserve moisture in the plant's foliage and root zone while admitting light and air. Plants literally feed on the sun's light by converting solar energy into oxygen and sugar, and even a seedling has to eat.

It would be stretching things to say that the medium is making a comeback, although it's about time: like the Democrats, painting has been out of office for so long that, in theory, it ought to be able to do some good. But it does seem that painting has a higher priority among young entry-level artists than it has had in recent seasons. With several galleries mounting painting shows concentrating on younger painters, re-election could be just around the corner.    Although these shows hardly represent the full range of painting being done at the moment, even by the younger generation, they do provide some interesting signals about the medium's direction. Cartoons, usually mixed with abstract elements, are especially hot, as are high-key fluorescent colors, which give some of these shows an undeniable visual bounce. Variations on the all-over composition, whose roots go back to Jackson Pollock's abstract drip paintings, continue to proliferate, often made of tiny semi-legible images.

For example, Jim O'Neal exhumes a stereotype when he writes: \\"White performers could play the music, sing the lyrics and express personal emotions within a blues framework with all degrees of talent and sincerity, but only those born to the blues culture could deliver the blues as defined by B. B. King's 'Why I Sing the Blues.' \\" As other contributors note, however, the blues has served as an \\"incestuous\\" musical relationship between the races since its beginnings. \\"Nothing but the Blues,\\" edited by Lawrence Cohn, who compiled the Grammy-winning \\"Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings,\\" also shows that even the so-called experts cannot agree on what the genre is or where it began. However, besides the photographs, and the inspiring design by Molly Shields, chapters by Mark A. Humphrey and Charles Wolfe are insightful contributions to the scholarship on the blues. Still, some evident prejudices by some of the essayists rankle. The essays by Samuel Charters and David Evans give off the moldy whiff of academia. And Mary Katherine Aldin, writing about \\"the blues today,\\" manages to give but a single reference to Stevie Ray Vaughan. When she writes that \\"not a single young artist is carrying on the tradition of, say, John Lee Hooker,\\" one wants to tell her to turn on the radio.\\nTOM GRAVES IN SHORT: NONFICTION","excerpt":"Shades of Blue"},{"year":"1967","title":"FOR some, the snowdrop is the first flower of spring.

Mr. Malkovich proves his devotion to actors, lingering on them during moments of silence. And the movie echoes its director's own deportment as an actor, alternating silky smoothness with burlap coarseness. The lawyer-turned-police-officer Agustin Rejas (Javier Bardem) is tracking down a pack of guerrillas, led by the man known as Ezequiel. Ezequiel's career traces the same steps as Abimael Guzman, the philosophy professor turned leader of Peru's murderous Shining Path terrorist collective, right down to his capture. Determined, solicitous and calm, Rejas goes about his job, sifting through the wreckage — physical and emotional — left in Ezequiel's wake. Mr. Bardem plays Rejas with a morose wit, a cheekiness that registers almost as an afterthought. He exudes a weary professionalism because his manner is the only tool that keeps him from being subsumed by depression. Mr. Bardem's performance is different from anything he's done before — the vivacious Reinaldo Arenas of &quot;Before Night Falls,&quot; the brooding paraplegic of &quot;Live Flesh&quot; — characters who couldn't hide the tremors of emotion that rocked them to the very core.

But I think it's time that all of us involved in the theater take a closer look at the real source of our woes, which is not strictly, as Mr. Rich and others keep pointing out, the finances of Broadway or the commercialized packaging of everything or the challenge of television, or - what may be called the ''Masterpiece Theater'' syndrome -the feeling that actors with British accents are superior to actors who talk American.   On a broad scale, and with obvious exceptions, British actors are superior, but it's not because they speak better. It's because they have been born and bred in a culture that still honors literature, language and the works of the mind.

The Swan, a theater built within the former premises of the original Memorial Theater, will, of course, have the more long-range effect, allowing the Royal Shakespeare Company to expand its repertory and its perspective. As Trevor Nunn, joint artistic director of the company, said, this will be ''a theater for the performance of 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century plays which can be seen as broadly contextual to our house dramatist, William Shakespeare.'' In the past, a limited number of those plays have been presented at the Other Place, Stratford's small theater, which presumably will now concentrate on new works and more tangential classics.

The members of Mr. Rosset's Teatro do Ornitorrinco perform in Portuguese and there is no simultaneous translation. For an English-speaking audience, the Shakespearean language certainly is missed, but the action is easy to follow and there is something to be said for hearing familiar words spoken in a lilting, unfamiliar language.

These, along with fleeting glimpses of Desdemona and Ariel, led directly into musical images and portraits far more obscure but quite fascinating: orchestral works inspired by Shakespeare and ably conducted by Leon Botstein, the orchestra's music director, at Avery Fisher Hall.   The temptation is to put the word \\"controversial\\" before Mr. Botstein's name, for as most listeners know by now, he is also the president of Bard College and the editor of the Music Quarterly. It has seemed unjust to many that out of an amateur's love of music and a part-time career, he has managed to become music director of a not insignificant orchestra and the dominant figure in the most important contemporary trend in concert programming during the last 50 years.

Together, \\"Richard II,\\" \\"Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2\\" and \\"Henry V\\" comprise an epic that some have compared to \\"The Iliad.\\" Like most epics, the plays chronicle a society in transition -- England's emergence from a feudal state into a Renaissance nation. But when the two parts of \\"Henry IV\\" open on Wednesday at the Public Theater under the direction of JoAnne Akalaitis, with a score by Philip Glass, more than history will be on stage. Shakespeare's passionate characters are moving psychologically from a world of certainty to the modern one of doubt and transience.\\n\\nThe story of Henry Bolingbroke, who led a rebellion against Richard II and who now rules as King Henry IV (played by Larry Bryggman), is also the story of a usurper wracked with guilt and beset with rebellions bloodier than his own. By the end of Part II, the King's son, Prince Hal (Thomas Gibson), who is seen mostly with the lowlifes of Eastcheap, has emerged as an astute Henry V. Shakespeare gives Hal two magnificent foils -- the fiery Hotspur (Jared Harris) and John Falstaff (Louis Zorich), the \\"unimitated, unimitable,\\" as Samuel Johnson described him in 1765.

It is a mature love that brings forth these ringing words: &#8220;The theater is and has always been a necessary part of human life, at all levels, in all parts of the world, at all times.&#8221; New Volumes for the Younger Reader's Bookshelf"},{"year":"1952","title":"Harrison, G B: Shakespeare's Tragedies The Deep And Tragic","excerpt":"SHAKESPEARE'S TRAGEDIES.

We may be in the land of fantasy, but it is a fantasy deeply rooted in a very real, universally felt sense of cosmic flux.   The great strength of Adrian Noble's staging of this late Shakespearean romance is its ability to fold its seemingly disparate elements into a gloriously symmetrical whole. It slights neither the disturbing darkness of the play's first acts nor the sunny ebullience of the pastoral scenes, but it leavens each with comic and potentially tragic elements that inextricably link the two parts.

The 14 ''Sommelier'' glasses - of which the largest, a 37-ounce size intended for vintage Burgundy, was a favorite of both Winston Churchill and Aristotle Onassis - were developed for this purpose by Prof. Claus Josef Riedel of Kufstein in the Austrian Tyrol.

The Riedel family, now in its 10th generation of glassmaking, originally came from Bohemia (Czechoslovakia) where some of the world's finest glass has been produced.

They need to avoid going to the line. Key Players Boston: Eric Montross has been known to get under Shaq's skin and Dino Radja will Grant honest on defense, but the backcourt of Dee Brown and Sherman Douglas is the main keys to shaking down the Magic. Season Review Orlando: Magic ran away with the league's best record until fading down the stretch. Never mind the 39-2 mark at the O-rena","excerpt":"Shaq and friends were a very unFinalslike 18-23 on the road. They lost 6 of their last 10. Season Review Boston: After an abysmal start, the Celtics played through distractions and finished strong. They beat Orlando twice in the regular season, but were only 20-21 at Boston Garden. Prediction: Too much Shaq, never mind season series, Orlando in four. New York Knicks, 55-27, Second place, Atlantic Division vs. Cleveland Cavaliers, 43-39, Fourth place, Central Division Key Players Knicks: Patrick Ewing should have monster series, but Knicks need consistency from John Starks and Hubert Davis from perimeter. Derek Harper's job? Harass Mark Price. With Cavs' decimated frontline, Charles Oakley should dominate.  Key Players Cavaliers: Cavs are still thin at guard even though price is back, he would have to average 30 points to stop the Knicks. Michael Cage and Greg Dreiling are merely too immobile to stop Ewing, Oakley and Anthony Mason. Season Review Knicks: A year after their championship run, they again found a way to overcome distractions, injuries and an offense that took the holidays off. Mentally, Pat Riley has them poised for a return trip. Season Review Cavaliers: Only the Democratic Party lost more starters than the Cavaliers this season. Coach Mike Fratello somehow found a way to milk 43 victories out of a team wrecked by injury. Recent slide does not bode well for playoffs. Prediction: Cavs simply don't have firepower. Knicks in 3. Charlotte Hornets, 50-32, Second place, Central Division vs. Chicago Bulls, 47-35, Third place, Central Division Key Players Charlotte: Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning represent the main obstacle in Chicago's path. Muggsy Bogues's ability to run the half-court set is important, but Del Curry's scoring role off the bench cannot be overlooked. Key Players Chicago: The Hornets need to treat No. 45 like an infectious disease, and quarantine him. For all Scottie Pippen's contributions, the series may come down to how hard B.J. Armstrong hits the open jumper. Season Review Charlotte: Re-emergence of L.J. and 'Zo helped them dash memories of last season's lottery-bound bunch. Scott Burrell is out for the season, though, and that hurts. Allan Bristow's job was saved by his players, can they save him again in the playoffs? Season Review Chicago: Scottie Pippen wanted out, the new United Center was no place like their old home and the Bulls were talking Urban Renewal Project. Re-enter Jordan, and all is well again. Prediction: Hornets have home-court advantage, but Michael Fever prevails. Bulls in 5. Indiana Pacers, 52-30, First Place, Central Division vs. Atlanta Hawks, 42-40, Fifth Place, Central Division Key Players Pacers: Reggie Miller is priming for another run at the Knicks and Rik Smits has been playing better than at any time in his career. Dale Davis and Antonio Davis are too strong inside for Grant Long and Antonio Lang to handle. Key Players Hawks: Stacie Augmon (sprained left ankle, probable) and Mookie Blaylock will try and rattle Mark Jackson in the foreourt. Craig Ehlo can still create his own shot, but Steve Smith from beyond the arc is key component. Season Review Pacers: Despite their perceived dominance, Indiana is only 19-22 on the road. Sure, Jackson has been a catalyst at the point, but the Pacers still rely too much on Miller to come off screens to save them in the crunch. Season Review Hawks: Lenny Wilkens overtook Red Auerbach, but that was it for milestones. The Hawks are 21-13 since Feb. 6 and have won 5 of their last 7, but they are clearly not the team Indiana beat in 6 games in the second round a year ago. Prediction: Miller may be contained, but not stopped. Indiana in 4.
