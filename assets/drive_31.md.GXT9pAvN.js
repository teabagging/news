Benny Bailey, an expatriate trumpeter who last performed in New York City during the late 1970's or early 80's, depending on who's talking, has figured out his approach. He rarely performs any material over a medium tempo, and at that speed, where nothing is circumscribed by velocity, he places his notes carefully, moving from precise and even lines to smears and kissed notes.   One of the many small miracles be-bop bequeathed to jazz in the early 1940's was the even eighth note, and Mr. Bailey, who is appearing at the Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at Perry Street, through Sunday, can play them. His phrases on Tuesday night often featured a lean series of notes whose rhythms were insinuated by the internal weight given notes within a line.

The Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., home of the largest collection of Dalí's work outside Spain -- and a place where visitors can buy flip-flops and lip balm bearing his visage -- wants a new building to battle the triple threat of too many storms, not enough space and not enough money. Recently, its hopes seemed as forlorn as the downcast face in ''The Average Bureaucrat,'' one of the paintings in its collection: Florida newspapers reported that Gov. Jeb Bush would veto relocation funds because he thought them an inappropriate use of the state's Conservation and Recreational Land Fund.    But late last month, Mr. Bush and the mayor of St. Petersburg, Rick Baker, reached a deal. The governor would let the $4 million allocation stand, and the city would spend $2 million to turn a parking lot across the street from the new museum site into a waterfront park. The museum also promised to match the state's contribution through local fund-raising","excerpt":"Mr. Baker said that close to $3.3 million had already been pledged.    The city's efforts on behalf of Dalí, the Surrealist master, who died in 1989, are firmly based in reality. In 2004 the museum attracted more than 220,000 visitors (just 30,000 fewer than the city's population), who contributed an estimated $65 million to the local economy. In that year, Florida was hit with four hurricanes, which all posed a serious risk to St. Petersburg. Hank Hine, the museum's director, said the Dalí had to move its collection of 100 paintings and more than 1,000 other works into storage twice because of the threat of flooding. The museum wants to move from its one-story structure on the waterfront, left, to a new three-story building downtown that would double its floor space to 20,000 square feet and, Mr. Hine said, ''get the collection up higher, away from any flooding.'' He estimated the total cost of the move at $25 million, some of which would come from the sale of the present building. Jacob DiPietre, Governor Bush's spokesman, said last week that Mr. Bush believed the Dalí was ''an important museum, a great place to visit, and after the city made their own funding commitment, he felt releasing the funds was the right thing to do.''

It is simply a genial conformation of an old buck who dreams of bygone days and a young buck who dreams of personal triumphs that he has not been able to achieve.The crusty and grumpy old fellow, played by Gabin, of course, keeps a tiny hotel on the seacoast in a town somewhere near Deauville, where he soberly molders with his trim wife and muses on his youth in China with the French marines. And it is to this place that the young one, the crag-faced Belmondo, comes to lick his wounds in the dead of winter and seek some solace in drinking.The old fellow, sullen at first, resentful at having the young one challenge his bleak sobriety, finally breaks down before the pathos of the young one in whom he sees a counterpart of the pitiful little monkeys that used to seek winter refuge in the Asian cities long ago. He manfully and charitably joins him in a titanic all-night binge that presumably purges both of them of their troubles.The solution for both men's problems seems purely theatrical at best—a contrivance to gratify the audience more than it gratifies them. But it works as entertainment. The boisterous carouse of the two, in which they give the whole town some excitement with a glorious fireworks display, makes a sparklingly comical climax and gives both actors a chance to show their charm and dexterity as toss-pots.There are other charming details—Mr. Gabin marching grumpily to bed, a dreary domestic ritual that he performs delightfully with the excellent support of Suzanne Flon","excerpt":"Mr. Belmondo, slightly pickled, pursuing his secret dream of being a great bullfighter by waving his coat in front of passing motor cars; or Mr. Gabin playing sober father to the piteously potted younger man.Set in the sadness of winter, with rain lashing through the seaside town and glimpses of gray, angry ocean, this moodily masculine story has a strong strain of wistfulness that laces its robust humor and gives it more than merely comic quality. In a sense it is a minor groping toward the heart of the human comedy.Miss Flon is touching in the role of the troubled wife, Noel Roquevert is highly amusing as a quixotic storekeeper, Paul Frankeur does a good job as an ancient drinking companion of Gabin and little Gabrielle Dorziat is affecting as Mr. Belmondo's neglected child.

Weicker Jr., erstwhile Senate maverick, used his strong local appeal to capture the anti-incumbent fever that swept through the electorate and win the election.   Running as an independent, the three-term former Senator defeated the Democratic nominee, Representative Bruce A. Morrison, and the Republican candidate, Representative John G. Rowland.   The House seat abandoned by Mr. Morrison was won by Rosa DeLauro, 47, a Democrat who has never held elective office, in a close contest with State Senator Thomas Scott, 32, a conservative Republican.   Mr. Rowland's vacated seat was filled by fellow Republican Gary Frank, a 37-year-old alderman from Waterbury who beat Toby Moffett. a former Democratic Representative, in a close race.  DELAWARE    In the \\"Small Wonder\\" state, two well-established, well-financed incumbents faced political neophytes who were trying to take advantage of voters' feelings against career politicians.    In the race for the United States Senate, the 47-year-old Democratic incumbent, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., faced M. Jane Brady, a 39-year-old Republican who is chief prosecutor for Sussex County. Ms. Brady called for Congress to be transformed into a citizens' Legislature with a two-term limit","excerpt":"Mr. Biden campaigned on his record. Delaware has only 297,000 registered voters; Democrats hold a slight advantage.    Fighting over Delaware's single seat in the House was the three-term Democratic incumbent, Thomas R. Carper, and Ralph O. Williams, a real estate developer. The savings and loan crisis was a primary issue in the campaign. Mr. Carper is a member of the House Banking Committee, and Mr. Williams is a former president of a savings and loan association.  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA    District of Columbia voters put an outsider, Sharon Pratt Dixon, into the Mayor's seat while turning back Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr.'s bid for electoral redemption in the wake of his misdemeanor conviction on a drug possession charge.   With Democrats outnumbering republicans 9 to 1, Ms. Dixon had no trouble defeating former Police Chief Maurice T. Turner to become the first black woman chosen to run a major city.   Mr. Barry, sentenced to six months in prison last month, ran a distant third in his bid to take one of the two at-large seats on the City Council.    Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat plagued by her failure to file local tax returns, defeated Harry M. Singleton, a Republican, to take the job as the District's non-voting delegate in the House.    The Rev. Jesse Jackson easily won the job as the city's \\"shadow senator\\" post to lobby in the Senate for statehood for the city.  MAINE     The contest for gover nor was termed a race between two incum bents. And indeed, the candidates -- Gov. John R. McKernan Jr., the Republican, and Representative Joseph E. Brennan, the former Governor -- are well known and well financed.    Mr. Brennan excoriated his opponent in 30-second television advertisements for his handling of the state budget.  Mr. McKernan charged that Mr. Brennan had flip-flopped on his sup port for Maine Yankee, the state's nuclear power plant.   Senator William S. Cohen, the Republican incumbent, defeated State Representative Neil Rolde. In the race to replace Mr. Brennan in Maine's First Congressional District, Thomas H. Andrews, a liberal Democrat who had built one of the strongest grass-roots organizations in the state, easily defeated David F. Emery, a conservative Republican, who held the seat from 1975 until he engaged in a disastrous run for the Senate in 1982 against George J. Mitchell.    Mr. Emery angered anti-abortion advocates by switching from an anti-abortion stance to one supporting a woman's right to an abortion. MARYLAND    The incumbent Governor, William Donald Schaefer, a 69-year-old Democrat and ex-Mayor of Baltimore, defeated his Republican opponent, William S. Shepard, a retired Foreign Service officer.   In the state's First Congressional District, the five-term incumbent Democrat, Roy P. Dyson, 41, was defeated by his Republican challenger, Wayne T. Gilchrest, a 44-year-old high school teacher who also ran against him in 1988.    Mr. Dyson had been renominated by his party despite the dislosure that he had been a conscientious objector at the time of the Vietnam War.    Mr. Gilchrest won a Purple Heart as a Marine in Vietnam.   Mr. Gilchrest's support for abortion rights was earlier thought to have lost him some Republican backing.    In addition, Mr. Gilchrest had more liberal positions than Mr. Dyson on some other issues.  MASSACHUSETTS     After a duel that riveted the state's atten tion, John R. Silber, the Boston University presi dent, who ran as the tart-tongued Democratic candidate, conceded vic tory to his Republican opponent, William F.  Weld, the former United States Attorney, who served in the Justice De partment in the Reagan Administration.    Mr. Weld was helped by Dr. Silber's blunt personality, which drove many of the state's Democratic voters to abandon their party.     Both gubernatorial candidates favored approval of Question 3, a tax rollback referendum that would have slashed state revenue by about $1.1 billion through cuts in various fees and taxes, but the voters defeated the proposition.    Senator John Kerry, a Democrat, managed to distance himself from Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, whom he served as Lieutenant Governor from 1982 to 1984, and defeat the Republican, Jim Rappaport.    Only one House member, Chester G. Atkins, a Democrat from the Fifth District, had faced a serious threat. His opponent was State Representative John F. MacGovern.  NEW HAMPSHIRE    Representative Robert C. Smith, widely considered the heir apparent to retiring Republican Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, defeated former Senator John A. Durkin to keep the Senate seat for the Republicans. This was one of three Senate seats around the country that had been left open by retiring Republicans.    The Democrats also were not able to unseat the Republican Governor, Judd Gregg, who easily outpaced his Democratic challenger, Joseph Grandmaison.    Pounding rain and heavy winds kept some voters away early Tuesday. There was a close fight for Mr. Smith's First District seat, which was won by the Republican, William Zeliff, an innkeeper who carried a jar of pennies on the campaign trail and portrayed himself a penny-pinching tightwad.  NEW JERSEY    Senator Bill Bradley defeated Christine Todd Whitman by an unexpectedly slim margin even though he had greatly outspent the virtually unknown Republican candidate.    Throughout the campaign, Mrs. Whitman, a former state official, tried to link Mr. Bradley to the $2.8 billion tax package pushed through the Legislature by Gov. James J. Florio, a Democrat, in his first six months in office.    The new taxes triggered a taxpayer revolt that became the focus of every state, county and local race on Tuesday. Mr. Bradley often found himself ducking attempts to be aligned with Mr. Florio and the tax changes.    Incumbents in 12 of the 14 Congressional Districts were considered safe, but there were tough races in the districts once held by Mr. Florio and his opponent in last year's election for governor, Representative Jim Courter. In Mr. Florio's former First District seat, the Democrat, Robert E. Andrews, the Camden County Freeholder Director, won despite being criticized for his connection to the Governor. In the 12th District, State Senator Richard Zimmer, a Republican, outdistanced Marguerite Chandler.    New Jersey lost one Congressional seat after the 1980 census and is expected to lose another this year. NEW YORK    Without a Senate race this year, considerable attention focused on New York's campaign for governor. But this was not because Mario M. Cuomo, the Democratic incumbent, was in any kind of jeopardy of losing his bid for a third term.   Opponents for the 58-year-old Governor and Queens native were Pierre A. Rinfret, a Republican reluctantly running on the Republican ticket, and Herbert London, a Republican running on the Conservative Party ticket. Mr. Rinfret was trying to stave off a third-place finish for the Republicans, which would cost the party its prized spot on the second row of all ballots in New York for the next four years as well as joint control with the Democrats of every County Board of Elections in the state. PENNSYLVANIA    In an upset, Representative Doug Walgren, a seven-term Democratic Congressman from Pittsburgh, lost to a political neophyte, Richard Santorum, a 32-year-old Republican lawyer who ran on an anti-incumbent theme.    Gov. Robert P. Casey, a popular Democrat and Pennsylvania's first Governor in 43 years not to raise taxes, was re-elected to a second term. His Republican opponent, State Auditor General Barbara Hafer, failed to win much support or money, even from within her own party in this largely Democratic state.    The race initially appeared to be referendum on abortion, with Mr. Casey opposing almost all abortions and Mrs. Hafer supporting a woman's right to abortion. But the issue largely faded behind more immediate concerns like education and the economy.    Redistricting is expected to cost Pennsylvania 2 of its 23 seats in the House, and how the political map will be redrawn depended on a handful of close races for the State Legislature.    Ballot initiatives sought voter approval for selling bonds to build prisons and buy equipment for firefighters and ambulance services.  RHODE ISLAND    Bruce G. Sundlun, a 70-year-old Democratic broadcasting executive, was elected Governor, defeating the incumbent, Edward D. DiPrete, a 56-year-old Republican in a heavily Democratic state.   Mr. Sundlun lost to Mr. DiPrete in the last two races for governor, but only by a narrow margin in 1988.    Mr. DiPrete's popularity began a free fall that year, after his family made $2 million in a single day on a real estate transaction in Cranston, where Mr. DiPrete had served as Mayor.    Claiborne Pell, a Democrat who has spent 39 of his 71 years in the Senate, won another term. He defeated Claudine Schneider, a 43-year-old Republican, who gave up her seat in the House.    The state has only two seats in the House. Ronald K. Machtley, the Republican incumbent, defeated Scott Wolf, a Democratic political consultant. In the contest over the seat vacated by Ms. Schneider, State Representative Jack Reed, a Democrat, defeated Trudy Coxe, a Republican who has been involved in environmental issues.  VERMONT    Bernard Sanders, a socialist who ran as an independent, won Vermont's only Congressional seat, upsetting the incumbent, Peter Smith, a Republican. Mr. Sanders, who was Mayor of Burlington from 1981 to 1989, toned down his Marxist slogans and ran on a populist platform attacking Washington politicians.    Richard A. Snelling, the popular four-term Republican Governor from 1976 to 1984, was elected to another term. He defeated Peter F. Welch, the first Democratic President pro tempore of the Republican-controlled State Senate.    Mr. Snelling, who is 63 years old and owns an investment business, tried to project an image as a fiscal conservative and prudent manager. Mr. Welch, 43, sought to undermine Mr. Snelling's campaign with negative advertising that portrayed Mr. Snelling as a wealthy businessman out of touch with the concerns of most Vermonters.   Governor Madeleine M. Kunin, a Democrat, did not seek re-election.  WEST VIRGINIA    Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th coasted into his second term, handily defeating John Yoder, a lawyer from Harper's Ferry.    Mr. Rockefeller, who spent most of his first term working on unglamorous health, transportaion and economic issues affecting the state, defused Mr. Yoder's campaign charges that he was a \\"captive of special interests.\\"    Voters in the mountains of the Second Congressional District rejected Oliver Luck's attempt to capitalize on his fame as a quarterback at the University of West Virginia.     He was defeated by Representative Harley O. Staggers Jr., who will return to Washington for a fifth term in the House.

A female announcer says: ''A lot has happened since then. Today, New York is considered one of the safest cities in the country.'' Mr. Bloomberg says, ''Together we have worked hard to bring progress to our city.'' The announcer says, ''Not only did we keep the city from bankruptcy during the last four years, we are also experiencing an economic renaissance in all five boroughs.'' Mr. Bloomberg says, ''We still have a lot to accomplish.'' The announcer says, ''Day after day, we are improving our public schools, through several programs focused on school safety and academic excellence.'' Mr. Bloomberg says: ''But with everyone's effort, the best is yet to come. Thank you for your trust and support.''

ACCURACY -- New York does regularly rank toward the top of the list of the safest big cities in America, and Mr. Bloomberg does win credit for guiding the city back from recession, though that was accomplished with assistance from an increase in property taxes that was pushed through with the help of the City Council and Council Speaker Gifford Miller, who is running in the Democratic mayoral primary. The mayor frequently points out that the city still faces an annual structural deficit in the billions. While several economic indicators are pointing upward and unemployment is relatively low, it is stubbornly higher among minorities. Mr. Bloomberg's schools initiative has so far been judged by many experts to be mixed, though test scores due out today were being eagerly anticipated.    SCORECARD -- Mr. Bloomberg will probably win points with Hispanic voters for speaking in Spanish in this spot, even if his accent is less than authentic. And with shots of him in neighborhoods with New Yorkers of various races, it seems to do an effective job at combating Democrats' charges that he is Manhattancentric and out of touch with the people of his city.

Property and casualty insurers, especially the small companies, argue that they need to share data on claims so they can price products according to the best available information. That is a valid argument -- and Mr. Brooks's plan would preserve the right of insurers to share raw data.

With the exception of about five minutes, the play isn't very good.That five minutes, however, would neutralize half an hour of \\"The Armored Vault's\\" mediocrity. It is the suspense scene, when hunter and hunted are in a large vault, expecting a mine to go off and bury them all. The clock on the mine ticks off the moments slowly, while the prisoners rush around frantically trying to find some method to save themselves. But then when the mine does explode, the whole affair turns out to be a dream.The hero of the piece is a detective named Stuart Webbs, who apparently goes the Northwest Mounted one better. He is so good at the profession that a group of counterfeiters try to buy him off. As he is honest and refuses the invitation, they take him prisoner. His escape soon follows, with the rest of the picture showing his endeavors to bring about the well-known ends of justice.Scattered through the length of the film are snatches of comedy which unfortunately deserve some sort of qualifying adjective. They are not very funny, and they serve only to delay the action. One of them deals with the outwitting of the heroic master-detective (not a difficult feat), thus dashing the whole business into counter-point.Mr. Reicher takes the part of the detective.

A6    What has really dominated the pages of most Hong Kong newspapers over the last week, like every other week, is crime. Even at this climactic turning point in the city's history, the bulk of news fare consists of tales of robbery, sexual harassment and bizarre moments of human tragedy.   A6    The Tricky Job of Repairing Mir  The commander of the Mir space station has had his brushes with disaster, but he still has worries about his latest assignment: repairing the stricken vessel, which was severely damaged last week when a supply vehicle crashed into it.

The World","excerpt":"Mr. Clinton Will See You, But He Won't Meet You"},{"year":"1995","title":"THE ECONOMY There Was Nothing to Inflate but Fear of Inflation Itself  Inflation, inflation, inflation -- that's all we heard about last year. Dire warnings, hand-wringings -- and, of course, repeated Federal Reserve interest-rate increases to head it off. But when the final '94 numbers came in last week, one couldn't help wondering what all the fuss was about. Dread inflation, as measured by consumer prices, was a puny 2.7 percent for the year -- the fourth straight year under 3 percent. With one exception, in fact, that was the lowest rate in three decades. And there were signs that the mighty economy was slowing, too. The Commerce Department reported that retail sales had slumped unexpectedly in December -- and, a bigger surprise, that November was weaker than first reported. This was taken as a sign that the Fed might hold off on future rate increases, and stocks and bonds roared ahead. Oh, Yes: The Minimum Wage  It's often hard to tell Democrats from Republicans these days -- from the silvery wads of hair atop Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich to those near-unison tax and welfare cantatas. But one issue survives: the minimum wage. Mr. Clinton, campaigner, vowed to raise it","excerpt":"Mr. Clinton, President, shelved it as he took that messy health care detour. Now it's back. Al Gore and Richard Gephardt (who calls it \\"a metaphor for the differences\\" between the parties) want to raise the wage, whose buying power is slipping mercilessly, while Dick Armey, House majority leader, wants to scrap the wage floor entirely. The case for keeping it at $4.25: raising it would mean wide job losses, and most low-wage workers are teen-agers, not breadwinners. Economists beg to differ: their studies predict negligible job losses, and show that just a third of four million minimum-wage earners are teen-agers; nearly half provide vital family support.  California Takes a Bath  Merrill Lynch and Orange County lobbed grenades back and forth last week in their billion-dollar blame game. First Merrill released letters showing that it had warned the county in 1992 that it was playing with fire with its explosive investment fund. Then the county sued Merrill for $2 billion, saying the firm had misrepresented the securities -- that it was illegal to buy them anyway. Merrill's response: the county was glad to get hefty returns for years, but now, \\"in effect, they're saying, 'Heads we win, tails you lose.' \\" . . . As this was unfolding, the gods got impatient with all the finger-pointing and unleashed 40 days' and 40 nights' worth of rain on the entire state (all in just a few days).  Hit the Ice, Already!  With football nearing its orgasmic finale and baseball a fuzzy memory, sports addicts who suffer post-Super Bowl withdrawal faced the horrifying prospect of having only basketball to distract them. (Sports pages would probably soon be reporting basement Ping-Pong games.) But last week it appeared that there'd be a hockey season after all. The settlement was grumpy, though -- both union and management were so dissatisfied, there wasn't even a public handshake.  Greenspan Has a Better Way  As the battle raged last week over that bit of mandated morality known as a balanced-budget amendment, Alan Greenspan unexpectedly offered to toss $150 billion into the kitty. The Government, he insists, could save that much over five years if it would just calculate inflation more carefully. The price index, he says, exaggerates inflation by 0.5 to 1.5 points, and since so many payments are tied to inflation -- Social Security, pensions, some union wages -- billions go out needlessly. Republicans liked the idea, though it does involve treading on that sacred ground called Social Security, while Democrats didn't waver from their demand that would-be budget-balancers \\"show us the fine print,\\" as Richard Gephardt put it. Jobs, in Black and White  \\"Economic recovery\\" -- those are empty words to most blacks. While the rosy numbers pile up -- on unemployment, say, or consumer prices -- blacks, as usual, are left far behind. There's been a breakthrough of sorts, for recent data show that the unemployment rate for blacks just dipped below 10 percent for the first time since 1974. It's probably just a statistical breakthrough, though, for if you scratch job numbers even slightly you see that they count only those looking for work, not those discouraged long ago. After all, just 24 percent of black youths are working, and 49 percent of whites.  INTERNATIONAL Resolved: To Help Mexico  Democrats and Republicans were in clear agreement last week: they wanted a quick end to the Mexican crisis. That $18 billion credit line announced over a week ago clearly didn't do the trick, as both the peso and Mexican stocks kept falling. So the White House, with quick support from Congressional Republicans, came up with a big package of loan guarantees (it didn't give numbers, though estimates put it as high as $40 billion). And -- this was vital -- the move, involving loans, didn't open up any hornets' nests by adding to the budget back home. One thing in peril, of course, is the success of the North American Free Trade Agreement -- if the peso stays weak, there'll be precious few exports to Mexico. Hail the Conquering Apple!  Life without apples, some say, is not worth living -- though the Japanese have somehow muddled through. With a good apple costing up to $6 in Japan, they've been treasured gifts, not daily fare. But salvation has arrived -- greeted by thankful hordes. Japan, never known to open its markets lightly, lifted import restrictions a quarter century ago -- in theory. In fact, it has kept foreign apples out all these years for fear that they'd carry disease (or so it said). But last week was D-Day for American apples, and Japanese consumers snatched them up in no time. At last report, no Japanese had been banished from their island Eden for partaking of this once-forbidden joy. COMPANIES Soon It'll Be the 'Gatesnet'  Clearly, it's not enough for Bill Gates to be the nation's richest human, to dominate the software universe, to build himself a digital San Simeon. No, he wants the world -- and since his world is computers, that means the Internet. Last week he said Microsoft had plans to be one of the world's largest commercial providers of Internet access, through its Microsoft Network, to start later this year. This, of course, puts strong competitive pressure on Compuserve, Prodigy and the like -- and could also provide a great lure for businesses, now computer-wary, to make the digital plunge.  Defy Microsoft at Your Peril  In case there were any lingering doubts about Microsoft's software dominance, just look at Borland International. Philippe Kahn, who founded Borland in 1983, kept lashing out defiantly at Microsoft -- and kept getting swatted down. It was undercut by a Microsoft desktop-application package it couldn't match, and it was late delivering key programs -- all adding up to repeated losses. So last week, after months of demands by big investors, Mr. Kahn resigned as chief executive -- though he'll stay on as chairman. The next step: possibly a sale of the company, either as a whole or in parts. Golf? Not for Dr. Vagelos  What do you do when you retire, at 65, from a mighty career? You could play golf, but that didn't appeal to P. Roy Vagelos. Dr. Vagelos, who built Merck into a drug giant before leaving in November, joined a tiny biotech company called Regeneron Pharmaceuticals last week -- saying, in partial explanation, \\"I don't play golf.\\" Is this a rerun of John Sculley's disastrous sojourn at Spectrum? After all, Regeneron has lost millions, recent tests of one drug were unsuccessful, and its shares have plunged (though they jumped on this news). Dr. Vagelos sees more, calling the company's scientists \\"some of the best I have seen.\\" What, No Dashboard Nintendo?  \\"Oh, reason not the need!\\" King Lear thundered. \\"Our basest beggars have too many cup holders!\\" But did Detroit listen? Of course not. Back when Detroit held its head up high, any car worth its chrome had fins you could ski down, or some awesome number of \\"horses.\\" But drivers barely drive these days -- they're so busy talking on the car phone, playing a CD, drinking coffee. So at the Auto Show in Detroit last week, the big news was things like cup holders -- G.M.'s mini-vans have 14 (14!) of them -- and his-and-hers climate controls. All, in the words of Robert Eaton, Chrysler's chairman, to give drivers \\"things they don't even know they want.\\" It's Chrysler's fault, of course -- it started the Great Cup Holder War when, a decade ago, it popularized those family-rooms-on-wheels called mini-vans.  A Statement That Refreshes  Is Coca-Cola trying to buy Quaker Oats? Opinions vary. Dan Dorfman, of CNBC, says it is. Investors went along, sending Quaker's stock up $4.50 on Friday.

By asking the two on a trip to Poland, where they discover that the Polish couple who hid Mr. Daum's father-in-law and two brothers are still alive, Mr. Daum hopes to shake his sons from their separatism, but even when confronted by such compelling, living evidence of goodness in the non-Jewish world, neither one is willing to abandon his prejudices.

''Milestones 2'' picks up Mr. Davis's career in 1960 and is an indispensable turntable companion.

Mr. Chambers does a commendable job of relating Mr. Davis's music to larger jazz trends. He also succeeds in conveying the forces at work in Mr. Davis's private life - his battle against the debilitating side effects of sickle-cell anemia, his fourth marriage, to the actress Cicely Tyson, and his frequent brushes with the law and with racial prejudice real and imagined. As was true of the earlier volume, there is some vital spark missing from ''Milestones 2.'' Mr. Chamberws keeps his distance from his subject - perhaps the ideal stance for a critic but not for a biographer. Denied access to Mr. Davis, who is notoriosly unfriendly to those who would write about him, and curiorusly disinclined to conduct interviews with the trumpeter's associates, Mr. Chambers has relied too heavily on secondary sources.

And now, in \\"He Stayed for Breakfast,\\" which arrived at the Roxy yesterday, Columbia's Alexander Hall is letting the comrades have it with both barrels of a satiric pop gun. But at the risk of being suspected as a tool of Moscow gold, we are compelled to report this morning that the damage is only slight.Basically, Mr. Hall is starting out from the same premise as Mr. Lubitsch: namely, that a Communist zealot, especially an attractive one, is fair and easy game when baited with luxuries and the blandishments of the opposite sex. Thus when Communist Melvyn Douglas (who has since been absolved by Congressman Dies) seeks refuge in the Paris apartment of beauteous and capitalistic Loretta Young while fleeing the police, the trap is obviously sprung on an eventual convert to plutocracy.Naturally, the process of conversion is deliciously prolonged, since Mr. Douglas is, of course, a rude and headstrong fellow. But it is only a matter of time before he completely succumbs to the irresistible attractions of Miss Young, her lovely gowns, her fragrant scent, her well-stocked larder and—oh, yes—her profound political philosophy. \\"Communism,\\" says Miss Young, \\"is government without people.\\" And again: \\"You are always talking about the poor and the rich. There are only two kinds of people—male and female.\\" Now, how could Mr. Douglas be expected to refute that logic?There is, no one can deny, the basis for a good satire in this story. Mr. Lubitsch already has proved it, in reverse. But Mr. Hall has handled his plot with so little wit, so little comic invention, that the picture which reels off on the screen is generally labored and obvious.

Only Una O'Connor, as a lady's maid, brings a touch of distinction to her character during a scene wherein she throws off her chains of economic slavery with the assistance of a bottle of brandy. Otherwise it is just a run of wisecracks about saboting this or that and taking orders from Moscow and the subversive activities of unions—much like the jokes you might hear at a banker's convention.

The principals, Cathy O'Donnell, Dane Clark and Tom Drake, are personable but not particularly incisive performers. Furthermore, the plot, which has a virtuous schoolmarm loyally shielding her ex-husband, a gambler turned murderer, until a smitten detective rescues the lady for himself, gets more pat and familiar as it moves along.For at least two-thirds of the way, though, the picture isn't hard to take at all. Ralph Murphy's direction is intelligently restrained, the acting is generally forthright and the dialogue supplied by Jesse L. Lasky Jr.'s and Jerome Odlum's script is tangy and spontaneous. The picture almost comes off as a modestly substantial suspense yarn.But a typical, tacked-on chase, with good Mr. Drake toppling bad Mr. Clark off a waterfront girder and Miss O'Donnell batting her eyes, dulls the preceding niceties and makes the whole thing seem inconsequential, which it probably is, anyway.

Former Ambassador Deane R. Hinton, a diplomat recalled, was ''responsible for the Government - He's the one that butted their heads together.'' The result was a government headed by a political independent, Alvaro Magana, and a commission with representatives from all legal political parties.    This year, the American Embassy and the army have played a quieter but watchful role in the presidential campaign that culminates next Sunday in a runoff between Mr. d'Aubuisson and Jose Napoleon Duarte, the candidate of the moderate Christian Democrats. For example, when the Central Elections Council complained of weariness during the laborious counting after the first round on March 25, Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering bluntly reminded them that their work was more important than their beauty sleep, an American diplomat said. Embassy officials later met with Francisco Jose Guerrero, the conservative candidate whom they had preferred, before he announced his neutrality in the runoff.

Mr. Fair is the kind of rocker emancipated by punk rock: a nerdy, bespectacled guy with a nasal tenor voice and a determinedly innocent optimism. His songs seesaw between utopian love and childlike misadventures. In \\"Silver and Katherine,\\" he sang, \\"Everything I thought was right turned out to be so good, so true and so right.\\" In another song, he becomes upset that his girlfriend doesn't answer the door, then finds her tied up by a monster he has to slay. At times, as in \\"The Last Straw,\\" Mr. Fair does get angry: \\"There's only so far you can push me/And buddy, that was it.\\" But he's a lover, not a fighter.

It is a popular type of entertainment in which both the young players give far better performances than they have done in other audible productions.Miss Gaynor and Mr. Farrell have not been seen together since they appeared last April in \\"High Society Blues.\\" In this melodrama they have a better opportunity than they had in the previous vocal picture and they make the most of it, for what they may lack in diction—and that is much improved—they atone for by the marked sincerity of their work.The several unexpected turns in this story won favor with both young and old, particularly the satisfactory ending—evidently a surprise to many—which elicited unusual enthusiasm as the performers vanished from the screen. It was most interesting to watch the expressions of the spectators, so absorbed were most of them in the doings of Miss Gaynor as Angie, the attractive San Francisco cabaret singer, and Mr. Farrell as Stephen Randolph, the spoiled son of a New York millionaire.Soon, after Angle falls in love with Randolph, she learns that he has signed and given out several worthless checks. His father, Thomas Randolph, hopeful of teaching Stephen a strong lesson, arranges for the young man to be shanghaied aboard a vessel bound for China. Through one of those pardonable coincidences, Stephen encounters Angie in a Shanghai den of iniquity.A year passes and Stephen and Angie, now married, are living in Honolulu. Captain Trevelyan, whom Stephen knows as a friend of his father's, has bought the plantation adjoining that of the young couple. He is an individual with sinister designs and one learns the reason for his conduct in a closing episode. Trevelyan shocks Angie by telling her that her husband has taken a drink, something he had not done for more than a year. When Stephen comes home that evening he brings a bottle of whisky with him and Angie is so worried that to keep him from drinking she pretends that she has taken some drugs. These incidents worried the audience yesterday.Later, when matters are set right, Stephen learns from his aunt who has come to Hawaii that his father is very ill and needs his son. Stephen is told that he must choose between his father's life and her's (Angie). When young Randolph elects to stay with Angie, the Roxy gathering applauded lustily.The closing glimpses may not be far from what one conjectures, but the incidents are developed quite neatly.The dialogue is not particularly bright, but it serves the purpose of the story. Miss Gaynor gives an exhibition of really fine acting in most of her scenes. Mr. Farrell is at his best when he is beheld as the derelict in China. Considering the task he has to tackle, Kenneth MacKenna serves the film quite well as Captain Trevelyan. William Holden is excellent as Randolph's father.Raoul Walsh has done well in his direction, the scenes in China suiting the mood of the picture. There is cheer in the Honolulu scenes and revelry and gayety in the San Francisco flashes.The surrounding program has the usual dignity of Mr. Rothafel's contributions.

Forrester, the Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey, began running this week on cable and network stations in New York and Philadelphia.    PRODUCERS -- Stevens, Reed, Curcio & Potholm.    ON THE SCREEN -- This decidedly austere ad opens with a shot of former Gov. Thomas H. Kean in a wood-paneled setting, like a library, with a delicate piano theme playing. There are two shots of Mr. Forrester speaking with Mr. Kean -- one on the front porch of a home, the other inside the library with Mr. Kean seated at a desk. But the ad mainly relies on the countenance of the widely respected Mr. Kean, his familiar Brahmin accent and the persistent weight of his popularity 15 years after he served as governor. Text blocks with Mr. Forrester's pledge to end what he sees as a culture of corruption in Trenton, and his property tax relief plan, also appear briefly on screen before the ad concludes with Mr. Kean and the words: ''Doug Forrester for Governor the Change We Need.''    THE SCRIPT -- ''I don't like some of the things being said about my friend Doug Forrester. They're just not true. I've known Doug for over 30 years. Like me, Doug is his own man. He's a moderate who supports a woman's right to choose. And Doug Forrester is one of the most honorable men I've ever known. Doug will clean up the corruption in Trenton, and he has a real plan to cut property taxes by 30 percent in three years. Doug Forrester is the change we need to save New Jersey.''    ACCURACY -- Mr. Forrester reaches for an endorsement from one of the state's most revered public figures, of either major party, of the past generation. Mr. Kean also happens to be Mr. Forrester's former boss","excerpt":"Mr. Forrester helped manage the state's pension fund for part of the Kean administration. In painting Mr. Forrester as a moderate, Mr. Kean correctly lays out his former employee's stated positions on issues like abortion rights. Left unspoken, however, are things like Mr. Forrester's stance on topics including embryonic stem-cell research, which he opposes. Democrats have used such topics to align Mr. Forrester with the extremists in his party.    SCORECARD -- Mr. Forrester could hardly have chosen a more soothing voice to ease the concerns of skittish voters who may wonder how conservative he is as the Republican standard-bearer. The use of the popular Mr. Kean is a shrewd move, as several polls show that the gap is closing between Mr. Forrester and United States Senator Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic nominee.

With a velvety sound that gauged the small playing space perfectly, Mr. Gampel made his New York City recital debut at the Frick Collection on Wednesday afternoon. He thrived on the Scriabin Second Sonata and Chopin's Variations on \\"La ci darem la mano,\\" but seemed more than a little uneasy in Schubert's Impromptus (D. 899) and the Schumann \\"Faschingsschwank aus Wien.\\"   When Scriabin's florid, ever-moving detail or Schubert's rhythmic left-hand accompaniments locked Mr. Gampel's melodic movement into place, the pianist became a sound interpreter. When confronted with unadorned melody, however, he seemed at a loss. The Intermezzo from the Schumann, for example, is phrased in one dramatic breath: an upward leap and downward swoop toward dissonance and resolution","excerpt":"Mr. Gampel draws back in mid-plunge, totally dismantling the effect.

However, his opening observation, that anti-Semitism is \\"generally on the wane in this country,\\" might come as a surprise to many who have been combating the increasing number of hate crimes in neighborhoods and on college campuses.   While Mr. Gates hints at a class division in the African-American community, he does not discuss the key role African-American nationalism plays in perpetuating some of what people believe are anti-Semitic beliefs. There are books popular among young African-American students primarily because they present a simplistic understanding of how society is governed or operates.

Mr. Gatton, an extraordinary guitarist who has developed a strong following, opened the show by enveloping a handful of musical styles with the assault of his clanging guitar. American pop music is often formal, but it runs on strong doses of anarchy","excerpt":"Mr. Gatton, who knows most of the American vernacular guitar styles -- blues, country, rock and some jazz -- is more than willing to push the limits of the genres he fools with. His improvisations sprayed out notes in clumps, let loose silvery runs that ended in bursts of shrill shrieks, and used a beer bottle to draw a harsh scream from the guitar.    But Mr. Gatton isn't a great band leader, and he and his band plodded along through blues and standards at numbingly high volume. The show closed with the Radiators, a mediocre bar band that tried some elemental group improvisation that at times seemed empathetic and supple. As it did with Mr. Gatton, the Ritz's sound system turned the Radiators' music into a clotted mess. But even that couldn't hide the routine mid-1970's approach to rock -- earnest, slightly regional and competent enough to form the background music for a Saturday night party.

The history of the Holocaust bristles with controversial issues","excerpt":"Mr. Gilbert himself has devoted a previous book to one such problem, the Allied reaction (or lack of reaction) to Auschwitz while it was still possible to do something about it. But on this occasion he is concerned with the broad course of events as they affected Jews throughout Nazi-occupied Europe, and with telling the story of what actually happened, rather than with why it happened or what might have happened instead.   A straightforward task doesn't necessarily mean an easy task, and that Mr. Gilbert's chronicle should be as effective as it is represents a formidable achievement. As far as possible he has attempted to let the victims speak for themselves, drawing on an enormous amount of documentary research (much of it into sources that have only become available in recent years), and talking to numerous survivors. He has also used his professional skills as a historian - he is best known as the official biographer of Winston Churchill - to sort out and appraise his material, to strike a balance between different aspects of the story, and (not least) to weave the scattered and often fragmentary evidence into a seamless narrative.

The brief, intense war that followed -- called the Yom Kippur War, after the Jewish holiday on which the fighting started -- is the subject of Amos Gitai's new film, ''Kippur,'' which will be shown tonight at the New York Film Festival. The battlefield action in the film is bloody and relentless","excerpt":"Mr. Gitai is working in the close-to-the-ground, hyper-realist mode of Sam Fuller's ''Big Red One'' and the opening battle sequences of Steven Spielberg's ''Saving Private Ryan.'' War, according to this style of filmmaking, is an existential rather than a political event. The causes -- and even, in this case, the outcome -- of the conflict matter less than the experiences of the men who fight.    ''Kippur'' might be described as an anti-war movie. Not because it takes a stand against the Yom Kippur War, or war in general -- the soldiers in the film accept the necessity of fighting, and the film never questions their commitment -- but because Mr. Gitai, who wrote the screenplay with Marie-Jose Sanselme, does his utmost to resist the conventions of the genre.

Robinson 3d as chairman and promoting Harvey Golub to chief executive said yesterday that they were resigning.   Rawleigh Warner Jr., 71, the retired chairman and chief executive of the Mobil Corporation and an American Express director for more than 20 years, told the board after its meeting on Monday of his intentions and submitted a letter yesterday saying that he would step down immediately, two months before he had planned to retire. He said he no longer felt it was appropriate to remain a director after he had opposed the company's top managers. 'Thoughtful Consideration'    Joseph H. Williams, a director since 1981, told the company that he would not stand for re-election in April and that he would resign immediately as a member of the compensation committee. Mr. William, 58, said in a statement that \\"after thoughtful consideration\\" and \\"the very strong dissent I registered\\" he felt it would have been inappropriate to remain on the board. Mr. Williams is chairman and chief executive of the Williams Companies.   John J. Byrne, 61, the chairman and chief executive of the Fund American Companies, confirmed in an interview that he had told the board in mid-November, two months after the search had begun, that he would not stand for re-election in April. He cited personal reasons for his resignation that had nothing to do with the board's decision to keep Mr. Robinson in place and elevate Mr. Golub.   The three men had voted with the minority when Mr. Robinson and Mr. Golub won their new positions in a 15-to-4 board vote Monday. The 57-year-old Mr. Robinson had been chairman and chief executive since 1977","excerpt":"Mr. Golub, 53, had been the company president since 1991. The board considered their appointments as one ticket after a search committee, with Mr. Robinson as co-chairman, failed in four months to produce an alternative candidate to Mr. Golub to succeed Mr. Robinson as chief executive.   Mr. Warner stressed that he was stepping down of his own volition: \\"It was entirely me. There was no effort to push me off.\\"   But he acknowledged that the ascension of Mr. Robinson and Mr. Golub had hastened his departure, with the company's mandatory retirement age at 72. Had an alternative to the Robinson-Golub ticket been presented to the board, he added, he would have served out his term.   \\"It was a very simple decision,\\" he said in an interview. \\"I started the process of urging the board to replace Jimmy. The board did not see fit to agree with that position. So I didn't feel right having been so out of line with the rest of the board to stay on. It wouldn't have been good for me, for Jimmy, for Harvey or for the board. I would have been embarrassed to sit there as if I hadn't started anything.\\"   Mr. Warner denied he felt any sadness or disappointment with his decision, calling himself \\"a pragmatist.\\" Before last year, he said, he was serving on six boards. By April, when he intends to leave the Caterpillar Inc. board, he will have resigned from them all.   Mr. Byrne, an American Express director since 1991, cited \\"personal reasons\\" for his pending departure. He elaborated only to the extent that he said his own business affairs needed more attention. He declined to entertain any questions about the succession or Monday's election results.   \\"This had to do with the fact that my own affairs needed attention,\\" he said in a telephone interview from his office in Norwich, Vt., adding: \\"I am not a good outside director. I am used to managing things and not good when I am not. It was not a terrific fit for me and not a terrific fit for the board.'   Mr. Byrne's company is a financial holding company, built upon what had been the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company.   With the departures of Mr. Warner, Mr. Williams and Mr. Byrne, the American Express board is left with just one director who voted against the Robinson-Golub team. However, it is not clear who the fourth dissenter was.   A spokesman for the American Express Company, Michael O'Neil, said he did not know if any other board members intended to retire. 3 Quit American Express Board"},{"year":"2009","title":"An article and an accompanying picture caption last Thursday about the spread of organic gardening at Harvard referred incompletely to the Rev.

The Economist last week read the riot act to both the Administration and the Fed: \\"Not only has the Bush Administration shown itself incapable of exercising wise economic leadership but, much more disturbing, it seems that the Federal Reserve stands ready to do its bidding.\\"    In Germany, however, the Bundesbank has been acting like Horatio at the bridge, defending its strong anti-inflationary policy and interest-rate structure against any and all threats from the Eastern provinces of Germany, Brussels, Bonn or Washington.    Does this contrast in German and American central-bank style simply reflect a difference in the personalities of the fiery Karl Otto Pohl, the president of the Bundesbank who announced his resignation yesterday for personal reasons, and the mild Mr. Greenspan? Or does it represent a difference in politics? (Mr. Pohl is a Social Democrat, unlike the Christian Democratic Chancellor, Helmut Kohl","excerpt":"Mr. Greenspan a Republican, like President Bush.) But the Bonn Government proclaims its own anti-inflationary fervor, and the mark has risen on the market's expectations that when Mr. Pohl leaves he will be replaced by an equally orthodox keeper of the Bundesbank's faith and integrity.    The difference in German and American monetary policies may represent contrasting national cultures, with Germans giving their highest priority to avoiding inflation and Americans to avoiding depression. The greatest economic trauma of Germany was the hyperinflation of the early 1920's, which wiped out the value of money, undermined the middle class and prepared the soil for Nazism. The worst economic trauma of the United States was the Great Depression and mass unemployment of the 1930's, which transformed capitalism and gave the state the responsibility of insuring high employment.    Yet there is still another way of interpreting recent Federal Reserve vs. Bundesbank behavior: as a reflection of their different reactions to the respective political and economic dangers facing both countries. In the United States, both the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index rose in April by a modest two-tenths of 1 percent. Since December, under the impact of the recession, producer prices have declined at an annual rate of about 3.5 percent. And since February, consumer prices have risen at an annual rate of only about 1 percent. In 1990, consumer prices rose by 6.1 percent and producer prices by 5.6 percent.    As a result of the sharp decline in inflation, there has been little or no decline in real interest rates, measured as nominal interest rates minus the current or prospective rate of inflation. Since the recession began last July, the Treasury bill rate has come down to 5.57 percent from 7.66 percent.   Without a cut in real, rather than just nominal, rates, the economic recovery is likely to get no help from monetary policy. How much should real rates come down to help the economy overcome its sluggishness? At a recent conference at the Jerome Levy Economic Institute of Bard College, Prof. Benjamin Friedman of Harvard said, \\"I don't know and I don't pretend to know exactly how much real interest rates would have to come down, but I do know they haven't come down that much.\\"    He calculated that the one-year Treasury bill rate has come down \\"visibly less\\" than the decline in the average inflation rate in seven of the last eight recessions. \\"What recovery we have in the next year,\\" Professor Friedman said, \\"will be recovery not because of monetary policy but despite monetary policy.    But as inflation eases in the United States, inflationary expectations are rising in Germany. Though the Consumer Price Index for the whole of Germany has been rising at an annual rate of about 3 percent, up only slightly from the 1990 rate of 2.7 percent, inflation has soared at an annual rate of 20 percent to 30 percent in what was formerly East Germany, said Adolphe J. Warner, chairman of Global Assets Management Associates and the retired senior adviser to the Deutsche Bank Capital Corporation.    The East Germans have been unable thus far to rid themselves of the incubus of their Communist past, with its inculcated habits of high but concealed inflation, low or negative productivity growth, widespread underemployment and (often concealed) unemployment, a lack of initiative and subservience to political masters.   The threat to inflation in the Federal Republic of Germany stems not just from the Eastern provinces but from the Government's huge expenditures on the East, big budget deficits and potential membership on the Bundesbank board of political hacks from the East.    Thus, the contrasts between German and American monetary policy stem not just from cultural or theoretical differences but from real differences in the political and economic problems confronting each country. This may be becoming a global economy, but nation-states and national currencies still matter.

That was before the 53-year-old Finance Minister got caught in a storm that every other politician in the country wants to duck: the biggest stock scandal in postwar Japanese history.    When the scandal broke -- with its charges that Japan's major brokerages lent money to gangsters and gave upward of $900 million in \\"compensation\\" to their biggest clients -- Mr. Hashimoto said his ministry was shocked and appalled. While the schemes violated no laws, they were clearly improper, and contributed to the widespread belief that the Tokyo Stock Exchange is a clubby place where big players get taken care of and little ones should get out of the way. The ministry, Mr. Hashimoto was quick to add, had no hints that such improprieties were widespread.

Mr. Helms has been assailing Mr. Gantt in these closing days as a supporter of racial quotas and \\"mandatory gay rights,\\" including the forced hiring of gay school teachers. Mr. Gantt has dismissed those charges as a smear.     HAWAII ---- This race pits Democratic Senator Daniel K. Akaka, appointed to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Senator Spark M.

The state's politics is particularly volatile this year and this race is considered close.     IOWA ---- This was originally one of the Republicans' best hopes for ousting a Democratic incumbent, but Senator Tom Harkin, the Democrat, has managed to maintain a signficiant lead in recent public opinion polls over his challenger, Representative Tom Tauke. Abortion rights supporters have targeted this race, with Mr. Harking a supporter of legalized abortion while Mr. Tauke opposeses it.

ABOUT NEW YORK"},{"year":"1929","title":"Not only does Jean Hersholt do clever work in the rôle of a barge skipper in a film called \\"The Girl on the Barge,\\" but his make-up is excellent. Few persons entering the Colony Theatre would ever suspect that the bearded old tyrant and drunkard is in everyday life the immaculate Mr. Hersholt. It is one of the most interesting examples of make-up that has come to the screen, for Mr. Hersholt as this McCadden is not crippled, but merely a bewhiskered and tanned old Scot, who would just as soon hold a Bible in one hand and a glass of whisky in the other.This picture, based on a story by Rupert Hughes, is another mélange of dialogue and silence. Mr. Hersholt's work is good throughout, but when Sally O'Neil and Malcolm MacGregor are heard, their talking is seldom spontaneous. Moreover, the writer of the dialogue has given Miss O'Neil as McCadden's daughter Erie lines that are far too babyish.During one episode Fogarty, the pilot of a tugboat towing the barge, is at the steering wheel teaching Eric the alphabet. Edward Sloman, the director, apparently believes that Eric can learn her A, B, C's euphoniously, but it might have been just as well to show this river girl the formation of the letters. Fogarty, however, is much too intent on picking out advertisements on the canal or river banks that help him to tell Erie of his love for her to think of showing her what A looks like.The scenes are admirably pictured, even those in which miniatures are used. The drama is handled quite well in some cases and there is a genuine suspense about what is going to happen when McCadden sees his daughter in Fogarty's arms. It is a pity that Mr. Sloman permitted the girl to be beaten so vigorously by her father, for a slap in the face is often infinitely more dramatic than a dozen lashes with a strap. Fogarty also goes through enough punishment to kill the ordinary man.In this production old McCadden is finally brought to see the error of his ways and this happens to be an instance where old and young will be glad that the barge skipper's youngsters are enjoying a happy existence as one leaves the theatre.Miss O'Neil might take a lesson in make-up from Mr. Hersholt. He looks the part, but while she is clad like a bargee's daughter, she has obviously been much too busy with mascaro on her eyelashes. Mr. MacGregor's interpretation of Fogarty is competent. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Mr. Hersholt. Anthony Asquith's Film."},{"year":"1977","title":"\\"La Sourfrière\\" is only 30 minutes long, but it is one of Werner Herzog's most exquisite efforts, a perfect distillation of his talents. Made in 1976, the film is a serene, strangely clear-headed documentary about the end of the world.\\"La Sourfrière\\" is the name of a volcano on Guadeloupe that threatened to erupt about a year ago","excerpt":"Mr. Herzog learned of the near-catastrophe only by chance, spotting a newspaper item about a native man who refused to leave the area after everyone else had been evacuated.Thirty-six hours later, Mr. Herzog and two cameramen had arrived in the town of Basse-Terre, at the foot of a mountain that had begun to spew forth white clouds of sulfurous steam.Mr. Herzog's narration deliberately skirts the question of whether he and his crew were afraid, but the implication is that they have passed beyond fear into a state of purely objective curiosity. When one of the cameramen lost his glasses, said Mr. Herzog, \\"we decided to pick them up the next day, if the mountain still existed by then.\\"The town is deserted, \\"just a few doors banging in the wind and water dripping.\\" The sea is full of drowned snakes, which have been driven out of the mountains where they normally dwell. A shot of a civic monument becomes wonderfully ironic, because the town is now a monument in its own right. The police station, like everything else, is silent and deserted: \\"It was great not to have the law hanging around.\\" Even the scientists have fled. Mr. Herzog had every reason to expect, as he says, that these pictures of the town were the last ones that would ever be taken.The crew finds the peasant man, who is lying on the ground, waiting peacefully; turning his palms upward, he shows them the position in which he plans to die. He talks confidently about God's will, and explains that he has no fear. At Mr. Herzog's prompting, he sings a love song.The film includes an extraordinary anecdote, about a city on the neighboring island of Martinique that was destroyed in a volcanic eruption in 1902. There was no lava, only a burst of flame—\\"the whole thing can only have taken seconds,\\" Mr. Herzog explains, showing a photograph of vultures circling the next day. There was only one survivor in a population of 32,000, and he was the town's most evil man, a convict who had been put in solitary confinement underground. He eventually became a sideshow attraction in an American circus.La Soufrière never erupted even though the warning signs were definite enough almost to guarantee that it would. Mr. Herzog is doubtless glad to have survived, but the film reflects only his disappointment. \\"It all ended up a dead loss and a laughing stock,\\" he said, almost angrily.\\"La Sourfrière,\\" one of the foremost attractions of the New York Film Festival (it will be shown tonight at 6 o'clock and Monday evening at 9:30), is on a bill with \\"Heart of Glass,\\" a feature by Mr. Herzog that is far less successful. Mr. Herzog hypnotized his entire cast to film a parable about a medieval town that has thrived by producing ruby-colored glass, until the only man who knows the formula dies. After that, the town goes mad trying to recapture its lost glory.In its own way, \\"Heart of Glass\\" is as much about the end of the world as is \\"La Soufrière,\\" but the longer film is much less accessible, and often obscure. The actors' trance is contagious, and the film has some genuinely mesmerizing moments, as when the town seer, whose words have made little sense, suddenly begins to predict an alarmingly familiar future in which \\"no man will like another man.\\" Mr. Herzog seems not to be working with real actors, but rather with apparitions.At times, the script reads like a collection of nonsequiturs. Do you want our people to eat oatmeal bread again, that gives them headaches?\\" asks one character. \\"Rats will bite your earlobes,\\" someone swears. Even the film's meticulousness—every trace of red anywhere, even on a goose's head, is clearly planned—is not entirely decipherable.The elusiveness of \\"Heart of Glass\\" makes it something of a disappointment. But it is too mysteriously lovely to be regarded as a failure.

After 36-year-old Brenda Schaefer was murdered in Louisville, Ky., in 1988, the evidence implicating her 50-year-old fiance, Mel Ignatow, seemed overwhelming. But a jury acquitted Mr. Ignatow, leaving the prosecutors to fume -- all the more so months later when new evidence led Mr. Ignatow to confess. He could not be charged with murder, kidnapping, sexual abuse, sodomy -- all the charges of which he had already been cleared. Bob Hill, a columnist at The Louisville Courier-Journal, describes the crime and its aftermath and recounts how authorities were able to put Mel Ignatow behind bars without violating his constitutional protection against double jeopardy. The book is well researched but sloppily told","excerpt":"Mr. Hill does not define all his legal terms, and there are troubling inconsistencies (for example, if one witness did not have a telephone, how did authorities put a tap on it?). Although Mr. Hill knows how to build tension, his syntax is sometimes disjointed, his chronology confusing and his narration repetitive.\\nKAREN ANGEL IN SHORT: NONFICTION"},{"year":"1986","title":"When P.

A thumbnail: Mr. Hiss was the most contentious political figure of his era, convicted and jailed in 1950 for perjury after denying, insistently and under oath, that he had been a Soviet plant within the State Department. Conservatives called him the embodiment of subversive Communism. Liberals called him a martyr strung up by a McCarthyite fanatic. In mid-October, a senior aide to President Boris Yeltsin sided with the liberals, saying a review of Soviet files found no evidence that Mr. Hiss had ever been a Kremlin agent.

Mr. Inoue might best be recognized among certain jazz audiences as Mr. Hall's protégé: they appeared together in a series of instructional guitar videos a decade ago and performed some effortlessly intuitive duets for the Village Vanguard's 70th-anniversary celebration last year.

Unfortunately, excess operetta baggage—fluttery mothers, unmarried daughters and phony diplomats—is repeatedly dragged in by the heels.Even so, with such an old-hat libretto, the picture could have been accorded plenty of cosmopolitan flavoring, since it hops all the way from Paris to Warsaw and Leningrad, and back. Unfortunately, director Arthur Maria Rabenait simply prods the story and padded situations without much luster.The picture does have cozy stylishness in the scenes of a Paris night club, a White Russian roost. Most of the acting, though, is broad indeed, except for the slightly uneasy-looking stars.What we get of the music, incidentally, sounds grand, especially two lovely waltzes, one bouncy foxtrot and two Russian numbers that are knockouts.

This fall and especially after the debates, The Times has analyzed the accuracy of statements made by the presidential candidates. Here are highlights of that coverage on some of the most important issues of the campaign.    IRAQ       More than a dozen times in the first debate on Oct. 1, President Bush accused Senator John Kerry of continually shifting positions on Iraq.     A review of Mr. Kerry's public statements found that his position had actually been quite consistent. But as the politics changed, Mr. Kerry repeatedly changed his emphasis. News accounts reflected what he was emphasizing at the time. And Mr. Kerry was often unclear in expressing his views.     On Oct. 9, 2002, Mr. Kerry was planning to run for president, but had not yet announced his candidacy. Before he voted to give Mr. Bush the authority to use force against Saddam Hussein in Iraq, he declared on the Senate floor: ''I will support a multilateral effort to disarm him by force, if we ever exhaust those other options, as the president has promised, but I will not support a unilateral U.S. war against Iraq unless that threat is imminent and the multilateral effort has not proven possible under any circumstances.''    That is essentially his position today. But look at what Mr. Kerry has said in the meantime:     In May 2003, two months after the United States invaded Iraq and routed Mr. Hussein's army, Mr. Kerry was the presumed front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, from the antiwar wing of the party, was not yet regarded as a serious threat. In a nine-candidate debate in Columbia, S.C., that month, Mr. Kerry declared: ''I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein. And when the president made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him.''     By October 2003, Dr. Dean had begun to emerge as a strong candidate and it had become clear that no unconventional weapons would be found in Iraq. Mr. Kerry asserted that month on the ABC News program ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos'': ''The president and his advisers did not do almost anything correctly in the walk-up to the war. They rushed to war. They were intent on going to war. They did not give legitimacy to the inspections. We could have still been doing inspections even today.''   Five days later, Mr. Kerry voted against a Republican bill to provide $87 billion more to support American troops and to pay reconstruction costs in Iraq and Afghanistan. Before that vote, he voted for a version of the measure Mr. Bush threatened to veto, a version that would have raised the $87 billion by repealing tax cuts for Americans with annual incomes of more than $200,000.     By March, Mr. Kerry had won the early contests, essentially clinching the nomination. On March 16, he explained his vote against the $87 billion for the troops by saying, in a comment Mr. Bush has repeatedly ridiculed, ''I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it.''     On Aug. 9, following the Democratic convention, Mr. Kerry told reporters during a trip to the Grand Canyon that he ''would have voted for the authority'' for Mr. Bush to use troops in Iraq even if he had known that unconventional weapons would not be found and that no close connection existed between Iraq and Al Qaeda.     This was the first time Mr. Kerry had expressed that view, and reports emphasized it. Many accounts, especially those on television, did not include his further explanation that ''it's the right authority for a president to have'' and that, referring to subsequent events in Iraq, he ''would have done this very differently from the way President Bush has.''     Then last month on the radio program ''Imus in the Morning,'' the host, Don Imus, asked Mr. Kerry, ''Do you think there are any circumstances in which we should have gone to war in Iraq?'' Mr. Kerry replied: ''Not under the current circumstances, no. There are none that I see. I voted based on weapons of mass destruction. The president distorted that, and I've said that.''     That was another new point, and nearly all accounts emphasized it. Many did not include the rest of what Mr. Kerry said: ''But I think it was the right vote based on what Saddam Hussein had done, and I think it was the right thing to do to hold him accountable. I've said 100 times, there was a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. The president chose the wrong way.''    COALITION       Mr. Bush said the war in Iraq was being waged by a large coalition","excerpt":"Mr. Kerry said that the coalition was shrinking and that eight countries had left it.     As of this month, 30 foreign countries had joined the United States, but they contribute only about 24,000 troops, with Britain supplying 8,000 of them. The United States has about 138,000 troops in Iraq, and 90 percent of the non-Iraqi casualties have been American.     Eight allied countries have withdrawn troops from Iraq since February: the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Norway, the Philippines, Singapore, Spain and Thailand.    AL QAEDA       Mr. Bush's statement in the first debate that 75 percent of Osama bin Laden's ''people have been brought to justice'' is impossible to document. It appears to refer to terrorist leaders, a loosely defined category.   There is no reliable tally of how many Qaeda operatives ever existed, and the administration has not provided the number who have been captured or killed.    DOMESTIC SECURITY      Mr. Kerry complained in the first debate that money spent on the war could be better used for police, firefighters and other security measures at home.     He said the administration had put ''not one nickel'' into protection for vulnerable tunnels, bridges and subways.     That is an exaggeration.     Even Democratic critics demanding more spending on rail and transit security and lobbyists for transit systems say the federal government has spent millions of dollars, while local transit authorities have spent more than a billion dollars.    Mr. Bush's statement that the administration had ''tripled the amount of money we're spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year'' was an  approximation and embroidered somewhat the rate of growth. It depends in part on what programs are counted, and from what date.     Money for programs inherited by the new Department of Homeland Security from other agencies has more than doubled since 2001, to about $24 billion in the fiscal year 2004, according to a report in April by the Congressional Budget Office.    Related programs in other agencies have grown almost as fast, bringing total domestic security spending to about $41 billion, a doubling since 2001.    Democrats have argued for even faster growth in spending on some of these programs.    IRAQ AND U.N. SANCTIONS      In the second debate, on Oct. 8, President Bush and Senator Kerry drew contradictory conclusions from the 918-page report issued this month by Charles A. Duelfer, the top American arms inspector in Iraq, and their interpretations did not always accurately reflect the report's findings.     After Mr. Kerry said that the Duelfer report had demonstrated that United Nations sanctions against Iraq ''worked,'' Mr. Bush said the report's lesson instead was that it was ''naïve and dangerous'' to ''just let the inspectors do their job.''     In fact, that report did not draw a firm conclusion about whether the sanctions and inspections succeeded in disarming Iraq. It said that Saddam Hussein's ''primary goal from 1991 to 2003 was to have U.N. sanctions lifted.'' But it also said that between 2000 and 2001, Iraq ''managed to mitigate many of the effects of sanctions and undermine their international support.''     Mr. Bush referred to findings pointing to how porous the sanctions were and showing Iraq's success between 1991 and 2003 at circumventing the restrictions, primarily through imports of conventional weapons.    But Mr. Kerry emphasized what he portrayed as the restrictions' bottom-line success, in prompting what Mr. Duelfer said was the fundamental decision that Iraq made after the war in the Persian Gulf in 1991 to set aside its plans for illicit weapons, at least for the time being, to win an end to sanctions.    JOBS      Mr. Kerry said in the second debate that Mr. Bush's was the first presidency in 72 years in which the number of jobs had fallen and that the nation had lost 1.6 million jobs since 2000. Mr. Bush said 1.9 million new jobs had been created in the last 13 months.     Mr. Kerry's figure for job losses counted only private-sector jobs. More than 1 million government jobs have been created. The total jobs lost has been about 585,000 through last month.     Mr. Bush is the first president since Herbert Hoover to have had the number of jobs fall during his term. The nearly 2 million new jobs created in a little more than a year still leaves the administration in the hole.    TAXES AND THE BUDGET      Mr. Bush said in the third debate that most of the tax reduction in his presidency had gone ''to low- and middle-income Americans.''    In fact, Internal Revenue Service figures compiled by the Tax Policy Center of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute show that half of all the tax cuts in effect this year go to the wealthiest 10 percent of taxpayers, those with incomes above about $112,000.    One-quarter of the cuts go to the richest 1 percent, those with incomes above about $357,000.    Mr. Bush also said the cuts were needed ''to get us out of the recession.'' But he proposed the cuts in his last presidential campaign, in 2000, before anyone knew that a recession was at hand, and he justified them by saying the surplus should be returned to the taxpayers.     The president said, as he often has elsewhere, that Mr. Kerry had voted for tax increases 98 times. That is probably true. But many, if not most, of those were multiple votes on the same bills or on nonbinding resolutions and motions. Mr. Kerry voted against the tax increase pushed by the president's father in 1990 to reduce the budget deficit. He voted for one large tax increase -- the Clinton bill of 1993, which imposed most of the increases on upper-income payers. Mr. Kerry said Mr. Bush had proposed $3 trillion in new spending, and Mr. Bush said Mr. Kerry had proposed $2 trillion. Neither claim can be proved, because the details of their proposals are so vague.    Mr. Kerry was correct when he said the budget had a projected $5.6 trillion surplus over 10 years when Mr. Bush took office and now has large deficits for the foreseeable future.     But Mr. Kerry was not accurate when he said he had shown ''exactly how'' he intended to pay for all his spending proposals. In fact, he lists as additional revenues such vague promises as closing corporate loopholes and making the government more efficient.     The Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that seeks deficit reduction, projects that Mr. Bush would cut taxes by $1.2 trillion in the coming decade, while Mr. Kerry would reduce revenues by $498 billion. New spending proposed by Senator Kerry would total $771 billion in the next decade, compared with $82 billion proposed by Mr. Bush.    BETTER OFF, WORSE OFF      Much of the third debate turned on the question of whether Americans had more money in their pockets as a result of President Bush's policies.     Mr. Kerry offered an array of statistics that in his view showed that people were worse off than they were at the beginning of the Bush presidency.     Mr. Bush accused his challenger of ''a litany of misstatements'' and held that voters were in better financial shape because of his tax cuts. But, as with the Kerry data, the accuracy of the president's statements is not obvious.     The truth seems to be that, after adjustments for inflation, Americans on average may have more money at their disposal. But more people are worse off than are better off.     The trick is in the word ''average.'' Average income -- all the income in the country divided by the total number of people -- has gone up because of the large increase in after-tax income enjoyed by the very wealthy.     But median income -- the point at which half the people have more and half less -- has dropped.    SOCIAL SECURITY, THE DRAFT      For weeks, the president attacked Mr. Kerry in ways that the Kerry campaign and outside commentators called distortions. After their last debate, Mr. Kerry began criticizing President Bush on Social Security and the draft in a manner that reached far beyond Mr. Bush's positions.     On Social Security, Mr. Kerry maintained that Mr. Bush planned a ''January surprise'' that could cost retirees up to 45 percent of their monthly checks. On the draft, Mr. Kerry said that involuntary extensions and National Guard call-ups amounted to a backdoor draft. He also told The Des Moines Register that there was ''the great potential of the draft'' if Mr. Bush won a second term.     Mr. Kerry's implication that people now retired stood to have their benefits cut was not fair. Mr. Bush has promised not to cut the Social Security benefits of current retirees or those nearing retirement age, and no plan under consideration would do that.     On the draft, Mr. Bush said flatly in the second debate that he had no plans to reinstate military conscription. There is hardly any political support for a draft, and the Pentagon is very much opposed to one.

The Dormitory Authority in the past has granted money for the building of universities and schools, but not living quarters. \\"The architects actually stayed in the old buildings, which are also being renovated, to see what was good and what should be changed,\\" Mr. Castro said. \\"They really lived with our residents.\\" \\n\\nLeake & Watts opened in 1831 in upper Manhattan as the Leake & Watts Orphanage with funds from the estates of John George Leake and Robert Watts. \\n\\nInitially its residents were all boys, and all, as described in institutional literature, full orphans with both parents dead or missing. By 1851, girls were admitted; in 1888, the institution bought its current property and had the grounds designed by Frederick Law Olmstead. The Gothic-style main building -- now used for administrative offices -- was said to be \\"typical of the days when orphans were housed in large dormitories containing rows upon rows of little cots.\\" \\n\\nIn the early years, a child would usually stay until he was 21, at which point he would go into an indenturing program with farmers upstate. (The average stay is now two years.) \\n\\nBy 1908, Leake & Watts was admitting half orphans -- children whose homes had broken up because of poverty. The next two decades saw major changes, with the addition of a school, replacement of the dormitory with the cottage system and the diversification of the population. From the 1930's to today, the institution has expanded in size and scope and now offers a variety of services to a varied clientele. \\n\\nThe image of an orphan, for example, is no longer that of a freckle-faced, parentless boy who gets in trouble for stealing a hot mickey (potato) from someone else's trash-bin fire. \\n\\nThese days, a typical Leake & Watts resident is likely to have a living mother and father, but the parents may be overwhelmed by problems associated with poverty -- drug use, AIDS, involvement in crime.\\n\\nIn other cases, it is not the parents or lack of them but the youngster who requires placement: truancy, rocky relationships at home and with peers or, as one resident put it, \\"too much hanging out on the street\\" can result in a court-ordered placement.\\n\\n\\"Poverty causes problems,\\" said Phyllis Gurdin, assistant executive director in charge of resident programs. \\"Desertion comes with poverty -- the father leaves, the family breaks up.\\" \\n\\nA graph of admissions over the years, she added, shows correlation between peak population at the home and societal upheavals: the 1848 potato famine, the Civil War in 1860, the huge waves of immigrants in the early 1900's, and so on, through the Depression, World War II and the prevalence of crack cocaine, heroin and AIDS in the 1990's.\\n\\nOver the years, too, the racial and ethnic mix at Leake & Watts has changed from primarily Italian and Irish in the founding years to the current population, which is 90 percent black and Hispanic. \\n\\nSocial theory and statistics, however, mean little to the Leake & Watts residents who are concentrating on making lives for themselves.\\n\\nDatayna Jordan has been there for five years, since she was 12. A soft-spoken girl with big expressive eyes, she is one of nine children. She is at Leake & Watts, she said, because \\"something bad happened to my mom, not because I was acting up in school or anything.\\" Now, she added, her mother is \\"getting her life back together\\" and so is she.\\n\\n\\"You get opportunities here you don't find elsewhere,\\" she said. \\"Last summer, I got to go to F.I.T. -- I might like to go into fashion, or maybe do hair for a living.\\"\\n\\nMs. Banks, who would like a career in journalism, is working as a secretary for one of Leake & Watts's off-campus programs. She became a resident \\"because I was having a little communication problem with my mother.\\" She said she found the change difficult at first:\\n\\n\\"When you live in a house with one parent, one sister and one brother, it's hard to come into a setting where you are living with eight girls and have to share things and make compromises.\\" Now, though, things are looking up: \\"I like having a job, and I like learning about responsibility.\\" \\n\\nMr. King credits some of his biggest personal successes to the Leake & Watts staff. \\"Brian and Vladimir made me who I am today,\\" he said, referring to Brian Lyons, a child-care worker, and Vladimir Carvajal, assistant director of residential programs. \\n\\nThe two encouraged his artistic abilities -- in his room are a beach scene and a seascape he painted -- and helped him understand not only his talents but also his own temperament. \\n\\n\\"Before I came here, I was running around with a gang,\\" he said. \\"We weren't real bad or anything, but if someone messed with one of us, we'd beat them up. Like I said, I always kept my hands clean, I never got involved with any real bad stuff. But I needed to be away from that scene, I needed something else.\\n\\n\\"Vladimir and Brian coaxed me to do the best I could do. They taught me to deal with people and to deal with my anger. Now I get along very well with everyone here.\\n\\n\\"I don't think of myself as a leader, but people tell me I am. I guess because I feel good about myself, I find myself in a leadership role.\\" The View From: Yonkers;\\nAn Orphanage Dating From 1831 Helping People in the 1990's"},{"year":"1937","title":"THE bombshell that dropped into the bailiwicks of broad casting during the past week was tossed by Senator King of Utah.

Last week Mitsui won the hotly contested rights to explore for -- and likely to develop -- the undersea fields near Sakhalin Island, off the coast of Siberia. The biggest business deal yet between the former Soviet republic and Japan, the exploration rights cover an area close enough to northern Japan to build a pipeline to Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island.

L. Doctorow observes that the novel is one in which the spell of narrative is broken by the author. Mr. Doctorow refers disdainfully to this sort of novel as ''disclaimed fiction,'' apparently alluding to the dread disclaimers businesses make to divest themselves of responsibility for their products.    What is wrong with the novelist stepping in every so often to remind the reader not to get too emotionally involved, but rather to think, to try to understand? And why - when the novel has been such an accommodating form for such a long time - why must there be good and bad types of novels?    Among socially committed writers, there are two principal schools of thought on the author's role in the modern novel. There are the social realists who, like Mr. Doctorow, try to reach the reader through his emotions, try to make him see the world as it really is. This angle requires a compelling story and compelling characters who struggle before a detailed backdrop of life.  Then there are the anti-illusionists, for whom honesty, direct communication and an abeyance of emotion are thought to constitute the best means of getting the reader to question the social and ethical structures of his world. The theory for this angle is best set forth in David Caute's ''The Illusion''","excerpt":"Mr. Kundera's novel is an excellent example of how it works.

The band, put together in Leeds, England, in 1977, started as a punk group, went through a country phase and now has come out a new- wave band, circa 1983. The music at first seemed indistinct, noisy rock that 100 bands could have played better. The attraction seemed obvious: at the Grand on Friday night, the Mekons put on a nostalgia show for the thirtysomething audience who had come to intellectual maturity listening to the group.   But after a while the group's elements started to separate themselves. The band is funny: after the show, the group's lead singer and guitarist, Jon Langford, let himself be carried by fans across the club, mocking rote rock-star moves. Onstage he and the band made no attempt to differentiate themselves from the audience, looking just like the average bohemians next door, and talking the same, too","excerpt":"Mr. Langford tossed off jokes about Marxism.

HOW comforting it would be to go and live in the safely defined past if we were not certain that it led obstinately to the chaotic present. Books involving the national memory, especially those containing pictures, inspire a reverie whose satisfaction with the past has a quality of unspoken misery, full of a longing for youth and promise that we associate with a perspective just this side of the grave. In this antidote to sentimental memoirs, Nicholas Lemann manages to mingle nostalgia with bitterness, anger with pride in a fashion reminiscent of Michael Lesy's now semiclassic ''Wisconsin Death Trip.''   ''Out of the Forties'' proceeds like a series of mystery stories.  With the modest assumption that the old, if properly excavated, can tell us something we need to know about the new, Mr. Lemann combines arresting photographs of the 1940's with his own inspired detective work of the 1980's. The photographs are clues","excerpt":"Mr. Lemann's stories become the solutions.

His voice is gruff - he growls, snarls, groans, howls and, when need be, wins an argument with the clarion cry of the old-school Shakespearean actor that James Tyrone is meant to be.   It is hard to believe that we are witnessing the same Jack Lemmon who has made a career of playing strictly contemporary and always likable little guys in plays and movies ranging from ''Mister Roberts'' to ''The Odd Couple,'' ''The Fortune Cookie'' and ''Tribute.''

The Metropolitan, which so often has staggered along at the brink of fiscal disaster, today stands accused of being financially and administratively stable. No doubt there has been some chuckling over this ironic situation in the front offices at lincoln Center. However, to some uneasy skeptics, this writer among them, it appears that the company has devoted far more energy and ingenuity to balancing the books than to staying artistically solvent. The Met is 100 and, in too many ways, acts it.   It therefore will be fascinating over the next few seasons to see whether James Levine, the newly appointed artistic director, will be able to slow or reverse the company's aging process. He is young enough at 40 to dare to shake things up, if he is allowed a reasonably free hand. Don't forget that Gustav Mahler was only 37 when he took over the Vienna State Opera in 1897 and made it the operatic center of the world.

They'd tested it in Phoenix and St. Louis, business hadn't been good, so they took it back and sat on it.   Meanwhile, there was a kind of palace revolt. One East Coast publicist who loved the movie spent six weeks ''yelling and memo-ing executives on the West Coast'' until he was given a reluctant goahead to screen the picture for New York critics. Some of these critics were so enthusiastic they said they were going to run reviews, even if there was no film around for their readers to go to, what with the studio's refusal to set a New York release date.

BLACKS ARE SEEKING A PATH TO THE STATEHOUSE"},{"year":"1929","title":"That precious little thing called humor permeates.\\"The Gold Diggers of Broadway,\\" a delightful talking and singing natural color picture, which was offered last night by the Warner Brothers at the Winter Garden. The fun, coupled with the lovely pastel shades, the tuneful melodies, a sensible narrative, competent acting and elaborate stage settings, resulted in an extraordinarily pleasing entertainment. It caused one to meditate in the end on the remarkable progress of the screen, for not only are the voices reproduced with rare precision, but every opportunity is taken of the Technicolor process in producing the hues and glitter of a musical comedy.But charming as the prismatic effect is, it is rivaled by the clever jesting. Roy Del Ruth, the director, and Robert Lord, the scenarist, appear to have worked hand in hand, ever ready with a witty twist. And two of the conspicuously fine performances are those of the stout Albert Gran and the comic Winnie Lightner.This production opens up in a promising manner, revealing that the Warner Brothers are out of the forest of sentimentality and tears. This first scene is one of an audience of bald-headed men rocking with laughter over an act of \\"The Gold Diggers.\\" From then on the comedy is adroitly sustained, and it reaches its peak when Mabel (Miss Lightner) is perceived entertaining the then pained Mr. Blake (Mr. Gran). As Mr. Blake weighs something more than 250 pounds, one can readily imagine the anguish he suffers the first evening he spends in company with Mabel and others. Mabel is the personification of energy, and at one moment she is torn between a desire for a string of pearls and an automobile with a chauffeur.Mabel tries several paper hats on the gray-haired Blake, and finally she decides that the one least suited to him is the one he must wear. He thinks that he has earned a moment's relaxation and suddenly Mabel spins a few lines of baby talk and then pecks his face with fast kisses. One could watch these two for a whole evening and never know a second of boredom. The more Mr. Blake betokens fear and fatigue, the more one laughs, for Mabel is the personification of tireless merriment. Little did Mr. Blake anticipate such an evening when he, as an attorney, accompanied his client. Stephen Lee (Conway Tearle) on the adventure to a nocturnal resort and Jerry's (Nancy Welford's) apartment.When the suffering Mr. Blake pleads for a moment's peace something he says is construed by Mabel as a proposal of marriage and she declares that it is all a matter of whether Grover will like Mr. Blake. The audience knows that and Mr. Blake learns later that Grover is a Pekinese.Songs and dances are introduced during the course of the story. Ann Pennington, for instance, does the light fantastic on a table and subsequently gives a further illustration of her terpsichorean talent in the kitchen of Jerry's spacious abode.Now and again melody takes the place of comedy and Nick Lucas. Miss Welford, Miss Lightner and others entertain with song.There is a catchy air, \\"The Song of the Gold Diggers\\"","excerpt":"Mr. Lucas's refrain. \\"Painting the Clouds With Sunshine\\"; then \\"Tip-Toe Thru the Tulips With Me,\\" \\"In a Kitchenette,\\" \\"Keeping the Wolf From the Door,\\" \\"Mechanical Man\\" and others.Al Dubin and Joe Burke are respectively the lyricist and composer. The dances and stage presentations are the result of the efforts of Larry Ceballos.Nancy Welford and Conway Tearle appear in one sequence wherein Miss Welford, as Jerry, tells Mr. Tearle, as the wealthy Mr. Lee, the story of her life, punctuating it with glasses of champagne. Jerry offers her toast. \\"Toodle-oo,\\" and it is repeated by her companion, but the fair, crafty creature pours her wine into the ice bucket, while the courageous Mr. Lee drinks his down. Jerry moans that she was born in Chillicothe, and Mr. Lee repeats the name of the Ohio town in a somewhat uncertain fashion. Subsequently, when Jerry introduces her mother, Mr. Lee is told that Jerry was born in Boston and that she lived there until she came to Broadway. Mr. Lee is furious. He does not repeat his proposal of marriage, and there ensues one of those misunderstandings in which the girl suffers and sighs, but here it is so well acted that it is appealing.Brilliant camera work is a feature of several scenes. One in particular being where Miss Pennington begins to dance. It is a series of dissolves and angles that impress one with the condition the characters are in at that moment.When Miss Lightner is not accompanied by her adipose escort, she endeavors to struggle with two lines, one line on the stage having been all that she has taxed her memory with before. She is constantly getting mixed up as she strives to say something like:\\"I am the spirit of the ages and the progress of civilization.\\"Lilyan Tashman, who officiated as the blond menace in \\"Bulldog Drummond,\\" here impersonates, Eleanor, a rôle she played in the play \\"The Gold Diggers.\\" Miss Tashman is the blasé. Albion-accented young woman, who holds her head high and counts her words. But why pick out one or two of the performers when all do capital work in this handsomely staged and gloriously colored motion picture? THE SCREEN; Sherlock Meighan.

Each morning, at 6:30 A.M., Mr. Gralto, a swarthy dark-mustachioed man who favored off-the-rack jogging suits, left his home in East Rockaway, L.I. Driving east against the traffic, he arrived within half an hour at his small junkyard in Oceanside. Inside his trailer-office, he phoned home. \\"Vera, I'm here,\\" he reassured his common-law wife.    Mr. Gralto then fed the junkyard's guard dog, a 125-pound German shepherd named Bandit, before his employees arrived promptly at 8 A.M. and the orders came ringing in. A hard worker and a hard-driving boss, Mr. Gralto typically ordered in lunch, worked untgil early evening and drove straight home. At his modest six-room home, a converted one-story bungalow on the waterfront, he and Vera Marino usually shared quiet dinners, though occasionally they dropped in on her daughter and son-in-law's. In the summer, the couple sometimes went boating, or had the kids over for a cookout.    \\"He put in long days,\\" said Detective Paul Vitucci of the Nassau County Police. \\"He demanded punctuality from his workers. He demanded very high productivity. One time, he had a guy out there who had nothing to do. Gralto had him work in the yard, sweep up the yard, rake it clean.\\"    But the admiration ended there. The orders coming in, according to an indictment in State Supreme Court in Queens, were from traffickers in stolen auto parts. Someone would ask for the nose of a 1992 Nissan Maxima. The fender of a 1991 Plymouth Acclaim. A couple of phone calls later, the indictment charges, Mr. Gralto had arranged for one of his trusty \\"steal men\\" to cruise parking lots and residential streets, mostly in Queens, occasionally in Nassau County. He would then \\"chop up\\" the cars, fulfill the order with the buyer and stockpile the remaining parts, the indictment says.   To business associates, Mr. Gralto's favorite comment was: \\"I'm an honest businessman trying to make an honest day's dollar.\\" But law-enforcement officials say this case, broken last month and based on hundreds of hours of wiretaps of his conversations as well as video surveillance, offers an unusually vivid glimpse into the workings of an auto theft ring, a core group of 13 that extended from a reputed captain in the Bonanno crime family to Mr. Gralto, down to the \\"cutters\\" and the \\"steal men.\\" The case sheds light on why more than half the cars stolen in New York vanish in Byzantine networks of thieves, chop-shop owners, thieves who specialize in certain parts, illegal parts suppliers and unscrupulous mechanics -- all of whom create an artificial demand for the supply of auto parts.   Organized crime syndicates have been involved in auto theft since at least the 1960's. But since the 1980's, car theft has grown increasingly organized, as a new breed of expensive and sophisticated cars, equipped with a growing array of gadgets and parts, multiplied the potential profits from theft. And because a police department overwhelmed with more serious crimes virtually ignored auto theft until the early '90s, the risk of punishment was low.   Beleaguered by perhaps the most skillful auto thieves in the nation, the city's car owners -- already suffering from a scarcity of garages and monthly indoor parking fees of up to $700 -- can take some comfort in statistics, if nothing else. Partly because of rising police attention, the number of reported thefts has fallen steadily since a record 146,309 in 1990. Still, 94,525 were reported stolen last year, or almost 260 cars a day. Of the 30 biggest American cities, only drivers in Detroit and San Francisco were more likely to have their cars stolen in 1993, says the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurance trade organization.   But because of New York's sophisticated rings, its 1.8 million car owners paid the highest theft premiums: $248, or five times the average for the 30 cities. \\"Though the theft claims are not as frequent as in Detroit or San Francisco, the average loss is higher because the chances of recovery are far lower,\\" said Kim Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the Institute.   So pervasive is the problem in some neighborhoods that drivers have adopted an almost fatalistic attitude -- particularly in Queens, home to 38 percent of all cars registered in the city in 1993. Near the Fresh Meadows shopping mall, one of the hardest-hit areas in the hardest-hit precinct of the city and a favorite target of the ring, so many cars were stolen last year that officers were posted on high-rise rooftops to watch the streets and residents could rattle off the names of victimized neighbors.   Under pressure to combat auto theft, law enforcement officials involved in the yearlong investigation by detectives assigned to the Queens District Attorney and by the Nassau County police were eager to talk about the case, which they describe as a benchmark in their efforts.   \\"This is the first auto-theft prosecution under the state's Organized Crime Control Act,\\" said Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown. \\"These weren't isolated thefts. You're talking about a highly sophisticated enterprise that stole and dismantled cars and set up a business in stolen parts.\\"   At the arraignment last month, all the defendants pleaded not guilty. Joseph Mure, a lawyer representing Mr. Gralto and Ms. Marino -- as well as her son-in-law Frank Merendino, who is also charged with assisting Mr. Gralto -- said recently that they maintain their innocence and denied any connection to organized crime. Lawyers who represent the other suspects and who chose to comment said their clients also declare their innocence.   Vincent Asaro, 60 -- who is charged with being a captain in the Bonanno crime family and with being at the top of this theft ring -- further denies that he controlled Mr. Gralto. \\"He denies any involvement with organized crime, period,\\" said his lawyer, Stephen G. Murphy, who has been involved in many high-profile cases in New York. THIEF, CUTTER, BROKER: THE CAR-THEFT LADDER     Guy Gralto, 34, grew up in Ozone Park. Investigators believe he has been involved in the auto-theft business for at least the last 11 years, climbing his way up, from thief to cutter to broker, in the tightly knit car-theft industry in southeastern Queens. He had been arrested only once, for possession of two stolen vehicles with illegal vehicle identification numbers, in 1988, and that case was later dismissed. Detectives who shadowed him for a year described him as an excitable man, who spoke in a loud voice even during normal conversations, barking into his telephone. At work, he kept his phone conversations short and businesslike, though last Sept. 5, unsure of the holiday, he spent minutes trying to persuade every caller that it was actually Memorial Day.   Not all his business associates were privy to Mr. Gralto's softer side, his love of pets. Besides Bandit, the German shepherd he had taken in as a sickly stray in Howard Beach, he poured affection on a small dog and three parrots at his East Rockaway home. Last summer, when a friendly chop shop was raided by the police and its guard dog was shot, Mr. Gralto's first telephone call, say detectives listening to wiretaps, was to inquire about the pit bull. \\"Oh no, jeez, they shot the dog. Poor dog.\\"   According to the indictment, Mr. Gralto's Oceanside business traced its roots to another auto-theft ring that he and a former partner set up in an inconspicuous warehouse in Maspeth, Queens, in November 1993. In Queens' auto-theft industry, a tight network where everyone knows everyone else, it was perhaps natural for Mr. Gralto to join forces with Martin Bosshart, a Woodhaven resident with a criminal record, law enforcement officials said. It was also natural that in an industry with its own peculiar hierarchies and codes of advancement that Mr. Bosshart, who was only 25, became the junior partner, with Mr. Gralto taking the lion's share of the profits. But Mr. Bosshart's inexperience was more than compensated for by his extremely violent behavior, officials said, pointing out he had been arrested on charges of attempted murder in 1990, though never convicted. In 1988, he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of attempted grand larceny in another case.   The joint operation earned millions of dollars by stealing and chopping up roughly 20 cars a week, Detective Vitucci and other officials said. But they said there was a conflict larger than both men: Mr. Bosshart paid tribute to the Gambino organized crime family. But Mr. Gralto, who had been loosely allied with Mr. Asaro for a number of years, was holding back payments from the reputed Bonanno captain.   The indicted individuals -- all \\"stand-up guys who don't rat on each other,\\" according to Detective Vitucci -- have provided few details of the ensuing fallout. But investigators believe that on Feb. 25, 1994, with the Bonanno captain's consent, Mr. Bosshart and two accomplices forced Mr. Gralto out of the Maspeth business. Inside the warehouse, the indictment says, Mr. Bosshart and two associates severely beat Mr. Gralto, stole thousands of dollars and then dragged him into an office and shot him in the leg.   After the shooting, Mr. Gralto -- to continue his career in the auto-theft business -- had no choice but to turn to Mr. Asaro for protection, law enforcement officials said. Mr. Gralto moved to Long Island, abandoning a salvage yard, Conduit Auto Parts, he owned in Howard Beach. In an industrial corner of Oceanside, he rented space in a carpet warehouse where he showed up to work, six days a week, dressed invariably in jogging suits.    Mr. Asaro shielded Mr. Gralto against other auto-theft rings looking to expand, steered business his way and sometimes provided him with his own car thieves, said Detective Cary Brenner, of the Queens District Attorney's Office Squad. A flat weekly fee, typically around $500, was delivered to the Great In Pasta, a restaurant in Hewlett, L.I., where Mr. Asaro spent his evenings.  A SMALL CIRCLE OF TRUST     In Oceanside, or sometimes at his home, Mr. Gralto received orders and dispatched his thieves, the indictment says. Whenever he did not perform those tasks himself, Mr. Gralto trusted only Ms. Marino, 49, her son-in-law Mr. Merendino, 32, or Louis Scarantino, 31, a childhood friend accused of financing a warehouse for stolen parts in East Rockaway. They were all indicted.   Two others indicted were acquaintances from Mr. Gralto's years in the auto-theft business -- Anthony LaGreca and Keith Hillman, who worked at auto-supply shops in Jamaica, Queens, and Bay Shore, L.I., respectively -- regularly called him with orders, said Detective Brenner, who eavesdropped on hundreds of conversations.   \\"Nose off a '91 Max, white, two-door,\\" was a typical order for a Nissan Maxima.   \\"O.K. I'll buy it,\\" Mr. Gralto said, after haggling over a price.   Mr. Gralto then paged one of his steal men, who were paid between $400 and $600 to find the car and drop it off at a pre-arranged location, Detective Vitucci said. One of Mr. Gralto's employees would pick up the car and drive it to a friendly chop shop where it would be dismantled, generally for $1,800, the detective said.   \\"I bought it,\\" Mr. Gralto would say, calling back the orderer of the part. \\"I'll have it to you in a day or two.\\" The parts were delivered to Mr. LaGreca, 30, who had previously been convicted of insurance violations, burglary, attempted possession of stolen property and attempted forgery. Other valuables were warehoused, and, after everyone was paid, Mr. Gralto could clear several thousand dollars.   The indictment says that two of Mr. Gralto's regular thieves were Victor Norwood, 35, and Thomas Parker, 42, two tall, thin men from Jamaica who over the years had acquired reputations as dependable steal men, Detective Brenner said. Although the operators of an auto-theft ring are often shielded from scrutiny, the steal men are the organization's foot soldiers, often desperate people who are willing to expose themselves to great risks for a few hundred dollars and, unlike their bosses, are unable to afford top-notch lawyers.    Mr. Parker's criminal record, dating to 1970, includes multiple convictions for grand larceny, possessing an illegal vehicle identification number and making a false report of a stolen vehicle","excerpt":"Mr. Norwood, with convictions for harassment and the unauthorized use of a vehicle, also spent five years in prison for first-degree manslaughter. THE M.O.: DAYLIGHT, PARKING LOTS, TRAIN STATIONS     Dressed in dungarees, driving junk-cars with stolen out-of-state license plates, the steal men favored spots in northeast Queens -- parking lots at the Fresh Meadows shopping mall, St. John's University and at Long Island Rail Road stations, say the detectives. They stole not at night, but during working hours.   From their surveillance investigators inferred that the two suspects worked like other professional car thieves. They usually broke in by smashing a small window. If an alarm blared, they popped open the hood, went around to the front and smashed the alarm, housed usually next to the engine. If a Club was used, they simply cut through the steering wheel. Finally, they started the car by breaking the steering column.   \\"It took them usually less than 20 seconds to start a car,\\" Detective Brenner said. \\"What made them good? Experience. Most car thieves are young, and not as reliable.\\"   Admired for his efficiency, Mr. Gralto, investigators pointed out, possessed another quality that led to his downfall: foolhardiness.   A simple, unostentatious man, Mr. Gralto eschewed the grand ambitions that drive many of his peers, Detective Vitucci said. Unlike a John Gotti who used car theft as a stepping stone into one of New York's five traditional crime families, Mr. Gralto apparently had no aspirations of joining the Bonanno family, of ever becoming a \\"made man.\\"   Instead, Mr. Gralto revealed a more pedestrian goal in phone calls: \\"I want to make a million a year.\\" That goal, investigators said, pushed him to grow reckless.   When an industry associate alerted him that his Oceanside yard was under surveillance, Mr. Gralto ignored the tip. When detectives, waiting in ambush a stone's throw from Mr. Gralto's home, phoned him on Feb. 15 at 6 A.M., to warn him that they were coming to arrest him, Mr. Gralto simply said, \\"Knock it off,\\" and hung up. When the police called back immediately, he still believed it was a joke. Spitting out an expletive, he slammed down the receiver. It was only when the police began breaking down his front door that the truth hit him, Detective Vitucci said.    Mr. Gralto tried to save the door by opening it. But it was too late.   By the time all 13 suspects were arrested last month, the ring had operated 10 months, from May 1994 to February 1995, the indictment charges. During a period of intense surveillance, from May 9 to Aug. 11, 1994, the ring chopped up and sold parts from 21 cars -- worth $244,000 on the used car market but almost $1 million in parts, the District Attorney's office charged.    In a related indictment, Mr. Bosshart, the alleged Gambino loyalist, and his two associates from Maspeth were also charged last month with possessing and dismantling stolen vehicles, and with assaulting Mr. Gralto. Murray Richman, Mr. Bosshart's lawyer, said his client denies all the charges against him. THE TOP CARS AT HOME AND ON THIRD WORLD ROADS     Because of the immense profits from cannibalizing cars, the police estimate that more than half of all cars stolen in the city are taken for their parts, said Lieut. Robert Martin of the Auto Crime Squad.   Not surprisingly, the cars most frequently stolen are made by General Motors -- because of the greater demand for used G.M. parts.   By contrast, Lieutenant Martin attributed the theft of three cars in the top 10 list of most stolen cars -- 1994 Toyotas, Hondas and Nissans -- to the growing number of stolen cars exported to Third World nations, where there are few or no dealerships that sell new cars and where vehicle registration is often nonexistent.    The Japanese makers' reputation for durability make them popular in underdeveloped nations with unreliable roads, Lieutenant Martin said. This market is controlled by recently established rings, based among the new immigrant groups, specialize in illegal exports. They steal new cars and resell them, for double or triple their original worth.   In the end, organized crime rings account for almost nine out of 10 car thefts in the City, Lieutenant Martin said.   Faced with the disquieting statistic that more than nine cars a day were reported stolen in the 107th Precinct last year, Linda Leuzzi thinks her Jeep Cherokee could be next. She and her husband, Vincent, live in Jamaica Estates, on a block where brazen thieves have been known to career down the street, searching for cars in broad daylight -- even on Mother's Day.    Three times in the last three years, inside their second-floor bedroom, which faces the driveway, the couple were awakened in the predawn hours by breaking glass. Each time, they chased away the thieves in time.   \\"Now, if we hear a noise outside, we jump out of bed and go to the window,\\" she said. \\"We have the window open, even in the middle of winter. We want fresh air, but it's also because we want to know what's happening out there.\\" The Indicted: A Flow Chart\\"    Though it is on the decline, auto theft remains a scourge in many neighborhoods. As cars have become more sophisticated, so has car theft. Law enforcement officials in Queens and Nassau County say a recent indictment is a key step in efforts to combat the crime and illustrates the power of market forces for blackmarket auto parts. Their case: Vincent Asaro, a reputed captain in the Bonanno crime family, was at the top, receiving $500 per week in tribute from the man they say operated the ring, Guy Gralto. They say Mr. Gralto connected with buyers and helped hire car cutters and thieves. All those charged have pleaded not guilty. You and the 'Steal Men': Get Protection and Say a Prayer     IN a densely populated city where few residents own private garages, and where monthly indoor parking fees can cost as much as a studio's rent, New Yorkers must leave their cars to the gods of the streets. Experts say that in New York -- especially in New York -- nothing will stop a thief. But there are devices that will make stealing your car more difficult, and maybe persuade the thief to move on to your neighbor's car. Here's a look at the most popular. IGNITION CUT-OFF SYSTEM    HOW IT WORKS: If the proper encoded ignition key is not used, or if an attempt is made to start the car without a key, electronic sensors built into the ignition lock automatically cut off the electric power. Usually, the system also activates an alarm. Some sought-after cars, like the Corvette and Lexus LS400, come already equipped with the system. But it can be installed in any car for a few hundred dollars.    THE BOTTOM LINE: The best, experts say. \\"We've seen this to be effective even in very high-profile vehicles, like the Camaro or Corvette,\\" says Kim Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the Highway Loss Data Institute. \\"Compared to previous models that did not have this system, the thefts have come down, and have stayed down. Now the theft of Corvettes is only twice above average, whereas in the past it used to be 10 times the average.\\"    HOW THIEVES GET AROUND IT: Tow the car away. ALARM    HOW IT WORKS: Sirens, flashing lights, or robotic voice warns thieves to \\"stand back.\\"    THE BOTTOM LINE: \\"They don't do much good,\\" Mr. Hazelbaker says. \\"It's a harsh statement. But we simply don't find the difference in the theft records of cars that have these alarms and those that don't.\\" Especially in New York, people tune them out.    HOW THIEVES GET AROUND IT: One thief breaks into the car and immediately releases the lever of the hood. An accomplice pops open the hood and smashes the alarm, which is usually installed near the engine. Frank Vasquez, an officer with the city police's crime prevention division, recommends adding a lock to the hood latch. LOJACK    HOW IT WORKS: A radio transceiver is hidden somewhere in the car. When the car is stolen, the police enter the vehicle identification code into a computer system, and a broadcast system emits radio signals to turn on the transceiver in the car. Each precinct has at least one patrol car equipped with a tracking computer, says Officer Jim Muller of the crime prevention division.    THE BOTTOM LINE: The recovery rate in several states for stolen cars with Lojack is 95 percent, according to the manufacturers. But the unit, which costs $595 or less, is unproven in New York City, where here it has just been introduced and where there are special problems.    HOW THIEVES GET AROUND IT: The owner must report the theft to the police immediately. If the owner dallies, especially in New York, the car could be in a chop-shop by the time the owner makes the call. STEERING-WHEEL IMMOBILIZERS    HOW IT WORKS: The most famous is the Club, a device that is locked to the steering wheel and limits turning.    THE BOTTOM LINE: Many auto-security experts regard these devices, used by themselves, as minor deterrents. HOW THIEVES GET AROUND IT By spraying Freon, a refrigerant, on the immobilizer's lock, thieves can easily smash it. Most don't even bother doing that. They simply cut through the steering wheel, which (to prevent injuries during accidents) is usually made of an aluminum wire covered with foam and vinyl. COMBAT AUTO THEFT    HOW IT WORKS: Under a police program, car owners stick a notice on their windshields, allowing the police to stop their cars between 1 A.M. and 5 A.M.    THE BOTTOM LINE: It deters car thieves who don't want to needlessly increase their chances of being stopped. For no cost, drivers who register cars at the local precinct can get between 5 and 15 percent discounts on insurance premiums, Officer Vasquez said.    HOW THE THIEVES GET AROUND IT: Once the car is stolen, the chances of recovery are no different from cars not registered in this program. Since the program's inception in the mid-1980s, 126,000 cars were registered, said Barbara Keimes, an officer in Crime Prevention. Of that total, 1,000 cars were stolen. But only 45 cars were recovered, and 20 thieves were arrested.

His retirement, a year in the planning, has generated a library, a scholarship fund, a sculpture, a tree, a chair, a book, a biographical video, even an ode -- all in his honor.    Mr. Perrine's leaving the Foote school was as thoughtfully planned as Benno C. Schmidt's leaving Yale University was abrupt. While Mr. Schmidt's departure made headlines, Mr. Perrine's has been less visible yet of great significance to the same community. The Yale president and the Foote headmaster are more closely related than one might imagine, for many Foote parents teach at Yale and they care deeply about the private day school founded 75 years ago by Martha Babcock Foote, a Yale faculty wife and parent as well as a graduate of Bryn Mawr.    Foote has been home to many connected to Yale, both as students and as parents. The children of former Yale presidents A. Bartlett Giamatti, Kingman Brewster and A. Whitney Griswold all attended Foote. Guido Calabresi, the dean of the Yale Law School, and his wife, Anne, went to Foote, as did their three children. And the son of Yale's new provost, Judith Rodin, is now enrolled, as are many of the children of Yale's faculty.    Popular with students, Mr. Perrine knows the name of every child in the school. They approach him openly, unafraid. In part, they respond to his modesty, his optimism, his sense of humor, his willingness to chat with them. He still teaches the seventh grade and views himself as an old-fashioned history teacher. He said he did not think students were hurt by memorizing certain things: the Gettysburg Address, multiplication tables, state capitals and the names of the Presidents.   At his final school assembly, the students presented him with a wooden chair, which they had all signed. They asked him to sit him in it, and then each grade recited his favorites, including \\"The Swing\\" by Robert Louis Stevenson and a section of the Declaration of Independence. They ended with a hymn with many chords, just the kind Mr. Perrine likes to play on the piano.    Given this adoring throng, why is he retiring at the age of 58? It is not for another job. Rather, he said he believed it was time for him to try something new, and for the school to have fresh leadership. The new headmaster is Jean Lamont, formerly of the Allen-Stevenson School in Manhattan. Mr. Perrine said that a good friend who had retired at 65 told him not to wait that long. \\"He said 'you've got another life in you; do something else.' I believe that. I think you're a long time dead. Life is short and you should try different things. So, I forced myself out.\\"   The Perrines will spend a year at their home in Peru, Vt., before deciding what's next. Even so, they leave a personal legacy to education -- their three adult children, Charlotte, Bill and Katherine, are all in teaching.    Looking back, Mr. Perrine says students are different today from when he arrived in New Haven from the Harvey School in Katonah, N. Y., where \\"we shook hands with the kids every morning and shook hands with them every night.\\" The year was 1967 and the Foote School was at half its current enrollment of 430 boys and girls.   \\"Kids today are much more sophisticated,\\" he continued. \\"They have a lot more stuff -- Nintendos and games and after-school activities. I tell their parents slow 'em down, be their parents, tell them no, don't rush their childhood, don't over-program them. Stay with them. Take the afternoon off, go fishing. Don't have so many baby sitters. Enjoy your children, enjoy your life.\\"    If anything, he confided, he has seen more change in parents than in children: \\"I get so mad at them, I want to spank the parents some days. They give those kids everything. The kids are crying for someone to set limits, they're not going to tell you that but they are dying for someone to structure them. Tell them what they're supposed to do. I tell the parents don't let these kids be making all their own decisions. Some parents are afraid to speak to them, to say stop it.\\"   Mr. Perrine, a product of the public schools of Cranbury, N. J., learned from the easy style of his acknowledged mentor at the Harvey School, Headmaster Leverett T. Smith, and sought to transplant the coziness of boarding school to Foote. But shortly after he arrived he was caught up in the educational turbulence of the 1960's. \\"We were radical about education in those days.\\" he recalled. \\"I got all stricken with the latest theories. The open classroom, the idea that kids can't learn sitting still. We had merged age groups. Then our board starting getting on my case because they didn't think the kids were learning.\\"    Mr. Perrine credited several people including Mr. Giamatti, who was secretary of the Foote board and teaching at Yale at the time, with helping him rethink his educational philosophy. \\"Rather than lecture me, he had me talk it through,\\" Mr. Perrine said. \\"And we started all over again. We developed a statement of purpose for the school, we got a committee together and we worked on Saturday mornings and slowly pulled it all back.\\"   Mr. Perrine said he now thinks a classical education is best. \\"We have Latin in grades seven to nine and French from grades four to nine, and we emphasize writing and the arts and sports.\\"    He said a major issue for Foote was how to keep a social and economic mixture in a good community school when tuition ranges from $8,350 to $9,250 a child each year.  Foote draws from 30 communities in addition to New Haven, has a 16 percent minority enrollment and a strong scholarship fund.    The paradox in the departures of Mr. Perrine from Foote and Mr. Schmidt from Yale is that Mr. Schmidt, who is to lead a new private school venture for Whittle Communications, has had no experience in a world that has been Mr. Perrine's life. The Whittle concept does not appeal to Mr. Perrine because, he said, it is predicated on computer and television learning, and as important as technology is to education, it cannot replace the teacher.   \\"Education is the spark between the kid and the teacher,\\" he said. \\"You've got to get inside a kid's heart. That's not what computers do.\\" 'Don't Have So Many Baby Sitters. Enjoy Your Children.'"},{"year":"1933","title":"W M Persons suggests convertible bonds as means of financing revival of heavy industries HAS FINANCE PLAN FOR CAPITAL GOODS","excerpt":"Mr. Persons Urges Convertible Bonds as Means to Revive Dormant Lines.
