Leo Gordon, Kay Kuter and Richard Karlan are sinister as his henchmen in the jug, and Walter Abel and Kenneth Tobey are crisp and hard-boiled as the prison warden and psychologist, respectively. Most impressive, however, is Perry Lopez as a youthful minion of de Corsia's mob who doesn't squeal on the boss to get out of prison until he discovers that the boss has no regard for him.The actors are all right, but the story, written and directed by Walter Doniger, is one of those briskly constructed fictions, in the middle of which is a great big hole. Here the warden and psychiatrist knock themselves out to get young Lopez to tell who killed a guard, yet they let him (their only likely informer) go roaming about the prison among the mob, without bothering to protect or even watch him!How illogical can you be in hatching a plot?Otherwise, this is a fair reiteration of the deceptiveness of the criminal code.

Residents said as many as 60 people had been in an apartment building that collapsed during the strike. A1    The United Nations Security Council issued a statement expressing ''extreme shock and distress'' at the killing of Lebanese civilians in the bombing in Qana after negotiations in which the United States was initially successful in blocking a call from Secretary General Kofi Annan for an immediate halt to the fighting. A10    President Jacques Chirac of France has moved to lead the diplomatic campaign to end the crisis in Lebanon. Just hours after Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice canceled her trip to Lebanon, Mr. Chirac ordered his foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, to head there immediately.  A12    Iraq Seeks Foreign Aid  Two high-ranking Iraqi government officials said their country was fighting international terrorists on its own soil on behalf of other countries and should be compensated with economic and military assistance. Their comments suggested an emerging strategy to portray Iraq as the global front line against terrorism and make a case for international aid. A6    Congo Election Proceeds  Millions of people streamed into Kinshasa, Congo, for polls in the first multiparty vote since shortly after independence. Sporadic violence continued up to the vote, but it went off without widespread complications, said officials of the United Nations, which organized and supervised the elections.  A3    Sri Lanka Faces Off With Rebels  The Sri Lankan Army, in its first ground troop advance since a February 2002 cease-fire, tried to take control of an irrigation canal that the government says has been blocked by the Tamil Tigers guerrillas. A4    NATIONAL A13-15    Employers Held Liable For Hiring Illegal Workers  The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has initiated a new nationwide strategy to clamp down on employers accused of hiring illegal immigrants. The campaign has sent payroll managers rushing to re-examine their workers' papers and rethink their workforce plans.   A1    Asylum Rulings Questioned  An examination of thousands of immigration cases has found wide disparities in the rate at which judges grant asylum to people seeking haven in the United States, according to a study released by a private research group.   A15    Charity Seeks to Market Drug  A small charity based in San Francisco is seeking approval from the Indian government for a drug to treat black fever, a disease that kills an estimated half-million people worldwide each year. If approval is granted as expected this fall, it will be the first time a charity has succeeded in ushering a drug to market.  A1    Out of Work and Not Looking  Millions of American men between the ages of 30 and 55 have dropped out of regular work. Many of the men say they could find work if they had to, but at lower pay and fewer benefits than they once earned, and they have decided they prefer the alternative. A1    The Conservative Legacy  While the conservative movement has long sought to transmit its intellectual heritage to its young, that mission shows signs of new urgency amid fears of ideological drift. Everywhere young conservatives turn there are conferences, seminars and reading lists that promote figures from the movement's formative years. A13    English for a Special Mission  Voice of America, the government-sponsored news organization that has been on the air since 1942, broadcasts in 44 different languages -- and Special English. Special English was developed nearly 50 years ago as a radio experiment to spread news and cultural information to people outside the United States whose knowledge of English is limited.  A15    NEW YORK/REGION B1-6    Courting Minority Voters As Primary Draws Near  With little more than a week left in the nation's most closely watched primary race, a wave of high-profile surrogates swept through Connecticut to campaign for Senator Joseph I. Lieberman and his antiwar challenger, Ned Lamont, as both turned their focus almost exclusively to winning minority votes.  B1    Memos From Protest Suit  The Bloomberg administration denied accusations of being guided by politics in banning protests during the 2004 Republican National Convention, but documents from a federal lawsuit suggest that officials were motivated by political concerns over how the protests would play out while the Republican delegates were in town and how the events could affect the mayor's re-election campaign the following year. B1    Girl's Death Ruled Homicide  The death of a 2-year-old Bronx girl who suffered head injuries, apparently at the hands of her mother's boyfriend, was ruled a homicide. A woman who provided day care to the child said she had reported bruises, abrasions and other signs of abuse to the city more than six weeks ago. B1    SPORTSMONDAY D1-8    Drug Tests Shake Sports World  The fallout from Justin Gatlin's admission of a positive drug test has rattled the track and field world, prompting the sport's international federation to say it would pursue a lifetime ban for Gatlin should a doping offense be upheld and turning a newly harsh spotlight on shortcomings of the system.

To that extent it may be regarded as an adult sequel to \\"The Road to Life,\\" which described the regeneration of the bezprizorni, the derelict children of the war.But the resemblance is entirely thematic, for \\"Prisoners\\" is less moving, less credible, less competently produced. Like so many of the recent Russian pictures, it has been indifferently photographed, carelessly lighted and chopped rather than edited.N. F. Pogodin, its author, lived for more than a year in a prison camp on the White Sea during the construction, by prison engineers and prison laborers, of the White Sea-Baltic ship canal. In dramatizing that engineering achievement, he has drawn a sympathetic picture of the GPU's handling of its prisoners, of its understanding attitude toward thieves, murderers and political enemies alike and of its success in converting them into sober, industrious and loyal workers for the State. Some of Pogodin's conversions are understandable and logical, but there are others which we must swallow whole and at some peril to our mental digestive processes.The reformation of the central player, the bandit Kostia, is virtually jammed down our throats. An impudent cut-throat who coerces the other prisoners in his barracks into a work-resistant policy, Kostia undergoes a complete change of heart when the GPU commandant places him in charge of a lumber division. It is heartening to watch his progress to chief shock-worker of the camp, but we could have stood a few words of explanation. The rehabilitation of two saboteur engineers and of Sonia, thief and murderess, are accounted for more satisfactorily.The picture ends on the usual note of ideological ecstasy with the redeemed prisoners standing happily on the deck of the first ship to steam through the canal.The players are unusually competent, with no less than four \\"honored artists of the Republic\\" in the cast. M. F. Astangov plays Kostia with a perfect blend of insolence and bewilderment. V. D. Yanukova is a tragic figure as the waspish Sonia. B. G. Dobronravof as the commandant, P. A. Olenef as the comic Sasha, B. P. Tamarin and G. M. Michurin as the engineers and A. I. Chabin as the GPU chief are admirable in their rôles. But \\"Prisoners\\" lacks the coherence and the technical polish a really first-rate picture should have.

The book is described in the publisher's catalogue as an iconoclastic look at the life of Jesus that includes network coverage of the Crucifixion and a visit by, naturally, Shirley MacLaine. Mr. Vidal demanded the secretive handling because \\"he knew it would be controversial and offensive to some people and he wanted it to be judged on its own merits, not by critics,\\" said Mitchell Ivers, the managing editor for Random House's adult trade division.   \\"He's a cantankerous sort, and his decisions are fairly strong,\\" Mr. Ivers said. \\"I did sort of say to him that it would be better to send galleys to get a buzz going, but he was very firm.\\"   Mr. Ivers said that Mr. Vidal, who is at his home in Ravello, Italy, thinks this book is similar to what is probably his most famous novel, \\"Myra Breckenridge,\\" both in size (slim, \\"Golgotha\\" at 240 pages) and \\"in its wild and crazy feeling.\\"   Mr. Vidal did allow one exception to the embargo. He asked that one copy be sent to The Advocate, the gay and lesbian magazine. The magazine will have a review in its Aug. 25 issue, which will be available on Aug. 11, a couple of weeks before the book is scheduled to be in bookstores.   Mark Thompson, the magazine's senior editor for the arts, said the review exclusive \\"came with no strings attached\\" and was the result of \\"a long history between the magazine and Vidal, whom we've interviewed and put on the cover several times over the years.\\"   Mr. Vidal is by no means hiding from the public. It's merely his book that he is temporarily sequestering. He is scheduled to be featured in an article in the September Vanity Fair and is soon to appear in the movie \\"Bob Roberts,\\" starring Tim Robbins. The Secret: Timing:    Summer has traditionally been a sleepy time for releasing books. The long-held publishing wisdom was that big summer books got their send-off in late spring and early summer and settled comfortably onto best-seller lists for the duration of summer vacations, and that the big fall books waited until people were back behind their desks so they could build up enough steam to keep them going until the Christmas selling season.   But more and more publishers have taken to jumping the fall gun by releasing books in midsummer, and the ones they tend to favor are by authors they hope are soon to be brand names.   This maneuver has already paid off twice for HarperCollins and Anne Rivers Siddons. Her novel \\"Colony\\" was released last month and this Sunday will be No. 6 on the New York Times best-seller list for hard-cover fiction in its third week on the list. The publishing house first tried releasing her books in this off-season last summer, with her novel \\"Outer Banks,\\" and that, too, made the list.   William M. Shinker, the publisher of HarperCollins's adult trade division, said he decided on this strategy after an earlier Siddons novel, \\"Kings Oak,\\" which came out in October 1990, did not become a best-seller, even though it followed her best-selling \\"Peachtree Road.\\"   \\"There's more of a vacuum in the market in the summer, and we try to take advantage of that,\\" Mr. Shinker said.   HarperCollins is hardly alone, and midsummer releases are fast becoming the industry's most open secret and imitated game plan. Charles Scribner's Sons has \\"carefully orchestrated\\" the release of Patricia Cornwell's \\"All That Remains\\" in August \\"to get a pop before Labor Day and a chance to get on the list,\\" said Barry Lippman, the president of Macmillan, which owns Scribner.    \\"We fully expect her to be a major hard-cover author, but the two-week window is crucial for getting a jump on the fall crush,\\" he said.   Here are some other in-between-seasons releases scheduled soon:   *\\"Contents Under Pressure\\" (Hyperion), a suspense novel about a Miami crime reporter, by Edna Buchanan, who has written nonfiction with the same theme.   *\\"Sailor Song\\" (Viking), a novel by Ken Kesey, the author of \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" who has not published fiction since his 1964 novel, \\"Sometimes a Great Notion.\\"   *\\"Book\\" (Random House), by Robert Gurdin, a sendup of life among the literati. Gold in Archives    The opening of secret Soviet archives has led to intense competition among publishers eager to get their hands on explosive, long-supressed documents.   Crown was the first American publishing house to announce that it had signed a contract with the Russian Intelligence Service. It is to get exclusive access to certain files of what used to be called the K.G.B.   Yale University Press has signed an agreement for exclusive rights to published collections of documents from newly opened Russian archives, in its case, from the former Central Party Archives. The archives, now under the control of the Russian Center for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Contemporary History, include the majority of Communist Party documents through 1953, the year Stalin died","excerpt":"private correspondence and diaries of leading figures in Soviet history and of ordinary citizens, and information on the history of the American Communist Party   The ordinarily understated Yale Press is crowing that its files are better than Crown's files and that its system for studying and publishing the documents is better than Crown's system.   \\"We have direct and unimpeded access to the material,\\" said Jonathan Brent, a senior editor at Yale University Press, who arranged the project. \\"Besides, K.G.B. files are very problematic from the standpoint of authenticity and reliability. Everybody knows that there is misinformation and false information in those files, and it's not always possible to distinguish these from the truth.\\"   What's more, Mr. Brent said, while Crown's exclusivity agreement will prevent other scholars and journalists from having access to the files until Crown publishes them, Yale will allow other researchers to use the information, although nobody else can publish the documents themselves.   \\"We want to enhance scholarship, not impede it,\\" Mr. Brent said.   Michelle Sidrane, the publisher of Crown, refused to be drawn into a \\"my files are better than your files\\" brawl. \\"I'd like to congratulate Yale University Press on the competitive challenge,\\" she said. \\"But we'll allow the scholars who review the files from the Communist Party and the scholars who review the K.G.B. files to determine whose are better.\\" Political Books    Books about politics, about politicians, by politicians, by politicians' wives continue to pour forth like so many policy statements.   Bantam has gone back to press with the paperback of \\"Raising PG Kids in an X-Rated Society,\\" by Tipper Gore, the wife of Senator Al Gore and the woman who would be Second Lady. Times Books will publish \\"Putting People First: What We Will Do to Change America,\\" a trade paperback that is more or less the official Clinton-Gore campaign manifesto on all major policy issues.   In addition, Simon & Schuster has just published \\"Marching in Place: The Status Quo Presidency of George Bush,\\" by Michael Duffy and Dan Goodgame, both Time magazine correspondents.

Among Administration and Congressional leaders, last spring and summer's enthusiasm for huge supply-side tax cuts to stimulate private saving, investment and economic growth has swung to anxious talk about the need for huge tax increases to narrow the prospective deficits. The Republicans in Congress are considering 24 possible tax increases that would add $84.4 billion to revenues in 1983 and 1984, if all were enacted.   David A. Stockman, Mr. Reagan's top supply-sider, now concedes that, in its hopes of balancing the budget by 1984, the Administration is ''seriously behind schedule for 100 little reasons and no one's particular fault.'' To be sure, he is willing, if pressed, to put the blame on Congress - for not giving the President all the budget cuts he wanted. Mr. Stockman apparently does not think the $750 billion in tax cuts that the President got out of Congress for the coming five years has anything to do with the gloomy budgetary outlook.

Big-boned Deborah Sampson, an indentured servant and self-taught schoolteacher, disguised herself in a retailored brown suit and, taking the $100 bounty, joined up as Robert Shurtleff of Uxbridge, Mass. She served in the 4th Massachusetts Regiment of Foot for 18 months in the waning days of the Revolution.   The 4th marched to West Point to help in the fighting near New York City, which, despite the victory at Yorktown, was still in British hands. Miss Sampson was slashed in the head with a saber in a skirmish with Tory loyalists near the Tappan Zee in Westchester.
