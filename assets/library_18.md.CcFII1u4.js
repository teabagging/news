While the crowd impatiently waited for the current jewel in NBC's comedy crown to appear, Michael Richards, who plays the lovable crackpot neighbor Kramer on \\"Seinfeld\\" (Wednesdays at 9 P.M.), came on stage to set up the microphone. As only Kramer could, he tripped, picked himself up, pulled out a too-short cord and generally fumbled about. The Chaplinesque routine took only a few minutes, but the reaction was enormous. As the audience stamped, clapped, bellowed and whistled, the 43-year-old performer was thinking, \\"My God, this is Carnegie Hall! What the hell am I doing \\n\\nhere\\n\\n?\\"\\n\\nThe humble, reflective and surprisingly soft-spoken Mr. Richards seems light years away from the hyperkinetic, cartoonlike Kramer. Kramer, after all, is the man who slides through Jerry's front door as if he had just stolen third base, or inexplicably goes into seizures upon hearing Mary Hart's voice on \\"Entertainment Tonight.\\" But the ability to tap into the physicality of his comic gift is something he has honed since childhood.

But Mr. Seinfeld's transition has been considerably more Pirandellian. He plays a character named Jerry Seinfeld who makes a living as a stand-up comic. Each week, the sitcom portions of the show are punctuated with excerpts from the character's solo club routines, which are used as commentaries on the plots. Will the real Jerry Seinfeld stand up?

It was a symbolic prize that meant little after the carnage that preceded it. The war will continue, because in the end, said one Chechen commander as he retreated to new ground from which to assault his enemy, \\"It was just a building.\\"    It was, of course, more than that, especially for the Kremlin. President Boris N. Yeltsin, desperately seeking a respite from his deadly misadventure, immediately declared victory. His aides were more honest, saying the war could drag on for years, as other Chechen-Russian conflicts have, from mountain redoubts surrounding Grozny.    Whatever its future course, the war has already badly shaken the leaders of Russia, particularly Mr. Yeltsin.    The financial, human and political costs will be hard to assess. By sending 40,000 soldiers to the seccessionist republic last month in what the Kremlin clearly though would be a bold, quick manuever, it has sacrificed many young lives, shown the army to be incomparably inept, set democratic allies in Russia against the leadership, strained ties with the West and dealt a punishing blow to economic reform.

Mr. Kotik began his career in Czechoslovakia, founded the S. E. M. in Buffalo, and has maintained a New York presence despite considerable financial challenges. What is to be admired in his efforts is an intractable, almost obsessive concentration on select styles and personalities.

The Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies in New York City mourns deeply the loss of a beloved and inspiring leader, Phyllis W. Meadow, in New York City on January 19, after a brief illness. She brought to her work an extraordinary ability to engage others in the psychoanalytic experience. She demonstrated her commitment to the field of psychoanalysis as a student, analyst, supervisor, teacher and researcher and advocate for analytic training. She fought for the recognition of psychoanalysis as a distinct discipline and for its establishment as an academic specialty. A most significant achievement, won with her colleagues' collaboration, was to secure accreditation to grant doctoral and master's level degrees in psychoanalysis at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis and its affiliates, becoming the first in the country to do so. She was also founder and editor of the journal Modern Psychoanalysis established in 1976. Her published works include Emotional Education: The Theory and Process of Educating Psychoanalysts","excerpt":"Selected Theoretical and Clinical Papers; she was co-author of Treatment of the Narcissistic Neuroses; her most recent book, The New Psychoanalysis, appeared in 2003. She was Chair of the Board of Trustees for the Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies and former President of the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis. She was also founder and former President of the Society of Modern Psychoanalysts. She served on the Board of Directors of the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis as Membership Director, and was a founder and past president of the National Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis. We will miss her contagious enthusiasm, her creative mind, and her boundless energy. Her singular gifts as a psychoanalyst were revealed in her profound attunement to our emotions, in her uncommon understanding of our psychic conflicts, and in her ability to say the words that never failed to reach our unconscious. A memorial will be held in New York City at a later date. Contributions in her memory may be made to the Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies in New York City and to the Boston Graduate School for Psychoanalysis in Brookline, MA.

I may dislike the tour pace - too long at one sight, too little at another, too much getting on and off the bus and too much time stalled in traffic or waiting at a stop for stragglers. But almost always I leave the tour with confidence that I have learned how to cope with the city: to find the best shops, restaurants and entertainment and to know what museums, parks or historic sights or interesting neighborhoods to revisit at leisure.

Never mind that the self-analysis often rings false. That, as the author makes abundantly clear, is her point.   Ms. Butterfield, who also appears in the play (and turns in its most credible performance), has a finely tuned ear for the language of self-deception. And the evening's principal pleasures come from her ability to create lively dialogue among people whose elaborate systems of defense and justification are set up to be exploded. \\"Know thyself\\" -- the inscription on the temple at Delphi, as one bombastic character announces -- becomes the play's shibboleth in a way that is both sardonic and earnestly sincere.

Major league baseball hopes so. Baseball yesterday handed its marketing reins to Gregory Murphy, a diplomat's son who played Little League in Libya and was most  recently president of Kraft Foods Bakery Companies. Murphy lacks sports experience, which did not scare off baseball. The erstwhile  national pastime has come to be viewed as a vastly undermarketed product that long ago ceded market share to other sports and entertainments. \\"We determined that the position required experience that went beyond traditional sports marketing,\\" said Bud Selig, the acting commissioner. Murphy, 47, insisted that the fundamentals of selling jars of coffee or bags of  frozen bagels can be transferred to baseball. \\"Get deeply involved and understand your consumer and your brand,\\" he said. \\"I think I'm prepared.\\" Murphy, who will report to Selig, becomes president of Major League Baseball Enterprises, a new division that embraces television, advertising, public relations, licensing, sponsorships and international development. \\"My biggest shock when I became chairman of the executive council in September 1992 was to find that baseball never had a central marketing operation,\\" Selig said. \\"This was a very necessary step.\\" The structure of the new division bears similarities to those in pro basketball, football and hockey, which have marketed themselves with more savvy than baseball. \\"The N.B.A.'s efforts the past decade have been extraordinary,\\" Selig  said. Donald M. Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said he has long hoped that baseball would adopt a national marketing strategy. \\"Without it, you don't give yourself a chance,\\" he said. A labor deal, which has long eluded negotiators, would be crucial to baseball's marketing, by assuring fans that work stoppages will not reoccur. But Fehr said, \\"It would help, but there are a lot of strengths baseball has and must figure out, make known and reinforce.\\" Murphy was reluctant to reveal his possible strategies to increase revenue, attendance, television ratings and franchise values, his four main goals. \\"I want to be sure I deeply understand the baseball brand and the consumer,\\" he  said. \\"I'm reluctant to say, 'These are my programs.' \\" But, he said, he understands that baseball is weakened. \\"Fans are angry,\\" he said. \\"I think disgusted. In many ways that's great because they really care. When you have such an intense feeling, there's a passion.\\" Baseball's popularity has suffered most among youth. Fewer kids are playing or tuning in on television. A new survey of 2,477 adolescents by the Brainwaves Group, a unit of the advertising agency D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, showed 63 percent chose baseball or softball as a favorite sport to play or to watch live  or on television. Basketball was named by 76 percent, football by 74 percent. Murphy was asked to compare marketing baseball now (on the eve of a possible suspension for the Reds' owner, Marge Schott) to marketing Kool-Aid for Kraft in 1978 after the mass suicides of Jonestown cultists who drank a fruit-flavored drink laced with cyanide. Murphy said that it was actually another beverage used in Jonestown. \\"It had little effect on Kool-Aid,\\" he said. He added: \\"Everyone feels passionately about baseball. Even Marge Schott. The core equity of Kool-Aid and the core equity of baseball are strong.\\"    BASEBALL","excerpt":"Selling Americans Their Own Pastime"},{"year":"1937","title":"Liquidation among the railroad bonds caused sharp declines in this section yesterday in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
